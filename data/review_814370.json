Imagine a cross between pokemon and castlevania, this game is probably it. Plus I like how the male character is totally a final fantasy red mage. But you can change that.\n\nPros-\n* The music was enjoyable, but not amazing. But I'm not here for the music.\n* The art was quite good. All the sprites are really good looking as are the monster portraits. The world is almost always enjoyable to look at, I tend to like the out door areas better than the dungeons, but even the worst area is at least fine.\n* Very stable. I never crashed once and I didn't see any bugs bigger than some short term visual glitching.\n* Depth. Each monster gets a nice Diablo 2 talent tree and can often be built in a couple different ways. There are a little over 100 monsters and each gets two palette swapped/shiny versions, each with different stats and abilities, making the roster feel much bigger than it looks. A light side monster built to be a healer looks and plays differently than a dark side damage dealer, even if they are the same species.\n* The combat is turned base and a little awkward sometimes, but I really do like it. Some people complain that it's too hard, but I really didn't find that to be the case. Actually I found it pretty easy, with a few exceptions. Monsters scale their level to yours the first time you enter a new area, so nothing ever out levels you and nothing should be too easy, unless you grind a bunch extra. Actually the boss was easy enough that I assumed there was another boss, until after the credits started rolling.\n* Monster Utility: Rather than get any of the mobility and exploration abilities you'd get in other games, you use your monsters. Vines? Burn it with fire or a slashing cut. Swim underwater with your fish monsters. Use tackle to break cracked walls. But some times it does go too far. I don't enjoy switching my deployed monster several times in one room; having one remove a vine, then another to fly me up to a ledge, then switch back to the first to remove another vine. You are absolutely have to going to look up how to get past stuff at least once or twice. Usually you have to use a particular monster power that you didn't know existed yet. Every single monster has at least one out of combat power.\n* They have several mechanics to quickly power level monsters lower than your highest level guy, so you can get a monster from egg to the same level as your main team really easily.\n\nCons-\n* I would have given this game a 99/100 until I hit max level at 42. You get you'r last ability at level 40, and have some wiggle room with your builds, so mechanically it's fine. But at the same time, I also had access to the highest tiers of weapons and best potions and foods. I discovered that 42 wax the max, just as I was entering the 2nd to last major zone. So for the last two zones there was no real progression for my monsters\nin any way; no levels, no better gear, no better foods or potions. Feels incredibly unmotivating to not be able to get any stronger in a pokemon game. The monsters still scale with your level so they don't get much stronger either. So you just to your most efficient routine, with only rare variation, every battle for the next 100 battles; because efficient kills gives the best loot. \n* Monster Utility: Rather than get any of the mobility and exploration abilities you'd get in other games, you use your monsters.

The exploration/metroidvania aspect was pretty fun, too and was a neat way to explore the map. Building teams is probably the most fun part, however, I wish there was more incentive in a normal play through to do so. Once you find a build that works, you're pretty much set, aside from some tweaks as you progress. The post game battles are fun and the method for saving/loading teams is really great because it saves the gear too which helps to minimize the gear upgrades for making multiple teams. So, if you force yourself to try out new teams, that would enrich the experience. When you get to a certain story part ([spoiler]unlocking shifting[/spoiler]), it really ramps up the options for synergies.\n\nLeveling is handled pretty well, and eventually I just decided to focus on leveling my main team to max/near max and then just hatch new eggs - since the new monsters are close to your max level (usually 2-3 behind).\n\nI finished a full play through and while I overdid it a bit, I do look forward to coming back trying the alternate modes, such as bravery, which makes it so you get a random assortment of monsters, which will make a unique team building challenge.\n\nI didn't get to try any pvp - it seems there's an active discord for doing so, but you won't find matches without coordination.\n\nAlso the music in most cases is really great, some reminiscent of Castlevania, and really adds to the exploration feel. However, there were some volume inconsistencies and a few tracks that stuck out - not bad necessarily but with so many great tracks, the lesser ones were more noticeable to me. Those are just my nitpicks, your ears won't have a bad time.\n\nI'll admit, there were times I did get a bit overwhelmed with all the possibilities and resorted to looking things up to help (such as on the wiki, to see what other monsters shared certain skills, etc). But even then, part of that was the fun for me, figuring out the puzzle of team building. If you're into team building, synergies, exploration in a 2-D platformer, this fits a unique niche, going well above just a \"pokemon clone\".

The developers managed to make every single one of the 100+ monsters usable in this game, which is a balancing marvel. I 100% support the meme that this is pokemon done right. The difficulty wall that many players mention when reaching the later parts of the game is because that's when team synergy becomes a requirement to surpass the final challenges. If you're lazy, just go with the obvious goblin route and you should be fine.\n\nThe bad: Platforming feels somewhat half baked, so don't expect to derive gameplay pleasure from that. The metroidvania aspect is just... meh. Did you think that the HMs aspect in pok\u00e9mon was fun? Yeah, me neither. You quickly learn that you're forced to capture specific mons to get past some barriers and then you just  accept it and do it. You constantly need to switch mons because \"OK fine I'll get the stone breaking mon and then the darkness seeing mon\".

It's very fun but also very challenging. The team-building is the games biggest strength but also I feel it can be its biggest flaw. Every monster has its chance to shine, but you really need to deep dive into it's skills and see how it pairs well with other monsters. You can cruise through the early game with whatever you want, but eventually you really need to start focusing on having a team that does something well together. If you don't like that, you won't like the game. It requires a lot of going back and forth between skill trees, the wiki, and youtube videos to see what builds work well together. There is so much information and it is very overwhelming. If you like that kind of game, you will enjoy Monster Sanctuary. \n\nThe soundtrack is very nice, especially the music in the Sun Palace. The world is very colorful and is nice to look at. The puzzles are a bit bland and can be a bit repetitive. You will spend A LOT of time backtracking as you gather more abilities to open up areas you previously could not. The platforming is simple, and the world is relatively easy to navigate after you get a monster you can ride on. It is not a revolutionary or anything, but as someone who does not like metroidvania style games, I found myself enjoying it.\n\nOverall, I think its a good game but can be very off-putting if you don't want to spend the time trying to figure out what team comps work well. You can use pretty much any monster you would like, but it has to be put into a team that it can benefit and vice versa. \n\nTL;DR Requires a lot of big brain and/or use of online guides to efficiently move through the mid to late game.

It considers the player to be intelligent and expects an understanding of the game greater than just \"Have bigger numbers and be super effective\", but its systems are deep enough to merit gaining that understanding. Building a team is like building an adventuring party, you want monsters that fill different roles but that also work well together, and most monsters can fill different roles depending on how you build them. The satisfaction of succeeding at this, of having your team of monsters work together to overcome challenges, is enormous. The game also has Metroidvania exploration, with progression through the map done by unlocking new monsters and using their outside of battle abilities. It's handled well, and all of the areas look very good, some of the better pixel art you'll find. The monsters themselves look even better, with a variety of aesthetic styles that still fit together well and look like a coherent roster, and their animations really add to their character.

If you play through the content normally there\u2019s about 20 hours of game, and I did a bunch of the side content and none of the post game so I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s maybe 30-35 hours of total content in here. And an online mode I never touched!\n\nFirst and foremost the game is just a turn based RPG. The UI is mostly functional, stats are mostly easy to understand, and the fundamental gameplay loop of \u201cgo to new area, collect monsters that let you get to newer area, repeat\u2019 is fairly fun. It has a lot more in common with the old Final Fantasy/classical turn based RPG games and Aria of Sorrow than it does Pokemon though. Don\u2019t buy the game expecting Pokemon because it definitely isn\u2019t that.\n\nThat being said, on a lot of fronts the game is fairly mediocre. The exploration parts are carried extremely hard by the only interesting thing being finding new monsters to collect. The art is pretty underwhelming. The new environments are all extremely generic. Apart from maybe the monster designs there\u2019s nothing really inspired or creative about any of the assets. The plot is entirely forgettable. The absolute worst thing about the game is the music, which is ALWAYS playing, is far too short so you hear it loop constantly, and is very annoying. You can turn sound off for the entire game and your experience will be better off for it. \n\nWhen playing everything that isn\u2019t a battle I was pretty dissatisfied as well. There are maybe 3 or 4 tricky platforming sections but every other \u2018puzzle\u2019 in the game is laughably easy. Exploration is a joke, there\u2019s almost no reason to explore each area after you\u2019ve collected all the monsters in it because all you\u2019re doing is picking up items you can probably just buy with all the gold you aren\u2019t spending anyway. I never really had a use for 95% of the items I picked up. Battles take a significant amount of time, even when your max level dudes are fighting level 1 clowns, so later on you\u2019ll just be dodging fights entirely and that makes backtracking to old areas a real chore. It doesn\u2019t seem intentional but there are an awful lot of design choices that seem to pad out the playtime quite a bit. At least there\u2019s a fast travel item!\n\nWhere the game really shines is its battle system. In a lot of the later game fights there\u2019s so much random nonsense flying around on screen it can be kind of hard to discern what precisely is going on, but despite that the game does a good job with its UI elements to let you know which monsters are causing which problems to you, and it\u2019s up to you to decide what is and isn\u2019t a priority. The difficulty is pretty well tuned most of the time, I could regularly beat bosses and enemies about 2 levels higher than my own. Anything higher than that and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll get absolutely creamed though. Customizing your party members via the perk tree feels very nice, although in the endgame your dudes are going to have like 75% of the tree anyway so you\u2019re usually only making important choices in the midgame. Leveling up is done automatically for new monsters you acquire so there\u2019s not TOO much grinding, but I did do some at the end of the game because I wanted to see what those level 40 perks were (they\u2019re not important or interesting, I wouldn\u2019t bother). This part of the game functionally carries everything else- if the battles were a bit worse, I definitely would have dropped it after maybe 10 hours.\n\nOverall this feels almost like a dated game. It\u2019s hard to believe it came out in 2020 because it feels very reminiscent of an RPG I'd might have played on the GameBoy, and I don\u2019t mean that as a compliment. There definitely are better turn based RPGs you could be playing, but for its price point I think it\u2019s not a bad way to spend a weekend. \n", "timestamp_created": 1694608012, "timestamp_updated": 1694608012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146216527": {"recommendationid": "146216527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401314165", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3383, "last_played": 1694601694}, "language": "english", "review": "Metroidvania graphics + monster collection with good background story will make you hook up to this game.

You're basically exploring as a 2DMetroidvania-like since you can use the abilities on the environment of the monsters that you have captured. This makes the exploration aspect of the game quite rewarding as it makes you want to check the monster encyclopedia in order to see if it's worth capturing X and Y monsters because of their abilities.\nThe combat is a turn-based 3V3 where your monsters take part in and you're basically there to give them directions on what to do, and use some items to! The combat is incredibly fun because the focus this time around wasn't on capturing 1000 monsters and hoping for the one with the best stats. In turn, you get to several skill trees you can choose from to learn skills, reset at any time (with an item) and experiment with!\nThis makes for a super entertaining and engaging combat, since you'll be wanting to create synergies between your monsters.\n\nWhat I think that in terms of gameplay the game lacked at the end of the line was a deeper and larger world to explore! Don't get me wrong, the map is quite big. Although eventually you'll be going over the same places to unlock specific hidden paths, or doors.\n\n[b]# STORY # | 7.5 /10[/b]\n(SPOILER FREE)\n\nThis was a hard one to evaluate as IMHO the core story of the game is very solid. Every bit of story that is added seems to connect. There's always this sense of wanting to know more as you progress through the storyline!\nThe foundation, the roots of the story are there. Everything sounds plausible and you do get that sense of adventure as you follow your hero's path, however the only downside I found was that at the end I was still left with a wild sense and want to unravel many other mysteries that were \"out there\".\n\n[b]# VISUALS # | 9 /10[/b]\n\nGreat pixel art, detailed monsters splash art, fluid animations, many visually captivating environments and amazing SFXs during combat! What else can I say? The team did a phenomenal work in terms of finding the right aesthetics for their retro monster taming game. Think if Castlevania SOTN was mixed with DS gen Pokemon games. Neat!\n\n[b]# Sound # 7 /10[/b]\n\nWhile the visuals and story are something that will definitely stay on my mind for a while, I can't say the same about the music. Yes, the retro feel is there and, yes the boss battle music is good. What I feel was a bit of a disappointment was the lack of variation in music for battles fought on the different environments. I feel like this would add a lot to the game.\nMaybe this didn't happen because of the need to have a larger world in order to justify having a battle theme song for every biome.\n\n[b]# OVERALL SCORE # 8/10[/b]\n\nAll in all, Monster Sanctuary is a great 2D platformer that somehow manages to merge several game mechanisms and still make it a very enjoyable metroidvania monster taming experience!\nMy experience was quite positive with the game, although I feel like I should point out a few Pros and Cons for you to help you decide whether you buy the game, or not!\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n\n- Solid gameplay (exploration & battle-wise).\n- Freedom of creativity to adjust each monster's build according to your gameplay style.\n- Many small good QOLs such as: Battle speed adjuster; Difficulty switcher; Useful teleportation items;\n- Game is small and runs great on desktop, laptop or even on a Steam Deck.\n- Original take on the mechanisms resulting in a great Pokevania experience.\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n- [spoiler]Somehow the last boss fight's difficulty spikes HARD-CORE. Even if you do sidequests, I'm positive that you'll need to grind and find an incredibly good synergy on your team to win this fight! I switched to Casual difficulty to bypass unnecessary grind. [/spoiler]\n- The replay-ability factor is not that great unless you really want to try PvP, or grind on.\n- The evolutions feel a bit confusing and most times you find yourself using items on all monsters to try and evolve them, instead of actually trying to use something that makes sense.\n- The lore of the game is great which makes me believe that the game is way to short, or they'll be thinking of making Monster Sanctuary II.\n\n\n[b]Thanks for coming to my Vault talk!

Monster Sanctuary is like Pok\u00e9mon on steroids. The battle system in this game is extremely fun and complex, and I don't think you can ever create one single team that is guaranteed to beat every other team or opponent. There's no real equivalent in this game to spamming moves at the Elite Four; there are always trade-offs and you have to prioritize a particular battle style if you want to win at high levels. One of the best aspects is the joy of discovering new team synergies between different monsters.

If you want your team to succeed, you have to choose your monsters and equipment extremely carefully, so they can synergize in the most broken possible way, and expect your opponent to do the same.\nWhile not nearly as hard as PvP, the story is still fairly compelling at times, which is a welcome change in the genre. It's also set in a vast, beautiful world, and the soundtrack (a decent chunk of it at least) is really inspired.\n\nThe cool thing about this game is that every single monster can be competitively relevant. While there's no such thing as perfect balance, this game comes pretty close. With enough time and effort, you can build a strong team around literally any monster. In that sense, this is probably the game that most rewards creativity out of everything I've played in the last few years.\n\nHowever, the natural counterpart of it is that there is A LOT to process. Monster skillsets are highly customizable, and their skill trees can feel really impenetrable as a newer player. On top of that, choosing the right equipment takes a while to get used to. But understanding how an actually good team is built is definitely the hardest part, and is in my opinion much more complex than it is in competitive Pokemon, that I've also dabbled with a while ago.\n\nSo in a nutshell, if you are like me, obsessed with optimizing the blob out of everything you touch, you're in for a treat.

Very much a \"Pokemon meets Metroidvania\" game as others have mentioned.\n\nThe main thing that I appreciate, however, is the massive skill trees for every monster. Sure, over the course of the game you'll see the same skills repeated, but the fact that literally every single monster has potential for combo'ing with other monsters is pretty awesome. I found that I actively swapped my team around more often in this game than I ever did in Pokemon, simply for trying out new abilities and testing the strengths of my teams.\n\nThe combats can be a tad sluggish, but you could technically turn up the animation speeds to circumvent that. Also, while there is somewhat of an \"evolution\" system, it is limited and not necessarily the best option for each monster. Only a handful of monsters evolve, and their skills don't get better, they just get rearranged to new skill trees. It's essentially used for 100% the Monster Journal (aka Pokedex).\n\nThe plot is good, some predictable content but worth reading regardless. The graphics are typical Super-Nintendo-era style, which is what it is, no worries here. The music is pretty atmospheric, and there were a handful of tracks that I really appreciated (notably the Underworld and Mystical Workshop); however, each song felt appropriate for its context, and showed depth of quality by their creator.\n\nI put 27 hours into the main game, with a small dip into to the side content. I played the normal, \"basic\" mode, but there's a handful of options to spice the game up. Perhaps, after I'm caught up on my other games, I will come back to this one to try the New Game+, combined with one or two of those other modes. It essentially gives the game replay value, at least much higher than a typical JRPG would.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you're into creature collecting, world exploration, and an intricate yet simple combat system.", "timestamp_created": 1692586266, "timestamp_updated": 1692586266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144617394": {"recommendationid": "144617394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082957316", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6758, "last_played": 1691179996}, "language": "english", "review": "All my reviews so far are constructed with light-hearted one-liners, with no thought put behind them. Or a simple-minded quote, to echo the narrative of a game, or so a friend told me! However, this game deserves more than a whimsical remark.\n\nFirstly, I must confess, the reason I even tried this game, is by searching \"Pokemon like games on steam\", because I am too cheap to buy a Nintendo switch for 1 game, and found Monster Sanctuary as a suggestion. But I must say, this game is not even close to being a Pokemon clone. \nSure, toying with the idea of collecting different monsters, participating in duels with other trainers, and evolving your monsters in different ways, may draw parallels to the Pok\u00e9mon experience. Yet, this game main identity comes through its intricate portray of strategic team-building and synergistic mechanics that deviate from the traditional path of all Pokemon clones out there.\n\n2 teams of 3 monsters can be equipped, you can have unlimited monsters in your inventory.  However, you will most likely forget that the second team exists, until you reach Trainer vs Trainer fights or Online, where using all 6 of your monsters is, not always, but usually a necessity, especially later in the game. \nMost monsters share similar passives, attacks and supportive abilities, but kind of shuffled around, some being unique to certain monsters, while others are found rather commonly in the majority of the creatures you encounter. This is mainly, because the game tries to balance all beasts, and forces the player to focus on team composition...but this is where my problem with the game comes to fruition. \n\nAfter a couple of hours of trying different monsters, reading abilities and seeing what works with what. I created a fantastic team, quite early in the game I must say, which I used for the entirety of the play-through, without ever feeling compelled into changing it. I beat anything, everything and nothing stood in my way. Now, you must think \"Why would this be a problem, you clearly created the best team\" and I agree, that's pretty much what the game wants you to do... But this is where the problem comes in, the abilities and the monsters... most feel pointless. The fights revolve too much around applying status effects or having something that removes them.\nThe game tries too hard to balance the monsters. I am sure you can beat the game with anything you prefer, but what's the point of having such a vast array of monsters, when I don't ever feel like being pressured into changing my team. This is not Pokemon. I don't want to change my monster just because is cute, or it looks cool, it does not feel like it has that aspect to it (even though I did build some monsters because they looked cool). I want to try a new monster, because it could be stronger that what I already have, especially when some of them are called \"Champion monsters\"\n I wish the fight mechanics and abilities were a bit more vast and more interesting, and each monster was more unique. I like the fact that is mainly focused on team building, but at the same time, because of that, you disengage most of the monsters from ever being used.\n\nMy other problem is, the pointless hidden chests which require a certain unique ability, from a certain monster you will get way, way, way later in the game, or if you are lucky some of those monsters you can get through reward boxes. Now you got that monster, you open the secret area, and you get a chest which contains... absolutely nothing useful to you. Yes, you are not forced into retrieving said chests, but if I don't have to, why do they exist... It's just a bad anecdote for an achievement hunter.\n\nYet, despite these problems, Monster Sanctuary thrives on its merits. Its combat mechanics remain consistently engaging and not at all repetitive, despite the lack of overwhelming creativity when it comes to monster skill trees. I loved the exploration and the fact that you do need certain monsters to reach certain areas even though some of the loot might be ludicrous. But the most captivating part about the game was the story\n\nNot just a story, but a pretty intriguing one with mysterious aspects to it, which slowly builds up to an alluring ending, and it does not disappoint . Most characters do fall upon certain archetypes, but I never felt they were hollow or out of reason. It is the usual story of \"prodigy comes and save the day\", but it's still good nonetheless.\nI am not going to dive too much into this, so I do not spoil anything. But this was one of the most engaging part of the game and I urge you to pay attention to it, do not just skip every dialogue to go fight the next enemy\n\nDespite some vexing aspects and quite bland elements, the game left a great impression. The world is overall vast, it does not feel empty. Exploring new areas to see new monsters feels good. The story as I said is very pleasing, which is unlike this type of genre. The fighting is very satisfying. All monsters look cool and unique. \n\nIt also has a new game+ feature, or if you still have an itch to scratch with the game, you can start a new file with game-modes, which add new items and also a randomize feature. Overall a fantastic turn-based indie monster game, and because of that, I am excited to see the new game they are working on.\n\nPersonally this game is a 9/10, but I can see why people might dislike it.", "timestamp_created": 1692509702, "timestamp_updated": 1694851560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874013721942901611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144422155": {"recommendationid": "144422155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032923565", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 6050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6050, "last_played": 1692287232}, "language": "english", "review": "I never expected a game that showed up on a bunch of lists as a \"Pokemon clone\" to be this fantastic.  Take a side-scrolling platformer, add some RPG elements like parties, skill trees, and equipment into the mix, and you get a beautiful game that would be the love child of Metroidvanias and Pokemon.  You get the experience that is Monster Sanctuary.\n\nI picked up the game on sale, and I was jazzed to see so many folks say \"it's a great 35-40 hours!\"  I was looking for something short and sweet.  I didn't get that, but what I got was better.  I'm a completionist, so my final achievement popping at 100.7 hours was a simultaneous sigh of relief and tear of sadness.\n\nThe graphics aren't the best, but they look good.  I believe sprite art is timeless.  These sprites are beautiful, from the NPC and Keeper to all 111 unique monsters, with three variations (unshifted, light shifted and dark shifted).  Some of the variations are less attractive than others (unshifted Fungi versus dark shifted Fungi, for instance), but overall, the creatures look good.  The backgrounds are gorgeous, particularly in areas like the Mountain Path and Blue Caves, and this carried over into the Forgotten World DLC as well (which was about 20 hours of that 100 hour timeframe).  Over the course of the story, you'll explore areas as varied as the Sanctuary dungeon to the Underworld, from a beach to mountain peaks, and a range of environments in between.  Each area evokes its own feel and has its own color on the overall map.\n\nControls aren't terrible, but my DualShock 4 could be a little overly sensitive if I was trying to make a very precise jump.  I usually play with the default settings, as that simplifies my review, and if I give the game another go down the line, I'm planning to explore the options menu concerning some sort of sensitivity or dead zone adjustment.  I did not play the game with a keyboard and mouse, but that is an option.  From my experiences with the game, it seems to be a quite viable option for the majority of the game.  I'd have to do some testing when it comes to those precise jumps, though.\n\nI played about 70 hours of the game on mute, but the 30 or so I played through SteamLink on my brother-in-law's gigantic TV in our living room were awesome.  I enjoyed the sounds of tribal drumming as I explored the Horizon Beach and Forgotten World, and the soft, whimsical tunes of the Mountain Path made his mom turn her head from her desk.  (For reference, my husband's stepmom detests instrumental music.)\n\nThe story is the weakest point of the game, it's still a stronger story than \"be the very best like no one ever was.\"  Marduk was an interesting enemy, and seeing his final descent into madness made the build up worth it.  The backstory for Chymes was interesting and engaging, and seeing plot twists for a couple of other Alchemists lent impact to a story that could stand alone without those twists.  The game is worth playing for the story alone.\n\nMonster Sanctuary is solidly made.  I encountered absolutely no bugs that I am aware of, controls were well done, the art is amazing, and the music is good enough I'm considering a purchase of the soundtrack.  My only real complaint was length, but that is an expectation I set myself, by reading reviews from people who probably weren't after all of the achievements.  My son is excited to tear into it next, and I'm excited to help him.  111 unique monsters stand up quite well over nearly a thousand Pokemon.  I'd like to see another DLC in the future, but the developers have said that Forgotten World is their \"farewell love letter to the community.\"  I'm okay with that, especially since I still have NG+ and a couple of other game modes to explore.

All the creatures have unique, customizable skill trees, and can be equipped with items to boost their stats in a fashion similar to a typical JRPG. The game took me about 57 hours to get 100% of the achievements, including collecting all of the monsters and completing all of the optional challenge battles. A completion of just the critical path would probably take about 25 to 30 hours. I hadn't played a Pokemon game in a long time so I picked up this game to scratch that creature collecting itch, and I imagine many other people looking into this game will be looking into this game for the same reason. Because of that, I will compare MS at times to Pokemon for reference. \n\n[h1] Combat Overview [/h1]\nAfter a few introductory fights, the player will eventually get a party of 6 Monsters. Whenever the player encounters a enemy they will battle, there will be a pre-battle screen where the player will be able to view their party of 6 monsters versus the enemy monsters (typically 3), as well as each monster's resistances, vulnerabilities, and elemental type for the moves it can use. From this pre-battle screen, the player will select 3 of their 6 monsters to fight the enemy. Victory is often determined at this point by choosing strategically based off of type advantages/resistances. Once battle begins, the player has the freedom to choose the order their 3 monsters will attack in, as well as what abilities/attacks to use for each monster. Once the player's three monsters attack, the enemy does the same with their three monsters. Rinse and repeat until the battle is over. After winning a battle, the player will be given score and a star rating out of 5 (or 6 if you earn a bonus star for being exceptionally efficient) for how effective the player was in the combat. The higher the player's rating, the better quantity and quality of rewards the player gets.\n\nBattles come in 3 varieties:\nWild monster battles: 3 player monsters vs 3 wild enemy monsters.\nChampion monster battles: 3 player monsters vs 1 Champion (boss) monster, and sometimes 2 normal monsters.\nKeeper (read: trainer) battles: players will fight with their full party of 6 monsters against a Keeper's party of 6 monsters. Turns are still 3v3, but once a monster is knocked out, their spot is immediately filled with one of the other remaining benched monsters until one side defeats all 6 of the other's monsters.\n\n[b]The Combo System and What Makes Combat Unique? [/b]\nIn addition to taking advantage of elemental weaknesses and resistances in the rock/paper/scissors fashion that is seen in Pokemon games, MS has a combo system that is integral to use in order to master the game. Each action a monster takes will increase the party's \"combo\" counter up for the remainder of the 3-monster's turn. If a monster has an attack that hits all three enemy monsters 3 times each, that is a 9-hit combo. The higher the combo meter, the more damage all subsequent monsters will do on their turn. This means a wise strategy is to have your first 1-2 monsters build up the combo meter with multi-hitting buff/debuff/heal abilities to get the combo meter as high as possible, so your final monster in the turn can deal a devastating attack to the enemy team. In the early game you can get by just fine without understanding this mechanic. However, in the mid-late game, enemy monster teams will start taking full advantage of the combo system and will wipe your team if you aren't playing efficiently. The game incentives the player \n\n[h1] The Creatures, Collecting Them, & Exploring the World [/h1]\nThere are a bit over 100 creatures in this game, which is smaller roster compared to most Pokemon or other creature collecting games that I have played. However, what this game lacks in quantity, it makes up for with utility. Every creature in MS is unique and therefore useful in its own way. There is no concept of a monster being inherently \"inferior\" to another monster. Even the evolved versus unevolved forms of monsters each have their own niche. When a monster is evolved, it usually changes its role in some way (such as going from a magic-type attacker to a physical-type attacker) instead of simply just being a \"better version\" of the unevolved form. In this way, you can have a party with the evolved and unevolved versions of a monster and be effective as they both have their own unique roles to play. \n\nIn addition to their battle skills, each creature will have an \"exploration\" ability that can be used in the overworld in order to explore and traverse the world in order to access new areas.\n\n[b] The Creatures, Leveling Up, and their Abilities [/b]\nEach creature has its own unique set of skill trees to progress through. Every level up will provide a new skill point to obtain a new ability or upgrade an existing one. A monster's level DOES NOT affect its stats, such as its HP, attack, defense, etc. - only how many skill points it has. It is up to the player to decide if they want to use the skill point to increase the base stats or not. Each monster typically has 3-4 individual skill trees to choose from, but you are free to mix and match skill points throughout all of them. The game encourages you to experiment with your options as items to reset spent skill points are plentiful and can be purchased cheaply from the shop. Skills range from active skills (usually consisting of an attack, buff, debuff, shield, or heal) to passive skills. All monsters in the players 6-player party will gain equal experience and will all essentially level up at the same time. This way the player is free to swap in and out their \"back row\" monsters without fear of them being underleveled due to not experiencing combat.\n\n[b] Collecting Creatures [/b]\nInstead of using an item like a Pokeball to capture monsters, new monster are primarily gained in the form of a monster egg at the end of a battle with the monster of that type. The higher star-rating/score the player gets in battle, the higher chance the egg will drop. All wild monsters can be seen in the overworld, so this makes it very easy to find the specific monster you are looking for instead of wandering around aimlessly hoping to randomly find the missing monster your are looking for to complete your collection. Some monsters can only be gained from completing certain quests, getting a 5-star rating from beating Champion monsters, and some can only be gained from evolving a monster.\n\nWhen hatching a monster from its egg, it will automatically be about 2 levels behind your main party's average level. So if your party consists of six level 20 monsters, new monster eggs will hatch as a level 18 monster. There is a common item in the game that can be found and bought that will increase a monster's level by 1 (up to a maximum of 1 level lower than your highest level monster). This way you can get a new monster, use one of those items, and have a monster that you can safely swap into your main party to try out if you are struggling with a hard fight. This makes it very convenient to experiment with different combinations of monsters without having to waste tons of times grinding levels on bringing a low level monster to the same level as your \"main party.\"\n\nAnother great feature with creature collecting in this game compared to Pokemon, is that your have access to every single monster you have hatched at any given time without having to go to a specific storage location to access \"stored\" monsters. This means you can swap monsters in and out of your party at any time without having to \"run back to town\" if you happen to run into a boss whose typing is your party's Achilles' Heel. This is a fantastic quality of life feature that is a huge time saver.", "timestamp_created": 1691812947, "timestamp_updated": 1691812947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536683619022369385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143951066": {"recommendationid": "143951066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096121630", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2690, "last_played": 1692341010}, "language": "english", "review": "Blob gang represent", "timestamp_created": 1691808878, "timestamp_updated": 1691808878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499024957418441772", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143935947": {"recommendationid": "143935947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068521118", "num_games_owned": 881, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 2920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2896, "last_played": 1693605480}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a expecting no more than a Pok\u00e9mon-like monster battler with 2D metroidvania platforming - an interesting and fun mix for anyone fond of these two genres.

Algun puzzle de alguna zona est\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajado, pero el 80% son muy simples\n[*] Con la misma me he encontrado con un puzzle que otro con muy poca inspiraci\u00f3n, de estos que te hacen dar muchas vueltas por el mapa y que la \u00fanica forma de describirlos es tedioso\n[*] El combate es t\u00e1ctico, correcto, pero las batallas terminan siendo una carrera por meter buffs/debuffs para ganar, lo cu\u00e1l hace que sea muy repetitivo conforme m\u00e1s avances, a parte de confuso cuando empiezan a activarse muchos efectos\n[*] Si te gusta jugar para montarte un equipo de monstruos cuyos dise\u00f1os te gustan, va a ser una experiencia mala, porque ciertos enemigos hacia el final del juego requieren de ciertas estrategias con monstruos espec\u00edficos, lo que le quita la gracia a eso de capturar monstruos, aunque sea f\u00e1cil ponerlos a nivel de tus monstruos m\u00e1s fuertes\n[*] La gracia de evolucionar monstruos en este tipo de juegos es ver una versi\u00f3n del monstruo m\u00e1s fuerte, pero aqu\u00ed hacerlo cambia todo el \u00e1rbol de habilidades del monstruo y seguramente te fastidie la estrategia\n[/list]\n\nSi eres muy fan de Pok\u00e9mon y te gusta montar estrategias con distintos monstruos, lo vas a disfrutar.

For example, at one point there is a revelation about a family member of an NPC you meet at the beginning of the game - introducing some information about them beforehand in the game would've given some impact to the revelation and created character development for the NPC, which was otherwise very lacking.\n- what I said before about the variety of combat and the level of difficulty was true... until I stumbled upon an OP combination that made every fight trivial from thereon out (Targoat/Caraglow/Brutus) and (more importantly) made every fight play out in the same way. When I tried using other teams (which I was already disinsentivised to do), I found that combat was much harder and I felt forced to switch back to the OP team, which made for pretty boring gameplay in the late game. In general it felt bad to only use 3/6 monsters out of the 111 the game offers.\n\nI enjoyed the game overall and I would definitely recommend it to friends interested in the genre so I'm still giving a positive review, but I feel that the issues I've highlighted prevent this game from truly shining.", "timestamp_created": 1691415952, "timestamp_updated": 1691415952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569144785404205322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143563578": {"recommendationid": "143563578", "author": {"steamid": "76561199017053273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1698255336}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1691375440, "timestamp_updated": 1691375440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475217729806900024", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143511647": {"recommendationid": "143511647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157722947", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1752, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1663541377}, "language": "english", "review": "pokemon without lopunny is like an angel without her wings", "timestamp_created": 1691316261, "timestamp_updated": 1691316261, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.315939962863922119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143498403": {"recommendationid": "143498403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084576147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2579, "last_played": 1691295975}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si eres un try hard del Pokemon te va a gustar este juego", "timestamp_created": 1691296101, "timestamp_updated": 1691296101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143488810": {"recommendationid": "143488810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285357937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6035, "last_played": 1695400884}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, Lots of Free updates.", "timestamp_created": 1691281464, "timestamp_updated": 1691281464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475217729806900024", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143409592": {"recommendationid": "143409592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054551850", "num_games_owned": 700, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1691267574}, "language": "english", "review": "fun!", "timestamp_created": 1691179048, "timestamp_updated": 1691179048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475217729806900024", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143402863": {"recommendationid": "143402863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067825800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 11287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11287, "last_played": 1686021805}, "language": "english", "review": "I only wish items would keep their upgrade through new game plus.

I mostly played and beat the game over one weekend I didn't have internet, so it didn't sync playtime. \n\nA complex, party-based RPG with a pokemon-like coat of paint and metroidvania world gameplay. Each 'monster' has an extensive skill tree and the name of the game is building synergies with your team. Every action affects your whole team in some way, leading to lots of emergent complexity and synergy. Instead of 1v1 being the standard, battles are 3v3 opening much more possibility for teamplay. But, skill tree resets are very easy to get your hands on, so you don't need to be afraid of investing a dud skill point or going down the wrong path - you can reset and try different things as the monsters unlock new skills, and you rotate in new picks for your team. You can re-skill your entire team after a boss battle to take advantage of a different approach. For me, the real fun in the game comes from optimizing my team so I can beat most battles in 2-3 turns. When wild encounters start lasting more then 3 turns, I know my team isn't keeping up and I need to optimize their skills and equipment. On the other hand, Trainer and Boss battles provide a longer form battle where synergies really shine. Spending 3 turns of set-up and defense to allow your Sweeper to spend the next turn bulldozing an entire team is incredibly satisfying, or setting up a stall + dots team and watching the enemy slowly dots themselves to death.  \n\nThe great thing is that wild, trainer, and boss battles are all so emergent different. Wild battles, you get the most rewards for beating them fast so you want some good all-out attack to do these quickly.  Bosses are typically incredibly strong but fairly narrow in scope, so you need to build a counter that really focuses on their strengths and weakness in particular.  20% damage reduction against all kinds of damage won't do you much help on a boss buffed itself to 500% fire damage, so you really need to prepare for exactly what you're fighting, after a few failed attacks to scout out their moveset and weaknesses.  Keeper duels are different again, with a 6v6 style that are highly varied where the Keepers have all the same mechanics and options that you do. All these kinds of battles require different approaches so you never get stuck in a routine and are constantly on your toes, thinking about how you can leverage the skills and abilities to you have to build a plan against the enemy infront of you. \n\nIt is difficult to stress just how important team synergy is in this game. You can't just build each monster individually to fit a predefined role, their role will change fluidly depending on the match-up of allies and enemies. My tank in one battle is my DPS in another is my support in another. All monsters can, and should, do all depending on the situation.

Here\u2019s what I have to say about the negative reviews.\n\n- A lot of the negative reviews talk about how it\u2019s too hard to defeat certain bosses/teams and how you need to switch teams constantly each time. I think people say this because they never had a good team with good synergy. You need different monsters in your team that fill different roles. I 5 starred and even 6 starred certain bosses without having to switch my team a single time.\n\n- Negative reviews talk about how the game is based around debuffs/buffs. While this is totally true, I don\u2019t think it makes the game bad. Instead of the game only being based around healing and doing dmg like other turn based games(Pok\u00e9mon), the developers put status effects on par with healing n doing damage, so status effects would actually be a decent threat. There\u2019s also decent counters to buffs/debuffs. Certain items get rid of buffs/debuffs, certain characters have a chance of a removing a debuff/buff, and certain moves can remove buffs/debuffs. So PvP wise it\u2019s not too OP as long as your team has someone that can do the things above. \n\n- I saw certain reviews talking about how it\u2019s too hard to get shift stones (They make the monsters stronger in a nutshell) This is false. I currently have 17 shift stones with two full teams fully shifted. I guess it might not be a lot if you need to switch teams every boss fight? Goes back to the first point. \n\n- Plot is meh, but I don\u2019t play games for plot so I don\u2019t care about that. The puzzles are decent, just know that you should immediately start marking anything that you can\u2019t get past as you will need it later. \n\nIt has decent endgame content and a lot of different team synergies that you can try. One of the main reason I wanted this game was because of the monster skill tree, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.

I'd recommend you get it on sale.\n\nUnfortunately, this game attempts to be many things, but only reaches a mediocre level at all of them. I think it would be lovely as a game for kids if it had a more balanced battle system (edit: I JUST found out this game had three difficulty levels. Still, the rest of the review stands.)\n\nAs a platformer/metriodvania(??) the level building is samey, not very interesting visually, and REPETITIVE. Most areas have very similar patterns of platforms, where the \"puzzle rooms\" are located, and even the secret chests. I actually liked the pixel artstyle (and frankly if you saw the trailers you'd already know what to expect in that department) but I disliked the lack of variety. The only zone I liked was the [spoiler]forgotten world, since it had way more creative graphics and the mushrooms as platforms were a cute idea compared to the bland repetitiveness of the other areas.[/spoiler] The puzzles were a pain. Not even that hard, or thought provoking, just annoying obstacles to overcome. I think they had an interesting idea designing them but never reached a satisfactory outcome.\n\nI'll add in that the plot and dialogues are terribly simple. Everyone does hamfisted exposition at you, at all times. There is no subtlety to be found. Everything is spoonfed at you in the most direct way possible. I would find that great for a game for kids. But I think kids would get frustrated at this game, so it's no use.\n\nAs a...  monster collecting, pokemon-like game, it has certain issues that make playing tedious. The game requires you to create teams that work together. Every monster can play different roles depending on which skills you choose. And you also have to take into consideration which weapon and three accessories you're gonna give them in order to make them useful. You can't preview weapons or accessories if another monster is already utilizing them, which is a pain. Those are already some things that force you to think very hard about all the variables and stats so that you can prevent the monster from being complete garbage. \n\nBecause that is another issue, monsters tend to either 1. Die a lot 2. Fail at killing enemies via direct damage 3. Both. The most reliable way to deal damage in this game, is through debuffs. Debuff based teams are VERY easy to create, monsters with debuff skills are more likely to synergize with other monsters (compared to more direct damage builds) and just make everything easier. Which is its own issue. Once I found out debuffing completely blew everything else out of the park, I began using debuff teams and not stepping out of that comfort zone. When team creation requires A LOT of thought, time, and careful consideration (monsters + skills + accessories + weapon + synergies...) you just stop enjoying it and start looking for the easiest method. Which is debuff spamming.\n\nAll in all I think this is a nice game, again, I would leave a mixed review if I could.

Of course, there's no prize for being the tallest midget, or having delusional pricing.\n\nThis is a hybrid of routine, somewhat floaty platformer and a pokemon ripoff.  A lot of work went into this console game without anyone asking what the point is, or if it's a good idea.  It wasn't a good idea, although Gen Y's seem to like it.  Gameplay consists of platforming around the place in a metroidvania style environment, and doing pokemon style JRPG-esque battles... it's deeper than most platformers, like, going up to your ankles instead of just the soles of your feet, I suppose. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nA choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel \"art\" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.\n\nWhile there are options to change the resolution for the game, all this does is scale up the simplistic 2D art assets used to make the game, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the lacklustre 2D visuals.\n\nPC gamers will be insulted by the insistence from the developer that a console peasant children's toy controller should be used, despite this being on PC.  Developers should try to be aware which platform they're developing for, and must never, under any circumstances dictate to gamers how their games are to be best experienced.\n\nBecause this is designed for consoles, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the inferior console gaming appliances that the game was designed for.  These are unfortunate compromises and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was a second thought for the console-centric developers.  The game is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for consoles forces upon a game.  Once more, console peasants have made gaming worse for everyone.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nMonster Sanctuary has the completely ridiculous AAA price of $30 USD (for a pixelcrap console game!!!), for which you could easily get any number of recent AAA games.  Games made by developers who know how to do 3D graphics.\n\nThis is also competing with over 9,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.  Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.\n\nIf you want a game where you get to tame animals and go into battle with them that looks like a PC game, try Ark: Survival Evolved.  It's a million times better than this and costs less than half the price.

I wouldn't have thought to cram metroidvania and monster rpg in the same game, but it's absolutely brilliant. The lore is really fun and well-crafted, the game controls super well in the platforming, the graphics are just adorable, and the battle system is just a gem of a thing.\n\n I can't overstate how much I'm loving the battles- It's a very unique system that's hard to explain but easy to understand by picking up.\n\nFor anyone on the fence, I'll try to give as good an explanation as possible:\nYou get 3 monsters on each side of the battle, and order of operations is really the name of the game, since you can use any of your monsters in any order on your turn. The ultimate goal is to rack up combo points by doing similar actions- attack, debuff, heal, etc- that raises your damage gauge. So, doing two buff actions, then an attack will lead to a much stronger attack than buff-attack-buff. Each option even has a number of times it hits, so you have to weigh going for the bigger number or doing a weaker attack with more hits to rank up that combo meter and then go for a finisher. The buff/debuff system is very robust, as well. All this means that, even though there is an elemental system you will need to engage with, it isn't a mere rock-paper-scissors affair. You can beat monsters with a monster that is technically weak to its element, but has other skills that compensate. \n\nI will warn you, though- Monster Sanctuary [i]is[/i] a monster collector, but it [i]is not[/i] Pokemon. This game is its own beast, and has its own feel/balance. I actually got my ass kicked by the lil nerd guy the first time I faced off with him!

So either you have specific boss-only monsters that are permanently benched while on overworld, or you build some weird mix-builds which makes the overworld monsters needlessly hard. \n\nExploration is nice and the metroidvania effect is wonderfully settled in but the platforming is made by platforming experts (sometimes we need pixelperfect jumps and hover application for those chests), and the switch puzzles are merciless and not fun. The minimap needs some more QoL like the ability to place markers. It's hard to keep track if a maptile is fully explored or waiting for a specific monster's exploration ability. \n\nLastly, if your monster is not part of the 6-unit team, they do not earn exp. But only 3 of them are constantly fighting while the other 3 are benched, that's why it's uncommon to really care for equipment for inactive monsters outside of squad battles (6v6, very rare occurence). It becomes apparent that from the vast roster of available monsters, you never actually have a need to switch and just try them out. They need to be skill levelled and they also require equipment, and if you split your exp on too many units, you will be forced to grind to make up for it. Remember specific pokemon from the first generations, the one that you only carry around because they learned HMs? Monster Sanctuary embraced this mindset.\n\nIn the end, this game feels nice to play and there is always a small excitement of getting new eggs, checking their skill trees and also their exploration skill. Although transparency in regard to monster roster is not well thought out, this game is definitely worth it if you ever see it on discount.", "timestamp_created": 1689290717, "timestamp_updated": 1689290717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524782240390777588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141916041": {"recommendationid": "141916041", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994240027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 3338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2266, "last_played": 1689617381}, "language": "english", "review": "The comparison must be made... and the others are right.

They all also have 3 equipment slots. This alone turns baby's first rpg into something that requires contemplation. And if you don't come up with a proper group you aren't going to have a good time.

There are too many secret walls suggesting I change my monster constantly and hit all the walls, often with no real visual hint that I can see. You can't see all the buffs and debuffs without pressing a toggle button and then backing out afterwards. Battles can feel a bit samey because the way teams work together, you're going to using the same sequence of skills most of the time unless an emergency comes up.

There are navigation puzzles in this game as well, and some of the later ones can get tricky. The core gameplay loop is to catch monsters and use their powers to reach new areas so you can find more monsters. It is incredibly fun, and the map is huge, so there's incentive to explore, without the need for the story to guide you.\n\nThat's a good thing, because the story is probably the weakest part of the game. It's not bad, but it's not as good as it could be. There is some neat lore, but the attempts at emotion fall flat.

Being a Monster Catcher that isn't solely a turn-based RPG is already unique in and of itself, and I applaud that.\n\nUnfortunately, this game is supremely amateurish.\n\nGraphics are subpar. A lot of it lacks cohesion: there are blur effects on top of simple pixel art on top of vector graphics and oddly unfitting UI design.\n\nSoundtrack is awful. Not one good track, and the only memorable ones stayed in my head for the wrong reasons.\n\nCombat is a bore. Very standard mana-based attacks with a neutral physical and some options for items, with the attacks sometimes being very light elemental variations on basic sh*t like scratching or slashing or pounding. \n\nCreature designs are incredibly basic. So many generic enemies and uninspired designs that I couldn't find a single shred of originality in the entire roster when I looked it up, save for maybe the Manticorb which was just a self-insert of that designer's cat. \n\nLevel design is bad.

I can say without hesitation that if you like those games or any creature collector then this is an easy purchase decision. By my count, Monster Sanctuary is better than all other creature collector style games except in the category of graphics. That's not to say that the graphics in monster sanctuary are bad, in fact I quite like them, but they don't have the AAA polish you might expect from a Pokemon game or Temtem for instance. That aside, in every other category Monster Sanctuary blows most creature collector games, including Pokemon, out of the water. The combat is deep and tactical, the monsters are balanced to the point where you can pretty much use whatever ones you want, (provided you have some sort of plan/synergy in mind) and the difficulty of the game is spot on. I find Pokemon games to be on the easy side for my taste. Don't expect to blow through every encounter on your first try in Monster Sanctuary, but the game doesn't punish you at all for losing a fight and also provides you with plenty of ways to change up your team or level a bit if you just need that little bit of oomph to conquer a difficult fight. I have now beaten the game twice and this time I completed everything there is to do in PvE. Fortunately for me there are plenty of ways to continue enjoying the game such as new game+ and I can even add special modifiers to change  how the game plays and keep it interesting.

Everything that takes place at the end of a turn from passive effects like poison and burn take literally two seconds to trigger and be done, with no text explaning what happened (huge positive for me as it keeps battles quick, and I found it pretty easy to understand what was going on because all of the info you need is in your monsters skill trees) \nAnother huge positive to the battle system is that every monster has a skill tree, with even one skill point being able to make a big difference to how that monster plays. You only get 43 skill points max, which doesn't let you fill out every skill, so filling out a skill tree involves making choices about what's best for your team and play style, and can be easily reset with an item if you want to try redoing it.\n\nIt's so easy to try out new teams, and see if a new monster will work with your team because of the way you get new monsters, where you hatch them from an egg, and the level of your new monster is only 2 ish levels behind most of your team, so no babysitting new monsters. Didn't feel grindy at all, I actually had to stop myself from doing random battles with wild monsters so I didn't get over levelled towards the end.

The marriage of 2D platforming and monster-taming RPG elements was not something I expected to blend so seamlessly. However, Monster Sanctuary exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond, offering a beautifully nostalgic experience that was simultaneously fresh and innovative.\n\nOne of the strengths of Monster Sanctuary lies in its monster-taming aspect. The variety of creatures available to collect and evolve was astounding and sparked the same joy I experienced in my early days of gaming with titles such as Pok\u00e9mon. There was an astonishing level of depth in the strategic possibilities for your team, allowing for a real sense of personal attachment to your monsters. The synergy between different creatures and the variety of team combinations provided me with many different experimentations.\n\nThe combat mechanics were engaging and satisfyingly tactical. Each battle was a delightful blend of strategy and power management, and I found myself thoroughly engaged mastering the various mechanics. Every victory felt earned, and each defeat was a lesson pushing me to tweak my strategy or grind to boost my team's level.\n\nThe Skill Trees for each monster were one of my favorite aspects. It allowed for so much customization and gave a real sense of progression and development for my monsters. Notably, the ability to tailor each creature's skill set to my specific strategies added another layer of depth, granting me a personal connection with my squad that few games offer.\n\nThe Metroidvania style exploration was another surprising element that Monster Sanctuary expertly weaved into its gameplay. Each area was filled with secrets, puzzles, and hidden pathways that often required specific monster abilities to access. This gave a reason to not only diversify my monster team for battles but also for navigation and exploration purposes. I spent hours exploring every nook and cranny of this world, my curiosity well-rewarded with unique monsters and valuable loot.\n\nAs for the story, it was a pleasantly engaging narrative that served as a fitting backdrop for the game's core mechanics. It was filled with ok characters and nteresting mysteries that kept me pushing forward. It wasn't the most innovative narrative, but it was heartfelt and served its purpose in driving the exploration and battles.\n\nThe art and music deserve special mentions. The retro-inspired pixel art is absolutely gorgeous, boasting unique, detailed designs for each monster and an array of vividly created environments. The soundtrack, a beautiful symphony of chiptunes, complements the atmosphere perfectly, further immersing me in the game world.\n\nMonster Sanctuary also has a few minor shortcomings. The pacing could be a bit off at times, with certain areas feeling somewhat dragged out and others seemingly rushed. Moreover, while the monster taming aspect was generally well implemented, the RNG-based nature of monster drops could occasionally feel frustrating. However, these are but minor blemishes in an otherwise masterfully crafted experience.\n\nCompleting Monster Sanctuary 100% was not just a testament to its pull but also a testament to its depth. I found myself completely surprised by how much the game offered in terms of content, and how much I enjoyed every single bit of it.\n\nIn conclusion, Monster Sanctuary was an unexpected gem that thoroughly impressed me. Its delightful blend of monster-taming, strategic combat, and platform exploration makes it a must-play for any RPG or Metroidvania fans, or for anyone looking for a deep and engaging gaming experience. It's a testament to the adage of not judging a book by its cover, or in this case, a game by its genre-mixing premise. It's not just a game; it's an experience that will take you back to the roots of gaming while also offering something new and innovative.

I regret giving this a chance.\n\nI wanted to give this game a positive review but the shift system and the equipment system kinda ruin it for me.\n\nThe shift system: after some point in the game, every group of 3 monsters can have one light-shifted, or one dark-shifted monster. Those shifted monsters are STRICTLY BETTER than unshifted monsters (except by a single good equipment that can only be equiped in unshifted monsters): they have strictly better stats and an extra passive ability that is often good. However, only 25% of the groups have ANY shifted monster, and if to guarantee an egg from the shifted monster you have to get 5 stars in the combat (what often means you need to kill all monsters in 2 turns). To farm them efficiently you need to defeat all groups of monsters that have the monster you want, so you can use one item to respawn all of them, and them rinse and repeat. None of the 6 groups with this monster in the game had a shifted monster? The only that had you got 4 stars and did not get the egg? Bad luck, try again. I would be okay with the 5* system to guarantee the egg if there was only unshifted monsters, having the shifted monsters being strictly better and much more rare (it is not even a 33% chance for each type, it is 75% all unshifted, 12.5% one monster light-shifted, 12.5% one monster dark-shifted), makes the grinding to test a new team you want to test unbearable, and this leads to my second point...\n\nThe equipment system: Not only you level up and chose the skills of you monster from a skill tree (very fun, recommend), but you also equip them with one weapon and three other accessories. The equipment makes all the difference and using not the best possible may be the difference between being able or not to pass a challenge. Not only because the attack/defense increase, but because if you do not have enough \"max mana\"/\"mana regeneration\" items it may be impossible for your monster to actually use the skills it have (having level enough to select a skill does not mean it has mana max or mana regeneration enough to use the skill). The problem is that you also need to level up your equipment, and you do this by farming for items that can be used to improve them. Item that sometimes are rare, so if you were to get an egg, instead you get one of such items, and if you want such an item you can get an egg instead. And testing different teams compositions become much more of a pain because every time you take someone from your team and add someone new, you need to remove all items from the monsters you removed, because you do not have so many good pieces of equipment, and any monster you perform poorly if it is not good equipped (not even worth testing any monster without your best equipment).\n\nIn the end, the process of changing your team and testing new monsters and combinations become too annoying to bother with, killing what should be the main selling point of the game, that is having a lot of monsters and builds you can have fun testing.", "timestamp_created": 1686153649, "timestamp_updated": 1688056226, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461719274520874023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139671871": {"recommendationid": "139671871", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044614863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1588, "last_played": 1688361551}, "language": "english", "review": "epic", "timestamp_created": 1686111977, "timestamp_updated": 1686111977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139669627": {"recommendationid": "139669627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130740157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 481, "last_played": 1686106769}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1686106859, "timestamp_updated": 1686106859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139665377": {"recommendationid": "139665377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271619725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5942, "last_played": 1662443897}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.

The individual mons are less charming and there's less of them than in pokemon, but in exchange each one has a detailed upgrade tree, several possible builds, a light shift and a dark shift, one of three ultimate attacks, and you field them in 3 v 3 battles, making the meta less about switching and more about designing your team so that they can cover each other.\n\nThis is a *very* numbers-y game, and it can feel a little grindy for the first half hour, but once you get a few build points into each of your mons it opens up a lot. By mid game, you'll have critters that can drop a moderate damage AoE that also inflicts every debuff and also strips buffs from opponents---and this won't be broken, the game is designed around the player being able to make really busted squads.\n\nIn terms of traversal, this *is* technically a metroidvania, since you platform around and look for ways to progress through the map, but there's no real penalty to falling off a ledge or landing on spikes, and most of the progress is gated around monster abilities. Even if you don't have a monster on your team, you can use its traversal abilities at any time.\n\nThe plot isn't anything too special, but it has a little bit more stakes than the average monster catcher, and there's a broader universe that gets implied. Music-wise, nothing stood out as jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but all of the tracks were really nice. There's some motifs that sound like they could be at home in Parasite Eve or Chrono Trigger, even if they don't command your attention the way those games' themes do.\n\nOverall, this is a 30+ hour game with fun battles and some really clever design.

good in all respects. Combat moves quickly and is quite fun, but gains significant depth later on. It offers a lot of choices for building both individual monsters and your party as a whole (and of course, lots of monsters to choose from). Nearly every monster can be built for offense, support or both as you see fit. The game makes it very easy to swap out your party members for any new monster that catches your eye, though once a monster falls behind catching it up is a lot more costly.\n\nCombat rewards are scaled to a ranking of \"how well\" you fought using a fairly deep but well-explained formula. This serves two purposes very well--it ensures that even in easy fights you're still fully engaged to try to get that ranking, and it provides an extra challenge for boss fights.\n\nIt starts out very easy, but grows somewhat challenging later on (especially if you're going for good ranks) and it has a high number and variety of of optional challenge fights in the endgame, both bosses and keeper fights. A bit of grind is required but you'll stay on level if you just fight each encounter you see once, and if you're exploring the map you'll hit the level cap well before the end anyways.", "timestamp_created": 1685073812, "timestamp_updated": 1687180642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138979872": {"recommendationid": "138979872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058485094", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3966, "last_played": 1685799492}, "language": "english", "review": "A couple of things to understand about this game : \n- yes it's monster taming but it could be a turn-based game all the same, don't let the monster aspect stop you\n- it's not a pokemon-clone, forget about pokemon. If you want something more like pokemon  with basic elements interaction, try nexomon or cassette beasts. They're good too\n- it's one of the best turn-based combat system out there : you're not spamming attack and heal dumbly\n- if you don't understand the combo/buff/debuff combat system you'll get slapped in the face ... hard. If you love thinking about teams/builds, theorycrafting, etc ; you'll be right at home\n\nAll that said, this game is amazing : monster have attacks that you choose based on 3/4 skill trees per monster ! Then they have some equipment. Then they have rare equipment that can change the way you play. \nOh wait, they also have abilities so that you can solve the puzzles in the game.\nYou can play tons of different teams and win if you understand how the combat works : the game is balanced  ! For real ! You're not forced to play the same 2 overpowered teams to cheese the fights.\n\nAnd then there's the dev team, usually when you back up a game you get a copy of the game with a poster and a pair of socks, right ? The best backers have statues in the game ! With their own team of monsters that you fight and they are tough. \nOh but wait, you're fed up with the music theme, they've put alternate musics in the game. \nOh but wait, you want PvP, they've put a PvP mode.\nOh but wait, you want more, they've developed two free DLCs.\nOh you also want a nuzlock, randomizer, new game+ ? They've added that too.\n\nOh but wait you're still not sure about an amazing game which is 1/10th the price of a AAA game for 10 times the quality ?

Adding in that every monster can be built in 2 or more ways (e.g. dedicated healer OR pure dps) is just amazing and keeps adding more variety in the already huge amount of setups. And this is without even considering light/dark shifting which again adds more variety.\n\nAlso, the first monster I hatched was with me until the end and proved to be a helpfull addition to my teams.

So many unique and cool team compositions and the game makes it super easy to swap out mons to try out different strategies.  \n\nI see a lot of complaints surrounding difficulty but I think that's because people are too used to other games where you're trying to invest in a particular mon.  For example with Pokemon you can over-level your starter, EV train it and watch it solo wipe the floor with every encounter in the game.  In this game, any monster on its own is not particularly strong.  It's the synergy between the three.\n\nFor example: I played a lot of the game with a burn comp.  All my monsters were capable of applying burn.  One of them increased the damage of burns and would gain a shield whenever you did burn damage, another increased how many burn stacks an enemy can have and then the third would make it so burns can cleanse enemy buffs.  None of which are that strong on their own but what you end up with is: stacking burn that ticks 5 times each turn and each tick gives your team a shield, does a ton of damage and vaporizes enemy buffs.\n\nAs long as you're thinking about team synergy, you'll have a challenging (but not overly difficult) experience.  It's also super rewarding to put together a team and watch it perform well.

Play this game with the mindset and expectation for teambuilding as you would a deckbuilder or a TTRPG. \nThe game can get extremely unforgiving if you don't strategize like that. \n\ntl;dr P.S. Pay more attention to passive skills than active skills. Talk to your familiar from the main menu if you need some tips on teambuilding.  \n\n~\nWhew! Without a doubt, I can say this is probably one of my favorite games of all time, and can wax poetic about its intricate teambuilding and all the fun I've had putting together teams and just running around seeing if they would click. As a result, I will gladly, GLADLY recommend this for anyone who have a blast with intricate turn-based gameplay.\n\nWith that being said, for anyone interested in this game for being a Monster Tamer: IT IS NOT EASY, especially compared to something like Pokemon. Considering that series's overwhelming presence over the monster tamer genre as a whole, I've seen several people assume that it's going to be like Pokemon, where you really only need to constantly hit the opponent's weaknesses to win during the story, and subsequently get roadblocked or otherwise struggle. \n\nNow, the game tries its best to accommodate you while you go about playing. The difficulty curve tries to ease you into the synergies you'll be expected to use by putting them in certain level brackets. As a result, reading the skills of the monsters you're using every 10 levels will help you figure things out, and also clue you in to when things will be getting more difficult.\n\nBut, while things will steadily get tougher, the story and general progression doesn't do a great job of actually directing you towards building synergies, and up to a certain point will be fairly brute-force-able. \n\nThat certain point, I would guess, is the cause for most of the negative Steam reviews. It is a very sudden difficulty spike relative to the rest of the story, and while you *could* get into other fights that are just as challenging, if not moreso, those are all in optional sidequests.\n\nThe platforming is, admittedly, more on-the-side than a true focus of the game, but is still a considerable part of it. For anyone interested mainly for the fine-tuned tactical gameplay, please keep that in mind.\n\n\nWith all said and done, the tactical depth is impressive even without diving into the PvP scene, the soundtrack and spritework is lovely, and the difficulty lies purely in mastery of the systems in the game itself.

This game is a mix of platforming, monster collecting and metroidvania like exploration. The metroidvania element is mixed with your monster collecting. Progression is tied behind finding and discovering your own abilities or hatching and raising a monster with the ability you need to progress.\n\nBattles in this game are all 3v3. The combat system in itself has a wide breadth of monsters to choose from including vast amounts of equipment and choices in each monsters skill tree.\nYou are encouraged to build a 'combo' meter during battle not just to do more damage but to get a higher battle rating at the end. This increases the rewards, makes it more likely you get rarer rewards and also increases the chance you can get an egg of one of the creatures you fought!\n\nGoing into this game I did not expect the amount of strategy that could be involved in the system nor the difficulty that would come around from being under prepared for certain bosses.\nDo not underestimate the necessity of tank or support skills/monsters in this game. They are an absolute must.\nMonster sanctuary also takes the idea of form shifts and evolution and does not make them straight up 'better'. Each form or evolution changes a monster to be used differently. Maybe that tank creatures evolution is now completely offence? You are fit to do as you see fit and shape the team you'd like.\n\nStory itself isn't that much but it is serviceable and the strengths of the depth of combat, exploration, soundtrack and art is what shines.\n\nPros\n[list]\n[*]Monster sanctuary has lovely QOL. This includes battle speed increase, hatching new monsters are around the level of your highest creature and access to badges to level them quickly. This lets you experiment with new creatures without having to grind too much.\n[*]All combat encounters are on map and can be easily avoided and fought. This means you can see what monsters you would fight in 3v3 and pick your battles as and when.\n[*]You can re-fight boss battles later to get a higher battle rating and get the egg of the boss/rare materials you may not have gotten the first time.\n[*]Large variety of skill trees and strategies including equipment. Lots of potential synergy and variety of things to play with. You can reset skill trees with an item too.\n[*]Basically all monsters can be late game monsters. You need to get a good synergy going.\n[*]Nice art style and soundtrack that is appropriate for the game. Animations for the monsters is nice and some of the designs of the monsters are creative.\n[*]You can hand in any extra eggs and monsters you no longer want to the monster sanctuary to 'increase their army' and gain rewards for your unwanted monsties.\n[/list]\nCons\n[list]\n[*]Most puzzles revolve around levers. Either pull all levers in time or pull levers in the correct order to open doors.\n[*]Difficulty sometimes spikes or gets tough unless you have the right counter to a boss. Sometimes some bosses are easily defeated.\n[*]Endgame is incredibly difficulty and you need the perfect strategies near enough.\n[*]Story is serviceable. You are a monster tamer from a bloodline with a special monster familiar. You are protecting the monster sanctuary. Strong monsters have been appearing recently that need to be defeated. There is a threat of 'Alchemists' and you set out to defeat them and the strong monsters that may or may not be linked.\n\nAll in all the game is a great take on two genres I never imagined coming together.

To describe it in a few words, this is very much like \"If Pokemon met Castlevania: Aria/Dawn of Sorrow\". \n\nIn more words than that, on the Monster Taming side, you have a wealth of creatures and mechanics to play around in (mostly) 3v3 combat. Raising your Party through Levels, individual Skill Trees, Food Buffs, and Equipment. With this, you have a huge variety of options and strategies to find new creatures that boast powerful synergies and can execute a variety of strategies to beat down anything that stands in your way. Whether it's through Brute Force, bolstering through Buffs, debilitating your foes via Debuffs and Status Effects, or slow-rolling your way to insurmountable power and laying waste to all in one giga-powerful assault. There's a lot to experiment with and will definitely keep you occupied throughout the games story and beyond.\n\nOn the other side, where you are navigating the titular \"Monster Sanctuary\", the creatures you find and hatch throughout your journey do more than just provide new strength and new tactics to employ, they're also pivotal to your navigation through the world. Each monster you find have their own unique overworld abilities that help you to traverse the terrain to find new frontiers and interact with puzzles to unlock secret areas and treasures. It's a great incentive to try and \"catch them all\", since you never know which critter will be the one that helps you open up the next chunk of Map because they can overcome that one obstacle barring your path.\n\nThe two together create an experience that actively encourages exploration and experimentation, and really engages you into trying out new strategies and new styles of play in the games battle portions, which I personally absolutely loved and was a fantastic driving force into getting me to complete the game 100%.\n\nAsides from that, there's online PVP to enjoy, an Infinite Arena where you fight increasingly stronger foes until you are eventually overwhelmed with rewards to help you through the game, and a New Game+ for added replayability which features a special Challenge Run, as well as a classic Nuzlocke-style challenge, a Randomiser challenge and finally a recently added \"Relics of Chaos\" mode, which add new items which drastically change up what you can do in battles, allowing for some truly bonkers strategies.\n\nI absolutely 100% recommend this game.

I'm not lying when I say that Dark Souls is an easier and more user-friendly experience. I beat Dark Souls in about 30 hours, and it took me about 85 to beat this game on console. This is especially the case in the late-game, but the difficulty haunts the mid-game as well, not so much the early-game. I bought the game again because I have faith the devs can make the game a bit easier in the future and I wanted to support further updates and new releases from the devs. So far, the balance updates have been in the right direction, especially buffing the weaker monsters to the point where they're, like, usable, but the balance is still completely boned. \n\nTo touch on the balance a bit, some types of monster are just strictly better than other types. Wind and Fire are busted early game, become decent mid-game and fall off hard in the end-game. Because of this, the Eagle starter is by far the best option simply because it not only does the most DPR out of all the starters, it gets abilities that give it Charge stacks in the mid-game to make it even stronger. It does fall off when you can get better Wind monsters late-game, but by then you shouldn't be using your starter anyhow. This is tragic because I really wanted to use the Toad, but all it really does is sit and debuff, and there are far better monsters for debuffing. The question of, \"Why debuff when you can buff and use shields instead?\", never really gets addressed either, making the team composition problem even more pronounced.\n\nBosses suck. I'm just gonna say it, they need to be completely reworked. They are either too strong, forcing you to go out of your way to get an entirely new team for one encounter, or far too easy for any team to beat. The easy problem is pronounced in the early-game, but by the late-game, every single boss is far too difficult, forcing you to either get lucky with crits to win (thank god you can increase your crit chance with equipment or the game would be basically unplayable) or again forcing you to get an entirely new team. I never felt like I was using the monsters I wanted to use, only what the game wanted me to use for that specific boss. Expect to have ~10 teams throughout the game. The grinding isn't bad, per se, the monsters scale up to around your level and you can use level badges to get your monsters up a good few levels more, but having to get an entirely new team every single boss fight is so draining.\n\nShifting is a neat idea, unlocking one out of two free perks for your monsters is a cool customization option similar to Mega Evolution or Z-Moves in the obvious source material, but the item that lets you do this is stupidly rare for the majority of the game. Remember how I said you have to have like 10-ish different teams to effectively beat the game? Yeah, you don't get that many items to shift your monsters, not by a long shot. I found myself running Gray Pearl (item that massively boosts stats for monsters that don't shift) in almost every boss fight, not because I made the decision to run that item instead of shifting, but because there simply weren't enough resources to justify shifting a monster I'm only using for one boss and then dropping. Save your Shift Stones or whatever they're called until you need them to win a boss fight, because you can't effectively farm them until very late in the game. \n\nWhy can't I just get the eggs for the monsters I don't already have at the end of the battle and instead have to get a 5-Star battle rating to have a chance at spawning an egg, one that could be for a monster I already own and don't need? If you want the 5-Star rating system to dictate eggs, then have it do so for monsters you've already got so you can farm for the Monster Army. This just adds to the tedium of farming, it's not interesting and it's bad design.\n\nWhy do none of the clothing options change dialogue at all?\n\nWhy have overworld puzzles at all when they're so surface level as to be just this: Do you have monster with needed ability? If yes -> Reward. If no -> No Reward. Also, why include some puzzles that are so tedious and convoluted as to necessitate a guide in some areas and then include others that are puddle-deep? The hard puzzles aren't even relegated to the end-game. They're in the mid-game too, in places like Sun Palace. \n\nWhy are there no Keeper battles in the overworld besides story-driven ones? Are we to really believe that a society built on taming and battling monsters only battle them against each other in one of the designated trainer battle areas in the main hub or when it's against an evil team? Are we to believe that every Keeper simply trains their monsters against wild monsters? It's super weird to look at a series like Pokemon and go, \"You know what, these trainer battles suck. Let's remove them.\" The lack of trainers in the areas of the game makes the areas feel dead, like nobody is taming monsters like you are and like everybody is just chilling in the Keeper Stronghold while you're out saving the world. This isn't even getting into the extremely weird limit put on the player in Keeper Duels where during the first turn, the player only gets to make a move with two out of their three monsters. You can't use strategies that depend on all three of your monsters at the beginning of a Keeper Duel, making your first turn always an awkward pick of what part of the strategy you want to execute first, leaving you at a massive disadvantage. \n\nOverall, I think the game has a lot of potential in terms of how good it could be, but it fails in a lot of areas that don't make a lot of sense for it to fail in. I'm giving it a thumbs-down not because I don't recommend it, I do recommend the game to anyone who finds monster collecting games interesting, but because it needs to be improved. Stop adding monsters and areas and game modes to the game when the core game itself needs to be fixed. I don't recommend you pick the game up for $20. Wait until it goes on sale and pick it up. Hopefully they fix it.\n\nCompared to games like Cassette Beasts, it's simply not as good.

And they're good skill trees too, almost none of the skills feel negligible and quite a few will fundamentally change how you use a monster or even construct your entire party. Furthermore, the game is remarkably well balanced. Almost every monster in the game is viable. At the same time there is a lot of room for strategy, in order to get the most horsepower out of your team you need to think about mechanics and composition.\n\nThe metroidvania part is fine, most of what kept me going through it was curiosity about what kind of monsters I might find in the next area.

But on the other hand; the game devolves into the most back track heavy, trial and error shit I've seen in a minute. The game starts off fairly easy, then devolves halfway through into a fairly difficult/annoying game that wants you to mix and match a bunch of Monster team combinations just to progress. Not to mention that you need certain Monsters with certain traversal abilities to reach certain areas, which is just more and more backtracking and forcing you to capture some Monster that you really don't want in your party.\n\nBoss fights are fairly interesting but devolve into \"better come prepared with a very specific set of Monsters with a very particular set of skills..\" Taken haha. Seemingly the Devs knew how annoying raising Monsters can be in games like this, so they added this pretty nice system that tracks your level, so that every new Monster you capture can be upgraded to match your current party's level. Pretty nice. Where this system fails, imo, is that you're supposed to know which Monster has which abilities and back tracking to go and get one just for a specific fight. For example: Some Monsters can learn poison moves, but not all can learn the ability that greatly buffs poison damage; this becomes particularly annoying when you need to deal DOT just to defeat certain Monsters.. and even then defeating the Monster isn't enough, you have to beat it with a 5 star rating (without taking too much damage and within a certain amount of turns) just to unlock the Monster. It becomes so annoying after 15 hours, it would be so fucking nice to just allow more Monsters to learn more abilities all around, or the ability to transfer certain abilities and moves between Monsters.\n\nI recommend this game if you like somewhat elaborate RPG fights that require stupid amounts of team synergy via trial and error, but if you're a casual Pokemon/Digimon/SMT/Persona fan, I wouldn't really recommend it.

The difficulty WALL. \n\nSo lets start at the beginning: Some good stuff should be addressed, before we delve into examining the problem. \nFirst, in Monster Sanctuary EVERY monster can be a LATE GAME monster. That means, even the first little mudcrap can be an endgame warrior, becouse its all about building up your little team, and choosing the best lineups. And thats the thing, i really liked about the game: that i dont have to switch my monsters constantly....\n...then the endgame came. And suddenly you hit a brick wall. The difficulty went from calm and medium to HELLISH within a minute. The endgame fights simply cannot be fought without abandoning your old team, and mathing out the best monster lineups against every single sideboss fight (and there is about 4-5 at the end). \nThere is a good thing, and a bad one here:\nThe good decision from the dev was that you cannot outlevel endgame bosses to just harvest them blindly. Thats okay and cool, makes the endgame really strategic... HOWEVER! The game is very different at the end, than before... I really enjoyed most of my playtime, i built up my little team, i geared them, it was a really fun time - then they just disappeared within a sec. So... after 30 hours of build up u have to trash ur team, and play with some meta lineup against those bosses. Totally ruined the endgame for me... i lost that sensation which came from achieving a high level with ur heroes and enjoying that power. Here u get frustrated at the end, u doing math with stats, looking for best lineups against X and Y bosses on the forums but definitely not playing the way u did before. \n\nIam so sorry about the endgame, which was a drag, a wall. \n\nAnyway, the game is insanely good, i have never seen such a cute wombo-combo synergie monster tamer like this.

To get a good gaming experience here you really need to come up with a good combination, and when a combination is good enough, you can easily beat enemies that somehow immune to your type of attack/ having a much higher level than you.

Something about living in harmony alongside magical animals and protecting them from exploitation and extinction at human hands is very cozy and delightful. Kind of a Jane Goodall in a D&D world fantasy.\n\nA mon game mixed with a Metroidvania feels like a chocolate/peanut butter combination. It's perfect together. You can walk around with a monster and command it to use its world power. These can open doors, allow new forms of traversal, or activate puzzle triggers. These new regions reveal new items, mobility tools, and, of course, new mons with new abilities. It can be a little 1-D at times. Why can't my flying magical seahorse help me swim or fly? That's not his power, idk. Occasionally the levels feel very deliberately gated, but that's just a metroid thing.\n\nThe combat is much more crunchy, complex, and in-depth than other mon games I've played. It's 3v3 and you have a combo meter that powers up moves later on in your turn, so you often build teams of a tank, a setup, and a hitter monster in different mixes based on what you have and what you are trying to beat, but you can also build a shield-sustain team grinds down enemies, or replace a direct hitter with a congeal, burn, or poison build. My favorite part was figuring out how the mons can work and how those can synergize. I am not a competitive mon battler and I don't recall any main quest fights being hard, but I never skipped a fight, enjoyed 100%-ing the map, and loved learning how all the critters fought, so it felt great to me. Honestly it feels like exactly the kind of strategy game I love, namely, that you get to explore the world and express your love for your favorite parts by making them part of your adventure going forward. And you get to customize them to suit your team.\n\nThe ability tocall up any monster at will or hatch eggs to get a monster near your party's level is great, letting you mix up your combat team or try new mobility powers, I only wish they weren't underleveled. Not sure why the game goes 90% of the way to make that mostly seamless to throw up an arbitrary limit like that. Also, getting a specific mon egg can be annoying because a lot of it is based on RNG, like if you hatch a boss monster early, it can easily fall behind and leveling them up can be expensive/tedious. Annoying, but a lot less annoying than finding a trade from another copy of the game anyways.\n\nAs for negatives, I wish the lore was more in-depth, but a lot of the lore comes from \"fun animal facts\" that have little relation to each other, except \"humans almost killed off this monster, until they were relocated to the Monster Sanctuary.\" It reminds me of the Gen 1 Pokedex, where it kind of implies Kanto is just a part of the world where the animals are Pokemon, but never really explores that much. Also, there are so many ways to build each mon that memorizing all of the options can make hi-level fights extremely opaque, even as someone who enjoys a lot of fiddly builds in D&D or Pathfinder.\n\nReading this back, it feels like a very \"mixed\" review, but I am just warning about the crunchier parts of this chocolate/peanut butter mix that I think is exceptionally fun.

The game has an immense amount of strategy, a diverse set of creatures to collect, and a large world to explore. There is much to love about this game, and I would personally struggle to find any flaws that I have with the game.\n\nThe game's strategy has a lot of depth for those looking for it with deep decision-making both in battles and in team-building. In battles, there many systems, such as combos, buffs, and debuffs, all of which need to be considered in the order of the actions. Rather than a single-battle system, Monster Sanctuary has you use three monsters at a time to battle. The synergies between three monsters influence how you think about building your team with each monster having their own builds and things to customize to further add to your strategy. Also, the game is difficult enough that it is important to understand these things; there were many times after losing a fight that I would replace a certain member of my team or change the build of one of my monsters.\n\nThe music and visual presentation of the game are also very strong. The music fits very well, either providing energy in fights or providing the ambiance to the numerous areas of the game. The pixel art of the game is visually appealing and detailed, as well as the monster designs are varied and fun. The world and story are solid, providing a good backdrop to the whole adventure.\n\nThe biggest flaw I had with the game was the clunky menu. The menu was definitely designed with a controller in mind, and while fine to navigate with keyboard and mouse, there could have been improvements to how the menu is presented. This is especially noticeable near the end of the game, where players would have countless items to manage and look over, and the menu can feel a little of a hassle to traverse.\n\nOverall, I quite enjoyed the game, even going out of the way to 100% it.

Definitely agree with that assessment as it feels like old school gen 1/2 Pokemon, which were my favorite. The endless brainstorming of different team and item combinations really made this game shine for me and I found the difficulty just right. On top of that, the exploration ended up actually being a fun aspect of the game as you utilize the monster's abilities to discover various paths, giving the 2D style more appeal.

It's not a Pokemon clone, and if you go in expecting that you're going to be disappointed. You should think of this game more like a standard JRPG with a huge roster of playable characters and extremely high customization.\n\nPros:\n- Game's difficulty is naturally dynamic. If you take your time and progress slowly you'll level enough that there won't be too much challenge, but if you move at a brisk pace you'll find a decent challenge awaiting you.\n- Customization options are through the roof and respec items are readily available. Build your team exactly how you want it.\n- Exploration is fun and rewarding. Your monster talents help you progress, but are typically not mandatory. This rewards you for having a big collection without punishing you if you don't.\n- Platforming is precise and feels good. Mobility options through some monsters let you customize how you get around.\n\nCons:\n- Combat system might be intimidating to first time casual players.

I was having a blast for my first 30 hours in Monster Sanctuary. I was enjoying it so much I couldn't wait to finish so I could begin my second playthrough. Later areas of the game went in a different direction and it completely killed my enthusiasm for the game. There is a difficulty spike towards the end that is absolutely ridiculous, and I don't think I'll ever replay this as a consequence. I am giving this a positive review because of how much I enjoyed the first half of the game, but this was a very tough call for me. The difficulty spike really soured how I feel about the game. I've seen this game described as Pokemon for adults, and I think that is a fair assessment.\n\nThere are a lot of nicely polished elements. I much appreciated that new monsters were close in level to my current party, and there are level-up badges that can be acquired. I especially liked that max-level monsters continue to gain EXP to grant me more of the level-up badges. The pixel art is fantastic, most of the music is good, exploring is very satisfying. Nearly every monster is useful and viable in some way - I wouldn't say any of them are junk. Some are kind of niche though. I was surprised that only a handful of monsters can change form, but overall there was a satisfying amount of monster variety. Replayability seems good because of NG+ and the monster randomizer setting.\n\nI don't ordinarily play metroidvania titles because I'm not a fan of precision platforming nor trying to remember all the dozens of places I need to backtrack to. The ability to add markers to the map was a welcome addition to dealing with finding  things, but unfortunately there was just enough difficult platforming to irritate me.\n\nThe concept of using the monsters for navigation, their vast array of abilities, synergies, etc., is all fantastic. I enjoyed studying the abilities and strategizing about what combos to use. I also enjoyed the exploration aspect of the game. The pacing of the exploration fell a bit flat though. For example, I got the first flying ability very early in the game, then the improved version about halfway through. I got the basic swimming ability and replaced it with the improved version less than an hour later. Nearly all navigating can be accomplished with double jump, and occasionally an area specific ability like swimming. Monster explore abilities are mostly confined to locking out new areas and hiding treasure. The only place that really used the monster abilities for lots of navigation was the Forgotten World at the endgame. Some abilities like Grapple were really underused, and almost exclusively used for finding treasure. It would have been better if various monster abilities were needed to explore more in previous areas aside from just getting a couple of treasure chests.\n\nI am absolutely not a fan of the 5-star combat rating system and how it is used to calculate loot rewards. That is the kind of trash I'd expect to see in a mobile game. There is too often nothing you can do to earn 5 stars besides dumb luck or being vastly over the level of the things you're fighting. I am super-duper not a fan of having to 5-star all of the bosses and having their level scale to mine. That kind of grindy crap is super tedious to me, as well as the [spoiler] lategame area with the keeper statues to battle.[/spoiler]\n\nCombat gets progressively more complicated as your monsters level up and gain new abilities. Keeping track of things after midgame and figuring out what works well is very challenging. I also never quite figured out why some monsters do so much more damage than others. Say I could have 2 different monsters, both with similar attack/magic stats, similar crit chance/damage, etc. Acting 3rd in combat gives the highest bonus damage, so I'd expect either monster to be able to fill that role equally, but somehow, some monsters just don't do the damage that others do even with the same stats. I used a Ninki Nanka for a while and his attacks were less than half the damage from my spectral familiar even with same stats, for example.\n\nAfter level 25 or 30 I noticed the combat difficulty starting to climb. By level 40 I was extremely frustrated with combat. My monsters had 4-6k hp, could hit for 1-2k damage, and had all level 5 upgraded gear. Enemy monsters had 10-12k hp and could hit for 4k+. It seems the enemy monsters don't have equipment, so their stats are boosted to make up for it but it is way too much. I absolutely hate when enemies don't play by the same rules that I am constrained by. I also hated keeper battles because I always start with a disadvantage: Only 2 of my 3 monsters can act the first round, but the enemy gets the usual 3 actions. Some endgame battles were profoundly stupid - enemy with 55% dodge rate and 5 stacks of regeneration healing for 22.5% of their hp every round, with more automatic healing when they attack and automatic debuff cures on top of all that! Doesn't help to try knocking off their buffs either because they automatically come back. Unbelievably frustrating. I also didn't like anything to do with the entier Keeper's Tower area - all that crap felt like themepark challengines from a mobile game.\n\nI realize this is a lot of complaining for a positive review, but keep in mind it is an extremely narrow positive.\n", "timestamp_created": 1677388647, "timestamp_updated": 1677388647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740139424800872803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133630458": {"recommendationid": "133630458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103854574", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3000, "last_played": 1679403858}, "language": "english", "review": "Rarely does a monster collecting game make me stay and play without getting bored.

Your experience on other versions may vary.[/u][/b]\n\n[h3][b][u]Short Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] An engaging turn-based battler and creature collector, with a bit of metroidvania influence in its level design. The 3v3 battles and unique combo system add a lot of strategy to each encounter, and it's designed so that every monster can shine with the right team. Some late-game difficulty spikes can lead to frustration, but there are community guides to help you get the most power out of your team if you need it. Way more fun than I expected, and the only reason I stopped at 40 hours is because I ran out of things to do.\n\n[b][u]NOTE[/u]: Slight [u]epilepsy warning[/u] due to many attacks including screen flash effects--not very strong or rapid effects, but I'm throwing out a warning to be on the safe side.[/b]\n\n[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Monster Sanctuary[/i] is a turn-based creature collector game that has you playing as a Monster Keeper, someone capable of hatching, training, and fighting alongside monsters that roam the land known as the Sanctuary. As you work to rise up in the ranks in hopes of becoming a Keeper Master, you stumble upon a secret organization that seeks to overthrow the Keepers and upset the delicate balance between humans and monsters; and it's up to you to put a stop to them. I almost skipped over this one purely because I generally dislike turn-based combat in games these days; but I'm glad I decided not to, because it ended up way more fun than I would've expected.\n\nThe core gameplay loop is pretty simple: you fight monsters in turn-based combat, collect eggs from these battles to hatch a copy of the species you got it from, then use them to build a 6-monster team that works best for you. My knee-jerk reaction is to compare it to the likes of Pok\u00e9mon, but that comparison alone doesn't give you a good sense of all the things it does to set itself apart:\n[list]\n[*]Instead of awarding specific abilities at specific levels, [b]every monster has JRPG-style skill trees unique to them that let you choose what you earn each level[/b]. These skill trees are diverse enough that you have the freedom to build each monster one of several ways--single-target vs multi-target damage, buffing allies vs debuffing opponents, X elemental vs Y elemental, etc.--and nearly all of the game's strategic elements stem from figuring out what setup work best with your current team composition. This can be tough to wrap your head around at first, and you will end up picking things that turn out to be unhelpful; but you're encouraged to experiment, so they make it easy to reset a monster's skills should you find that your current build isn't working out for you.\n\n[*][b]Battles are all 3v3, so there's a lot of emphasis on making sure your team has good synergy with one another[/b]. This can either mean a team where each monster fills a different core role (healer/defense, buffs/debuffs, damage dealer), or a team where one monster's skills directly compliment another (e.g. one triggers a bunch of debuffs, another gets a damage boost for each debuff an enemy has).\n\n[*][b]There's this interesting combo system where every successful hit on an enemy adds a damage multiplier to your next monster's attack that turn[/b]. The idea is to use your weaker multi-hit moves to rack up a high combo, then take full advantage of the damage boost with your heavy-hitter or a move that can exploit the enemy's weakness. It adds another layer of strategy to each turn, but the best part is that non-damaging support skills also add to the combo--sometimes even more than attacking would. This means that even monsters that never attack still indirectly contribute to overall damage output, which means you don't need to compromise by including support monsters on your team--and on a related note,\n\n[*]In many creature collectors, there's a clear progression where your early creatures are meant to either evolve in some fashion or be set aside in favor of stronger late-game creatures. While that can happen here too, it's by no means a requirement--[b]from the first blob you meet to the last boss you defeat, all 111 unique monsters are designed so that they can be viable with the right build and the right team.[/b]\n[/list]\n\nA lot of the marketing references a metroidvania influence, and that mainly stems from the overworld map design. You have a 2D side-scrolling map comprised of distinct but interconnected regions, a ton of secrets and shortcuts to uncover, and a lot of backtracking to get to them since they require abilities you don't unlock until later on. You actually get these from the monsters you capture, as each species has an \"Explore Ability\" that lets them tackle one or more of the obstacles in your way: flight, swimming, breaking hidden walls, activating special switches, and so on. Usually any monster whose ability fits the description will work (e.g. \"Activates fire orbs\"), but occasionally you'll require a specific monster because their version of said ability behaves just a little different than the rest. With all that said, the genre's influence starts and ends there; so [b]don't buy this expecting a full-fledged metroidvania, because the turn-based combat is the real focus here.[/b]\n\nI've seen some reviews say that the difficulty of the late game put a premature end to their run, and that it conflicts with the game's core philosophy that \"every monster can be viable\"--and they do have a point. [b]Late-game Keeper battles use tactics that induce a sudden, sharp spike in difficulty; and it can be very tough for most teams to counter them.[/b] I personally didn't have much trouble here, but that's because my go-to team by this point just happened to be a good pick for these fights. If you're having trouble with your current setup, I'd suggest looking at [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7GtJveVZzjxZqGjO4u1_2pM_4k5dVBrW_SVLcJK9j8/]SmugLookingBarrel's recommended monster builds[/url] to see if there's a way to better optimize your current team. I can also recommend the team I used--one that's fairly easy to put together--but that could take away the fun of discovering things on your own, so see if you can beat it with your own team first before reading:\n[list]\n[*][spoiler]Scattered throughout the game are six different goblins: the first three can be found at the same time (Brute, Hood, Warlock), and the rest are found separately later on (King, Miner, Pilot). Each one has skills that compliment one another very well, including one passive skill (which can be unlocked as soon as you get them) that provides significant buffs to all other goblins in the party. This team--often just the first three, even--along with SLB's builds can get you through every main story battle with ease, and it's also well-suited for most optional and post-game content.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\nOne last piece of advice to address another common complaint: [b]there's an option to speed up battle animations anywhere from 1x to 3x--[u]USE IT[/u][/b]. Start at 1x until you get comfortable with the mechanics and/or fights start to drag, bring it up just a bit, rinse and repeat; don't start with 3x or you're gonna struggle to understand what's going on.\n\n[b]What started as a hesitant 1-hour test run turned into a 40-hour 100% completion run[/b], and it's safe to say that I'm really glad I gave it a chance--and now I'm thinking I should go back and give some more turn-based games I passed on another chance too. [b][u][i]Monster Sanctuary[/i] hooked me way more than I expected it to; and I only wish that I had more of it to play.[/u][/b]\n\n[quote]For more game reviews, check out my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42524563/]Curator page[/url]![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1676949327, "timestamp_updated": 1676955334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133267743": {"recommendationid": "133267743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371804174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1940, "last_played": 1676942622}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really enjoying this game. Then I got to one end game boss that ruined the entire game for me. I don't mind difficult games, but this game is fairly casual and generally will allow you to use whatever build, or load out you want, then you get to the boss battles which are entirely different than normal battles. In boss battles both the player an the enemy have 6 monster instead of 3, which makes a small difference to strategy, but beyond that there is this stupid buff they built into ONLY boss battles where if you go beyond a certain number of turns each player will gain a massive 25% damage buff per turn. Now this limit isn't something you'll never hit, no I hit it in near every boss battle and it completely changes how you have to play boss battles because it makes defensive play completely useless beyond the first few turns. This is pretty annoying, but I was able to turn down the difficulty for boss battles and it wasn't that bad... then I got to one boss in the late game called Zosimos. Even on the lowest difficulty it is impossible to beat him without using an over powered build you find online which just isn't how you should have to play the game. The normal gameplay is fine, the balancing isn't great, when you level up and go back to an area you release a 2 level difference will allow to steamroll monsters that were putting up a good fight before, and the leveling system also makes it so you can't grind past areas for XP because battles 3 levels below you will drop 1% of a level. The normal gameplay is also very much so casual, if you stick to your level you won't have much of a struggle, but then you hit bosses which are a wall. It seems like this game couldn't decide if it wanted to be easy or hard and instead went with this easy for the first 75% then you hit a wall that requires you to min max your set up, which is FINE if that was the idea from the start, but when you're 25 hours into a game and hit a wall it isn't fine.", "timestamp_created": 1676943850, "timestamp_updated": 1676943850, "voted_up": false, "votes_up":

I'll put the TLDR in caps and for those who want a more in depth idea as to why I like or dislike something, you can read beyond the caps. Keep in mind that these are just my opinions. My taste in things like artistry and music may be different than yours.\n\n----PRO'S----\n-THE SPRITES AND MONSTER JOURNAL ART.   Incredible art and spriting of all the characters. Whilst sprites can rarely do their drawn versions justice, the sprites give the monsters more life than I see in many games these days that use them. When you have a favorite Mon that you think looks so cool, that you're hellbent on making a team around them, you know the sprites are awesome. I sincerely appreciate the Monster Journal as well for giving you a peek at how the monsters actually look as well as some lore about what and who they are, how they came to be, etc., Some look cute, some absolutely cool looking, some somehow both.\n\n-BALANCE.    Whilst you can say that no game will ever manage to 100% balance everything, especially in a game like this where you're putting together a 3 man team, especially especially when they're acting together rather than one or two at a time like in pokemon, the fact remains that they've still done a fantastic job of making sure the vast majority of the monsters feel like they *could* be godly together and give you a power trip, whilst still staying within the games boundaries at the same time. It takes a considerable amount of team crafting (at least alone without looking up guides) to really craft a team that feels broken in any way. I made a team called AFKBleeds that literally just sits there shielding itself, healing, and debuff stripping whilst the enemy bleeds to death for massive bleed and debuff dmg numbers, and I still had a few teams give mine a run for their money.\n\n-AMOUNT OF CONTENT.     This one's not the most remarkable on why I like the game. With the story being somewhat short compared to most game stories, it's carried decently well by the fact that this is a game where you'll be keeping a lookout for and backtracking for loot, hatching and evolving monsters, and overall sitting down and theory crafting the perfect team. If you're here for the long and engrossing story, I've got bad news. If you're here for the amount of hours you'll put in, I welcome you to the Sanctuary my friend.\n\n-REPLAYABILITY.     So, you've beaten the game after killing the Big Bad, whadya do now? Well, that depends. Are you a treasure hoe like me? Get to exploring until you've 100% the map of all its hidden loot. Ya wanna Catch Em All? Go beat the daylights out of every monster until it pops out an egg for you in its deaththroes and 5 star the champions you've beaten for theirs. Ya wanna see if your seemingly unbeatable team truly is unbeatable? Game's got ya covered with the Infinity Arena where you go up against random AI teams that ever increase in lvl, but reward prizes and gives you a highscore. Ya got online pvp to see whose team's the cheesiest. Ya can fight the rest of the games *Super* Champions. You can fight against any number of the more secret easter egg enemies and teams post-game.\n\nMUSIC-   Again, this is my own opinion, and honestly this one is a mix. I did like some of the music. When I play a game with any sort of combat and I/we're about to face up against a powerful opponent, I want something that makes me feel like, \"This is it, team. They may be tall, but we've proven we're taller. Steel yourselves and show these dudes how we got here!\" They've got some solid tracks in that area. A tiny bit samey after listening to the same ones a number of times, but solid all the same. The music for the overworld fits pretty well too. This world is a Sanctuary. Whilst there is fighting to be had, it's meant to be a place of nature, and the tracks capture that pretty well. I won't pretend to know music instruments and their terms for different strings and such, but the track did well in the immersion department. The only nitpick I could give is that for a combat junkie like myself, the peaceful and nature-esque tracks further agitate my itch for getting back in combat asap.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE-   Did you already name your character or monster, but you just thought of an even better one? You can change both. Granted, the monster name changer is a little later in the game, but it's there. Are you gender-fluid or just recently realize your real gender? The costume changer allows you to take on the costumes of the other gender, effectively letting you switch genders whenever you visit em.\n\n\n-----CONS------\n\nSTORY-     I don't feel like the story quite deserves to be in the con section, personally, but of all the things that'll wow you in this game, the story-telling here definitely won't be among them. It's a little short without the other content in between, the characters didn't have any real self development arcs other one of em being, \"I was a duchecanoe to you earlier, but having the floor mopped with my face one time made me humble,\" and I usually like for my Big Bad villains behind everything to be more than Bad for the sake of being Bad, but it was passable. To put it in perspective, if I had to give it a grade, the story would be like, \"Well lil Timmy, ya didn't fail. I can tell you did the barebones work to pass and that's what ya get. A barely passing grade.\"\n\nMAP LOOT-   Now, while I understand that some folks aren't teamcrafters and are gonna struggle and need to rely on potions to get em through, it did make me frown a bit every time I discovered a sneaky breakable wall or finally got the right creature to reach a bit of loot, only to find a potion or singular bit of fruit. Honestly, I'd have rather just gotten some straight up gold to spend on food I actually needed or maybe some upgrade ingredients with how hard those burned up my wallet. Also...I think I'd feel a little weird if irl I found a hidden treasure chest with a single half rotten strawberry in it.\n\nTHE COSTUME SKINS-    While I found the skins to be well done, I found it a lil uncomfortable the way they were...well actual skins. You'd often have a costume with a myriad of colors to em, which is awesome, but you'd have like 7 or 8 of em being a white person and have like 1 or 2 blacks people. While I may not be black, and I'm not gonna pretend I'm the vanguard of black folks issues, but that just feels weird. I get there's not a character template on top of which the costumes are being placed on, but this doesn't feel like the way to go about being inclusive. It feels shoehorned in and as if you're being restricted to which colors you can wear if you care about your character representing the irl you to a any degree.  I think it would probably have been less weird if instead of having 9 different colors with 1 or 2 being black skinned, if you just had like, say 3 skin colors and then the same 3 costume colors for each skin color. Same amount of spriting work, possibly even less actually if ya think bout it, and a lot less weirdness.\n\nBout all I can think of for the moment. I'll update if I think of anything else.

Every creature fits a role and they all have different synergies with one another. For example I had a creature which inflicted high stacks of \"frost\" on a creature. I then had another creature which speacialised in doing extra damage to enemies based on the amount of \"frost\" stacks they had on them. I constantly wanted to try out different synergies and the game kept providing unique combos and movesets. There are also additional mechanics you unlock through the game which add even more layers to the combat.\n\nThis game does unfortunately have some flaws though, particularly towards the late game.

At the beginning of the game, I thought I was in for a rather quick experience (10-15 hours) without too much depth. But as the game unfolded and new areas became available, you find yourself in a well-developed RPG with loads of replayability.\n\nIn fact, after you finish the final \"story\" mission, you will look at your map completion and realize you're missing an entire new area that has not been available until you get skills from monsters you only recently gotten.\n\nIf there is one negative I have, it's that the difficulty ramps up too slowly. For most of the game, you can survive without needing to think about synergies and how the buff/debuff system works. As long as you have monsters that can counter your enemies' weaknesses, you can largely succeed up to the very final few \"story\" fights. However, those last few fights really require a team with more thought about how the buff/debuff systems work and being intentional with the weapons, items, and food you give to your monsters.\n\nI was able to get through the final fight after several hours trying new combinations, but I felt frustrated that many of the strategies that had been so successful failed at the very end. \n\nOne additional side note is that the rarer achievements (especially with the champion fights) really require specific setups. [spoiler]There is a guide of one team that is particularly effective for most post-game fights here in Steam, even though it states it is outdated.[/spoiler] I think if you had a lot of time to play around with different styles of gameplay (and by a lot of time, I mean 50-100+ hours), then it could be a fun puzzle to solve. However, I felt like I had already put in the time I wanted to in this game and opted to seek out the best setups possible to get these final achievements.\n\nDespite these qualms, I really did enjoy playing this game and plan on recommending it personally to several friends I know would enjoy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1675543074, "timestamp_updated": 1675543074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132159753": {"recommendationid": "132159753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198858237487", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2192, "last_played": 1675481156}, "language": "english", "review": "I like these monsters.", "timestamp_created": 1675476322, "timestamp_updated": 1675476322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132138402": {"recommendationid": "132138402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072346824", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2438, "last_played": 1686276704}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminded me how I love the Pokemon turn-base that much.

It was surprisingly entertaining. Take a classic NES Legend of Zelda, throw in some old gen Pokemon and that pretty much describes Monster Sanctuary. \n\nStory- Very simple, quick fantasy story with interesting lore. Perfect story for speed runs. Emotional moments between characters are rare. Some character development for a select few. Pretty generic RPG characters. Expanding the story would not have hurt however the story presented feels mostly complete. In the end, it feels like there could/should be a MS2 around the corner. The history/lore is a fascinating start for what could be expanded on in many different ways.\n\nGraphics- Great work for the low bit level. And who doesn't love a 2D pixel game. The classic side scrolling style made it feel reminiscent old-school LOZ. While the battles are similar to old gen pokemon battles with more a bit action/movement. The attack graphics are mostly layered color tones dependent on the element of the monster. The monsters themselves are fantastic! They look awesome during battle and one can follow you while you run around the beautiful 2D map. \n\nGameplay- Not open an world map. Areas are cut off until certain story requirements are met. Lots of hidden doors/caves cover the map. The map itself could have had a few more sections but the diversity of those sections in the game remind me of Subnautica. The battles are where the real fun is. With a litany of monsters to build teams from, its easy to make several team builds with only 6 monsters. The monsters have individual skilltrees you earn points for as the monster levels up. Some have heaing, some have attack, and some defense based trees with MOST monsters having a mix of all three. Battles are teams of 3X3 and effect each other WAY more than pokemon. Easy interface during battle.\n\nLots of things I loved about this game.  I personally enjoy RPG strategy games that allow battle monsters to support each other. The cool monsters and the genuinely fun gameplay make it very re-playable. The only complaint is that there should have been more story and an expanded map.", "timestamp_created": 1675424398, "timestamp_updated": 1675424398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132090360": {"recommendationid": "132090360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305630457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5424, "last_played": 1685394392}, "language": "english", "review": "This brought me back to the days of SNES and pokemon.

Combine that with different monster variants that provide different benefits, and skill tree options, and the number of potential teams you can build is immense.

Run around, collect monsters, beat champions/NPCs, unlock new areas, rinse & repeat.\n\nPlatforming: Mostly easy, with lots of locked/secret areas. Different monster abilities  required to get 100% chests/secrets/areas\nStory: It's a story, simple but functional. I think there is potential for a more story-focused title in this universe, but I feel that this particular game is mainly focused on the mechanics and worldbuilding.\nMap exploration: oh god where is the one map tile i haven't found\nPvP: Haven't tried it, but likely to get roflstomped by people who built good teams.\n\nCore Mechanics:\nParty of 6 monsters, only 3 of which can be out at a time. You pick their skills and items (and can change them). Straightforward and easy to learn, with a crapton of options/builds/setups.\nYou fight monsters 3 at a time, NPCs 3 at a time with a total of 6, and champion monsters 1 to 3 at a time.\nCollect monsters by fighting them and hoping for an egg (open inventory, hatch egg, voila). Or get lucky with rewawrd boxes (random eggs/items).\nMonsters provide overworld exploration abilities such as Mount/Fly/Light/Claws/Tackle, etc etc. Some are rarer than others, some direct improvements to others, some hardlock world areas without them (swimming). The more the merrier.\n\nReplayability: Absolutely. You can play with whatever monsters you want, some are weak and some are strong but all are viable to beat the game with. Included challenge modes and difficulty options allow significant challenge. Nuzlocke + random monsters + permadeath are included options, and the hard difficulty is unforgiving without a NG+ save file. Speaking of, NG+ allows to use existing save file, saving items and resetting monsters.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I had a lot of fun (and frustration at times) and I hope to see more DLC (last one was included free in base game). \n\nCons: There's only around 110 monsters, which isn't a con, I just wish there was more.

Monster Sanctuary is so much different from pokemon, monsters can have more than 4 abilities to use at any given time, they can be built with skills to play certain playstyles, and be equipped with accessories/weapons to play certain ways as well. The combinations of teams you can build are endless and you're not discouraged from trying different things out since resetting skills is affordable to do and there's no grind mid to late game for levels on monsters, when you want a monster to be close to your highest level monster in levels just get a monster egg and hatch it.

The monsters all have fun designs and the fundamental gameplay is pretty engaging (I generally don't enjoy turn based party combat.)  The exploration and team building are also enjoyable and I encountered no bugs or technical issues.  With that said, some fights get annoying or drag on a bit, even with the built in system to prevent that.  Regardless, I certainly got my money's worth out of it and feel comfortable recommending it.\n\nFor context, I approached the game (on normal difficulty) by making one generalist team to handle every challenge without using consumables.  This was doable, and I'm glad I didn't have to build separate teams for each champion or keeper duels (essentially two variations of boss battles).  That said, I put a lot of thought into my team's skill trees to have answers for most weaknesses, damage types, and especially debuffs.  I also didn't like keeper duels enough to do the post game duels or several of the side objective duels and I only got 5 star ratings on a handful of champions.

Platform games are not my thing so I didn't know if this would be for me but I wasn't bothered too much here as it's not hard nor frustrating. It is actually well done, with a nice progression based on abilities from monsters you gradually unlock. The creatures and areas at first generic and uninspired get better the more you advance, some are really nice. Music stands out as quite charming. The combat system is solid and deep, with tons of possibilites, and feel gratifying. A lot of items to get and upgrade to fit your monsters and build. There is no unnecessary tedium, it is made so you can just play straight, no need to go back and heal or recharge. Your new creatures start close to your max level, no grinding, very pleasant. Good value for the money.\nMy main issue is that this game is visual cancer. I don't get that trend of pixel art, or basically gameboy graphics.

Es un criador de monstruos sobre todo, pero mezclado con metroidvania y jrpg. La dificultad dir\u00eda q es casi perfecta, los combates contra \"salvajes\" son muy asequibles y te dan cosas muy buenas dependiendo de lo bien q lo hagas (lo poco q tardas en matarlos y el da\u00f1o q recibas, basicamente); y luego los jefes se podr\u00eda decir q son lo justo de dif\u00edciles. De duraci\u00f3n bien, yo me lo empec\u00e9 dos veces por tenerlo en dos plataformas diferentes y aun no acab\u00e9 la historia.

Y mi parte favorita, la personalizaci\u00f3n de los bichos q usas. No es ni infinita como en algunos juegos RPG modernos, ni es tan pobre q no te da opci\u00f3n a explorar diferentes versiones de tu equipo. Simplificandolo un poco, cada bicho se especializa en un apartado, defensa, ataque, magia etc, pero cambiando las habilidades q aprende puedes convertir un mago glass canon en un support q cure o que meta debuffos al equipo enemigo.

This is not an easy game. By the end of the game, you cannot have a level advantage; your ability to win depends entirely on your ability to make a team that functions well. \n2. The strongest team composition strategies are chance-based, so get ready to brute force some fights in your lucky slippers with a rabbit's foot in one hand and your lucky Bible in the other.\n3.  The metroid-vania aspect of gating through monster abilities is a little tedious and unnecessary. I love the animations but organizing your active monster once you've got an enormous library of monsters is cumbersome. \n\nTHE PROS: \n1. Strong aesthetic style\n2. Great music\n3. Option to scale all monsters with your level for more challenge\n4. Endgame challenges present significant difficulty\n5. No limit on monsters in inventory\n6. No limit on items; you can farm as many as you want of every item with enough patience/knowledge\n7. Exceptionally deep and versatile skill system (I spent a couple hours learning skill trees to build teams)\n8. 101 monster types, a few evolutions but each \"unevolved\" form is potentially just as viable. Every monster is a viable member of a strong team. \n9. New game+ options\n10. Various costumes\n11. ~50 hours to complete all achievements\n\nTHE MEDIOCRE: \n1. Story isn't anything impressive, but still better than pokemon. \n2. Game at max speed is fine, could be better with a faster option. \n\nAgain, very charming game, made with a ton of love.

Each monster has their own skill tree and with a fairly common item, you can reset it at any time to find the most optimal build. There are 6 monsters in your active team but you have an unlimited (dynamically changing) inventory of monsters with you at all times so you can swap to any team outside of battle whenever you please. This is made even better with the ability to save and load teams. And if you thought the game couldn't add more complexity for team building, later on you have the ability to \"shift\" light/dark alignments, and each one gives your monster a different ability and stats. So yeah, there is a lot to this game.\n\nI just finished the game + the free DLC, and I love this game enough that I've been writing team synergies on an excel sheet. If you love monster capturing games, then this is definitely for you. The artwork is also great. I love the detailing on each monster, each with their own ability you can use in the overworld.\n\nStory-wise, I would say it's kinda mediocre, however, gameplay-wise there is a lot of content and many secrets that are not part of the story to discover. I've had to run back to places I've been to before because I obviously missed something and I need to figure out how to get from Point A to Point B.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the enemies will scale with you as you progress through the game (and there's also an option to keep EVERY enemy scaled and not just the new ones you encounter) because any enemies in any new map tile you explore, will be around or at the level of your strongest monster, which just reinforces the idea that you need to really strategize and not just mindless mash A. If you find yourself repeatedly dying from enemies or bosses, regroup and redo your skill trees - buffs and debuffs go a long way.\n\nAdditionally (because of course there's even more), New Games have new modes now for even more challenges. There's even a permadeath mode which I feel would be great for pokemon nuzlocke players lol\n\nAnyway, highly recommend this game.

Si mi opini\u00f3n cambiara, m\u00e1s adelante actualizar\u00e9 la cr\u00edtica, pero dudo que suceda.\n\nEste juego es una interesante combinaci\u00f3n de g\u00e9neros. Es un plataformas en 2d donde distintas \u00e1reas pueden desbloquearse conforme progresas y quedan para siempre abiertas para que las visites en algo que se parece un poco a un mundo abierto (en realidad no lo es, vas desbloque\u00e1ndolo luego no es abierto). El sistema de combate consiste en un rpg por turnos enga\u00f1osamente sencillo, en realidad tiene bastante profundidad jugable. B\u00e1sicamente vas por el mundo derrotando monstruos para conseguir sus huevos, con los que obtienes inmediatamente cr\u00edas de dichos monstruos y puedes reclutarlos para formar equipos de 6 que luchan en combates de 3 vs 3. \n\nSi has jugado pok\u00e9mon pero lo encuentras excesivamente simple, esto es justo lo que necesitas. No es tan simple como plantar un monstruo de un tipo que te de ventaja, ya que casi siempre implica tambi\u00e9n vulnerabilidades. Y el rol de los bufos y debufos es clave y otorga un dinamismo estrat\u00e9gico al juego que encuentro genial. Los monstruos est\u00e1n preparados para cumplir los roles fundamentales como tanque, o sweeper, con multitud de habilidades especiales, t\u00e9cnicas y recursos. No aprenden una lista de ataques (que tambi\u00e9n), tambi\u00e9n adquieren habilidades pasivas, tienen \u00e1rboles de skills para ello, y hasta puedes equiparles armas y accesorios.\n\nLos monstruos tambi\u00e9n pueden evolucionar, pero no os explico c\u00f3mo. Ya lo descubrir\u00e9is, es curioso.\n\nTiene toda la pinta de que los desarrolladores de este juego, igual que muchos de nosotros, no entend\u00edan la reticencia de Nintendo a desplegar todas las posibilidades del concepto base de pok\u00e9mon, y con un presupuesto peque\u00f1o y un poco de pixel art, han logrado m\u00e1s que Gamefreak en los \u00faltimos 10 a\u00f1os. El gameplay es m\u00e1s interesante, adictivo y desafiante, el lore es llamativo y lo m\u00e1s importante de todo, EXISTENTE. Y tiene modo pvp, aunque a\u00fan no lo he probado.\n\nA ver, seamos realistas. Dado el presupuesto, esto es un peque\u00f1o juego indie. No tendr\u00e1 tantos monstruos como pok\u00e9mon ni de lejos, seguramente gente con poca experiencia escribiendo habr\u00e1 terminado de redactar una historia que oler\u00e1 a fanfic por todos lados y probablemente podr\u00edamos hablar todo el d\u00eda de todo lo que se puede mejorar.\n\nPero esto lo compr\u00e1is por 5 o 10 euros (yo lo cog\u00ed por 2 euros) y con pok\u00e9mon ten\u00e9is que pagar 50 o 60 euros por productos inacabados e incompletos de una compa\u00f1\u00eda que detesta a cada uno de sus jugadores y que seguramente escupa en cada cartucho que venden (y s\u00f3lo voy medio en broma). \n\nAs\u00ed que... S\u00ed. Recomiendo bastante Monster Sanctuary. \n\n[h1] Un peque\u00f1o rpg 2d por turnos con tintes de metroidvania que mejora la f\u00f3rmula de pok\u00e9mon en los aspectos m\u00e1s fundamentales y crea algo con personalidad propia.

Music was mostly fitting and didn't feel intrusive. Minus half point due to no songs being particularly memorable.\n\nStory (6.5)\nThis is just put together enough to be called a solid story with no weird continuity errors. \n[spoiler]\nIt is pretty generic overall and doesn't do a great job of playing with the concepts introduced. The bad guys are barely given a motivation to be bad and the villain is a literal demon lord brainwashing them. There is a weird moment of them introducing a Dark/Light mode half way in that is never really explained properly or ever really acknowledged again. If redone the dark/light theme should probably be mentioned in the first 3 areas and have a positive or negative inflection placed on it for this section to make sense.\n[/spoiler]\n\nGame play (8.5)\n-.5 slightly grindy, -.5 minor unrewarded play time, -.5 creativity inhibitors\nPart 1 battling\nVery solid Monster RPG battler that encourages synergy and thought in team building and didn't feel particularly unfair at any point. This game is punishing if you are unfamiliar with RPG synergy set ups, but is very easily beatable with almost any team with 2-3 tanks/heal tanks on it. The main issues I have are that if you are constantly given a stream of monster and trying to get them to level up to try new team combos is a bit of a pain this could have been circumvented by just having the player gain xp then have the monsters just have skill points equal to your level. Additionally, the moves and items feel a little on the generic side which is semi-forgivable due to the size of the game but does mean that a lot of monsters feel samey until about level 20 at which point you have mostly picked favorites and don\u2019t want to grind up older monsters unless you are a big numbers fan. My biggest gripe with the gameplay is the battle tower bosses as if you are trying to get that 5-star egg drop you can waste literal hours trying to get a perfect score and not get any gold, xp or items to show for it.\n\nPart 2 platforming\nVery solid I never got stuck or locked out anywhere and the timer puzzles were incredibly tight on timing. This did however did lead to me attempting to beat timers that were unbeatable without a mount resulting in about 30-45 minutes of trying to beat timers.\n\nPart 3 Metroidvania\nWhile cool in theory using monster abilities for exploring was often a little confusing on which monster I needed to grab to get through a certain puzzle. While this didn\u2019t block story progress as you only need 2 abilities to beat the game it did making exploring less fun. I would recommend either replacing this mechanic with tools received from bosses rather than trying to grind for a specific type of fish egg.

I think it is safe to say that I am addicted to this game. Anyway, I bought this game because I wanted a different experience when it came to the monster taming genre. I was promised a fantasy world where humans and monsters live together within a safe haven from the \"Old World.\" This haven is the Monster Sanctuary, and among the people there are Keepers simultaneously training and preserving the well-being of Monsters. I like this idea as somebody who really loves animals and fantasy creatures.\n\nThe game has a beautifully rendered pixel style reminiscent of the 16-bit era, brought to life with fluid animations and wonderful music. The battles that take place throughout the game follow old-style RPGs by playing out certain animations without visibly making contact, and instead rely on special effects to show actions. The game appears to have a clear artistic style that is handled with great care.\n\nA major part of this game is its world building. A lot of effort seemed to have been put on to making the world of Monster Sanctuary as believable and interesting as possible. Despite playing for so long, I have not read that many entries in the Monster Journal. I hope to truly appreciate the work everyone did for the world this game takes place in soon enough.\n\nAs for the gameplay, Monster Sanctuary is a monster taming RPG with elements of a \"Metroidvania,\" as it is marketed as. There are a bunch of secrets to discover thanks to the help of the Monsters you tame, and you are free to go anywhere you please, so long as you have the abilities. One is free to take on the Sun Palace before even setting foot into the Stronghold Dungeon. The map is filled with secrets that can only be accessed by certain abilities, so those looking to explore every nook and cranny would be happy to know that you can mark places with labels on your map. This was really handy for me.\n\nThe other half of the gameplay is the battling, whether they be against a team of wild Monsters or against another Monster Keeper. Battles start out pretty simple, but later on it can get super complex. The bread and butter of the battles is that they take on a 3-vs-3 turn-based format where every action of one Monster makes the action of the next Monster in order stronger. Applying buffs, healing, shielding and using moves that hit multiple times first is key to delivering devastating blows at the end of your turn to your opponents. There are also debuffs, stacks, auras, and other things that will require you to strategize every battle. Furthermore, the game encourages you to execute battles as efficiently as possible, giving you a rating that influences the loot and money you receive, including Monster eggs to hatch and experiment with on your team. There is never a dull moment in this department.\n\nI'll be honest, the amount of skills and the synergy between your Monsters that you should consider can get very overwhelming. I myself have never really played games that used skill trees to such a degree before. All the RPGs I played before usually had party members with jobs and equipment that influenced what they could do, and the skill trees (plus feeding) add a layer of depth to the gameplay. There will be moments where you will need to stop and go over your Monsters' capabilities. For those used to the laid-back nature of Pok\u00e9mon (another monster taming RPG that you've probably heard of), you will need to use your brain a lot more, even during the main story. I could see this turning off some people, but for others it yields great satisfaction for understanding and mastering the mechanics.\n\nEven when you're done with the main story, there is still so much to do: battle stronger Champion Monsters, explore hidden worlds, complete the Monster Journal, face off against 20+ Legendary Keepers, and even try your hand at online PvP. As someone driven to 100%'ing the games I play, this game has so much content that will keep me busy. And this game is at least one-third of the price of AAA games (including Pok\u00e9mon)!\n\nOverall, I am proud to join the Monster Sanctuary. I love exploring new worlds and unlocking the potential of my Monster comrades. I love the presentation and style, and the oodles of content will certainly keep me busy for 70 more hours.

Using the monsters you get along the way to explore and unlock the secrets of the Sanctuary.\nPros of the game\n- While there is a place to store monsters, you can carry a large number with you\n- Teams can be saved and loaded any time outside of combat\n- You can talk to your first monster to basically get \"help\"\n- While monsters don't level up in the reserves, there's items that give them a free level up to your highest level monster\n- Knocked out monsters still get experience (take notes pokemon)\n- Battles can be avoided or repeated with a monster ability or item respectively\n- Bosses can be fought again in the same run to get rewards you may have missed\n- The different ecosystems make it feel a bit like a metroidvania than a monster collection game\n- Tutorial isn't heavy handed\n- No permanent penalty for messing up other than try again (fits to the game's relaxed tone)\n- Monster abilities are varied as the monsters for interacting with the world \n\nCons of the game\n- Keeper Battles can catch off guard if you skip the tutorial.\n- Enemy teams are always in teams of 3 (except bosses) which can make the early game challenging if you don't take advantage of weaknesses.\n- Filling out the full map is challenging, since no monster can point out breakable walls (some of the walls don't look cracked)\n- Forgotten Realms 'story' without giving spoilers, feels incomplete (at the time of this review)\n\nThere's lots more that could go into this, but avoiding spoilers I will recommend this game highly with 5/5.\nAnd if you can get it on sell, go ahead if you have something to spare. Since the world is fairly open, its not a hard game to pick up and put down. Whether its exploring or building an unstoppable team, there's a little something for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1671746096, "timestamp_updated": 1671746096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

After defeating really powerful boss monsters in the world, you can return back to base to battle them again at any time. Each battle is scored and graded based on different metrics, and higher grade means better rewards, so more likely to drop an egg. Getting max grade when battling boss monsters is also the only way to acquire eggs of them.\n\nBattles are done in groups of up to three monsters on each side. You can walk around with up to six monsters in your party, three being the active ones that are sent into battle, and one designated as following you around.

Somehow, they pulled it off successfully and everything works very well. All of the combat is in environment and you can see (and dodge) your enemies before encounters. While the turn-based combat can be slow at times, there's options to speed up animations and 3v3 means combat rounds are never long anyway. I never found the game tedious because each biome required different approaches to combat; I often found myself swapping in new party members every few hours or returning to old creatures when tough fights demanded it. The game slowly introduced new game systems and concepts that kept surprising me; you rarely get stereotypical \"key for a door\" abilities and most of your environmental skills are from your monsters. There's a wide range of combat abilities, buffs, debuffs, support skills, and synergies with passives. In fact, there's a bit too much synergy a lot of the time... \n\nThe combat system's flaws become apparent about halfway through the game: any RPG, eastern or western (that I've played at least) will have most buffs and debuffs fall off after a few turns or when they reach a damage threshold. Oddly, there are no time limits on anything here so you can endlessly stack status effects. The more synergistic monsters will not only allow multiple stacks of the same status effect, but can apply multiple buffs or debuffs with the same action in a turn. By the end of the game, you and your opponents will start the battle with a host of status effects before the first turn because of passive abilities. Every fight becomes a race to strip, steal, and dispel enemy buffs while stacking enough debuffs to passively kill your opponents. The last boss was a huge pain who I found even more difficult than the optional bosses I had fought before him. Adding to this fact is that max level is 42 and experience beyond that gets poured into level up consumables means you can't just grind to finish the game like most JRPGs expect you to.\n\nThe narrowness of the combat is my only main complaint about this game though. Everything else, from the music, art style, level design, and character customization are all very good. I had a really good time playing most of this game but it got surprisingly difficult near the end. It's a bit odd tonally because the simplistic, predictable story seems to be written for children and yet the gameplay is the probably the sweatiest, neckbeardiest JRPG combat I've ever played. This is the best Metroidvania I've played in a long time... However, I'm giving it a recommendation only on the condition that you realize this game is huge and very challenging.

Monster Sanctuary takes place in a world where that is a legal and a respectable way of living, only that instead of chickens it\u2019s mouthless, bipedal, one-eyed beast that sets things on fire with its mind.\n\nMonster Sanctuary feels like a grown up Pokemon. Specially now that Pokemon has become so bloated and un-innovative. \n\nThis is one of my favorite games. Saved me when I was in a huge depression after finding out my wife had a new boyfriend. Pok\u00e9mon was like that for my wife & I once. We\u2019ve been through the most horrific amount of stress/depression/anxiety in this last couple of years. Life has been unbearable. Monster Sanctuary was a ray of light and such a wonderful distraction. I honestly don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be without it. \n\nIt's absolutely perfect for disenfranchised Pokemon fans like myself. It scratches the same itch as a monster trainer, but with an unbelievable amount of thought and care put into it by the developers. Tying the typical metroidvania upgrades to the monsters you catch is such a natural fit I can't believe it hasn't been done before. The strategy is a perfect balance of being easy enough for casual players, but having an insane cap for anyone who wants to minmax.\n\nIt's not often you find a game that is SO good with such little fanfare. Monster Sanctuary is close to one of my favourite games of the genre, it's a fun mix of Metroidvania-style platforming and monster collecting and battling like Pokemon. \n\nBut calling it Pokemon-like its unfair. The combat is nuanced and framed around team building. In three-on-three battles, particularly towards the end game, you frankly will not win without thinking about your tactics and your team. \n\nAnd there's not one tactic that is objectively better than the other, whether you like to buff, debuff, stack, brute force, shut down teams with defense, there are so many options to succeed and it depends on your playthrough.\n\nPerhaps my favourite aspect of Monster Sanctuary is that every monster in the game is viable. Even the Monsters you pick up in the first area can take you through to the end of the game. It's all about how you use their unique set of skills to your advantage.\n\nThe game is challenging, particularly the end game and post-game, but you can adjust the difficulty settings depending on how you like to enjoy games. \n\nI cannot recommend this game more highly. The devs are all lovely and very active in the community. Selfishly, I want this game to become wildly popular so that we get a sequel in the future, but also because I think anyone who picks this really well balanced game up will enjoy it, particularly Pokemon fans, RPG fans, Metroidvania fans, and more. If this game sounds remotely interesting to you, buy it. It's one of the best value games for it's price.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1669488633, "timestamp_updated": 1669488633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756772160530090332", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127077891": {"recommendationid": "127077891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019646250", "num_games_owned": 1063, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3547, "last_played": 1669487187}, "language": "english", "review": "This game tries to take a step further from Pokemon's battle system, but doesn't come close.

Adem\u00e1s visualmente me gustaba much\u00edsimo, as\u00ed que me met\u00ed de lleno a probarlo. Adem\u00e1s con el tiempo han ido a\u00f1adiendo mejoras, tanto visuales como de contenido, cosa que me alegr\u00f3 todav\u00eda mucho m\u00e1s. \n\nEn el juego encarnas a una especie de entrenador de monstruos en el que deber\u00e1s viajar por todo el santuario derrotando a campeones con tu familiar espectral y con los dem\u00e1s monstruos que puedes ir reclutando y entrenando (resumido as\u00ed para evitar spoilers). \n\nHay muchas facilidades para hacer equipos a tu gusto y no te preocupes, que se pueden ir adaptando a tu nivel (tanto para enfrentarte a ellos como para reclutar a nuevos, cosa que se agradece mucho).  Tambi\u00e9n puedes personalizar a tu personaje y adem\u00e1s todas las criaturas tienen \u201chabilidades de exploraci\u00f3n\u201d, que te permitir\u00e1 acceder a nuevos lugares o abrir nuevos caminos. Adem\u00e1s puedes obtener recompensas y objetos de muchas partes diferentes. \n\nCompletar el mapa me es una sensaci\u00f3n muy agradable y me gusta personalmente tenerlo siempre completo, rinc\u00f3n por rinc\u00f3n (la comunidad y la wiki tambi\u00e9n te van a ayudar mucho si te pierdes o buscas algo en concreto que no encuentras). Cada zona es \u00fanica, con su est\u00e9tica y su complejidad e incluso sus puzles y jefes (la mayor\u00eda \u201ccampeones\u201d, que son monstruos a los que te puedes enfrentar de forma adicional m\u00e1s veces, y dependiendo de la puntuaci\u00f3n, hasta los puedes reclutar). \n\nNo he probado el multijugador (no soy muy \u201cdel competitivo\u201d), as\u00ed que en esa parte no puedo dar mi opini\u00f3n, pero si los combates con entrenadores del propio juego me han parecido epicardos, para enfrentarte a otros jugadores debe ser una prueba a\u00fan m\u00e1s dura.\n\nAdem\u00e1s los dise\u00f1os de los monstruos a mi me han encantado casi todos. Tienes una enciclopedia para conocer incluso su lore (una pok\u00e9dex muy \u00fatil), a algunos los puedes evolucionar\u2026 y a todos los puedes transformar en su versi\u00f3n de luz y oscuridad, que adem\u00e1s de variar su aspecto, les aporta una pasiva especial. Tienen los monstruos \u00e1rboles de habilidades bastante extensos, pudiendo hacer locuras de combinaciones o llevar un equipo con 2 monstruos iguales en apariencia, pero centr\u00e1ndose en roles totalmente distintos. Con esto quiero decir que puedes personalizar tu equipo como mejor te convenga y como mejor te guste jugar. Los l\u00edmites los pones t\u00fa. \n\nSe puede jugar muy c\u00f3modamente con mando e incluso con teclado, aunque obviamente es m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo el mando, pero si no tienes (como mi caso, se fastidi\u00f3 el que usaba y a\u00fan no he podido hacerme con otro) no te va a suponer ning\u00fan problema. \n\nSi te gusta Pok\u00e9mon y te gustan los plataformas/metroidvanias, esta combinaci\u00f3n te va a encantar.", "timestamp_created": 1669312407, "timestamp_updated": 1669312407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126589546": {"recommendationid": "126589546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255642313", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1669354565}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, reminds me of the good ol days playing Pok\u00e9mon on my DS back in elementary school.

A simple team of blobs could still utterly destroy an endgame comp if built correctly.\n\nThe world building is unique in its own way as well. The story doesn't feel overly cliched and is enough to stir the curiosity of lore hungry players like me. The different biomes are simple but interesting with its own touch of medieval steampunk-ish background. Each monster have their own background stories that you could read if you are interested in the lore. For classical exploration rpg fans, the map has a lot of hidden secrets to be discovered in which some could not be accessed early on but need to be retraced. Even if you did miss out on those secrets, it wouldn't make a huge impact on the experience as most of the secrets are either extra gold, materials or special items that could at most provide a small boost to your team. \n\nDon't forget to mention the music/soundtrack is nice and brings a good atmospheric touch to the environment as well as battles. \n\nOverall I'd give this game a solid 9/10 as I am no heavy critic. If you are a fan of pixelated monster collector rpg games like me, I'd definitely recommend you to give this a try.", "timestamp_created": 1668315291, "timestamp_updated": 1668315291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125277424": {"recommendationid": "125277424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040736202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3453, "last_played": 1668365563}, "language": "english", "review": "9.5/10, super satisfying and highly recommended for RPG lovers.\n\nSomeone amazing introduced me to the game and asked if they could watch me play.

The basic gameplay is good, the main story took just the right amount of time, the writing is decent, and the monsters design is really good -- some of these things are down-right adorable, while others are, well, pretty damned cool.  (Favorites of mine have included the Spectral Wolf, Tar Blob, Ninki Nanka, Nightwing, and Krakaturtle)\n\nCombat works more like a traditional RPG than a Pokemon game, which threw me a bit, but I think ends up being better.  At any time, you have six active monsters; when you start combat, you pick a team of 3.  They generally fall into one or more traditional RPG roles, based on how you build them: you've got your physical damage, magic damage, healing, buffing, and barriers.  (Most monsters can potentially perform more than one role, depending on how they're built.)  You've also got items (which give larger bonuses but are rarer) and food (which gives smaller bonuses).  Each monster has four skill trees, and the build-space is fairly complex; some monsters I've found good builds with, some I've found great builds with, and some I'm still working on.\n\nWhen you're not fighting monster battles, the game is a platformer.  As platformers go, it's fairly conventional, but it's not bad.  While you're going through the world, you can pick one of your monsters to follow you; it will give you a special ability.  These abilities do a lot of the things that unlocked items would do in other platformers: some monsters will lift you, some will let you swim, some you can ride, some will give you a \"ghost form\" that lets you bypass fights, some will let you burn vines or break walls, and so on.\n\nOn the whole, the difficulty level is right where I want it to be.  The monster fights are tough enough that you'll sometimes lose, but they're not impossible or unreasonable.  There are a few boss fights that have thrown me for a loop, but I've managed to get through just about all of them.  The platforming is honestly fairly unchallenging, but I'm OK with that -- not every game needs to be Celeste.\n\nThe \"quality of life\" is also very high.  You can cary as many of your monsters with you as you want -- there's a nursery where you can leave them, but you don't have to, and there's no limit to the number of monsters you can have with you at a time; you can pick any monster to follow you at any time; you can swap monsters into your team at any time; you don't carry damage or conditions from battle to battle; and they start every battle at full mana, so they never run out of \"PP\".  The biggest things you have to return to town for are changing your outfit, buying more consumables, and upgrading weapons and items.\n\nThe game also has PvP, but I have not tried it.\n\nMy current team is a rainbow-blob, a magically-levitating turtle with a volcano on it's back, and a rainbow-bird.

That is roughly what Monster Sanctuary is.\n\nYou collect, level up, evolve and battle (in 3v3 or 6v6 duel formats) with monsters. However, the overworld plays like a 2D metroidvania with environmental hazards, platforming, secrets, etc. There are also weapons and accessories to collect and upgrade as well as skill trees unique to each monster. All this variety gives a lot of freedom to switch around teams to use and counter different strategies your enemy might use. All in all it is a really satisfying blend of both genres.\n\nI would describe the story, music, and graphics as good enough. They did not have anything that stood out to me but they were enjoyable. The game's main plot had a conclusive end but leaves a very clear path to a sequel.\n\nOne other thing worth pointing out is that the game has a lot of player friendly gameplay mechanics which I really appreciated. For example, even though only your active party (6) gains experience, there are items you can buy or get as drops or rewards which let you level up monsters. Once a monster hits the level cap (42 at the time of writing this review) it continues gaining experience and each \"level up\" grants one of these items to level up another monster. There are various other examples of similar design choices that seem minor but allow players to have fun with the game's mechanics as opposed to worrying about farming or grinding in order to fully make use of them.\n\nOverall: it's a solid, fun game, especially for any fan of Pokemon or metroidvanias!", "timestamp_created": 1667191628, "timestamp_updated": 1667191628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500757217407226563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124693803": {"recommendationid": "124693803", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970861139", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 3771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1442, "last_played": 1674722873}, "language": "english", "review": "The metroidvania aspect is limited to exploration and platforming.

If either sounds like your kind of game, pick this up.\n\nAs for things I like about the game:\n+ All monsters are viable throughout the game. There are certainly some monsters that are better in that they are flexible with whoever you chose but any monster can work with the right combination.\n+ The systems are straight-forward and easy to figure out. While this game throws a lot of information at you with skill trees for each monster, equipment, food bonuses, and the shifting system, it's actually pretty easy to learn and understand how it works. And it's easy to correct your mistakes as respec options are easy to come by. Plus, there are some good in-depth guides and people posting to help you out.\n+ Being a Metroidvania, the monsters you use will help open up new paths for you as time goes on. It does get a little annoying when you want to find that one exploration ability but if you were a fan of the Pokemon following you while running around the world, that's the added bonus.\n+ There is a built-in Nuzlocke and Randomizer mode. Haven't tried it but it's cool that it's there.\n\nThings I'm netural on:\n~ The story. It's not on the level of games like The Witcher 3 or Chrono Trigger but I really enjoyed a lot of the lore that was uncovered as I played through the game. It's got as much depth as a kids cartoon but it's well-written and the characters do have some depth. Its one of those \"take it or leave it\" situations.\n~ PvP. Didn't touch it so I don't know how active it is nor can I really comment on it.\n\nThings that I see people getting annoyed with:\n- Backtracking. You are going to be doing a LOT of backtracking particularly if you are going for the 100% of the map achievement. It isn't bad but it can get tedious.\n- Pokemon vets are gonna get annoyed that you aren't going to one-shot the monsters. While there is a type-weakness mechanic, you aren't going to be obliterating monsters unless you are overleveled.\n\nAt the end of the day, I would recommend this at full price.

This is my favorite Turn-Based Tactic game and creature collector. Not easy though unless you have a good comp. Preparing for battles is very important.

This game has a unique skill tree for EVERY monster and each monster has over 40 skills (active abilities and passives) which you can select. Then account for the fact that you can deploy 3 monsters at once (6 in a team), there is a lot of different combinations. This is definitely something to keep in mind if you are getting stumped on a champion or keeper battle, because changing your strategy can be difference between being utterly destroyed in a battle or annihilating an enemy (also it helps to keep your monsters on the same level or higher than your opponent and making sure you have appropriate items  for you monsters that are upgraded as much as you can).\n\nThere is a lot to do in this game. There are over 40 champion monsters (which are basically bosses), all of which you can gain for yourself (though with reduced stats, they are often the most powerful monsters in the game).

The world is fleshed out and the lore depth is decent, especially for an indie game.\n\nYou could say that some of my problems stem from my casual play style, never playing more than a few hours a week; I ended up spending some time to refamiliarize myself with the game after starting again.  This wouldn't be much of a problem if there was some sort of quest log, or at least something that points to my current objective. At the current point where I am in the game, to figure out what I'm supposed to do entails just running around the map trying to find rooms I haven't explored yet.  As stated in some of the other reviews, there's a lot of rooms that are puzzles and/or require a certain monster type to be able to pass through.\n\nAlong the same lines as my previous point, the amount of monsters that you have at your disposal grows pretty quickly. At my current progression through the game, I have a hard time putting together a team to progress, nor do I have any idea if the current 'boss' I'm attempting to clear is the one I should be going for.  For all I know, I could be endlessly running face first into a wall that will never budge.  Again, this could be because I don't play frequently enough to remember the everything from the story, but my team can mop the floor with certain monsters, but get absolutely wrecked in a couple turns by others and no amount of tweaking team members seems to bring a good balance.

I never really could get into turn based combat. But this game, holy shit, this game man. You turn up combat to 2x and you treat this game like a speedrun and you got yourself a slay the spire meets Digimon experience. This game is straight up top notch 10/10 indie badassary that is a jewel in a desert. I rarely give games such high praise, but this game really is impressive.\n\nLet me first start with the strategy. You have 3 monsters you can use in combat, each with a literal tree of unique abilities. With their own weaknesses, strengths, attacks, and stats. Even a simple Slime can be useful in this game. \n\nThis isnt a grind if you don't make it a grind, you can walk through the game with a selection of monsters that you choose from and you can totally switch these monsters up as you go along. 3 monsters can fight but you can have 6 monsters to choose from which to fight, all with their own synergies. All gathering experience equally. On top of that you can farm for eggs if you want to get a specific monster you came across and it will be the same level as your other monsters.\n\nThere is a level sync across the game as well. So each map will have equally leveled monsters. Each map with its own elements. First map is water/earth. Second is water/fire, and so on. With its own methods of buffing, debuffing, and passives. One map you may be really strong in while another you may be incredibly weak in. Along the way you may have to change tactics if you made poor decisions, but if you have any common sense you can easily grind for eggs for a few hours, and rebuild your entire team from scratch with your own selection of monsters you choose.\n\nThe story doesn't make me cringe, it isn't something out of some children's book like most games like this is. The story is actually pretty decent, but I wouldn't say this games story is the highlight. There is a monster encyclopedia and its very interesting to read. \n\nThe balance is top knotch. Definitely some things need nerfs but only a few I've come across. Not enough for me to say its broken. I'm already almost on the 4th map. I am not sure how many maps there are or how long the game is but I definitely plan to beat it and update the review later. \n\nI do spend time thinking about what to do and if you don't seriously stop and think for half an hour how to construct and skill out your team, you will encounter barriers. I almost encountered a few with some debuffing teams. If you aren't careful you can easily wind up having to grind, so use your brain and think before you do something.\n\nDo I recommend this game? YES. I got it on sale but if I knew it was this good or even watched videos on it, id have bought it full price.\n\nMy only request to the devs is make another one, I don't care if its the same concept.

Well, here it's entirely possible to beat the final boss with the very first blob you've hatched in the tutorial [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2874678373](proof)[/url]. In fact, I'd say that every single monster is viable - as long as you play into its strengths. No need to worry about IV, EV, no endless grinding; just team building and strategy.\n\nThe game almost feels more like Monster Train than Pokemon; it's less about having the perfect monster with just the right moves and exploiting weaknesses - rather, it's about creating those cascading synergies of destruction which hopefully will end your opponent before they end you. Yes, exploiting weaknesses is a thing here as well, but it's just one piece of the strategic puzzle - one that sometimes is better discarded in favour of a more synergic course of action.\n\nAlas, this is also something that can be seen by many as bad; You see, for a big chunk of the game you can get away with playing Monster Sanctuary as if it was Pokemon. Buffs, debuffs and synergies are just nice-to-haves, but we know it's all about that \"super effective\" raw crit damage. Right? Well, at a certain moment - which, sadly, is in the final stretch of the game - you're being told: Stop. You're playing the game wrong. Here's an opponent that actually uses buffs and debuffs strategically, and they will [i]decimate[/i] you if you don't have a properly built team. If you explore a lot, you'll probably run into one of the super champions before then - and they'll teach you this lesson a little earlier; but you'll still have to get down to it, read the skill descriptions and make a team that's got good synergy.\n\nThat said, the team building is as streamlined as possible. Each monster has 3-5 separate skill trees which usually focus on different possible roles; you can immediately see all of them and plan ahead. You can also very easily respec your monster, or hatch a new one which will be only slightly behind your strongest level. And no worries; you can save teams for later use - and there's more slots than you can possibly need.\n\nThere's a lot more to say about the battles, but enough is enough. You get the idea. It's great, and generally grindless. Let's talk about the aesthetic for a bit.\n\nIt looks great, that's plain to see. Every monster is fully animated - walking, jumping, attacking. And the monster compendium has wonderful, detailed pictures of each and every single monster. On a Cute/Cool scale, they tend to fall towards Cute, but that doesn't prevent many of them from being cool as well. Areas are varied and each of them has their own unique feel, even if from a pure level design perspective they're more or less the same. \n\nAnd the music? It's a bit of a mixed bag in my opinion. Some early game pieces feel... I don't know, uninspired? But as you keep going, the music gets better and better, all the way to the end. One piece in particular has a very specific feel - it's meticulously made to sound like it's from Terranigma, an old SNES classic which happens to be a favourite of mine. It's so spot on that I refuse to believe it's a coincidence - and why would it be? Monster Sanctuary is a German game, and the biggest fan community of Terranigma is also in Germany.\n\nThe story is also a little weird. There's nothing wrong with it per se - I enjoyed it, and there's a lot of interesting lore everywhere. Something about the way the characters speak is... unusual. And the story itself is very plain, not many twists and no real structure... in a way, it feels less like a story and more like something that's actually happening. That's a good thing? Maybe? Unusual, like I said.\n\nAll in all, the game is fantastic. I enjoyed it greatly, and towards the end I simply couldn't put it down. I'd even go so far to call this game a masterwork - at least as far as its general design and individual systems are concerned. If we lived in a fair, meritocratic world, Monster Sanctuary would be death knell of Pokemon; kids would wear Blob backpacks to school and we'd have a Hollywood release of Detective Catzerker. Instead we live in a world ruled by marketing budgets and trend-driven design; luckily, you can escape this world at least a little bit and play Monster Sanctuary.\n\nAnd remember, love your Blobs, and they will love you back!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1665684970, "timestamp_updated": 1665732953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724219977855682373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123755365": {"recommendationid": "123755365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048189799", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1030, "last_played": 1683992030}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego, tal vez corta un poco la acci\u00f3n las batallas por turnos al principio, pero te puedes acostumbrar", "timestamp_created": 1665635704, "timestamp_updated": 1665635704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123754239": {"recommendationid": "123754239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028228592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3027, "last_played": 1685250674}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good\n", "timestamp_created": 1665633095, "timestamp_updated": 1665633095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500757217407226563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123749239": {"recommendationid": "123749239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284900417", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 811, "last_played": 1667415456}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Fun Pokemon like Game with a Metroidvania Twist!", "timestamp_created": 1665622273, "timestamp_updated": 1665622273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123746631": {"recommendationid": "123746631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073635047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1671185860}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy bonito RPG, sencillo y a la vez muy completo.

The people in charge of balancing the game deserve so much credit, I say this with full certainty, every single monster in this game can be the star of your team. From monsters found on the very first route to monsters that evolve into something else (monsters that evolve don't necessarily become better, they just gain access to different skill sets), there isn't a single monster that is a waste of a team slot. (Unlike where as in pokemon, you very rarely keep the beginning route pokes and you almost always hinder yourself by not evolving your mons).\n-Depth of Combat. Do you like the amount of strategy that goes on in competitive pokemon, but you get tired of the actual story being too easy, MS throws that right out the window. This game starts out easy enough so you can get used to the style and then consistently pumps out more and more depth that only ever add to the experience, yet never feel cluttered. \n-Difficulty. This game is significantly more difficult than any pokemon game, if you are looking for a more challenging yet rewarding experience, this is 100% your best bet.\n-Story. Creature Collectors that have an actual story besides, \"Get 8 badges, beat the elite four, and become the champion\" will always have my heart. This is a story that while not as impressive as titles outside of the genre, absolutely stands up to titles within the genre and kept me on my toes the first time around.\n-Non-Linear Progression. One of my favorite things that I've learned after playing through the game several times is that the you can pretty much choose how you want to progress through the middle section of the game. This game is split into various little regions that have a unique storytelling aspect, but all connect to a overarching story. One you get past the first area and start making your way into the second area, about 50% of the other regions open up, allowing you to take a non-linear progression through the map. The best part of this being that the regions will scale to your level. For instance, my first two runs I went through the Dungeon Area second and always had monsters level 6-10 there. However, recently I've been going to that area later in my playthroughs and I've been getting anywhere from 10-25 (depending on how late I get there). This really helps in making every run feel unique.\n\nCons:\n-This game infamously has a massive difficulty spike. Depending on what kind of team you're running you may experience it earlier or later, but all in all, there is a 90% chance that you will feel solid in your team, and then there will be fight that makes you re-plan your entire team. Now that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can be frustrating on a first-run through to hit that wall.\n-Reliance on Debuffs. This is another thing that may not be a negative thing for some, it might just be more different some similar creature collection games. From my experience, if you want long-term success in this game you have to base it around debuffs as you won't be able to do enough damage by pure damage alone. This is something that I initially disliked, but it has grown on me quite a bit...so there's that.\n\nTLDR: \nQ. Is this game worth $20?\nA. 1000% yes.

But nothing can beat catzerker in terms of destroying everything so far.\n\nLeveling your party is impossible, you are locked to some variation of 6 monsters. It made me not even hatch the champion monsters, because I know there is only one egg ever. \nIf I wanted to change my party and use a champion monster, I would rather hatch it later when I need it... or never at all. Hatching a monster makes it about the level of your party - 2.\n\nThe skill trees are really nice and so far I have not found a single \"full combo\" monster, but rather you have to take 2 for a good combination of skills. Like when you go for debuffs, you have one debuffer and one that makes debuffs stronger or stack higher.\n\nPersonally I feel like there sould be more monster keeper duels, because the wild monsters are just pure grind and 99% of the time pushovers.\nWhich brings up another point: Pacing.\nIt happens that you just rush into a chamption monster by accident, as it was a very unexpected one. Some fights have no buildup at all. And then there is the monologue of the bad guys, but you never know if there will be a fight or not.\nIt is not like you go into a gym and challenge the leader, it just randomly happens.\nSometimes you unlock stuff at the keepers home and sometimes not, but you never know why.\n\nSo what makes the game good?\nItem managment and equipment is done very well, you do find your special yellow marked item every one in a while and they have nice extra effects.\nSkill trees as mentioned before are very well balanced. They might be a big confusing at first, but you do know the skills soon enough. and you still have to figure out if your monster is a tank + healer, or tank + debuffer or whatever else.\nMost monsters can perfom several roles, or maybe when you get enough skillpoints it does not matter? I have not reached that far yet.\nAnimations are very cool and the combat speed is nice without having to press or read everything that just happened (Like in Siralim). Almost every attack has a different effect.\nEvery monster has a info and lore page with additional artwork, but it is done a lot better than in other games.\nMonsters are very pleasing in design.

A pixel art metroidvania with creature collector mechanics? I like a good creature collector but platformers and metroidvanias are not really my cup of tea. I Generally hate backtracking and especially in metroidvanias, trying to remember where that one place was that had the one thing i couldn't do at the time. Luckily for me though, this game is fantastic.\n\nThe Metroidvania stuff did kind of annoy me occasionally, however falling off a platform or hitting spikes or whatever was never much of a detriment as you just pop up on the last safe ground you were on with no repercussions, allowing you to retry as many times as you need to very quickly with no downside. The map also has a handy little marker you can set as well, so anytime i found something i couldn't do yet, i would just mark it on the map, label it what it was that was stopping me from going that way, and when i found the thing that let me pass it, it was easy enough to get back there and go do the thing.\n\nWhere this game REALLY hooked me though was the amazing creature collector side of the gameplay. There are SO many build options for your team and strategies you can do. And because your monsters have skill trees, you can even make multiple teams with the same monsters work completely differently. The synergies you could line up between your monsters attacks and even what position you placed them on your team could really make a difference. There is so much more to the strategy than just \"Hit the enemy with the element it's weak to\" that so many other creature collector games pretty much completely revolve around.\n\nSince you hatch new monsters just a couple levels below the level of the ones in your party, switching out your monsters and your team strategy was quick and easy and the game showers you with level badges that you can give to your underleveled monsters and get them to just one level below your team as well so even if you want to try out that one monster that you have had in your inventory for a while and neglected, it's a trivial matter to get them into fighting shape again and play around with your build. You can also carry ALL of your monsters with you at all times instead of having to go back to a PC or some stupid garbage to switch out your team. All these quality of life decisions just make experimentation and build testing that much more fun and doable.\n\nAll in all, this game hooked me so hard that even though i'm not typically the kind of person to replay games over and over again, I can't stop thinking about this game even after i have done everything.

There's no big expository dump at the beginning so it feels good to learn more, little by little, as you meet new characters and explore new areas.\n\nThe combat is turn based like Pokemon but feels MUCH more like a good card battle game than Pokemon's more basic combat. Each monster has their own skill trees with unique skills and you can customize them and your party around whatever strategies you want.\n\nSome monsters are great direct attackers, some spread debuffs, some make great tanks, while others excel at healing or shielding and clearing debuffs from your team. There are elemental resistances and weaknesses to exploit and lots of really cool interactions that really make it combat deep, interesting, and gratifying and it rewards thought and strategy.\n\nThey also released a massive expansion to the game for free recently choosing to allow people to tip the dev team if they liked it.

Even when Pok\u00e9mon products are regarded in utter disdain (Sword & Shield games) the franchise seemingly gets a pass with droves of children and adults willing to pay money over fist for whatever they can get with their outstretched sweaty palms full of money.\n\nMonster Sanctuary (MS) is a game that deserves the attention that that yellow electric mouse gets and more. Monster Sanctuary is worth your time, money and repays you in all the ways you'd want, then some.\n\n[h1]Longer Review[/h1]\n\nBattles are turn based like so many games in this genre but they're also considerably more complex than what you've likely experienced if your reference point is Pok\u00e9mon. Every monster in the game has a skill tree with 3 - 4 branching paths. The branching paths fall into offensive, defensive and support. Typically, each monster will have 2 or all 3 of these branching paths with several monsters being more particular/unique for example, Toxiquus (a seahorse looking monster) has a team buffing tree, a wind attacking combined with healing tree and two specific yet different poison trees. Once maxed level, you'll notice you haven't and cannot unlock everything in all the paths.\n\nThe item Skill Resetter which is insanely cheap and often found whilst exploring, can be used at any time on any monster to reset their skill trees. This allows you to respec whatever skills you'd like, allowing for lots of experimentation.\n\nOn top of this each monster has their own stats waiting to be manipulated. They can equip their own equipment (which can be upgraded), have food passives and a Light or Dark passive using a Shift Stone allowing for huge customization of playstyle. There're many Toxiquus but this one, Curly Bubble, is mine.\n\nEach monster naturally has their own strengths and weaknesses so, with all the above combined, it's correct to quickly assume that each monster has a lot going on. Now multiple all that by three and you have a single battle, multiple all of that by six and you have a team battle. That's 6 selected from a pool of 111 different monsters.\n\nOutside of all the tinkering and battling you'll be wanting to \"Catch 'Em All\" (the monsters). This is done via finding monsters when exploring the areas and simply battling them. If you perform well enough you'll be rewarded with a rating. If that rating is high enough, you'll get a monster egg to hatch. You'll be able to hunt down boss monsters and hidden monsters as well as your standard monsters.\n\nNewly hatched monsters are hatched at the same level as your current team meaning you don't have to grind away for hours leveling up a new monster only to find that it doesn't gel with you for whatever reason. Considering what I typed about respecing monsters, it's extremely clear that the devs want players to be able to experiment with a wide variety of monsters quickly and easily. They've definitely done that.\n\n[h1]Metroidvania[/h1]\n\nOutside of the \"monster trainer\" tag MS is played in a Metroidvania style world with running, jumping, pulling levers and acquiring double jump etc. MS adds to this gameplay style by finding a perfectly fitting way to customize the Metroidvania gameplay style to it's own theme. All the monsters that you've been collecting on your journey can also be used to navigate the environment. Found a ledge that you can't reach, perhaps your Vaero monster can help you reach it. Can't reach that treasure chest because of a diamond block, maybe Asura can help you out etc.\n\n[h1]Game Modes[/h1]\n\nEverything that I've typed so far is the core game. Outside all that there's also challenge duels, PVP with leaderboards, infinite battle mode and you can replay any boss monster battle until your heart is content. When you've finished the game to 100% (like myself) you can go for New Game + which allows you to keep your monsters, certain items and equipment. If that wasn't enough, additionally and optionally you can also turn on \"Nuzlocke\" style options when you start a new game having beaten it once or when you select New Game +.\n\n[h1]Last Thoughts[/h1]\n\nMS is a great game with loads of content. The game has become so popular in my home that we've also bought it on the Switch so that I and my son (or the Mrs) can play at the same time.\n\nI completely recommend this to everyone especially if you're jaded by the Pok\u00e9mon franchise. MS is a fantastic game that is truly as deep as you want to take it and worth every moment.", "timestamp_created": 1663379291, "timestamp_updated": 1664915382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738561630249023438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122346991": {"recommendationid": "122346991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801813103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1563, "last_played": 1664161207}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game.

Some of the most powerful combos aren't immediately obvious, and a lot of builds that sound good in theory can get you totally screwed, and you feel like you've wasted some investment in equipment, skill resetters, etc. The freedom to choose how you build is excellent, but the game does punish you for building poorly, even on the lower difficulty.\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\nThe game's difficulty seems to fluctuate wildly between bosses, optional content, and exploration. Some areas you'll breeze right on through, only to get absolutely stomped by the boss. Some areas, you'll just get stomped in the field, only to find that your team hard counters the boss.\n[spoiler]The keeper duels in particular can be a bit awful. The first one you're introduced to, against Will, is almost guaranteed to clap you, unless you happen to have the right build early on.

This is a great game. I found that the 3v3 battle structure made for much more interesting combat and strategy, which is sorely lacking in the broader genre. Each monster has its own individual skill trees which expand and unlock new synergies as you level, providing a nice learning curve as the game progressed. I thought I would be able to take my starting few monsters and power my way through the game, but I hit a significant wall and needed to revamp to take advantage of the synergies available and have a more balanced team. This is where the game truly shines.\n\nThe Metroidvania style exploration is interesting. It's not crucial to the game design by any means, but the developers melded monster monster collection with exploration, which was a nice touch. It relies a little more on the monster collection aspect than something like Pokemon, since certain monsters were necessary to open specific secrets, but the collection method is easier. There isn't any \"hunting for random encounters,\" as they are all structured, and actually obtaining monster eggs is somewhat straightforward. The puzzles themselves are simple and a little repetitive (mostly a series levers), but they don't feel cumbersome or frustrating, though there is definitely some room for improvement.\n\nWhile there is a lot of depth in team-building, there is little incentive to continually experiment, as building one strong team can easily carry you through the game (and even the higher level end-game content). I needed to only make one small adjustment for the most difficult encounters once I had a good team. With the amount of end-game challenges and how simple it is to build another team (as new monsters scaling in level with you), I would like to see more end-game content that relied on specific strategies or limited you to smaller monster pools in order to explore more of the depth in the game.\n\nThere's a lot of content here, and this is a very polished product.

The mixing of Gotta Catch 'em pokemon with the movement upgrades required to make the back tracking and exploration of Metroidvania rewards is fantastic and well done. 1000% more balanced than pokemon since every single monster is viable at all stages of the game. some are better than others obviously, but don't think you know just by looking.  (Blob and Magmapillar are legit top tier mons) and some monsters that aren't pitch hitters can be fantastic with the right team. I used Ucan (crab monster) for all of the hardest content in the game as 1 of my main damage carries and he is considered D or below tier so you legit don't have to worry. That doesn't mean it's easy either though, the monster are all just designed with a power floor that makes them useful, some just have higher ceilings. I also have to say that the BIGGEST PRO of this game is the QOL features this game has. I do not have a single complaint when it comes to, menus, movement controls, synergies, combat, leveling, collecting monsters, optimizing and experimenting with your monsters and teams. Mor Rai has cut out all of the pointless bloat to these feature and the game plays and feel rewarding at all times. All new monsters are guaranteed to just be 2 levels below the rest, you can carry and infinite number of monsters with you so you don't need to worry about changing monsters for battling or exploration, resetting skill trees can be done easily and infinitely, losing and dying has almost no punishment or inconvenience whatsoever so you can feel free to experiment or try again without stressing or losing progress, Map markers so you can save info for later when you have the right ability, the ability to speed up combat and other convenient features that just work. They preserved everything you like about both Genre's seamlessly while also trimming the fat.\n\nMy only cons to this game are:\nBarely a real Story \nUninteresting Characters\nSome Monster Names and designs\n\nThe Story is incredibly Simple and doesn't even really have a message or meaning just a vehicle to get you from point A to point B so you can catch more monsters and explore the map, (post game makes it more interesting but that's a low bar and leaves you expecting DLC, WHICH i can't wait for) and the characters aren't even really Archetypes, There are only 3 characters that can even claim to have personalities, Nerd guy, Pompous Prick, and Old man teacher guy and now you know everything you need to know about them. Every other character in the entire game exist to just tell you a hint to a secret or to go to a place to do a thing. Neither of these Genres really require either of these to big successful and they aren't going to stop me from loving this game, but there is obviously room for improvement here.\n\nThe last complaint is, of course, just personal opinion but Monster names like Rocky for a rock with legs, and Goblin Wizard for a goblin wizard just don't do it for me. i would say about 40% of the monsters need better names and maybe 10% would be better off removing. I don't like monsters that somehow hatch out of an Egg with a claymore in hand or a Barrel with wings and that's it. (Ornithopter, dumb name as well, is literally a barrel with wings, no face no mouth, nothing that even indicates it is anything more than a barrel some stapled cardboard to) I also don't like the goblins or steam golems just because they feel like... not monster but people if you know what i mean so it feels weird. I know part of this is bias off pokemon and digimon and this game is trying to be a classic RPG monster but even so that is my preference\n\nOverall this is an easy 9/10 game and i'll recommend to everyone i know.

The monster skill trees are interesting, and the platforming puzzles are generally (with a couple of exceptions here and there) challenging without being overly punishing. However, towards the end I started hating this game with a burning passion. A couple of battles just felt completely overpowered and unplayable unless you have a very specific counter team for it. Like, the team that has carried you through the whole game is suddenly totally helpless just for one fight. To me, this was bad enough to flip my review from positive to negative, precisely because all the positive aspects of the game build up this impression that you have so much freedom and agency to choose your team and playstyle, but in the end it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you in a very jarring and frustrating way, and the primary team comp you have put so much thought into putting together and refining suddenly becomes completely useless. \n\nMore specifically, I'd never had any problems with compulsory story battles up to that point, but in the late game against Zosimos, my strongest DPS with the right elemental advantage (and the stacking status afflictions to match) suddenly couldn't even damage the squishiest enemy monster enough to make even the slightest dent in the downright ridiculous amount of PASSIVE heals and shields. They literally healed to full, through both direct damage and damage over time, with a huge chunk of shield every single round while still using all three actions to attack, and there was nothing I could do at all. And that was with heals and shields being nerfed by a passive aura from another monster in my team. I don't see a point in there being so many monsters to choose from when some fights are completely untouchable unless you have a specific 'correct' lineup. It felt like my choices during the battle didn't make any difference at all; no matter what actions I chose and in what order I was doomed to lose miserably just because I don't have whichever specific monster that was supposed to be the 'right' answer. I'd be okay if this was for one of the optional champions (e.g. my team also couldn't do anything with the Ascendant, but I didn't mind just skipping that), but to lock main story content behind something like that is just needlessly frustrating.

Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t do a good job at giving you the right expectations to enjoy the challenging parts immediately.\nAt the start, the game teaches you, how the combat system works and then leaves you alone with your monsters and their skill trees, which I enjoyed a lot.

The same thing is true for new monsters, which have even more new abilities for you to get excited about.\nOf cause, this can\u2019t go on for ever, since there are only so many abilities. So strategy and challenge have to take over, but the way they did was not very enjoyable. It was basically one fight, which was a big difficulty spike. Of cause I thought a bit about my team before, but losing this fight multiple times (which there is no punishment for), while I beat everything before in the first few tries made me question, if my team was bad. Or maybe I was just getting unlucky, maybe my level was to low. I just didn\u2019t know and that didn\u2019t feel good. Through out the next fights I slowly got into the right mindset of expecting to lose the first attempts and using them to find out, what my opponents monsters are doing, so I knew what monsters to take out first etc. the next times. That way I was able to beat the later fights (exempt the finale) in 1-10 tries while being underleveled, so I don\u2019t thing the game is to difficult, the difficulty curve is just bad, but I can\u2019t think of a good way to fix it either, without having a bad new player experience.\nAn other weak point of the game are the characters and the world. Part of that could be, because I took a longer break from playing the game in the middle of the story, but the characters always felt a little flat to me and the areas didn\u2019t quite feel like a connected world and not very immersive. But that could also just be me. I don\u2019t know.\nIn any case, apart from those two issues the game is great. There are a lot of monsters, that all feel different and capable, a lot of interesting abilities to discover and use and only one music track, that in my opinion was not in between good and awesome. There is also a new game+, that I haven't tried yet, that even has a build in randomizer and perma death option, which they released in a free update, they definitely could have charged money for.\nSo, as I sad, if you are a Pokemon fan, I recommend you giving this a try. Just don\u2019t expect Pokemon levels of difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1662041013, "timestamp_updated": 1662041013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121570403": {"recommendationid": "121570403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067949760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1280, "last_played": 1662054528}, "language": "english", "review": "Dopemon", "timestamp_created": 1662036037, "timestamp_updated": 1662036037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121558055": {"recommendationid": "121558055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119217130", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1662231500}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10 muy adictivo.", "timestamp_created": 1662011407, "timestamp_updated": 1662011407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121557757": {"recommendationid": "121557757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198852363927", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 3211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 881, "last_played": 1696119456}, "language": "english", "review": "If Pokemon and Hollow Knight had a Dark Souls kid", "timestamp_created": 1662010662, "timestamp_updated": 1662010662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504161238670349121", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121552656": {"recommendationid": "121552656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198884689492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1384, "last_played": 1662054481}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty Great Game.

Some thoughts: \n\nPositives:\n+ Combat system was enjoyable and healing is not required after battle\n+ Most if not all monsters seemed viable and worth using\n+ Liked the design of a lot of monsters which made choosing a team fun\n+ Built in randomizer mode\n+ The wiki is filled out with a lot of information, if you do not mind using it as a source\n+ Easy-medium difficulty achievements. I got 100% in 40 hours, none of which I would consider hard are super grindy\n+ Game went on sale for a great price\n\nThings I did not particularly like:\n- Arguably only 1 good monster used for travel that is only accessible late game. \n- Useless / filler overworld abilities (not sure what levitating was even used for)\n- I really dislike when I cannot get every single skill upgrade but you end up getting most of them by max level\n- Having to use consumables to shift and reset skills.

Building a balanced team that provides a strong mix of utility, healing, durability, and damage output takes some finesse, but the process is fun all the way through. Thanks to new monsters you hatch always being within a few levels of your strongest creature, and a good supply of level up badges (this game's version of rare candy), it is relatively easy to try new monsters on your team. You can also save multiple teams and quickly switch between them (outside of combat of course).\n\nIn addition to having multiple build pathways, each creature can also equip a weapon and three accessories to further increase their stats and abilities. Equipment can be upgraded to enhance stat bonuses, and special rare equipment can have unique effects. I enjoyed how many paths one could feasibly take to reach success. I personally enjoyed emphasising burning away enemy buffs and stacking shields on my own team to keep a glass cannon alive and bombarding the enemy.\n\nWhat can sometimes put me off of metroidvania games is the feeling that I am constantly backtracking. I'm happy to say this is not generally an issue here. While I did find myself returning to previously explored areas a few times, it was usually relatively low hassle, and was seldom necessary. While some backtracking is required to progress, in most cases the reward for returning to previously explored areas is extra upgrade materials for your equipment, or occasionally finding some new monsters.\n\nI went into this expecting a reasonably quick game lasting between 20 and 30 hours, but I spent nearly 60 hours before completing the main story and hitting the end credits. I'm happy to share that I never felt like I had to grind, and naturally reached max level at the very end. There is a New Game+ option that I have not yet tried, and before I do there is still a significant amount of additional content to explore.\n\nThis game packs heaps into it.

I've already sunk several hours into this game and catching all the little monsters is really fun! There's a diverse set of skills and types so you can really mix up your team however you want. However, when I saw there was a frog as a starter choice, I knew I would be sold. \n\nMy only complaint is that the platforming can occasionally be pretty frustrating, but it's not terribly punishing most of the time and there have only been a few items I've had to leave behind. From an accessibility standpoint, this can make for a feeling of slow progress as timing jumps isn't always easy for disabled players, but I found I have been able to get through most areas without too much difficulty. \n\nI love the art and the creatures; you can tell a lot of love was put into their design. Being able to unlock different types makes it all the better, with different skillsets and colors to choose from! The game also does a good job of not dumping it all on you at once so you have time to learn the mechanics. \n\nCreatures also have other utilities on the map, like being able to solve puzzles, float the player or swim, and I found that made a lot of the platforming feel more fun and less like a slog through a level. Plus, it's really cute to see your little monster friend follow you around the map! \n\nWhile I can't say anything about the end game story, I like the one that's been presented so far. The game does a good job of making you feel connected to the world and invested in what happens to the monsters and the keep, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes! \n\nI think this game is polished enough to warrant full price, it seems very reasonable for the amount of content and I think it's very promising that the devs seem committed to releasing free DLC so as to keep the PVP aspect of the game (which seems entirely optional) balanced and fun for all players.

This ain't a world of one-shots; some of these battles are fought via attrition. It's a game of buffs, debuffs, DoTs, shields, heals, and cleanses. Raw damage has its place as well, but it takes a proper team setup to be effective. When you hit a wall, and you will, the game encourages you to sort through those eggs you've been stockpiling this whole time and find a monster that can rise to the challenge for you. Every monster is designed to be viable in the right situation.\n\nMost battles are in the wild; fighting 3 monsters at a time with 3 of your own. However, as part of the main story and some end-game content, there are 6v6 battles against other 'keepers' (trainers). The 6v6 fights require you to have a proper line-up. Tanks, support, and DPS are all important factors in a well-oiled team. The AI opponents will have them, you're expected to as well. There are also boss battles, which aren't very hard, but 5-starring them certainly can be.\n\nThis game is challenging. There was a point while playing where I audibly said, \"this game sucks ass.\" It wasn't until I stopped acting like a gaming journalist and started acting like an adult human being that it clicked with me. By the end game, I was beating the \"Legendary Keepers\" with a total of ~10 different monsters, swapped in as needed based on enemy team comp. You really DO NOT need to Google guides to beat the 6v6 fights, but there is more trial and error than some people are willing to sit through; which is very understandable. My advice is to learn from the AI, their team comps and synergies.\n\nBiggest con for me is that dodge chance is extremely annoying, especially given how tanky some of the monsters can get. It's somewhat fair since the player has access to it as well, but the fights can feel like a slog at times when over half your damage is whiffed. Also, it feels like monsters should just hatch at the Avg team level, rather than 2-3 below your highest. There isn't a purpose for them not to, it frustrates people.\n\nOverall it's a pretty good game that served to scratch that creature-team-building itch.

Combining the elements of a metroidvania/RPG/roguelite, Monster Sanctuary proves to be quite an enjoyable experience, from start to finish. The game revolves out the world known as the 'Monster Sanctuary' where you fight, collect and uncover many secrets within the realm. You choose one from 4 different Spectral Familiars, all corresponding to one of the 4 different element: Water, Earth, Fire or Wind. every monster has a strength and weakness, strategising is the key to becoming a successful monster keeper.\n\nBuilding monsters comprise of various methods. Your main focus goes into the skill tree, which opens up 4 different paths to go down. They can range from offensive attacks (both physical and magical), support buffs, flat stat boosts, aura passives, additional hit perks and unique passives. Each monster is unique in the way they are built.\n\nEquipment is also another important factor, as they allow for mainly boosting the attack output, defensive potential, mana amount/regeneration or critical chance/damage. Feeding monsters is also important, while be it small, it makes for a good buff long term where you can feed them food to buff certain stats and they can be changed by feeding them again. Every design is very diverse and every monster has a paragraph explaining the background and history of that monster, which is a nice detail to learn how some monsters came to be. There are 111 monsters currently all with there unique playstyle, some are more viable than others but everything can be used. \n\nWorld design is also very impressive, such as the Sun Palace, Mystical Workshop and the newly added Forgotten World all housing monsters that suit the familiar environment. Lots of treasures to uncover and a few puzzles here and there but nothing too complex that cant be complete. Monsters also all have world abilitys which you will need to use in order to interact with new areas.  within each world, you will encounter champion monsters which are either previously fought monsters or something completely different. \n\nFinally, there is a lot of replayability, with the standard NG+ along with new editions like the bravery mode which limits your selection of random monster and challenges team building skills. Randomizer is as the name states and will have monsters spawn in different locations and then permadeath is similar to Nuzlocke from pokemon.

The fact you can carry dozens and dozens of monsters on you at once (as opposed to the usual 'party' concept of around 6 members at once) and make teams on the fly to fight with is great, as it saves unnecessary trips back to the 'daycare' area you unlock later in the game.\n\nThe longer you play the campaign, the more and more monsters you end up with in your party - juggling their abilities, synergies, pros, cons etc. - and this can be quite overwhelming at times.\n\nWhile this is more most likely down to my own skill, I will say that at the time of writing, I still haven't defeated one of the 'main' storyline bosses, due to it being such a (seemingly impossible) difficult fight. There are a few mechanics which don't make too much sense to me - such as only two of your monsters being able to move on the first turn of a boss battle, as opposed to all three of theirs (meaning they always start with an advantage, so in difficult boss battles you're on the losing foot instantly) - but certain bosses have predetermined synergies and upgrades applied to their monsters which make them [i]brutally[/i] difficult. For me, it went from a fun monster-collecting and party-building game to a frustrating back-and-forth of trial and error with different parties, items, armour, and above all - luck - to try and beat the final boss. However, the furthest I got was about halfway through his monsters, at which point the cumulative buffs he'd built up on his monsters make them practically immortal and nothing I could even make a dent on.\n\nI do have friends who have already beaten this boss battle and moved on however, but claim it's down to having a very specific party with very specific synergies - which to me sadly takes a lot of the magic away. If there's such a vast collection of monsters to collect and train, but then only one or two decently powerful combinations that can actually defeat a final boss, it feels the same as only being able to defeat the Elite Four in Pokemon with legendaries. If I want to try and beat Elite Four Aaron with three Dittos and an levelled up starter, I should be able to, however slim the odds.\n\nRegardless - combined with the free recently released DLC, I went back to the game and continued playing and exploring, and did still find it enjoyable despite not having completed the main storyline.\n\nIn short; Monster Sanctuary is a vast exploration and party-building game with tons of detailed skill trees, but some of the boss encounters seem far too difficult for the casual player.", "timestamp_created": 1659603701, "timestamp_updated": 1659603830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120024253": {"recommendationid": "120024253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010118974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3434, "last_played": 1659575561}, "language": "english", "review": "Combine Pok\u00e9mon with a Metroidvania, and you have this amazing game!", "timestamp_created": 1659575592, "timestamp_updated": 1659575592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120015491": {"recommendationid": "120015491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081611931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1498, "last_played": 1660778191}, "language": "english", "review": "such a fun and well designed game with way more tactical depth than I had expected. +2 thumbs up", "timestamp_created": 1659562503, "timestamp_updated": 1659562503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119925592": {"recommendationid": "119925592", "author": {"steamid": "76561199235992179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1674300223}, "language": "english", "review": "This game the beast game\n", "timestamp_created": 1659426825, "timestamp_updated": 1659426825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119924260": {"recommendationid": "119924260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198998013474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1217, "last_played": 1692040065}, "language": "english", "review": "Think Pokemon + Golden Sun + Metroid and you get this game\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1659424074, "timestamp_updated": 1659424074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119917263": {"recommendationid": "119917263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198993871114", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1659533860}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome :D I recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1659410514, "timestamp_updated": 1659410514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119916575": {"recommendationid": "119916575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255191141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1902, "last_played": 1621840907}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed playing this game.

The combat is the best monster tamer combat I have ever experienced. It starts out simple, early on you might think its just pokemon but triple battles, but it quickly spirals as you learn all the mechanics within skill trees, equipment, feeding, etc. It's also some of the most accessable. All monsters are usable and viable, its not about just finding the OP dragon pokemon, its about how your monsters synergize with each other. The exploration and story are servicable. The story starts out nonexistent but slowly builds up over time, its not crazy complex but it does its job. The exploration is metroid-like as previously stated, there are abilities you get from monsters that you use outside combat to solve puzzles and discover pathways, expect to travel back to early areas when you find some new ability that say lets you hover or double jump.\n\nAs for my critisicms, I only have a few. The combat can get overwhelming if you don't pay attention, and the game does have a few difficulty spikes that make sure you have a good team and aren't rushing past encounters, but I didn't mind this. My biggest critisicm is that a lot of areas feel overly paletty. What I mean is the areas often have a reused palette that is repeated for an area. There is very little distinguishing between rooms besides layout, which makes it hard  to know where you are without the map. There are exceptions and some areas look quite nice, but don't expect the life that you would find in say hollow knight\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1659058939, "timestamp_updated": 1659058939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119652595": {"recommendationid": "119652595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044229474", "num_games_owned": 3288, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1660157183}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Ok, For a castlevania / pokemon / final fantasy hybrid.", "timestamp_created": 1659028519, "timestamp_updated": 1659028519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578493416309356689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119623804": {"recommendationid": "119623804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035233570", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 187, "playtime_forever": 3301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1661747466}, "language": "english", "review": "I try to keep abrest of various Pokemon-Alikes on Steam, as a fan of the genre, and that's how I got recommended this one by a friend.

The games simplistic style and comparatively small monster count (111 at the time of writing this) betray it's complex but fun leveling and skill system. Because of this, the game can be VERY challenging, especially once you hit late game where if you don't know what you're doing you'll get your butt kicked by just about anything you bump into. However, this game does an excellent job of easing you into the different mechanics of the game, and by the time you reach the third or fourth area you should have a good grasp of how the game works if you have good reading comprehension, unlike me.\n\n        Now since this game is difficult, I've put a mini-guide below if you want it. However, if you do not, then all you'll need to take from me is that this game is VERY much worth $20 and I cannot recommend it enough, it's a good 30 hours of fun and I think most people will enjoy it, including you.\n\n        Each monster has its strengths, weaknesses, and one to three areas of profession; healer, support, tank, buffer, debuffer, and of course the magic/physical DPS, and its your job to balance them out and create teams that synergize with each other based on their passives, abilities, stats. And the cherry on top? If you ever make a mistake and put a skill point somewhere that you don't want that messes up your strategy, the game has you covered by giving you access to infinite skill reset items VERY early on in the game at the stronghold shop at the cost of a handful of gold, meaning if you wanted you could just mix and match skills till you can come up with an unstoppable monster child of death and destruction that even the gods themselves fear.\n\n        This game is VERY akin to Metroid in its platforming, and different monsters have different explore abilities. You'll want to keep tabs on which monster does what as the game doesn't tell you on their status screen, it only tells you when you try to switch your active explore monster. (A + D on Keyboard, L + R on Xbox controller) Another thing about exploring: The map. Or more specifically, the marker tool for that map (Spacebar for PC, A for controller) which allows you to keep notes on things you find but don't have access to, like elemental switches and unbreakable walls. If this was explained in game, then I either missed an NPC I didn't talk to or I wasn't paying attention in one of the cutscenes dialogues, which is unlikely but I've done dumber things. Its very important you keep tabs because these inaccessible spots lead to optional bosses, unique equipment, and items that can 'permanently' buff your monsters like rare food, or items that actually permanently upgrade your monsters like skill potions.\n\n        And that's it!

It looks beautiful and plays well. \n\nMonster Sanctuary mixes a more complex pokemon style battle system with side scrolling metroidvania exploration. One great QoL feature that was added to the game is the ability to place map markers and write descriptions for them, so you know where to return later once you found a monster that gives you the right ability to progress along a sidepath or access loot. \n\nThere are three difficulties, and I played on the medium one. There were only a few battles I straight up lost but plenty where I struggled. Towards the end when I was very well leveled, geared and also experienced I steamrolled even the harder side content (but I was never more than one or two mistakes or a terrible rng pattern away from losing). There are also optional modifiers like a randomizer or a \"soft\" hardcore mode (i.e. you can't use defeated monsters in combat again, but once your entire team is defeated the challenge deactivates.) if you're itching for a challenge.\n\nI would say the game isn't something for anyone who doesn't want to strategize at all. You have to create a team of six monsters, with three active at the same time. There are 111 monsters, most with 3 to 4 skill tress of 60 to 80 skills total, only a small fraction of which are straight stat increases. If any, there are only a few of these monsters that are only good at a single thing. And then there are things like gear, ultimates and shifts to consider. So, at the very least you'll have to build a functioning team, even on the easy difficulty.\n\nThe game's only weakness in my opinion comes from the story. It's very simplistic, though there are many little details hidden throughout the world and some of the characters have pretty interesting personalities (not you mom and dad).", "timestamp_created": 1658434856, "timestamp_updated": 1658434856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119212089": {"recommendationid": "119212089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451598365", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2041, "last_played": 1656376800}, "language": "english", "review": "I am still in the process of progression in this game.

It hits a lot of the nostalgic notes that recent pokemon remakes aim for, and it does it a lot better. If you strike out the more \"filler\" mons that gen 1 pokemon had, you've even got more monster diversity. Adding light metroidvania elements is a lot of fun, and encourages you to keep a relatively diverse group of monsters around, even if you aren't using all of them to fight.\n\nThe AI is much smarter than it is in a game like pokemon as well, which is always a good touch. The distinction between battles against champion monsters vs keeper duels also provides a nice contrast, giving you two different flavors of high-level play. The battle system looks simpler than pokemon, but in reality I'd say it's just easier to parse and easier to optimize. Depth-wise, what's really happening is that you're exchanging a prediction-oriented playstyle for a build-oriented playstyle, which suits me quite well on a personal level. Every monster is unique, and they all play a little bit differently and synchronize with their teammates a little bit differently.\n\nFinally, while I don't personally go in for the multiplayer matchmaking, it's important to note that there is a robust scene for it with a well-developed meta, and the devs are quite attentive to balance issues, both in terms of power and in terms of playstyle diversity. The post-release changes to how buffs work are a big example here; buffing-oriented teams on release tended to just spam as many copies of whatever buffs they had access to, where debuff teams were built to focus on different kinds of debuffs, all of which had slightly different effects. Since release, many of the new auras and other skills have focused on buffs in one way or another, with particular attention going to skills that add flavor to specific buffs along the lines of the skills that have done the same for debuffs since the early access period. The game's discord server is quite active and friendly, and I'd recommend joining it if you're interested in the multiplayer.", "timestamp_created": 1657292620, "timestamp_updated": 1657292620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118454089": {"recommendationid": "118454089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367334696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 7421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5271, "last_played": 1659040951}, "language": "english", "review": "Yo, this game seems simplistic and childish.

If you told me that this was a big budget Nintendo release from the 2011~2014 era of 3ds games, I would not bat an eye, and that is a compliment of very high praise. Fantastic job and very well executed. While the game is not perfect in some regards, (like showing the tower rise with each level pull while the the first section stays at the first, second at the second, instead of rising, with the top being filled in with the section below it), and not a lot of ways to help bring up the power of weaker, earlier game, evolutionless monsters in line with later game ones with better abilites, skill trees, and base stats, the variety as well as the genius of the shift system for further customization as well as the great diversity of accessories makes up for that in a big way. My only real gameplay complaint is that later game rare weapons like the restoring wand come unupgraded, meaning I have to invest thousands of gold to bring it up to a comparable level to weapons I'm already using, and that the price of materials and availability of gold is a little sparse. As someone who used no combat consumables, opting to sell them for gold, selling excess equipment and never buying food or non-rare equipment, I found myself at a gold deficit frequently while trying new accessories and rare weapons to experiment with.  Maybe gold sense could be a larger increase, as even with an aurumtail with those skills assigned, I still had to spend a couple hours grinding gold and selling items to buy the materials to upgrade all the different unique weapons and accessories to +4, as I am still unable to buy gold or rubies from the material shop even post credits.

It took me almost 60 hours to do almost everything the game has to offer (sans New Game+ and one cheevo). The story and most of the graphics are a plain ok, but everything else the game has it's really good. The battles are great, most monsters are useful for something or in certain comps. You can play the same monster in different ways through skill trees. It does take a while when you first start to have that really fun rush because of all the possibilities at your disposal. Initially, some monsters are too weak and you'll have to play a while to tame better ones. This is mostly because the equipment you'll get at the beginning won't be a lot of help, but the closer you get to the endgame the more possibilities you acquire. \n\nInitially I wasn't really into most of the monsters because of how plain and forgettable they seemed. Even the names for most are very uninspiring. But I mean I get it, making cool monster designs is a specialized skill, let alone naming them. I think they invested a lot in the gameplay and it really paid off. The learning curve for the battle system and the skills the game has is pretty steep in my opinion. There aren't a lot of elements for the weak vs strong mechanic, but there are different buffs, debuffs, passives involving both, critical and non-critical damage, neutral damage, etc. \n\nYou need to tame all monsters and make different comps to wrap your head around it (or use a guide). It's not like pokemon where it's easy to understand from early on that you'll do great with a team of spread out types and kinds of damage. Sometimes you'll think of a cool team idea and then implement it and fail miserably. But when it works it's way more fun than Pokemon.  To complete everything the game has to offer late game, you'll need more than one team comp. So for better and for worse, you'll have to let go of the idea of \"playing with your favorites\" in order to succeed, specially for the toughest challenges in the game. \n\nThe new DLC was great content through and through and it expands build possibilities with the new monsters, skill updates and many new weapons that were missing for certain builds. I love the sprite redesigns. They are finding a better, more memorable style with those. It also made the story more interesting in a short amount of time, making me want more DLCs in the future. I can only hope they release a large paid one with a lot of story development and more creatures. \n\n I'm glad I bought it and it's brought me many hours of fun.

The game, as I said before, feels inspired by Pok\u00e9mon but I think it goes the extra mile and it isn't a \"copy & paste\". The first thing you will notice is that all the battles you use 3 monsters, this makes SO much sense because this allows the player to build a party that have sinergy and each mon can play a different role in the combat. This is the reason why Pok\u00e9mon tournaments are 2v2 and not just 1v1 where you almost always avoid support or tank abilities in favor a damage ones. So... having 3 mons allows you to build a team, with different roles, but that its just half of the combat, the other half are the skills. The skills system is complex enough to make you feel that you are choosing how you want to build each mon, but it is simple to understand what each skill will do and how it will combine with each other. Each monster have between 3 and 5 skill tree to allocate points with different focuses (magic damage, physical damage, healing, shielding, buffing, debuffing, aoe, single target, etc etc etc).\n\nOk, so I've discussed how the \"JRPG part is\" but how about the Metroidvania or the story? First lets talk about the exploration and platforming part. This part is really straight foward, playing you will face obstacles where you will need to acquire one of two things: a new power up for the character (as double jumping) OR a new mon that has an explore ability that you need (flying, swimming, mounting, etc.). The latter is what I think makes this game excel without making a game changing innovation in the classic metroidvania formula, it just let you choose (and see in action) what monster of your collection you want to help you and in what scenario, I think that this makes so much sense and makes you feel more engage on the game.\n\nFinally, the story. I must say that it isn't a story that shake my world and will keep it in my mind forever. It's simple, but it fulfills it's role to push you through the game.\n\nI want to give a shout out to the art style that, although being simple, it's beautiful. I love pixel art. \nPSA: If you want to have a full image of the monster, remember to go to the monster journal.\n\n100% Recommended. You like Metroidvania? Go for it. You like Pok\u00e9mon-like games?

Monster Sanctuary does a great job combining and refining elements from other games, but doesn't stray too far from mechanics which have worked for other games in the past. I found myself impressed by the lack of weak aspects, from the visuals and music to the level and combat design, it all had a good level of polish.\n\nThe level design and platforming are reminiscent of older metroidvanias and felt natural to move around. The combat is surprisingly deep, and puts many other monster collecting games to shame. Each monster allows for multiple build types, and the game gives you plenty of opportunities to rethink your skill selection. Monster Sanctuary is harder than I expected, while not being overly punishing.\n\nIf I had to pick a weakness, the writing is standard JRPG writing.

I got to be part of the beta test, and the developers are very open to feedback and balancing changed recommended by the community. There are countless hours of debates and discussions about the balance. Especially for the upcoming DLC, there are no monsters that are unusable, and every individual monster or team has counter play.\n     The amount of things you can do when building a team or an individual monster is nuts. So many monsters can fit so many roles with so many different types of teams, even I with almost 800 hours haven't tried all the different types of teams you can build.\n     I actually think the difficulty in this game is a pro. After adding a casual mode, there should be no more complaints about it being too hard. Also there's many ways to make the game more difficult, even on top of just increasing the difficulty.\n     The art and music for the game are great. I know something like music and art are pretty subjective, but i personally like the art and music quite a bit. \n\nCons\n     If someone were to want to try PVP, they would run into a couple of roadblocks. The stars would have to align for someone to find a match in queue. not only that, but they would most likely get stomped. The only way to avoid this is though the discord, where you can find consistent matches to play and are able to discuss plenty about what you teams lacks and why you lost.\n     The early game is difficult for 2 reasons. 1, tutorials and dialogue in general is easily skipped and new players could easily get lost. 2, it can be very complicated to learn and understand everything at the start, and some battles at the start can be hard without either a good bit of time or someone you help you.\n     I'm a but hesitant to put the story as a con, because I think the story is alright. There were some nice twists and a satisfying ending, but I can see arguments for it being boring.\n\n\nOverall, I think that the cons are few and avoidable, and with this i cant stress enough how great the discord is for this game. The community is fantastic and super helpful, theres regular tournaments put on with people casting it and everything. \n\nTLDR\nSo many things to do with team building.\nvery balanced.\nnice art and music.\ncan be hard to start because its complicated\nAmazing discord and community", "timestamp_created": 1656562914, "timestamp_updated": 1656562914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613460242748260498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117888051": {"recommendationid": "117888051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147248236", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1816, "last_played": 1681041485}, "language": "english", "review": "gud gaem", "timestamp_created": 1656539401, "timestamp_updated": 1656539401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117886257": {"recommendationid": "117886257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156154221", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 586, "last_played": 1657562507}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of, if not THE, best monster collection games on the market.\n\nMonster Sanctuary manages to squeeze Pok\u00e9mon into a Metroidvania formula and it works unbelievably well.\n\nAll monsters are not only viable, but also very unique and useful in their own way.

I cant really concisely articulate just how incredible this game is.  This review is intended to be relatively comprehensive but I may miss a few things, and it is probably going to end up being a tad lengthy so please bare with me.\n\nPokemon, Metroid and Castlevania are all very important games that pioneered their genres, popularized them and helped to shape many modern games today . All 3 of these IPs have games that are considered so good that they are masterpieces that transcend time and can be enjoyed again and again regardless of age by incredibly large numbers of people.  Pokemon specifically is one of, if not the most valuable video game IP on the planet proving that the monster taming genre appeals to incredibly large numbers of people worldwide.  \n\nAll that, and yet, Monster Sanctuary has managed to eclipse Pokemon entirely in it's first entry, by taking the genre to the next level. This game takes everything you love about the best Pokemon games in that series and combines it with the main design elements that are core to the metroidvania genre. This fusion is, frankly, ingenious, and pulled off seamlessly.   Monster Sanctuary doesn't stop there though! \n\nThe monsters themselves are elevated above and beyond anything Pokemon has managed by giving them each multiple skill trees and monster  equipment, allowing you to build them in specific ways. Because of this, there is a huge emphasis on team building and strategy.  The strategy and team building elements are balanced to utter perfection. Every  single monster in the game is strong and viable. All the while, no one monster or strategy is without weakness so there is no \"best strategy\" or \"best monster\".  The shifting system (dark and light monsters) adds another layer of depth and complexity to the team building. Some monsters even evolve which alter their skill trees entirely. \n\nMonster sanctuary can be quite challenging at times, but never manages to feel unfair, or oppressive. These challenges encourage you to rethink your team and strategy and make diving deeper into the team building, skill trees, equipment and shifting systems in order to problem solve fun, rewarding, and addictive. \n\nYou can collect as many monsters as you want, and can choose one that will follow you on screen (swapping between them is simple and without restriction). Each of these monsters has abilities that will aid you in a variety of ways.  The level design is masterfully done (as it should be in any metroidvania game), encouraging you to go back to areas you could not fully explore before later on and rewarding you for doing so. There are plenty of secrets to look for and puzzles to solve (requiring varying degrees of brain power) The soundtrack is fantastic. Movement feels great.  The platforming has points where it might take a few attempts  to overcome, but doesn't ever feel unfair, or frustrating.  The story is fine. Simple, but well told, with plenty of room for expansion in future games.  The environments, graphics and animations are all beautifully done.  Multiplayer PvP is supported as well. \n\nIn closing I will say this: Monster Sanctuary is, without question, the strongest game in the monster taming genre  I have ever played and is one hell of a good metroidvania game too. It is one of the absolute greatest games that I have ever played, period.  I feel confident recommending this to absolutely everyone.  Buy it, support the game, and the developers so that we can hopefully get more Monster Sanctuary games in the future. I can think of no game more worthy of mass support than this one.", "timestamp_created": 1655522071, "timestamp_updated": 1655522217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749236643314361572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117148049": {"recommendationid": "117148049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047496173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8020, "last_played": 1657581566}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_created": 1655502431, "timestamp_updated": 1655502431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117105651": {"recommendationid": "117105651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137096822", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 3418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 737, "last_played": 1655920011}, "language": "english", "review": "Friendship with Pok\u00e9mon ended\n\nNow Monster Sanctuary is my best friend", "timestamp_created": 1655434860, "timestamp_updated": 1655434860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483705848455429077", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117096572": {"recommendationid": "117096572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271677197", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 664, "last_played": 1680146213}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game to play in short burst.", "timestamp_created": 1655418537, "timestamp_updated": 1655418537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117069516": {"recommendationid": "117069516", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067700841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2632, "last_played": 1657317942}, "language": "english", "review": "i enjoyed this game very much. the team compositions are hard to get a hang of at first, but are fun to experiment with. i cant wait for a sequel.\n", "timestamp_created": 1655382302, "timestamp_updated": 1655382302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117043618": {"recommendationid": "117043618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347807246", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1086, "last_played": 1672260968}, "language": "english", "review": "Monster Sanctuary is not a bad game, but it lacks a few things to make it a good game.

I'm constantly on the look out for monster collector games with more going for them than the incredibly stale Pokemon formula.  There's a lot of really decent ideas here.  Like the metroidvania mechanics where the different monsters in your collection have different abilities that help with exploration.\n\nThe biggest problem is when you have a game where you literally collect dozens of different playable characters players are going to want to try them and there are so many roadblocks to that in this game.  Only 6 of your characters collect XP at once.  The abilities are locked in when you acquire them and can only be reset with an expensive item discouraging experimentation.  I finally got to a point where the team I had assembled and spent a lot of time resetting skill points and leveling up just wasn't cutting it for a boss and gave up because I wasn't willing to spend more time and resources to adjust my team.\n\nThere are also certain innane quality of life decisions made that don't make any sense.  For example, the monsters evolve using various items you find as random drops and treasure items.  They don't tell you which monster they upgrade though.

There are 111 creatures each with dozens of skills, each has multiple slots for various items that can have effects pretty similar to skills yet doing different things, and each monster has multiple forms adding a special passive, and all of it comes down to a wide variety of effects, builds, and synergies, somehow balanced enough that basically any of these monsters are viable and reasonably balanced.\n\nOne thing to note, this isn't pokemon. Battles are longer, extremely different, you aren't limited to 4 different moves to choose from, and there is a heavy focus on synergies, team building, and strategy. Also a lot of long term planning.\n\nThe story itself isn't overly complicated, but I like it. It provides plenty of motives and reasons to fuel your journey, it has some mysteries both revealed and hidden as the story progresses, it makes sense, and it creates a nice sense of bitter-sweetness near the end. For elaboration on that, [spoiler] you achieve your goal, there is enough to feel like your side was in the right, but you can also understand the reasons for the other side's actions, and it is hard to hate or even fully disagree with them. It is the end to the story, but feels like true change and more stories still await.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I would call it a great game, a bit of a hidden gem, but I am going to make a list of pros and cons anyways.\n\nPros:\n*Good and atmospheric music\n*Excellent long-term planning if that is something you are fond of\n*Surprisingly well balanced\n*There is a very wide variety of potential builds that are all viable\n*Does a good job at introducing new mechanics or expanding on previous ones at good intervals that maintain a relatively constant set of progression\n*Nice lore and world-building\n*Pretty open, after the first couple of areas, things branch out pretty quickly and there are a lot of areas you can potentially go to. Even after you have completed an area, there are often different sections of it you can't initially access, and plenty of reasons to come back later.\n*Even though it was already a complete game, recently a new free DLC was added adding a lot of content. Pretty great so far.\n\nCons:\n*There are a lot of fights, and it can start feeling a bit tedious at some points\n*There are maybe 2-3 songs used for battles, only one for normal fights. This makes battle music somewhat disappointing compared to the various area themes.\n* From what I have heard, can have a fairly steep learning curve for a new player, though someone with some experience in these sorts of games can get a handle of things pretty quickly\n*If you don't like team-building and trying to build synergies, it is a pretty major part of the game.\n*Limited post-game at the moment. There are some pretty fun and challenging battles to complete, some final monsters to hunt down to complete your bestiary, options to re-battle some of the game's equivalent to bosses, a pretty good new game plus with a higher difficulty mode (which in a game like this, is less just beefing up stats, and more increasing the number of options, tools, and synergies available to enemies), but besides that it is mostly just challenges you make yourself.\n\nOverall, I would say it is one of the better games I have played in quite a while, and I had to spend a fair amount of time thinking to fill out that con list some more, as opposed to the pro list where I had little trouble thinking of new things to add. I would definitely recommend it for it's price tag, and especially if you can get it on sale. It beats out the vast majority of other $20 games you will find even without a sale though, and the free DLC coming up is probably only going to make it even better.\n\nEDIT: New free DLC arrived. Adds a lot of really fun monsters, an interesting new area with nice music, some fun fights, added some fun new skills and exploration abilities, the new modes are great, and so on. Plus, with the arrival of the new skills, they also went back and made adjustments to every monster in the game.

I was originally hesitant to buy because it looked too casual for me, and I wanted a challenge. And it is too easy. Far too easy. And then, without warning, too hard to bother with.\n\nIn Monster Sanctuary, you encounter two types of enemy teams. The vast majority are [i]contemptibly[/i] easy, even on \"Master\" difficulty. But periodically, and especially in the late game, the long yawn-inducing stretches of easy enemies are punctuated by enemies you will [i]not[/i] beat without assistance. Not unless you have a serious devotion to the game that I will never have.\n\nThere are over a hundred monsters to recruit, and you can make a team that gets you to the endgame using any you like, provided they're basically suited for the current situation. Use fire monsters against monsters weak to fire, for example. Or take more healing and debuff removal against poison monsters.\n\nHowever, getting through the content in this game is not thriving. The game pushes you hard to extreme min-maxing, punishing you heavily with fewer drops and monster recruits if you don't conduct your fights [i]just so[/i]. It doesn't matter if you win. You have to win quickly by exploiting weaknesses and by performing everything in the order they think you should. You can 1-shot the entire enemy team (I have done this) with the wrong damage type, and your performance will be rated subpar.\n\nBut no matter how carefully you perform the dance steps, the vast majority of monsters are utterly useless in the late game, particularly in the last half dozen fights or so. Of around 100 monsters, I got significant use out of fewer than 10, and most weren't even worth trying once. \n\nYou have two options if you want to complete the game. You can go watch YouTube videos that show you exactly the magic combination of monsters that will work, or you can devote yourself utterly to min-maxing and trial and error to see what apparently good combos actually work.\n\nYou can easily spend the same amount of time on the last 5% of the game as you did on the previous 95%, purely in grinding out levels so that you can test yet another combination on the endgame encounters. But I'm not into grinding. I do not enjoy going through 30-40 boring, easy combats to level a monster up to endgame status, upgrade its equipment, and find the consumables that add the final, essential abilities. But I do this so I can find out that the combo I envisioned isn't going to work. And I've done it at least a dozen times now, so my patience is at an end.\n\nIf this were a Souls-like, I could just practice and get better, memorize the fights, and use the high skill cap to my advantage. But here, it's about grinding out levels and items simply for another chance to throw spaghetti at the wall.\n\nPerhaps if the end of the game simply allowed you to use every monster at max level, and all available variants and equipment, this would be OK. But grind is never OK. I have things to attend to.\n\nIf you need evidence that this game turns into a pointless slog, just look at the global achievements. Over 90% of players haven't bothered to finish the game. \n\nI've abandoned Monster Sanctuary at the penultimate battle, and while it might have otherwise been a good game, it has greatly overstayed its welcome, and I'm glad to see the back of it.

This was not what I had expected at all. Just look at my playtime with this title. I even unlocked all the Steam achievements (which is actually doable here)!\n\nMonster Sanctuary is both a puzzle platformer and a turn-based combat strategy game. It also has a bit of a backstory which I thought was nice, cozy and - due to the bad guy characters and their motivations - also fit for an older audience.\n\nThe real meat of the game is of course the combat aspect. There are around a hundred different monsters for you to collect. A few can be evolved into different forms (rather simplistic though, you just need a special item). Each monster can also be of a light or dark variant. These variants change the coloration scheme of the monster and give it a strong special passive ability. Which turns your 100 monsters more or less into 200 monsters.\n\nThe monsters have a fixed stats growth and each has a specific skill tree where you can allocate a skill point for every gained level (40 is the max level). You can reset the skill tree at any time with a very common item. This also applies on a larger scale. Any monster can always be readjusted if you so desire (light to dark, etc.).\n\nSome monsters are very rare (meaning you only get 1 per playthrough unless you get lucky with reward boxes). The same also applies to special equipment items. Speaking of equipment, each item can be upgraded to +5 which greatly enhances its stats.\n\nAnd so on and so forth. Developing your monsters and teaming them up together to fighting other monster groups (or champions) is quite complex and opens up a huge amount of possible combinations. You can spend a lot of time here and this is one of the things that make Monster Sanctuary so much fun.\n\nBut the puzzles, the map secrets, the story and the minigames (like the infinity arena) make the game even better! After finishing the game you can even start over with a new game+ and keep all your current monsters (with a few special rules though). And that's actually a pretty great way to experience the game again with a fresh monster team.\n\nThere is so much more to say but I'll leave it at that.

A superb 3v3 monster raising game with a good metroidvania tacked on for traversal. Fully recommend, hope they make a sequel.\n\nThe best way to summarize Monster Sanctuary is to break it into its component parts. It is important to note though, every part of this game is well done. The story you can take or leave, its serviceable, but the amount of love and care put into descriptions of the monsters is enough to make up for it.\n\nMetroidvania: The traversal mechanics are simple enough, with the uniqueness of most of your actual unlocks are monsters themselves. Sometimes this does mean you need to get a monster ability to progress, and that requires a few fights, but this is minimal. You do get a double jump, but most of the standard new mechanics are monster based. A monster will break walls, allow a glide, swim, burn vines, etc. The only negative here is I wish you could mark areas, as when finishing things up I would forget where the new ability I got could be used in older areas.\n\nMonster Raising: Every monster has a skill tree. It isn't fully unique, a lot of skills are shared between monsters, but the exact layout and amount of abilities differs. There is enough difference and a hard cap on skill points that you could ostensibly build two monsters of the same type differently. In addition, there is gear, some with unique bonuses other than stats, and a later mechanic introduces a choice of two unique bonus options. Some of these are -major- and you build a team around them (Bleed stacks not going away for example, letting you stack up hundreds to slowly murder a defensive monster). Further in addition, if you make a mistake in a build, or want to change things out, there are items to reset skills, level up lower monsters and the like. I never felt like a bad choice locked me out of any potentials, and I could easily reconfigure my team. Lastly, every monster gets 1 of 3 unique 'ultimate' skills, which you can change between fights without an item. All of this adds up to a superb experience making unique teams and trying out new combinations.\n\nCombat: The 3v3 style, along with the raising detailed above, means that you have a lot of opportunity for fun combat challenges. Some fights will be against one huge monster that acts multiple times, but often you will be facing a team of three. If it is an opponent trainer, you will 6v6, with three out at a time. Buffs and debuffs are very important, and some monsters are entirely built around healing when buffing, getting free buffs, spreading debuffs, super-stacking them, etc. You also heal to full after every fight, but there is a grading system based on buff/debuffs, rounds taken, damage, how 'efficient' you are that makes you want to do every fight well. The higher the grade, the better chance of getting rare items (including eggs for monsters to raise).\n\nIn summary, an amazing game, fully worth 100%'ng, and doesn't deserve to be compared to Pokemon.

I personally use a wired XBOX 360 controller and haven't had issues. One POSSIBLE fix (shot in the dark here) is going into your Steam client's controller settings (In steam, go to top left corner \"settings\" / controller/ General controller settings) and looking for the \"XBOX Configuration Support\" check box. Try playing the game with this box checked / un-checked and report back if this works. Don't ask me the full technical details, but this particular setting can mess with various games and how they act with the controller.\"\n\nIn your case, just put whatever kind of controller that you're using.

Y no solo es que los lleves en una caja, es que sientes que te acompa\u00f1an, pues cada especie tiene unas habilidades que podr\u00e1s usar si lo tienes seleccionado como acompa\u00f1ante, para descubrir nuevos caminos, sortear obst\u00e1culos, resolver puzzles, o desplazarte en los distintos medios(tierra, agua y aire), y esto es algo que le aporta much\u00edsimo al juego, pues cada monstruo nuevo que consigues puede ayudarte a seguir avanzando, o a llegar a nuevas zonas.

Adem\u00e1s todo tiene una historia, una trama y unos NPCs que te dar\u00e1n misiones en forma de di\u00e1logo para ayudarte a avanzar de forma no lineal, pues podr\u00e1s elegir tu camino en todo momento, siempre que cuentes con los compa\u00f1eros con la habilidad necesaria. Hay bastantes misterios y algunas misiones secundarias por todo el mapa, adem\u00e1s de una base central donde podr\u00e1s encontrar varios personajes que te comerciar\u00e1n distintas cosas, y varios NPCs tanto nativos como que ir\u00e1s conociendo a medida que avances y que te ayudar\u00e1n en tu aventura.

This includes evolved monsters as they have completely different skills trees from their predecessors. Also, resetting skill trees was easy as it only cost a handful of money to buy a skill reset item and monsters seemed to semi-frequently drop them in the late game.\n[*] Skill trees were expansive and varying enough to where most monsters felt like they had multiple viable paths depending on what you wanted them to do. (Do I want monster X to be a tanky shielder/healer or a debuff/buffer? Maybe a mediocre mix of both?)\n[*] I felt that being able to shift monsters added a neat layer of added bonuses to double down on whatever decisions you made in the skill tree.\n[*] Puzzles and platforming were simple enough to where it never felt like it was impossible but varying enough to be enjoyable.\n[*] Storyline was enjoyable even if you could see a few things coming. I hope there's a sequel where you get to go to the main \"other\" place mentioned.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]\nWhat I felt could be better/minor improvement suggestions:\n[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] This is probably due to my lack of experience with metroidvanias, but certain obstacles can only be overcome with certain monster skills (not a problem). But sometimes you'll run into these obstacles early on and not get the respective monster until much later in the game (also not a problem). However, there is no way to mark the map or to tell where these areas were, aside from the noticeable dead-ends where there is clearly a door or partially explored region. So a lot of my time was spent backtracking through areas to be like.. \"Where could I use this monster again????\" and checking every map dead end or area where I thought I saw a treasure chest. This could be easily solved with a map marker for things like \"Big X Thing here\". But again, this might be part of the fun for some people, just not for me.\n[*] I wish there were more evolutions! This isn't so much a negative as something that could definitely be expanded upon, because honestly I love most of the evolutions that already do exist. Evolutions felt so cool and meaningful because you get an entirely new skill tree. But, unlike something like Pokemon where seemingly every pokemon can evolve, it only felt like a very select subset of monsters could actually evolve, though I'm sure this is also limited by the length of the game. Also you mostly (to my memory) only get the items necessary to evolve them once you've already encountered their evolved form, so there isn't very much surprise to it on what the monster will evolve into when you get an evolution item.\n[/list]\n\nHonestly I don't have a lot bad to say about the game. I found it pretty enjoyable for what it was. Some people were saying that you have to farm a lot but I never had to farm throughout the game and could just use level badges (gives +1 level like rare candy) whenever I needed to get a couple levels. The hardest part for me was just getting 5* on the main bosses because I'm not super creative when it comes to team comps and I didn't want to look anything up.", "timestamp_created": 1652066431, "timestamp_updated": 1652066431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115179731": {"recommendationid": "115179731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098540347", "num_games_owned": 649, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3337, "last_played": 1666280893}, "language": "english", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1652049446, "timestamp_updated": 1652049446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115168662": {"recommendationid": "115168662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074795151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5401, "last_played": 1685228438}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego Indie que esta a un nivel espectacular.

It took me a few hours to get into because it was too easy at first. My biggest problem with pokemon and why i can't enjoy it is because it's mind-numbingly easy. It doesn't take long for this game to pick up. I found myself dying consistently to bosses a few hours in and that's where this game starts to shine and stand out on its own. Don't be deceived by how it looks. This game has plenty of depth to it. Your strategy and team synergy is very important in this game. It makes you always think about your team makeup and how to improve it because you're constantly being challenged. Another bonus here is don't be afraid to change your monsters out or change the allocation of the skill points on them. The game makes it very easy to make these kind of changes so you can always try new things. i myself had three different team setups i would switch out depending on who/what i was fighting. \n\nIf i had to nitpick on anything i would say some puzzles were kind of annoying. I understand this game wanted to add metroidvania style gameplay and stuff but i thought that stuff was the weaker part of this game. I thoroughly enjoyed combat, but was annoyed when i ran into these brick walls of puzzles where i had to focus on doing that for 10-15 minutes. They're not long, but some puzzles seemed overly complex. I personally did not enjoy them because i was eager to get back to the combat and i'm not a huge fan of metroidvania mechanics anyway. You guys might differ here. \n\nAnother nitpick might be that i feel the base game is a little short. It just seemed like as my teams finally came together and my understanding of the game got to a good point, it was over. I got all the achievements in about 35 hours. You could definitely do it faster. I was a bit slow because i was just running around fighting things i didn't need to be fighting for a few hours. There is a new game +, a master mode, and the infinity arena to try out, but personally i would prefer the base game to be longer than to just repeat the same thing again. I'm not a huge fan of new game plus in general. Having said that there's plenty of replayability here. Going through new game plus doesn't sound completely terrible to me with this kind of game since you can try out new monsters and make new teams. There are 101 monsters so there's plenty of interesting teams you can make.\n\nOverall, It's definitely worth a buy. This is a great game that's definitely worth your time.

I like the former better, but I also like to get lost in skilltrees, combining creatures, and equip them with stuff that makes them stronger. This game is seriously good, I like it a lot. I don't really go for achievements with steam games, but I unlocked all 34, just for fun. Even if you go through the vast map and storyline, the game still proveides things to do.\nThere are many pros:\n- I love the pixelart, the animations are not many in frames or types, but the existing ones are made well.\n- Many retro tunes to listen to\n- The monsters are cool as hell, some are cute, or funny, some are noble and majestic, some are terifying and horrendous. And there are a LOT of them. You can modify them to light or dark, (upgrades to base stats, and a new skill) tripling the creature number. Some even can be evolved to a new monster.\n- Interestingly both the platforming and the tactical battling made really well (with small hickups).\n- The metroidvania part include the monsters too: all creatures have an ability that helps in exploring and progressing on the map.\n- Worms!\n\nThere are some cons:\n- The map is not a big help, it's very basic, not giving any information whatsoever (no ability gates, not even the area names).\n- If you look for a specific thing (a monster, a crafting material etc) it could take a long time to find it.\n- To max out everything, you probably have to look for some guides as I did. Some secrets are hard to find (wich is fine, I just mentioning what I used some guides to), most of the champions are hard to defeat to 5 stars. Some of the puzzles are hard to solve (the timered ones especially). To find and build a team for defeating a specific champion could take a long time, as they probably need some equipment you don't have, and maxed out. And the skilltrees, as I mentioned I love to mess around with them, I'm just not good at it. :)\n\nBut, despite the cons there is so much to love, this game is worth it's cost, and if you are on a budget, wait for a sale, and then buy it, you won't be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1651616691, "timestamp_updated": 1651616691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114904954": {"recommendationid": "114904954", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975113400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 397, "last_played": 1651612761}, "language": "english", "review": "The level design is really disrespectful.

The abilities you get are pretty bland, such as [spoiler]double jump, hover, morph ball, swim..[/spoiler].  It's sort of a mix of Metroidvania and Pokemon in a sense.  When you encounter enemies, you go into an RPG-style monster battle.  Sometimes wild monsters drop an egg item you can use to get that monster.  Each monster has its own level, strengths and weaknesses, various attack types, and a semi-unique skill tree.  As you progress through different areas, you have to figure out what monsters to put in your party that are strong against the monsters found in that area.\n\nThe story isn't half bad and has a fair amount of dialog, although plot twists are few.\n\nThe game does have some good quality of life features.  For example, when a monster is max level, you continue to \"level up\" with that monster.  Each time you fill the exp bar again, you instead get an item that allows you to give that level to a different monster, so you aren't throwing exp in the garbage by using your best monsters.  It would be a shame to feel like you were wasting exp by using them right after they [spoiler]unlock their ultimate at max level[/spoiler].\n\nOne sharp criticism I do have of the game is that the difficulty curve turns into a rather sharp spike with \"RNG\" written on it.  Up until you get to that point, the difficulty is pretty mild.  48 hours in and nearly at the end, I called it out of frustration from losing constantly.  I decided to go back and give it another try because I really hate to lave a game unfinished like that, and guess what?  RNG is a fickle thing.  I blasted through the last several bosses with the same party I was already using without losing once.

As long as you capture monsters as you meet them, you will generally have all the tools you need to explore the majority of an area when you first come accross it, except in the beginning of the game, and at a couple points in the story - where you will promptly be directed toward the ability that will allow you to progress. And if you can't reach a chest, well, it's not really a big deal - the vast majority of chests contain items that you can easily acquire from merchants, or that are dropped from monsters, or sometimes their content is literally random (well, technically you get a fixed item, that you then use to get a random reward). So unless your goal is to get the 100% map achievement, if you miss something... It's not a big deal.\n\nThere are a bunch of monsters, and all of them are viable, even the ones you encounter early. The good thing about that is that you can compose an end-game worthy team in the first few areas. The bad thing is that it kinda saps the feeling of progression. Like, okay, I went into the hidden magma caves and got a badass fire breathing dragon... but why should I care when the random goblin I got ages ago is just as good, if not better? This is even the case for evolved monsters. Some monsters can evolve, but their evolved form isn't going to be strictly better - just different. And the game outright tells you as much. In particular there's a late game opponent who has both the base and evolved form of a monster in their team, and the unevolved one is by far the greater threat of the two. It's a bit jarring.\n\nThe meat and potato of the game is the combat. And it's pretty good. There are plenty of strategies available and things to consider. One thing to note though, this isn't like Pokemon where you can just take your favorite looking monsters and smash your head into the wall until the wall gives. The difficulty is scaled in a way that a team that doesn't synergise is doomed to fail. That said, there is literally no penalty for failure. If you lose a fight, you're just put back in front of it, ready to try again immediately or turn back and change stuff. There are only a couple of fight where losing simply denies you an extra reward, but those rewards are literally random, so it's not exactly a huge loss.\n\nAll in all, I recommend the game.

Another con of mine is that there's no ingame guide to evolution and the items, meaning that if you play spoiler/wiki free, there is no easy way to know which evo item is for which monster.

I find that the below is the most common solution for this sort of thing:\n\n\"For your controller, what kind do you use? I personally use a wired XBOX 360 controller and haven't had issues. One POSSIBLE fix (shot in the dark here) is going into your Steam client's controller settings (In steam, go to top left corner \"settings\" / controller/ General controller settings) and looking for the \"XBOX Configuration Support\" check box. Try playing the game with this box checked / un-checked and report back if this works. Don't ask me the full technical details, but this particular setting can mess with various games and how they act with the controller.\"\n\nNote that if you'd like us to notice your issue, it is better to make a post on the bug-reporting forum found here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/814370/discussions/2/\n\nSimilarly, feel free to contact us on Discord for live-support: https://discord.gg/vG558ng"}, "114018797": {"recommendationid": "114018797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024340430", "num_games_owned": 1968, "num_reviews": 6506, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1650216092}, "language": "english", "review": "DEAR FELLOW HUMBLE CHOICE ENJOYERS CAW CAW \n\nYOU CAN NAME A SLIME MONSTER INFLATION HENTAI CAW CAW\n\nTHAT IS THE REASON YOU SHOULD INSTALL THIS GAME CAW CAW", "timestamp_created": 1650216141, "timestamp_updated": 1650216141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.221028313040733337", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114013920": {"recommendationid": "114013920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066196927", "num_games_owned": 1044, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1650241765}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat is very fun", "timestamp_created": 1650210019, "timestamp_updated": 1650210019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114005737": {"recommendationid": "114005737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019226283", "num_games_owned": 796, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1649875552}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun", "timestamp_created": 1650199960, "timestamp_updated": 1650199960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113997301": {"recommendationid": "113997301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329528588", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1417, "last_played": 1650186508}, "language": "english", "review": "its nice have lots monsters and", "timestamp_created": 1650187017, "timestamp_updated": 1650187017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113988796": {"recommendationid": "113988796", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960861120", "num_games_owned": 638, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1661232691}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1650171432, "timestamp_updated": 1650171432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480225980281829834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113979826": {"recommendationid": "113979826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073615591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2020, "last_played": 1672556677}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is truly excellent.

Full review at [url=http://www.dragon-quill.net/monster-sanctuary/]Dragon Quill.[/url] Comments are enabled there.[/i]\n\nMonster Sanctuary is a cross between a monster catcher RPG and a Metroidvania. I am interested in both of those things, so I decided to check it out.\n\nThis game is better than Pokemon in every conceivable way except for the most important one: Monster designs. As you can see in the banner above, monster designs are incredibly basic, usually consisting of real plants, animals, or mythical creatures with only minor twists. And those tiny overworld sprites are all you\u2019re getting; you don\u2019t get to see detailed closeups in battle like you do in Pokemon. This is highly unfortunate, because the game is otherwise very enjoyable and has a number of features I wish Pokemon would include.\n\nThe game\u2019s big claim to fame is that every single monster has a skill that helps you explore the world in addition to their battle skills, a little like HMs from Pokemon but placed much more center stage. This is what makes the game a Metroidvania: instead of gating progress through items or upgrades to your character, you need to find monsters with the right skill to reach new areas or optional goodies. Not every monster has a unique exploration skill, but this still added a lot of personality to them and helped them feel like real creatures instead of just battle-bots.\n\nThe other cool thing is that battles require more than one iota of thought. All battles are 3v3 rather than 1v1, all enemy trainers have a full team, and monsters can survive more than two hits. This means that status and support moves actually matter, and are in fact a cornerstone of most advanced strategies. Additionally, instead of learning new moves automatically on level up, every monster has a skill tree that you can customize yourself, which makes me feel a lot more involved in their development and allows for even more tactical depth. This added complexity means that every monster actually feels like it has a unique niche, rather than them being interchangeable outside of elemental coverage like in Pokemon.\n\nAnother thing the game does is that your monsters can have equipment (one weapon and three accessories), which I\u2019m ambivalent about. It provides more opportunities for customization, yes, but for me it felt like too much micromanagement for a game with 101 potential party members. It\u2019s pretty grindy, too, because in order to improve equipment you need to gather crafting materials, which drop randomly from enemies, making it a crapshoot if you\u2019ll get the ones you need. Also, weirdly, every monster starts with a basic weapon that is necessary to boost their attack stats to a meaningful level but for some reason can be unequipped. I feel like, given this is a game about monsters, not humans, they should be relying more on their innate skills than equipment modifiers. Pokemon\u2019s single held items that provided small qualitative changes were enough complexity, this is too much.\n\nThis ties into my more substantial criticism, which is that the game overall feels much too complex. So much of the stuff that happens in battles happens automatically; it\u2019s all effects that trigger follow-up effects that trigger follow-up effects that trigger follow-up effects. Good builds require you to exploit these several layers deep, so that every action you take heals you, which grants you a buff, which lets you do a follow-up attack, which\u2026 Every single turn in this game features a truly dizzying amount of things happening beyond the action you just took, with no indication of what triggered what or exactly what happened. Playing this game for too long literally gives me a headache, and it\u2019s not hard to see why.\n\nThis is especially bad when encountering new enemies; while you can guess what\u2019s going on with your monsters since you built them, you have no idea why this new monster just oneshotted your tank and fully healed itself on the same turn, and thus you have no idea what you\u2019re supposed to do in response.\n\nOne thing I did like is that instead of learning new abilities automatically, monsters have skill trees that you invest points in every time they level up. You can never max out a tree (as the level cap is scaled for you to hit at the end of the game instead of off in space), requiring you to make actual choices and come up with customized builds. Monsters can end up remarkably different if you diversify their tree or go all in on one branch, and depending on what passives you choose. This made me feel much more involved and invested in my monsters\u2019 development than I ever did in Pokemon, and lends more credence to the idea you are actually training them. It\u2019s definitely something more mons games should consider.\n\nHowever, despite all of this complicated setup, the game forces you to rely a lot on random chance. In addition to critical hits, there are buffs and debuffs that can make you randomly miss attacks, and there are a ton of abilities and items that provide a buff or debuff that\u2019s chosen randomly. This isn\u2019t too bad, because a core mechanic is that all of your attacks hit multiple times, so random effects get averaged out\u2026 Except, as you might notice in the above video, there\u2019s a scoring system that ranks you on how well the battle went, with crucial rewards like new monsters gated behind high scores. This is immensely frustrating if you\u2019re just on the cusp of getting a perfect score, because you don\u2019t know if that means you need to change your strategy or if you just got unlucky. You can fight a battle the exact same way and get different results, which is fine in general but not if you\u2019re turning battles into a puzzle that must be performed perfectly. And, again, this isn\u2019t just for bragging rights; getting new monsters, the game\u2019s core feature, requires getting high scores.\n\nCompounding this is that the leveling curve is incredibly punishing. See, unlike in Pokemon, boss battles are hair-pullingly difficult, with every enemy trainer having a full and well-balanced team that\u2019s deliberately scaled to be higher level than you. It\u2019s impossible to coast through the game with a single team, as you\u2019ll need to switch out most or all of your monsters for every boss to come up with a viable counter. However, like in Pokemon, benched mons gain no experience from battles; so even if you know intellectually what monsters you should swap for, they\u2019ll be statistically useless until you do a ton of grinding first. This was incredibly frustrating and unfun, and completely killed the pacing every time I ran into a brick wall of a boss. Pokemon also has this problem (which is why people who complain about the EXP share and EXP candies are nuts), we just don\u2019t notice because it\u2019s so easy a monkey can play it.\n\nThe game does throw you one bone with Rare Candy-type items that give monsters free levels (capped by the level of your strongest monster, which I thought was a good throttle)\u2026 except they\u2019re limited items, so you can only use them to bring one or two old monsters up to par, out of dozens of options. Bizarrely, a late-game area has a shop that lets you buy unlimited amounts for a pittance, which just makes me ask why we couldn\u2019t have that from the start.\n\nDespite my gripes, I\u2019m still putting this down as a rec. It\u2019s a fun game overall, and it\u2019s good to experience different takes on the mons genre. Like I said, it\u2019s better than Pokemon in nearly every way, so I don\u2019t object to spreading it around.", "timestamp_created": 1649951912, "timestamp_updated": 1649951912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113834190": {"recommendationid": "113834190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356889867", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 2721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2708, "last_played": 1650214773}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game, be prepared to adjust your strategy frequently to achieve victory.", "timestamp_created": 1649933912, "timestamp_updated": 1649933912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113831290": {"recommendationid": "113831290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049906063", "num_games_owned": 1742, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 4888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4888, "last_played": 1649928127}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Metroid, Megaman, and Pokemon, and you thought they all should be combined, then this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1649928272, "timestamp_updated": 1649928272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622526884078979492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113826265": {"recommendationid": "113826265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167896565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1649917199}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't expect this game to be as addicting as it is.\n\nPokemon is one of the most boring game franchises I've ever had the displeasure of playing and I came into this game expecting a boring Pokemon experience, but I was wrong.\n\nCons:\n\n-There is a lot of backtracking in this game and not enough ways to make the player move faster.\n\n-Monster encounters seem unfinished.

A Team is bad if you build their skill tree in a way that does not promote synergy, but you can make any creatures work with the right synergies (yes, even the starting Slime!)\n         - Most moves don't let you choose which creature gets the extra random buff or which of your debuffs are healed from the list of debuffs you have, so it makes the game a little less of a math homework and keeps you more on your toes with faster gameplay\n\nNeutral: - 16 hours in, the difficulty is slowly rising, and I can see how the game gets difficult overtime (but as of now, it's still a bit easy)\n\nCons: - Seems to be a good entry game to the metroidvania genre, but I'm guessing veterans of the genre might find it a bit simple on that aspect? Idk, I'm not the expert\n         - Most moves don't let you choose which creature gets the extra random buff or which of your debuffs are healed from the list of debuffs you have, so it makes the game a little more about luck, which may deter some RNG-repulsed players\n\nTL;DR: Game good, graphics pleasant, gameplay very well made and polished, seems simple but allows many kinds of playstyles that will still be fun to play", "timestamp_created": 1649853813, "timestamp_updated": 1649853813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113780770": {"recommendationid": "113780770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000568601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 19889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9178, "last_played": 1686463225}, "language": "english", "review": "Monster Sanctuary is a very solid and relaxing game.

I love that you can't just power through all the content with the same team (without experiencing diminishing returns). Combos and team roles (healer/shield/damage/etc) are a thing and slowly become a wall you need to overcome in order to learn how to efficiently win battles without simply using brute force (until you figure out a team that can use said force efficiently).\n\nI love that in this game, equipment and food buffs are an actual thing to signify progression instead of just being tacked on. I also experienced a lot of freedom in swapping around monsters for my various teams as I worked my way through the post-game content.

Monster Sanctuary takes the idea of Monster farming and adds a solid Metroidvania to it, which creates a rather interesting game. Players start with one of four characters, but from there will explore the world collecting monsters, and defeating enemies. \n\nThe first hour is pretty easy to get through but there\u2019s also a strong feeling of grinding and farming inherently to the idea here, as well as reports from people I trust, that the game does eventually get decently challenging. There are great skill systems, interesting monster designs, and a lot of features here that keep the idea fresh. \n\nPick this up if you like either Metroidvania for their exploration or Pokemon. I\u2019m a little shocked this hasn\u2019t gotten more attention but I\u2019m thrilled to have experienced it now.

There's always new monsters to find and capture, but it gets boring especially when you need to backtrack.

The party fights are an absolute chore, usually about having the right buffs/debuffs and don't allow much flexibility to overcome. Either you have the right monsters or you're dead.\n\nNow, the monsters come in egg form. If you hatch them they usually have a level around what your highest level is, but only the 6 main monsters gain experience from fights. So if you later need one of the other monsters for a specific talent, yeah, you have to grind that up, which happens quite often later in the game.

If you were intrigued by the buzzword Metroidvania, be aware that there aren't really any platforming challenges and the ones that are there are pretty simple- similarly combat in this game is if you touch a monster your JRPG combat begins.\n\nSo with that out of the way, this game is amazing if you like theorycrafting. Combat works like a standard party JRPG (not really pokemon), you get 3 monsters to battle against the enemy 3 monsters, each side takes all their actions at once. But the awesome part is there's over 100 monsters in this game, each with a branching skill tree, and ALL of them are good enough to include in a team. Some are more generically strong, but almost everything can atleast be niche viable- including unevolved monsters (TBH there's only a handful of evolutions, but evolutions in this game are sidegrades and have tradeoffs) So basically there are a lot of pieces to imagine team compositions around.\n\nThe story mode itself has a standard forgettable kid friendly plot line common in monster collecting games, but the difficulty is decently well scaled, with wild battles being able to wreck you if you just mishmashed some mons, with some bosses being able to dismantle some compositions. But toward the end it does have some pretty challenging fights that do require you to bring a well rounded team and may require you to adjust if your team isn't working.\n\nSo now lets talk grinding. As far as XP, the game doesn't really require any excess during the initial playthrough, just fighting the standard amount of encounters thrown at you while exploring the map will keep you where expected. Adding new monsters is easy- depending on your level monsters when caught will always be 2-5 levels behind your highest level monster- and your \"rare candies\" in this game get handed out like, well, candy- so the only difficult part can be catching them, as admittedly if you don't overlevel them you may need to swap around your comp to be able to even catch particular monsters as your chance of catching a new monster is based off of doing a fight \"well\" which if your team is well constructed then it usually shouldn't be an issue. The game does have its \"shines\", and they are actually important, essentially being the actual \"evolved\" forms of the monsters offering an strong passive and extra stats- but that said the chance of one spawning when hunting is about 1/12, and the playthrough will hand you about 10 items that let you upgrade a monster to the \"shiny\" status anyway.\n\nSo now lets just round out with \"what can I do with all this theorycrafting?\" well a couple things, besides finishing the playthrough, the game does offer PvP, which while the game is not super popular you can expect to atleast match with people. It has an infinite arena mode, so you can try to see how many rounds your team can go against increasing modifiers, and finally new game+ (which does give the option to be done on a seperate save or the same one) which lets you do a new playthrough with ALL of your monsters you caught the first time, but reset to level 1 against enemies scaled higher than the initial playthrough, letting you reexperience the game with comps you wouldn't have been able to access until you were already 3/4s done the first time.\n\nAs a guy who loves TCGs and Monster catchers for the vast theorycrafting, this game has quickly become one of my favorite indie games I've played in the last few years.

Firstly the first area is too easy. It's like the devs were scared people would stop too early, so they made it easier. But then afterwards the difficulty increases. I'de prefer they set expectations better there. Then there's the fact that my pokemon didn't evolve from leveling xD The evolution mechanic didn't feel that meaningful in the game.\nI do like the general games difficulty, forcing me to change up my team. But it does feel quite unbalanced and doesn't feel like there's any intuitive gameplay rules to follow. Like pokemon fire beats grass. Here it's use these monsters in a combination together and they do 5 times better than your previous team. I still enjoyed it though.\nAnother grief though is the health, a lot of the fights I found myself thinking 'when will this fight end' because the monster healths are super high and a lot of the bosses are just high health. This means rather than a new challenge I am just spending more time. A lot of the game design does this. Like the way you have to backtrack every time you unlock a new way to traverse through obstacles. I feel like this game could of been more fun at 30 hours if they balanced health lower and concentrated on the aweome combo mechanics.\nOne last thing, the third last boss 'Zosimos' is basically broken. I don't know how this got through the dozens of QA testers you see in the end credits. I did read a Reddit post about bleed stacks, but I ended up beating it just by adding a snake to my team. But this alchemist was harder than the next two bosses which I completely crushed. While I do love abusing the healing mechanics personally, I feel like this particular boss needs a nerf as it just leaves a sour taste in ones mouth.\nI did enjoy the game and the various environments and battles. So still recommended, just know there's some issues with balancing at that one boss. Maybe just make 'Zosimos' the last boss lmao.

Cozy spritework and music, with a heavy focus on teambuilding. The combat is fantastic - it's a 3-on-3 active party system that rewards things like buffs, debuffs and multihit attacks. I felt like the way it wants you to think more heavily about the way your party works for you reminded me positively of the Shin Megami Tensei series. You have a lot of different options and ways to make your monsters work for you, and the game loves to reward you for building effective teams with many different roles. As someone who was disillusioned with the battle mechanics and lack of challenge of a game like Pokemon, this really satisfied me - this isn't a diss at Pokemon so much as me painting a picture of the kind of game this is and who it will appeal to.\n\nThe amount of monsters comes a little over 100, but this is far from an issue, as each one is distinct, with their own unique customizable skilltrees, and from my experience not a single one has ever felt like they were dead weight. The maps are fixed, but it's fine because they're well-designed, fun, and encourage backtracking in an organic and interesting way. At times I could see it being too challenging for some people, but I personally loved how difficult it could be at times. The story isn't anything special, but it really captures this simple and cute 2000s kid hero game feel. I spotted a few grammatical oddities but if anything that kind of added to that \"secret hidden gem I found used at Gamestop for my DS\" vibe.\n\nAside from the main game being a meaty enough experience that you'll spend tons of time exploring, playing with team ideas, and battling, the game offers many diversions. After beating the game, there's a New Game Plus mode and a higher difficulty, as well as postgame challenges in the form of an endless arena and a special hall to fight harder monster teams. A recent free update even added features for Randomizer runs, Nuzlockes, and a whole new postgame region with more monsters and battles. I love to come back to it just to see how fast I can handle the bosses or try new teams in the arena challenges.

Anyway once I was in the mechanic tower and in the magma caves I realized my monsters... sucked, most were level 33-35 iirc and had most of their gear upgraded until +4 or +5. I had other monsters there mostly for advebturing purposes (flying hich, swimming, etc) but all of those were level 20few at best. having to level all of those to try which one worked best was a chore, specially considering that around level 30 you get very little xp. so there I was and ther I stayed, stuck with a lame party and not really wanting to level every mosnter to see which one may work and which one. Tis a shame actually cause I really really enojoyed the game up until that point. I think that I discovered a little more than 60 monsters.

If you like exploration, turn based rpg combat, or deep levels of party customization, this game is absolutely worth playing.\n\nThe world is heavily interconnected and fun to poke around. Your monsters provide most of the upgrades that allow you to access new areas, which allows you the opportunity for some light sequence breaking if you explore thoroughly. The visual tells for obstacles and hidden areas are generally pretty clear, so you can tell quickly whether or not you possess the correct ability to reach any given area. In the recent major patch, they also added a nice custom map marker system to help you keep track of which places you might want to revisit in the future. Alongside this, the game also provides a handy menu option that points you to your next main objective in case you get lost.\n\nThe combat is easy to grasp but incredibly deep. You start off with very simple direct actions, and slowly throughout the game you unlock more actions and passive traits that create synergies between your monsters. By the end of the game, each of your actions is triggering multiple buffs, debuffs, heals, or extra attacks, which is incredibly satisfying to see play out. The UI is very well built to convey a lot of information that helps you predict the effectiveness of your actions so you don't get overwhelmed. The game also offers several optional challenges to really push your understanding of the system to its limits. My one personal grip with the combat is the battle scoring system, which tends to emphasize certain strategies over others.\n\nMonster customization is also very detailed. Each monster has its own skill tree, one of two major passive buffs, equipment, and even food. All of this allows you to very thoroughly control what a monster is good at. Though a lot of the skills are shared across multiple monsters, each monster's base stats and skill tree are unique, giving each of them a clear identity. To help encourage experimentation, the game provides a few ways to boost the level of your monsters to match your highest-level monster, which eliminates the tedious grinding you tend to experience in these kinds of games. It also lets you save and load multiple team setups so you can switch back and forth easily. The one major drawback here is that it can be fairly time consuming to look through the monster skill trees and equipment lists to figure out what things go well together.\n\nThe game has solid art and character design. The monsters, which are mostly drawn from folklore, fantasy literature, and other games, have a great deal of charm and variety. The background art and music both do a solid job of conveying each region's atmosphere. The writing isn't the most sophisticated, but the main story is competently told, and the background world building (found mostly in the monster log) is pretty interesting.\n\nOverall, I found the game extremely enjoyable, and it is one of the few games I've chosen to 100%.", "timestamp_created": 1646897008, "timestamp_updated": 1657952334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5947532057762146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1647044195, "developer_response": "Hey Yethello-\n\nThanks for the kind words and glad that you've been enjoying things so far.

I've never known anyone who genuinely enjoys these and at best they simply serve to pad out the games length and softlock portions. \n    [*]Tons of monsters, many of which are functionally the same and have the same special abilities eg, there are more than 10 that can cut or burn vines, 15+ that can break hidden walls and numerous that slightly levitate the player. I can understand a few sharing the same pool, so that players aren't required to get one or two special monsters to complete a task (even though later on, there are indeed monsters who are VERY rare that ARE required to progress) but having that many share the same pool is mental.\n    [*]ALL characters are one dimensional and have zero originality. They're literally just tropes with no further development onto who they are. Examples include the wise old man who helps the hero on his/her journey, the loyal pet, the hot headed/arrogant one and the coward. These tropes can be useful to tell a story IF there is additional character development but in this game there just isn't. What you see is all you get.\n    [*]Gold is pointless. Never spent a single penny throughout my playthrough (everything I needed I simply found in drops, I never even felt the need to use any potions or buffs, so just kept them in my inventory even though I could have sold them, but again, gold is pointless, there's virtually nothing to do with it as everything can be found anyway) yet there's perks that increase gold if you're playing with certain monsters. \n    [*]Endless backtracking. Great, you got a new monster. Now you'll need to go all the way back over here to open this little level. Cool! You got another while doing that, best head under the dungeons because you need to activate an orb for this one! What? Teleport there? Why would you want to do that? Which leads me onto my next point...\n    [*]Teleportation. To stop the tedium of walking from point to point as much, there is teleports and items that let you move back to your main location (the Sanctuary). The issue with these is that they aren't really located near anything major or important. You STILL need to backtrack even when using a mechanism to decrease backtracking.\n    [*]Vague objectives which aren't recorded anywhere (atleast that I had been taught ingame). Every objective is spoke half cryptically, and some don't work when you're prompted to go and do something, requiring a hidden trigger to work. An example of this is [spoiler] when Will loses his Spectral monster to Alchemists and broods by reading all the lost lore of the Sancturary. Your own monster will prompt you to talk to him, yet he remains brooding until you unlock the hidden trigger of discovering a chipped stone in the Fire Area which finally lets Will speak to you[/spoiler].\n    [*]You can steamroll the enemies just using your starter monster and the correct stat/item attribution. I've ran the same 3 monsters from the start and there has been little to no challenge. \n    [*]This next one is a personal gripe that is less about the game, and more about the developer whom acts condescending and unprofessional on the forums to players who genuinely do seem stuck. This player was accused of \"trolling\" for this. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2776232661\nDoing this seems like a bit of a power trip, which I have noticed A LOT of developers seem fond of (Including one who Steam apparently found no issues with permabanning people of a racial origin that they did not personally like) and always call it out when I see it.\n[/list]\n\nI do however, like the monster designs (even if one is copied from pokemon, similar movesets included) and the mechanic which stops fights going on forever.

They all have their own strengths, weaknesses, types, and so on. It's a little more complex than a \"rock, paper, scissors\" kind of thing. For instance, there can be a monster that's only weak to a magical fire based attack, and either neutral to or strong against all others. An interesting aspect to the battles is that you're scored and given a rating at the end which affects what drops you get, and it shows how many points you get for different things (bufss/debuffs you use, number of turns taken, synergy with attacks, combo rating, exploiting weaknesses, etc). In addition, there's a combo mechanic where the more times you hit an enemy on your turn the higher the counter rises, and the higher it rises the more damage you do, so it can pay off to do weaker attacks that deal more hits with your first two monsters, then deliver a damaging blow with your third monster. The counter resets at the end of each turn.\n\nEvery monster has it's own RPG-like skill tree, gains XP in battle (or by being part of the \"active\" group) which gives a skill point upon leveling up, and tiers of skills are locked behind levels. It's possible to unlock every skill for a monster by continuing to \"level\" it past max level where it just gains skill points.\n\nThere's a variety of equipment, levels for equipment, different kinds of food, and so on to equip or affect your monsters with, along with an option that comes up mid-game that can wildly change stats and other things.\n\nThere's just as much emphasis on active skills as there is on passive skills, and builds relying on either or a mix of both are all valid. Speaking of which, synergy not only between skills but between different monsters is set up very well. For instance I can have one monster grant a shield to all three members at the start of each round, which in turn may trigger an effect of another monster that activates upon receiving a shield.\n\nOne of my favorite things is how, unlike other games this may be compared to, your monsters actually matter outside of combat. In fact, they're absolutely essential for exploration and getting around. There's monsters that can pick you up and fly for a short time, ones that you can ride for better speed and higher jump, ones that can break open walls, ones that can cut or burn vines away, ones that help you swim, and so on and so forth. The way this works is that you have a monster following you at all times which you can use the exploration ability of (i.e. flying, destroying obstacles, etc), and you can freely swap them out for any monster you have obtained at any time without restriction.\n\nSide note, there's also an online PvP mode you can enter once you have it unlocked. If that's not your thing, that's fine. The rest of the game is offline single player and you're not punished or miss out on rewards for not partaking in it, nor is it required to enter PvP at any time.\n\n\nNow for what I don't like.\n\nThere are a couple jumps that require nearly pixel perfect precision. I don't mind challenge, but some parts are straight up ridiculous. There could also be more explanation of your monster's exploration abilities. It's touched upon once, but only for one thing for your starter. That's pretty much it. I hate sounding like a fanboy, and I'm sitting here trying to think of what else I don't like... but that's pretty much all I can think of.", "timestamp_created": 1646402690, "timestamp_updated": 1646473144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658121943473815918", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111518293": {"recommendationid": "111518293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003369768", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1668709471}, "language": "english", "review": "SNES-Jump'n'Run/Pokemon/DarkestDungeon", "timestamp_created": 1646401698, "timestamp_updated": 1646401698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111495604": {"recommendationid": "111495604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047692235", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 989, "last_played": 1666558129}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this game on Xbox a while back.

I put it down at the end boss because it was too difficult for the teams I had already raised and didn't want to rebuild and reoptimize everything, but I felt the balance was at a good spot other than the very last encounter. The difficulty does jump up quite drastically throughout the game but it's nice to have a difficult game in a genre that's otherwise filled with cakewalks.\n\nThe metroidvania layout was satisfying to me since I'm a huge fan of exploration but it's not the best example of the genre.

The overall world is presented very much as a 2D metroidvania with a bunch of biomes/areas to explore, but they are all filled with monsters that will drop eggs you can hatch to build up your monster battle parties.  The combat is generally a turn based 3v3 pokemon battle style affair with each creature having some specialties/skills and its own progression tree.  I do recommend speeding it up a bit in the settings menu but overall it is relatively quick and it pushes you to optimize your team balance and strategy by giving better rewards for faster/more successful combat.\n\nWhere things fray just a little bit at the edges is there really are not clear guidelines on what specific creatures do build optimal teams.  On the one hand that does encourage some experamentation until you find a strategy/team that works best for you, but on the other hand it does mean that unless you want to re-run that optimization 100 times over throughout the game you are going to end up capturing creatures you won't ever bother even looking at because the time sink to learn/adapt each one's full skill tree is pretty massive, and when optimal teams can use some of the very first critters you find, and they are not clearly out-powered by end game boss monsters, it can edge out of interesting strategy and in to what can feel a bit more like busywork.\n\nAll that aside though, collecting everything initially is pretty fun and sped up the combat is overall fairly quick and simple.  If you do feel bogged down, there are guides on solid teams you can build pretty early on that will last you right through the end of the game (with occasionally some item/weapon etc updates as you find them).\n\nDefinitely worth a shot if you do enjoy metroidvania style games as this is an example of just how far you can push that design from its origins while keeping a fun and solid game-play dynamic overall.\n", "timestamp_created": 1645624782, "timestamp_updated": 1645624782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64249873161315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110720204": {"recommendationid": "110720204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059241883", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1915, "last_played": 1645473255}, "language": "english", "review": "It feels like this game has some progression difficulty issues but other than that it is a cute mix of metroidvania, pokemon and jrpg :)", "timestamp_created": 1645478072, "timestamp_updated": 1645478072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518072307109832764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110581364": {"recommendationid": "110581364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128526347", "num_games_owned": 1297, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1469, "last_played": 1645300786}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like pokemon you're going to love this game it's not as easy so definitely recommend looking up some guides and doing some team building", "timestamp_created": 1645298834, "timestamp_updated": 1645298834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110539625": {"recommendationid": "110539625", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992992101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2978, "last_played": 1645427274}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a metroidvania pokemon game.

This game was amazing! I couldn't put it down all week. \n\nImagine a game that sits somewhere between Pokemon and Dragon Warrior Monsters (the Dragon Quest spin-off years ago, if you're familiar with those.) Take the elemental strengths and weaknesses and to a lesser degree, the evolutions of Pokemon. Then add the team battles from Dragon Warrior (rather than one-on-one fights -- I know Pokemon eventually did this too) and the zones full of lesser monsters to fight and recruit with \"Champion\" boss monsters scattered around to fight and possibly recruit as well. Now make the game you're imagining a Metroidvania RPG. Then give all the monsters a weapon slot and three accessory slots so you can custom-tailor their stats how you want them. Now give each monster four talent trees with 15-20 things in each ranging from active abilities, passive abilities, and stat boosts so you can further decide if you want them to be tanky, throw out tons of damage, buff the party, debuff the enemies, etc. AND give each monster an out of combat ability to use as you explore the world. Anything from breaking down walls to reveal secret rooms to various ways of pressing switches for puzzles, to being able to ride some of them as mounts or be carried short distances to increase your jump range. \n\nPros:\n-Combat is super engaging. You're constantly re-evaluating your party synergy and coming up with new strategies, and the game makes redoing your specializations really accessible, even early on. It's also very easy to catch new monsters up to your group (or even ones that you have had for a while and haven't used) if you decide you want to change things up.\n\n-The Sanctuary setting is incredibly charming and surprisingly beautiful for what basically amounts to somewhat scaled up Terraria graphics. Each zone has its own character and feel and is genuinely fun to explore. The characters you meet along the way, while perhaps a bit clich\u00e9 at times, are a fun part of the story without feeling like they're in the way.\n\n-The monster designs follow some familiar themes at times, and at other times they go completely off the book from what you're used to in other games of this genre. Early on, I found myself gravitating towards monsters that reminded me of my favorite Pokemon, but by the end of the game, I had a very different group that I used consistently. \n\nCons \n-Ok the only thing that is even remotely coming to mind, and I wouldn't even really call it a \"Con\" so much as something to warn people about...The music, especially in a couple of zones, is INSANELY LOUD. Simple enough to fix in audio settings (I ended up turning it down to like 10% I think) but worth noting because it wasn't consistent and when I reached the main hub of the game where you have your shops and all that, it was a bit of a surprise at first.\n\nBottom Line: If you like Pokemon (or other catch monsters and battle them type games), chances are, you'll love this. If you're a fan of Metroidvania games, you'll probably enjoy this too. If the idea of smashing those two genres together sounds enticing to you, go buy this game and don't let it sit in your library for a year like I did!", "timestamp_created": 1645163863, "timestamp_updated": 1645164015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569892466068267822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110434158": {"recommendationid": "110434158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273366306", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1989, "last_played": 1688195284}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2611 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1645115714, "timestamp_updated": 1645115714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 170, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808861494064331055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110365881": {"recommendationid": "110365881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045356650", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1505, "last_played": 1668923500}, "language": "english", "review": "Monster Sanctuary is quite a phenomenal monster tamer and metroidvania, as strange as that combination may sound on paper.\nIt's a fairly challenging game that requires you think think about team synergy a lot, which I like.

You travel through interconnected maps while catching and training creatures that can help you traverse the world. It's honestly just really fun and has a lot of good design choices with a pleasant sprite work in the characters and biomes. For difficulty, it's easy enough to not be frustrating, but has enough challenge that you do have to make strategies and pick and choose how to fight enemies. It's probably a good 20 hours of playtime to beat the main story - and there's still things to do after! there's still areas I haven't explore and monsters I haven't seen.\n\nTHE PROS that separate it from other popular monster collecting/fighting games:\nACCESS TO ALL YOUR MONSTERS WHENEVER YOU WANT:\nEach main fight is 3v3 and you have your team of six that each gain experience and level up/get experience in each battle. You can also choose who you want to use skills first each match, so order of them on the field doesn't matter at all! You can freely swap your main six monsters in/out to use for battles, and outside of battles, you can always reorganize your team wherever you are. In addition to your main 6, outside of battles you can use/move them around into/out of your team whenever you want. You can just equip it, try it out by swapping in, and it you don't like it, try again. No need to go anywhere or get anything to have access to all the creatures you have. Each monster also has abilities outside of battle (like letting you fly, swim, moving blocks) and you can use those abilities from any monster you have (from your 6 or your backlog) at any time at the map.\n\n-SKILL TREES:\nEach monster has three different skill trees like a lot of RPG style games for characters. Once you hatch a monster, you can see all their skills in the tree, and it tells you what each thing does. So you can choose which way to build them, and can customize how you want each critter on your roster. You have the typical health and mana with skills that others do, but you have more access to their abilities at any time in \nthe battle.\n\n-EQUIPMENT VARIETY:\nYou get a lot of different equipment on your guys, so you're not just laden to the standard builds/stats assigned to each monster. Each monster does have its own general stats like HP, attack, defense, etc. but the main way to increase these is through equipping. You can gets a TON of different kinda, multiple kinds of equioment that you can find and buy. And you can upgrade them with loot you collect. It adds a nice level of customization and leads to some fun additions that can completely change the way your team works.\n\n-ALMOST NO NEED TO GRIND: \nUnlike other monster catching and training games, you can get eggs from enemies you fight and hatch them at any time. These eggs are within 2-3 levels of your main team of 6, so you don't have to fight a lot to get your new team up to level and swap/try out new beasties. You also get level badges (to increase levels from anything 2+ levels below your highest guy) and resetting stones (in case you don't like the aforementioned build you made) so you can redo your guys. These are given to you pretty liberally. As mentioned above, most stats are determined by armor/equipment that you can swap out at any time. Upgrading equipment needs materials, BUT even for those you don't need to really grind because your bestiary will tell you on each monster what its loot drops are after you find them. So no tedious fighting over and over for drops. \n\nSOME CONS:  to the game, or things that maybe weren't done quite as well? I honestly don't really think anything is done BADLY, just not as well as the above. You can tell there was a lot of attention put to making the different monsters fun and they don'y bog you down. Like said, if you enjoy monster catching and exploring games, I don't think any of the reasons below are any reason to not want to play. but if you're on the fence about these kind of games, these are just things to consider:\n\n-STORY: \nIt isn't bad, but a pretty basic plot that you'd expect from a game like this. The story makes sense, flows well, but it's kind of more of the same plot you'd come to expect from this kind of game. Just a pretty basic story where you start as an inexperienced kid and rise the ranks and save the world from baddies thread you've come to expect from games like this.\n\n-CHARACTERS:\nSame as above, the other allied people you encounter are a little one note and bland. Each has their own personality trait that you can see pretty much immediately and they stick to it the whole time. Not a lot of character interaction and not much depth to it.\n\n-BACKTRACKING:\nSince this is one large map, there is backtracking. This is mostly mitigated by teleporting spots in each area and an item to recall to base/items to get out of fights you didn't mean to encounter. But you'll still encounter areas/items you can't get to until you find a monster/item elsewhere to let you do it. And once you find them, you have to remember where it is and go back to it. It can be a little tedious at times to do so. \n\nFIGHTS CAN GET MONOTONOUS:\nThere's pretty great monster variety, but once you've fought a group of enemies once, you've fought them every time. From what I've seen, enemies have the same skills when you encounter them each time (there is a person later that lets you keep level of monsters the same as your own no matter where you go, this might help a bit with that) so they have the same access. You'll also often have same creatures and so you can essentially just be redoing the same strategy and attacks each time. It can get a little boring/tedious spending those turns with monsters the same with each encounter\n\nOVERALL:\nI really like this game, and if you love these kind of monster catching and fighting games, I think you'll love it, too! There was clearly a lot of thought and effort put into this game with a lot of insight into how to make a monster catching and fighting game really fun and customizeable while reducing the bad parts of them like grinding that a lot of games like this suffer from. the sprites have personality, the game is wonderful to look at and fully embraces its pixel style and there's tons of variety for organizing/changing/exploring your team options.

You have to REALLY think through your teams synergies to progress through the game, and there is always a secret around the next corner. It is incredible to me how versatile each monsters roster is and how even with overlapping skills between monsters, each ones kit and selection of abilities feels fresh.\n\nSome advice for beginners:\nDamage is completely overrated. Control of debuffs aka removing and placing them, as well as shields will be your best friend. Shields can be equal to your max HP, so if your monster has a ton of HP, this can be a really effective tanking strategy. Also don't forget Safecast. Barrier + Channel + Shields will win you many fights. This reduces damage dealt to you, gives you extra hp to work with (Shields) and ensures you can always cast your best spells. Lastly, Shields over Healing. More HP is always better than healing your HP bar as ideally you don't want the enemy to touch your HP bar at all. Minimal healing is good, but you don't need much more.\n\nI will say, there is some amount of disappointment to team building. Mass debuff removal and shields are essentially a must for every team. This does limit team building to some extend. I could also be completely wrong and built it wrong, but damage outside of slow teams using Age stacking felt like they just really could not cut it and output the needed damage. Either way, I could not put this game down from start to finish. So much to love about this game. The art style, music, dungeon designs are all top notch. I love pokemon, this is not pokemon outside of collecting monsters and turn based combat. It is much harder. That said, I love how you have all 3 of your monsters working together and the teamwork between them is lovely. It also makes or breaks the harder fights of the game. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes hard strategy games and collectables.

The easy thing to do is build debuff teams or ensure you always have someone that can remove debuffs, but again with the variety in each of the monsters the game will allow you to not be forced into debuff teams if you teambuild properly, but it becomes much harder to do so the farther you get along and it will be harder to do without hunting for certain pieces of equipment.

Somehow every single monster looks like it would be potentially useful in some sort of endgame setup, and you often have multiple ways to build an individual monster.\n[*] Most standard battles are simple to beat, but since your rewards depend on performance ranking, you're still encouraged to think about the most efficient way to win. The \"boss battles\" however ramp up in difficulty until they really test your team-building. While everything appears usable, just slapping together any six monsters and attacking enemy weakness will not work, and the game instead favors things like effective utilization of non-attacking moves/effects, a strong central theme, and/or abilities that synergize with each other. \n[*] The game also makes it so that any new interesting monsters you find are quick to incorporate to a team. Every new monster hatches only a couple levels below your best one, and you only need to feed it a couple food items and swap over some equipment for it to be essentially on par with the rest of your party. Level-up items that let monsters catch up to your highest-leveled one are also infinitely buyable.\n[*] The metroidvania aspects take a backseat, but do allow for some freedom in the order you progress through the game. The game also essentially levels along the player, so as long as one roughly fights every new monster group once, no new encounters should have the player either over- or underleveled.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, if you like RPGs with a large degree of customizability, prefer to use strategies other than just spamming attacks in turn-based combat, and are not afraid of some difficulty, then I heavily recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1643250610, "timestamp_updated": 1643250770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108831325": {"recommendationid": "108831325", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990203604", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 595, "last_played": 1643216098}, "language": "english", "review": "Absurd combat system.  Overly complicated with a bunch of abilities/skills that are either completely worthless or do apply random buffs/debuffs, making them unpredictable.  I saw where the combat was heading after my first fight against the other keeper.  Buffs, debuffs, and dots.  Passive *everything*.  Active abilities used *only* to cleanse debuffs or shield/heal.  It opened my eyes to just how ridiculously imbalanced end game would be, and that the only thing to focus on was stacking absurd amounts of offensive and defensive passives.  Active damage slowly became worthless and unreliable, undodgeable debuffs and dots became better and better.. ugh, and it was the only way to play.  \n\nI've played so many JRPGs, have thousands upon thousands of hours in various MMORPGs which I've played at a very high level (world firsts in some), and this is one of the worst combat systems I've ever encountered.  It needs a complete overhaul where the passives are massively nerfed and more emphasis is made on active abilities and actually making decisions rather than turtling while passives do all of the work.  I saw that EVEN HEALING was going to end up being passive, with the sole purpose of healing characters to be removing debuffs, while most heals come from passives that heal you when you do or take damage, or at the end of a turn.  Absurd. \n\nAnyway, aside from the ridiculous combat system, the game world is dead and the story is incredibly bland.  Yeah the graphics look nice, but you can't call this a metroidvania.  The only metroidvania aspects are walking through 2d worlds.  There is almost nothing to interact with in them, an extremely poor map with nothing labeled, and all of the environments look the same throughout their various areas.  This game could have been any other type of game, a top down JRPG like Suikoden for example, and it would have played exactly the same.  That's how incredibly boring the world is.  \n\nIt's not good.  Just.. yeah, not good.  If you're buying this to play a metroidvania, don't.

It does so much almost right.  The non-linear game, the team building, the battle system...they're all so close to working in a way that's truly enjoyable.\n\nBut every one of them falls flat in a way that doesn't seem like it's improving but is rather getting worse as I go on.  I'm going to go from most frustrating to least frustrating here to help prioritize.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have is that wild battles/guardian fights and fighting other keepers are fundamentally different to the point it's become extremely frustrating because they take different teams.  Wild battles and guardian fights focus on a star rating system.  The faster you kill them and the more health your team has left when you succeed, the better your star rating, and more stars equals more rewards (5* a guardian fight for an egg of that guardian).  This encourages building a team that hits hard, fast, and often, and is where I think the game is at its best - many monsters cover this well, and allows for the flexibility the game boasts to shine through.\n\nKeeper fights though...the farther you get in the game, the more these require a very specific kind of team, and that is very inflexible.  Usually a team that cleanses debuffs well and applies their own rather than focusing on the damage.  They become fights of attrition where hitting hard and fast is just straight up not a strategy.  So what this means for you is you'll have a team of monsters that you go through the overworld with and try to build around the star system, only to get stonewalled by a keeper fight and need to go grind up a different team that can out-attrition them.  It's a jarring shift and is my biggest gripe with the game - I did not like needing to bench the roughly dozen monsters I had built up to handle different kinds of fights under the star system to grind up a handful of goblins which out-sustained the keeper at the top of the Sun Tower, for example.  It goes against the \"build what you like\" model and the two types of battles don't mesh at all.  If they had picked one and stuck with it, it would be so much better, even if that meant not having as many \"viable\" monsters.  As is it feels like they made all the monsters, made one battle style, then decided they needed variety for the sake of the monsters that didn't work well under system 1 and made system 2.\n\nNext up on the frustration is the RNG gatekeeping.  The exploration side of a metroidvania is to find the one room with the new powerup you need and then go use it wherever you can.  This is still the case sometimes in Monster Sanctuary and it works well when that's the roadblock.  Just as often though, it's a monster ability you're lacking, and in that case you're now subject to RNG.  Farm the monster fights, hope you did well enough in the star system for decent drops, and then hope you get the egg you need to get the next ability to move on.  It brings the game to a grinding halt, quite literally, especially since monsters only respawn when you clear four other rooms or use a consumable to bring them back.  So if there's 3 rooms with the correct kind of monster, that means, travel time between rooms excluded, you're not actively working on your goal 25% of the time.  (Also I understand that they didn't want to give the starters amazing abilities but it feels really contrived that the Eagle familiar can't figure out how to use greater fly when it's supposed to be the embodiment of the air).\n\nFinally, a minor gripe, but one that seems to be mirrored in other reviews, the platforming is fairly minimal, which feels off for a metroidvania title.  It's a minor thing and I'm not giving the review its thumbs down for that, but I would like to note it.\n\nOverall, Monster Sanctuary is a ton of fun early on.  I really like the character designs, the monsters are more classic JRPG monsters than something like Pokemon or TemTem, but they're charming and I like them on the whole.  Music is solid if really really loud (even when turning it most of the way down in the settings) and the plot has been genuinely interesting if fairly bare bones.  The non-linearity is amazingly well done too, with monsters' levels being set based on how much of the map you've explored rather than area C being level 15 all the time, in case you go and do areas D E and F first.  But the core gameplay loops struggle to be consistent and ultimately causes a lot more frustration than enjoyment...I've tried to play this three times now, and two of the times I've stopped was because of frustration with the core loops not being consistent.  It's so close to being a great game, but the lack of consistency in what battles gauge as being \"successful\" and the forced RNG drop grinding for some of your powerups just keeps making me put it down after a fairly short time playing it.  I'm making progress each time, but not having much fun doing it, so I can't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1642284696, "timestamp_updated": 1642285006, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723742246627807617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108089481": {"recommendationid": "108089481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015032780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 4988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4988, "last_played": 1591096297}, "language": "english", "review": "I concur with many of the negative reviews of the game: The first half is fun enough, but by about the halfway point the scaling on fights becomes skewed.

It's not a metroidvania because the metroidvania aspect of the game is so bare-bones and basically just a substitute for the top-down overworld view of the older pokemon games. Rare is the instance it takes actual skill to accomplish anything in the overworld. The platforming is basic, never challenging, and mostly seems to serve as something to do between the battles. The pokemon-like aspect is also kind of a lie too, because this game lacks the charm and personality that pokemon tends to have. The designs aren't very interesting, for one, even the late-game ones look like... generic JPRG enemies, for all intents and purposes, and as well fighting them just feels like fighting stat machines, not \"oh god another wobuffet\" or \"haha a stunfisk nice\" or \"ooh finally a ralts\" they're just. Enemies. The rest of the aesthetic doesn't have charm either - every area looks fine but it's the most visually basic version of its archetype - grasslands, cave, beach, snowy mountain, etc. and the music is... I just do not like this game's soundfont, I guess, but it all sounds so dry to me. There were maybe one or two area themes I liked and that was about it, the battle theme gets so old because it never, ever changes, even bosses and trainer battles (er, sorry, \"keeper battles\") have one song each that only rarely changes for particularly important encounters (read: like two or three times total, I think). \n\nSo strip away all the metroidvania exploration, all the charm and charisma, and what you have is a very technical JPRG that's mostly based on buffs, buffs, and more buffs. Like sure, try to build a team based on dealing raw damage. You won't, because they forgot to balance DoT effects, to the point where DoTs were dealing more damage that I could manage with standard attacks. And thus every fight devolved into the same loop. Set up buffs, regen, shields, get my infectious poison and burn on every mob, stall for time until they died, maybe attack every so often to speed up the process if I have a chance to. Druid Oak, Vasuki, Stolby, my three-piece disaster team that completely tore through the last 40ish% of the game by themselves to the point where I stopped even using my other monsters entirely. Hey, if it works, it works. The alternative is suffering and losing fights over and over until you sneak out a win, because there's so many systems going on all the time and so many things to keep track of that can all be undermined by an unlucky crit or a miss (evasion is the worst invention of JRPG-kind and should never, ever be implemented, if I attack, I don't miss, okay? It's that easy.)\n\nLike, there was a period where it was kind of fun to play with teams and try to find good builds, but that also slowed down the pace of the game and often lead to worse builds that did less damage less consistently. I almost swapped out Stolby for a Rainbow Blob when I got one of those but, no, it was worse, why change my strategy when my strategy works against literally everything? I'm sure all the speculative teamcrafting and min-maxing is fun for a certain kind of person, but this game is already pretty long for what it is, at some point I was just ready to see it end.\n\nDealing with overworld encounters is so easy and banal that, honestly, they barely feel impactful for anything other than testing out a build, yet there's dozens per area and they respawn way faster than you'd ever want them to. Even the fastest battles will take a minute or two and the longer ones upwards of five, with no actual risk of losing or being challenged, but you need to fight them or else you're going to be underlevelled and underskilled for the keeper fights! I did at one point in the early game have to grind a bit to be able to deal with the first keeper fight, because it comes out of the blue and demolishes you if you're not prepared (you won't be, because nothing else has challenged you at all up to this point). There's no middle ground between \"easy as pie\" and \"frustrating and luck-based\" until you find that winning strat, at which point, again, why change it?\n\nI've seen people complain about the final boss gauntlet of three fights (actually two fights, guys, you can leave the room and come back after the first one to set a checkpoint) and like, yeah, I guess I did forfeit like two turns into the second time my first go around because i messed up setting up and ended up with one of my monsters dead, but because I had The Strategy in place once I did get set up I had no issues whatsoever, and the final final boss is a piece of cake compared to the average keeper fight, too. So the game ends anticlimactically. I guess it feels good to not struggle, but the story wasn't particularly engaging, either. I'm just stubborn.\n\nIf you really like technical, teambuilding RPGs, I guess this game is for you, and for what it's worth the systems in play are very deep and interesting to play around with, it's not really a -bad- game, more of a middle ground that steam doesn't offer, but I'm not the right kind of person for this game and I kind of regret getting suckered into playing it by what it claimed to be on the surface.

Don't go in blind if you don't want to spend a day grinding up a team that looks good on paper, only for it to fall apart before whatever keeper battle or champion monster you are stuck on. It's not so bad with champions, but keeper fights are a torture, and you barely get to leave a room before you are forced to fight another one in the Abandoned Tower (you get sick of them way before that, though). I'm no expert on this game's combat system, I can't even get a single monster that levitates big rocks, but the overabundance of skills that inflict random debuffs (or randomly inflict pre-defined ones), grant random buffs (some of which raise your evasion), cure random debuffs, remove or steal random buffs from enemies, lower the enemy's, or, sometimes, your own monster's accuracy, randomly trigger extra hits and, of course, score criticals makes me suspect that the whole system is actually a barely playable mess. Good luck estimating how much damage your team will be dealing and how much it can take with that in mind, and that's before you account for the combo multiplier that affects the power of your and your opponents' attacks, healing and shields.\n\nHaving to switch monsters all the time while exploring the overworld gets annoying quickly, especially if you also use a riding monster to save a few seconds on the parts where your path isn't obstructed. The only exploration ability that you get to use normally is double jump, for everything else you must wade through your ever growing list of duplicate monster abilities. In a good metroidvania tradition, most, if not all obstacles can only be cleared in a pre-defined way, so invisible platforms, large rocks and equally large pressure plates are only there so that you can add them to your \"To backtrack\" list. You aren't sneaking past them early.\n\nIn case just doing those things being unsatisfying was not enough, your reward for defeating most of the story mode keepers is a random reward box, and the majority of the chests found in the world contain regular upgrade materials (or, sometimes, random reward boxes).\n\nThe game's music is bland, and is sometimes grating to listen to, and so, of course, its soundtrack is sold separately, why not. The story is uninspired, and it only makes the keepers even more annoying and makes you respect the champion monsters more, since at least they don't say anything stupid before or after you defeat them.\n\nThis is how it felt playing it on normal mode without consulting any guides.
