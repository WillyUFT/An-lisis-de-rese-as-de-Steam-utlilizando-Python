Some of them are:\n\n- AI behavior/pathfinding is bad. This is more apparent here than in HL (or Blue Shift for that matter) because you often find yourself with multiple AI allies (sometimes up to 3), whereas in HL you usually only have 1 security guard tagging along. The maps also seem narrower (or they barely account for AI pathfinding issues) and you get frustrating parts where you have to babysit the AI if you want allies to go up something like a circular staircase, only for them to barely act as a meatshield for half a second against enemies that will usually outgun them.\n\n- The game is buggy. Sometimes, reload animations will simply not play. It's easy to get displaced or stuck on terrain (to be fair, this one also happens a bit in HL) or something like the topmost part of a rope.\n\n- Platforming can be frustrating. Just like in HL (all HL games, in fact), ladders can act like magnets. Heat exhausts can kill you if even a single flame particle touches you, and it's easy to misjudge the timing. Rope climbing *works*, but it's rudimentary and subject to bugs like getting stuck when jumping from rope to rope.\n\n- Audio mixing tends to be questionable. There's no voice slider, which means dialogue often is muffled, and all SFX is grouped together, which is bad in chapters like Worlds Collide where the audio levels are fucked and the sound of the boxes being moved around is so COMICALLY LOUD that you have to turn everything down to avoid becoming deaf.\n\n- On hard difficulty, enemies are HP sponges. This exacerbates the issues of certain weapons like the MP5 against human troops: black ops tank almost entire mags at point blank, but you can't afford the time it takes to fire *that much* otherwise you take too much damage in return. So even though you get 9MM ammo from them, you have zero incentive to use the 9MM weapons against them and have to leave the extra ammo unused (or you leave those lying around and backtrack for them later). There's a bad interplay of weapon use because the way of tackling some encounters is to simply quickly gun down big threats with something powerful like the M249 instead of trying to \"trade\" ammo. This either pads out the game (by giving an incentive for needless ammo backtracking) or leaves you with almost no ammo for some portions of it.\n\n\nThe game does have its share of qualities. At its core it's just Half-Life, and it experiments with it (usually successfully) by adding a few mechanics, some fun weapons, and a new story angle. There are some neat ideas underneath the messy execution. This would benefit greatly from a remake that fixes all the issues with the physics, pathfinding, audio shenanigans, etc. I'd love to see another game featuring Adrian too.\n\nIf you already played the other games and this is listed under those 85/90% off deals, then I think it's worth it despite its flaws.

Considering Randy Pitchford made it, Opposing Force is surprisingly competent. Though the last few hours feel like blatant filler, and the boss fight is the biggest waste of time (easily the worst boss in all of the HL series).\n\nThe new weapons are welcome, but the squad concept is half-baked. Other than occasionally healing you, they are there solely to trigger scripted events. The rope physics are utterly broken, but that might just be a consequence of running this over 30 fps. The major problem is that the night-vision filter is the same color as the reticle and the weapon selection menu, so in the dark you not only can't aim, but you also can't see what weapon you are switching to, and this game has a lot of dark spaces. Gearbox didn't do basic QA testing evidently.\n\nUnfortunately, the updated Steam version with widescreen support is broken as of writing, so the game may freeze or crash without warning. I think my save files might be corrupted, but I have no clue since running the game in earlier versions sometimes works. Similar bugs were present in the HL 2 DLC as well. For that reason I wouldn't suggest anyone buy this, sadly. What quality gameplay there is is not worth the headache.

expansion pack that dives deep into the Half-Life universe. Gearbox Software dropped this gem in '99, and it's a whole new angle on the Black Mesa mess.\n\nYou step into the boots of Corporal Adrian Shephard, this soldier caught up in the chaos. His story is happening alongside the original game, giving you a fresh look at all that madness. It's like a new puzzle piece in the Half-Life saga, and it's pretty darn compelling.\n\nThe gameplay, it's got that same intense vibe as the original Half-Life, but with a twist. You're packing new weapons, dealing with fresh enemies, and exploring different places. The level design? Top-notch, man. You're in for both familiar and unknown threats, so it keeps you on your toes.\n\nGearbox Software really nailed it. They kept the Half-Life vibe while putting their own spin on things. You can see the love and attention to detail they poured into this expansion.\n\nReleased in '99, Opposing Forces was a real treat for gamers, giving more of that awesome Half-Life action and expanding the story. If you're a Half-Life fan, this one's a no-brainer.

The graphics are so vivid that I nearly mistook them for my own polished reflection! The gameplay is smoother than a freshly polished spoon handle, and the storyline is as engaging as a royal dinner party.\n\nBut what truly sets this game apart is the incredible community it has fostered. I've made friends from all corners of the globe, and we've shared countless laughs and memories. It's like having a virtual tea party every time I log in, complete with biscuits and good-natured banter.\n\nIn conclusion, dear readers, if you want a gaming experience that's as sweet as sugar and as satisfying as a spoonful of your favorite dessert, this game is the one to savor.

Where is squad was iritaed that they don't know what they are deploying for.

there some problems, like crashing when quick loading around area before final boss, I guess in room with big creates.\nAnd final boss felt too tedius, because it seemed that it is taking too much time, so I thought I'm doing something wrong, then I watched video and found out not only it doesn't need a lot of time to beat, but also I was doing more or less same time what it was in

"review": "THE FOUNDATION OF GAMES\n\nREVIEW 2 of 4.\n\nThis is a mini review of the Half-Life expansion , Opposing Force. \n\nThe game tells a side story where the player impersonates Adrian Shephard, one of the military with the task of eliminating the Black- Mesa project and everyone in it. The game itself is an expansion of the original Half-Life, same graphics, slightly improved voice acting but with localization bugs throughout the game, a rather long story for the price of the expansion, and a rather large variety of levels and weapons. The real strength of this expansion is the variety it grants players compared to the original game, granting several special weapons compared to the original game. As mentioned above, the main problem I encountered concerns the voice acting, which often changes from English to Italian during gameplay, without an in-game option to change the language.\nOverall a great expansion of the game that grants a couple of hours of playthrough.\n", "timestamp_created": 1696870501, "timestamp_updated": 1696870501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147899413": {"recommendationid": "147899413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009960402", "num_games_owned": 913, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1696809978}, "language": "english", "review": "Gearbox did a really solid job of encapsulating what made Half-Life so great - great level design, engaging puzzles, and fun combat encounters.

Adema que esta historia se agranda y se sabe que paso con black mesa y los demas despues de lo que hizo morgoan freman.\nSe expande mas a los soldados (como los verdes y negros) ademas que los nuevos aliens si son un reto.\n\nAlgo malo es que aveces el juego sera injusto y su difilcutad dependera a ponerte muchos de los enemigos mas fuertes del juego esto se ve mucho casi al final.\n\nEl jefe final esta bien honestamente me diverti mas con este que con el del juego original.\n\nEl mini-jefe no estuve tanto a la altura que los tentaculos, ya que los tentaculos si eran muy dificiles y enfadosos y el nuevo mini-jefe lo unico peligroso que te puede hacer es lansarte un rayo laser y ya pero este se puede esquivar facilmente. \n\nEn conclucion 8/10.

It's a much more action oriented game then the original HL, and it adds cool weapons, enemy types and a squad to order around from time to time. I was kind of annoyed that you just leave your team mates when they stop being useful to Shepard, but I get that's the best they could do at the time. I loved all of the additions, you get to see the some events from HL play out from the eyes of Adrian Shepard, and of course you get some easter eggs here and there. The game is a lot harder then the og combat wise, so you get a lot of firs aid kits and ammo. I don't think that I ran low on ammo once in the entire game.

For those that enjoyed the original Half Life but never got around to playing these expansions, or if you are just now trying out these classics for the first time, they are a worthy addition to the Half Life franchise. They aren't long and they suffer from the same negative that Half Life did (poor sound quality, some hit scan enemies to name a few) but they are still good games. These are some of the earlier works from Gearbox and they really did a good job.\nNotes: Set mouse to RAW MOUSE INPUT to fix the weird glitch causing the mouse to bug out and not let you look around. If you are using an ultrawide, good news and bad news. Good news is that the game supports Ultrawides out of the box despite its age. The bad news is that the FOV is CLAUSTROPHOBICALLY NARROW. Like dealbreaking, game ending, always zoomed in bad. Search around online, there is a way to fix that in game.

The same goes for the rope physics, sometimes you're climbing a rope and it works super well. Sometimes it's just annoying.\n\nStory (2/2): It's nothing crazy but definitely a good follow up to the events of OG Half Life. Otherwise creating an entirely new bad ass character, Adrian, who has plenty of important roles to take on over the events of Black Mesa's end. My only curiosity would've been more on the premise- going to kill Gordan Freeman. But... that's why we have Hunt Down the Freeman.\n\nWriting (1.5/2): I'm not gonna say much, I just put this in my usual reviews. But the writing matches the tone and atmosphere we come to expect of Black Mesa. Scientists, Freeman, yadda yadda.\n\nVisuals (1/2): Usual old Half Life art style. I would say the areas introduced throughout the game were all distinctly characterized by new areas of the facility that implement background to enemies. However, I wouldn't say there was anything too notable that I remembered apart from the end zone maybe?\n\nAudio (1.5/2): Score occasionally occurs, motivating you to go pew pew. SFX and voice work top notch and fun. Not all that much to stand out.", "timestamp_created": 1695787019, "timestamp_updated": 1695787019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

En lugar de volver a contar la historia desde la perspectiva de Gordon Freeman, te pone en el papel del sargento Adrian Shephard, un soldado de las Fuerzas Especiales enviadas a Black Mesa en medio del caos. Esta perspectiva fresca permite explorar nuevos aspectos del incidente y entender mejor los eventos que ocurren en paralelo con la historia principal.\n\nLa jugabilidad tambi\u00e9n se enriquece con la inclusi\u00f3n de nuevas armas y enemigos. Opposing Force introduce una variedad de armas \u00fanicas y emocionantes, como el Desert Eagle y el Displacer Cannon, que a\u00f1aden un giro interesante a los enfrentamientos. Los enemigos, incluidos los peligrosos soldados de las Fuerzas Especiales, ofrecen desaf\u00edos adicionales que requieren estrategia y habilidad.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de niveles sigue siendo s\u00f3lido y mantiene la sensaci\u00f3n de estar atrapado en una instalaci\u00f3n de investigaci\u00f3n en ruinas.

"last_played": 1694145106}, "language": "english", "review": "it's hard to call this DLC when it's about the same length as the base game; it feels closer to a sequel than a DLC, which is impressive. That being said, if it were to be graded as a sequel it would fall flat compared to the original.\n\nAlmost all of the game is comprised of new maps and scenarios compared to the original, with a number of new aliens and military personnel to fight against. There's a fairly large amount of new weaponry as well, which is great. As with the base game, though, the new weapons are pretty hit or miss. Out of everything the barnacle hookshot is by far the most interesting addition; it works very well and is a fun tool albeit one that's used sparingly. The new black ops enemies are slightly less obnoxious than the original ones, which is nice. The new alien enemies were pretty roundly terrible; they detect you instantly the moment you enter the room and their projectiles are so fast you don't even have time to react. From a gameplay standpoint the new bosses are better than the ones from the original; the atmosphere of the final boss is much worse than for Nihilanth but the fight itself is much better, even if it's obnoxious how the boss makes no indication that you're doing damage to him once he's vulnerable.\n\nOne of the key gameplay mechanics is the addition of solider NPCs which are more prevalent and useful than the security guards in the original. Generally the NPC soldiers are great in a firefight (I only survived past the midgame because a single soldier tore through every black ops in the rail tunnel for me) but the pathfinding AI is absolutely abysmal. There are several points where you need to drag over an NPC to open a door for you; this is never fun and slows the gameplay down for absolutely no reason because you usually end up abandoning the soldiers right afterward anyway. This is, of course, a problem in the main game too where you have to occasionally bring a scientist over to a door, but it's a much bigger problem here since opening doors takes a solid 10-15 seconds and there's never any real narrative significance behind it. The radios that provide occasional plot were fine early in the game; by the late game it made very little sense for so many soldiers to even still be alive in Black Mesa given the odds stacked against them and how they supposedly had already pulled out.\n\nThe game's biggest fault is in the plot. Bringing the G-Man in to directly intervene in everything feels very off and misses the point of the character; that being said, it was still very early in the series before much had been established. The journey through the facility feels very disjointed; much more than the original, this game feels like a sequence of unrelated levels. The various connections to the original game feel shoehorned in; I would have far preferred to not see Gordon Freeman at any point. It overall feels like it failed to learn many of the innovations that Half-Life taught; I had to google the plot to understand what was actually supposed to be going on, unlike the original where the plot was conveyed intelligently through level design for the most part. \n\nOverall, it was a fun expansion pack of new levels and mechanics and enemies, and for its age is far above average, but it fails to seriously learn from or develop any of the ideas from the main game. 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1694198644, "timestamp_updated": 1694204553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145921813": {"recommendationid": "145921813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174830457", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1694214488}, "language": "english", "review": "i am such an opposing force", "timestamp_created": 1694189367, "timestamp_updated": 1694189367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145917193": {"recommendationid": "145917193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155371438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1694101925}, "language": "english", "review": "Normal", "timestamp_created": 1694184604, "timestamp_updated": 1694184604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145893649": {"recommendationid": "145893649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865869622", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 459, "last_played": 1694149207}, "language": "spanish", "review": "mejor que el hl original", "timestamp_created": 1694149233, "timestamp_updated": 1694149233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145888452": {"recommendationid": "145888452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019143909", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1694139546}, "language": "english", "review": "This was one of the games that shaped my childhood and showed me the way.

Yes, it does have some story, but Opposing Force is more gameplay-oriented rather than story-oriented. Opposing Force expands upon concepts and mechanics that the original Half-Life had, and it does so by adding in new content such as new weapons, new NPCs, new gameplay mechanics and a few other things too. \n\nIf gameplay is the thing you care about most when it comes to a game, then Opposing Force is the expansion pack for you. However, if you care more about story, I'd recommend Blue Shift instead. \n\nAnother thing I absolutely love about Opposing Force is that you don't anything at all about the main protagonist, Adrian Shephard. All you know is that he's a 22 year old H.E.C.U marine corporal. You don't know much about Shephard, but yet you still bond with him and guide him throughout the Black Mesa Research Facility.

Opposing Force, the highly anticipated expansion pack to the revolutionary first-person shooter, Half-Life, brings players back into the captivating world of Black Mesa. Developed by Gearbox Software and published by Sierra Studios, Opposing Force offers an exhilarating new perspective on the events of the original game, delivering intense action, gripping storytelling, and fresh gameplay elements.\n\nSet parallel to the events of Half-Life, Opposing Force casts players in the role of Corporal Adrian Shephard, a member of the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU). Tasked with containing the alien threat at Black Mesa, players witness the chaos unfold from the perspective of the military forces sent to quell the outbreak. This unique viewpoint provides a fascinating contrast to the experiences of Gordon Freeman, the protagonist of Half-Life.\n\nThe expansion manages to maintain the same level of quality and polish that fans came to expect from Half-Life. The graphics, while not revolutionary for its time, still hold up well and effectively capture the eerie atmosphere of Black Mesa's environments. The sound design is equally impressive, with haunting ambient sounds and the chilling cries of alien creatures contributing to the game's immersive atmosphere.\n\nOpposing Force introduces a variety of new weapons and enemies, offering fresh challenges for players to overcome. From the powerful Desert Eagle to the versatile Barnacle Grapple, each addition serves to enhance the gameplay experience. The expansion also introduces new alien species that further expand the lore of the Half-Life universe.\n\nWhere Opposing Force truly shines is in its level design and pacing. The game expertly blends moments of intense combat with periods of exploration and puzzle-solving, ensuring that players are constantly engaged and invested in the unfolding narrative. The set pieces are memorable and the pacing keeps players on the edge of their seats throughout the campaign.\n\nHowever, the expansion is not without its flaws. Some players might find the campaign slightly shorter than the original game, and the story, while engaging, doesn't quite achieve the same level of depth and mystery as Gordon Freeman's journey. Additionally, a few sections can feel frustratingly difficult due to unbalanced enemy encounters.\n\nIn conclusion, Half-Life: Opposing Force successfully expands upon the rich Half-Life universe by offering a fresh perspective and thrilling gameplay. With its engaging storyline, well-crafted levels, and captivating action sequences, this expansion is a must-play for fans of the original game. While it may not surpass the heights of its predecessor, Opposing Force remains a solid addition that enhances the Half-Life experience.", "timestamp_created": 1691918705, "timestamp_updated": 1691918705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144063554": {"recommendationid": "144063554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134700575", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1691942002}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041b\u0423\u0427\u0428\u0410\u042f \u0418\u0413\u0420\u0410 \u0412 \u041c\u0418\u0420\u0415", "timestamp_created": 1691906812, "timestamp_updated": 1691906812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144062762": {"recommendationid": "144062762", "author": {"steamid": "76561199277033880", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1698252384}, "language": "english", "review": "adrian when he said \"FRIENDLY FIRE\" when he has a m249 and kills all headcrabs this is fr me rn", "timestamp_created": 1691905997, "timestamp_updated": 1691906104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144054603": {"recommendationid": "144054603", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467915105", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1691951933}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1691897679, "timestamp_updated": 1691897679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144052289": {"recommendationid": "144052289", "author": {"steamid": "76561199519582226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1700690928}, "language": "english", "review": "A very underrated expansion to amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1691895388, "timestamp_updated": 1691895388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144050677": {"recommendationid": "144050677", "author": {"steamid": "76561199186287930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1692675533}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like the concept of this game.

This game is much more action-focused than the original, with less emphasis on the tricky platforming and fun-ruining chores like the tram level in the middle of the original\u2019s campaign. Opposing Force trims the fat of its predecessor in all the right ways. The story is passible, but having different characters experience the resonance cascade in each pack makes for a complete experience in the original Half-Life.

You play as Adrian Sheppard, one of the military specialists sent to the Black Mesa Research Facility to eliminate Gordon Freeman. This game brings a whole new single player action episode, as well as new alien opponents, weapons and environment.\n\nOne of the great features of Half-Life Opposing Force is the graphics. The level design and the environment of the Black Mesa Research Facility are stunning and very detailed. Not only that, but every weapon and enemy in the game is realistically designed, and makes for an intense gaming experience. The sound effects are also great, the sound of the weapons and the alien noises really add an extra layer of realism to the game.\n\nThe gameplay in Half-Life Opposing Force is great. The single player campaign is fairly long with 10 missions, and each mission is well designed and provides a great challenge. The missions require you to complete objectives, and they have a nice mix of exploration, puzzle solving and combat. The combat in particular is very enjoyable. You will get to use an arsenal of weapons such as assault rifles, shotguns, and sniping rifles. You can also use grenades, tripmines and various other tools to your advantage. The enemy encounters are intense and challenging, and you will have to be very careful to survive the onslaught.\n\nOverall, Half-Life Opposing Force is a great expansion to the original Half-Life game. It has excellent graphics, sound and gameplay, and the various weapons, tools and enemies make it an incredibly immersive experience. If you are a fan of the original Half-Life, then you should definitely give this game a try.

Opposing force has you constantly observe an area you need to get to from afar, and than has you look back at the place you came from, some levels are truly open, while some use this only as a small gimmick, but in general, the interactivity has been greatly expanded. There is a lot more different rooms and interactive gizmos to discover, as well as entire optional scripted sequences. In general, i find myself questioning the areas i inhabit a lot less than i did in the original HL. There is a lot more environmental story telling as well.\nIt's also got new music, and it kicks ass.\nIf you are into multiplayer, this is the expansion that introduced CTF into the formula.\nIt's still got the same jank, some people might argue about canon, some people are pissed off you don't just go around slaughtering everyone, but for those of you who just like Half-Life, this game offers very much the experience you are looking for, and more.", "timestamp_created": 1689953949, "timestamp_updated": 1689953949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142531111": {"recommendationid": "142531111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830205282", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1698423789}, "language": "english", "review": "this is half-life Opposing force", "timestamp_created": 1689953407, "timestamp_updated": 1689953407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142526275": {"recommendationid": "142526275", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072933000", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1691664670}, "language": "english", "review": "NICE.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

It was exciting to revisit the Black Mesa facility and experience the story from a fresh perspective, especially after the immersive army training at the beginning. The first few chapters were enjoyable, even though the graphics and physics were not as impressive as in Black Mesa.\n\nHappiness didn't last very long. Bugs and AI stupidness occupied my gameplay - I got stuck in walls a hell of times, and AI teammates tried to kill me a lot because of some glitchy behaviour. It became so frustrating that I had to force myself to finish the game. But by the end of the game, the gameplay became much more enjoyable, and I am not sure why. There were fewer bugs, and the final boss Gene Worm (nice guy), was a thrilling challenge.\n\nOverall, I found the Opposing Force DLC to be overly tedious and less engaging compared to the main game and Blue Force. While I would recommend it to hardcore fans of Half-Life, I wouldn't suggest it to more casual players like myself. Skipping this DLC in 2023 won't take anything away from your overall Half-Life experience.\n\nUPD: After this review and retrospective view of Blue Shift, I remembered in detail the new mechanics and bosses that Opposing Force introduced.

This is the second time I've played this expansion pack for the half life 1 games. The first time I played it was on my brothers PC and I liked it when it first played it. So pretty much the game takes place at the same time where you play was a soldier that take care of the aliens that have invaded black mesa and it gets more crazy as the game moves on. If you are going to play this game I would recommend doing boot camp because this expansion pack has some add ons that people would like. One being the new weapons like the desert eagle with a red dot and much 2 extra weapons that I wouldn't like to spoil unless people don't want ot be spoiled by anything from the game pack. It tooks me months to finish this game not because of how long it is but because of how hard it is sometimes. There are some new aliens that Gordan Freeman hasn't fought in the game and the new soldiers that just eat your bullets unless you use a more powerful weapon. The story is pretty good since you barely have to listen to it but the pacing in the game I feel like is great. This done by the game studio that made the game Borderlands and If you haven't played borderlands then check it out when you have the time.  Also another thing that I hated in the game is the difficulty. Some parts can be fun but most of the time it can get annoying when you aren't focused on the game or not taking it seriously. For me when it comes to the half life games I would say this one is the hardest one I played so far since I'm sort of going through a game marathon for the half life series (Including the ones many people aren't talking about). Also If warning for people that play this game.

The big additions are new aliens, more guns, and squad tactics. Fight your way through different parts of the base, with a few familiar sites, and deal with the invasion on a different front. \nI\u2019ve always wondered if this was a retcon, where the military suddenly isn\u2019t an antagonist. The plot seems to try to direct it as such, shifting blame despite the events of the base game itself. \nstill, onwards.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] No Xen levels. Beyond a few brief sequences the game is blissfully short of Xen, which is a terrible positive, but it\u2019s still a positive. \n[*] The game feels decidedly Half-Life. It feels put together with the same care and attention to detail as the first, but suffers the same flaws because of it. For its time, though, it made it a strong expansion.\n[*] The new enemies and weapons all feel different and provide a new experience, expanding on the ideas of the base game. They feel well placed, and the only question that pops into my mind is \u2018Where were they?\u2019 Which is a standard issue when trying to fit an expansion inside the very same space as the original.  \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] Saves are bugged, mouse is bugged, game crashes, and when things are running \u2018smoothly\u2019, they aren\u2019t smooth. The game has issues performing at every step and it\u2019s as frustrating as it sounds.\n[*] Friendly fire, isn\u2019t. The clinging to realism, where American soldiers spend more time shooting their allies than enemies, is laudable, but a bit on the chin. It was when one of my squaddies lobbed a grenade directly into the cluster of his team mates, who were in cover and not even in the same direction as the aliens, killing all of them, that I just decided to stop bringing the soldiers along. It improved my battle performance no end. \n[*] The extra weapons led to bloat for me, where I found myself cycling through all the menus looking for the gun I wanted. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]\n [list][*] FIX. THE.

There were a couple plot points that didn't quite make sense to me like why the HECU soldiers were killing the scientists after they crash landed in the original Half-Life and weren't really shown doing that in this game and some other small stuff but overall I liked the further story context this game added to the HECU. I also think the level design was on point (still not as great as Blue Shift but really good and better than the base Half-Life game). It was also really cool how they tried to introduce squad mechanics with your AI teammates (it didn't always work perfectly but it was awesome when it did work). I do wish this game's story interconnected with the main Half-Life story more liked they did with Blue Shift (I really liked the Gordon cameos) but there where still some cool moments like, \"FORGET ABOUT FREEMAN!\".

Opposing Force is a drab, lifeless mod that tries to stuff far too many ideas in to a small amount of play time. In general it feels like amateurs made it and indulged themselves whilst doing it. I'd avoid, as it's not very engaging to play, and play other games/HL mods instead. e.g. Go play 'Echoes' or 'They Hunger'.\n\nIn full:\n\nWhen I played this in my yoot, I loved it. Half-Life was amazing, this was more HL, therefore it was amazing. Though looking back I barely remember anything other than the nightvision and the machine gun. I don't even remember the bosses. Could that be because it's simply been 20 years?\n\nWell, now as I play it, 20 years on, I see how flawed asnd forgettable it is. Playing it on the back of HL1 it feels completely amatuerish. I've played _a lot_ of HL mods and TCs over the years, both single- and multi-player, and this really pales in comparison to a lot of them.\n\nThe mod is completely uninspired. It relies mainly on taking familiar places, set-pieces, weapons and enemies from HL, giving them a slight twist, and then repackaging them for you. However they didn't understand the ethos Valve had when making Half-Life, and this is clear from just the training room, e.g. you're forced to listen to huge amount of cliche drill sergeant chatter, whereas the original HL hazard course practically allowed you to speed run the entire thing. \n\n\nIt's clear when playing Half-Life that a huge amount of love and attention went into each level, making every area feel alive and like a \"real\" place, and a large amount of testing went in to make the subtle cues that direct the player's flow state work like magic. We'd come to know such polish as a hallmark of Valve. \n\nNo such care has been taken with the majority of the levels in this game. OP4 simply does not have the je ne sais quoi of Half-life. The vast majority of the levels are boring, square boxes with the wrong footsteps sounds applied to them and ZERO atmospheric sounds applied. You spend the vast majority of the game clumping around listening to that classic \"half-life concrete footstep\" sounds. It rarely tries to drop those timely music tracks that HL performed so well just before a battle or something interesting. Most of the major \"set piece\" battles were a thrill to take-part in in HL, whereas in OP4 they're just boring shooting galleries. \n\nGearbox also often made that rookie HL mapper mistake of trying to make large open areas, which doesn't work well with HL's BSP tree engine, as it will happily bring a modern computer to it's knees if you give it an open enough arena. So I imagine that's why all of those open arenas are so square and boring -- they were desperate trying to go \"big\" whilst also saving on brushes and portals. Valve knew HL's limitations and allowed them to guide the level design, but I guess Gearbox's short turnaround time on making the game meant they lacked any such experience, and it's obviously something the HL community had yet to learn by the time of OP4's release.\n\nBut even ignoring the engine problems Gearbox show a general lack of experience in designing fun experiences. In general OP4 makes the mistake of adding \"more more more\" without any tact or sense on how to apply that. It's completely misguided and leaves everything feeling crowded. A good example is it adds a large number of weapons and keeps the majority of the old ones. You have fully stocked roster. But you have so many that you can barely use them all before completing the game, and it makes managing battles with HL's inventory a pain as now you have 2 more categories and each category has a million weapons. \n\nThey clearly had more ideas than production budget when developing this mod and it's a classic example of scope creep.\n\nOther short examples of Gearbox's eyes being bigger than their belly: \n\n* \"Let's have them play the soldier!\" Cool. But you completely forget to address the whole \"shooting civilians\" thing. Why is Shepherd nice but the ones we see in HL will happily shoot everything?\n\n* The rope system. You use it like, twice in the entire game. It's a colossal waste of development time and the player's time learning it. It also looks stupid.\n\n* The squad system is fun, but rarely serves any functional purpose.\n\n* The portal gun is beyond useless. It effectively converts 40 uranium into a few health packs or batteries. But after the 5th or so Xen map it starts to recycle them and doesn't even repopulate the spawns, meaning the portal gun's second fire stops being useful 1/3 of the way through the game! But those Xen levels are clearly loaded into each main map, as the portal is instant with no loading, which presumably also contributed to the memory pressure and hence their more drab main environments. The Xen levels themselves are also drab, flat and empty, I assume for the same reason. There's very little Xen flora or fauna when compared to stock Xen.\n\n* Also the Xen levels have the wrong gravity? You don't float as much. \n\n* It added a nightvision mode, in lieu of the flashlight, but it's ugly and useless and the times when it IS requires are really tedious.\n\n* The monsters and weapons themselves are fun, however. Except the two melee weapons. Why add a knife AND a wrench? Especially as the wrench is redundant -- the knife does a better job at killing monsters AND at smashing boxes. There's no need for the wrench. It's just wasteful bloat. But I think they needed to cut most of the original weapons to allow their new ones to shine. \n\n* There were quite a lot of jumping and environmental puzzles. I quite liked them, but they weren't paced well with the combat, so they often felt tedious, and they all took place in those drab boxy environments. They also over-use box-smashing.\n\n* Too much gman, ruining his mystique. \n\nIt's kind of ironic that OP4 adds lots of stuff to HL, but rarely did it add anything worth remembering even 1 hour after playing it, let alone 20 years.", "timestamp_created": 1683754566, "timestamp_updated": 1685444456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473032265901565552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138099742": {"recommendationid": "138099742", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070805090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1683833255}, "language": "english", "review": "us marine propaganda version of hl", "timestamp_created": 1683736544, "timestamp_updated": 1683736544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138080282": {"recommendationid": "138080282", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013055452", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1682820452}, "language": "english", "review": "im sure he became a cute uwu boy after 25 years of doing nothing :3", "timestamp_created": 1683699706, "timestamp_updated": 1683699706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138080077": {"recommendationid": "138080077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045586998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1691943997}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

For one, the platforming has been made much more manageable, as have the difficulty spikes. Some enemies are still damage sponges, but there's a greater variety of foes to defeat, each with wildly different attack patterns and quirks. The story isn't quite as interesting as its source material, but the soldier and security guard NPCs have a lot more character now, each with their own goals and personalities. Enemy placement is tough, but still more manageable than the original Half-Life; bosses and puzzles are more visually interesting and more engaging to figure out than Half-Life as well. This is all-in-all a very enjoyable expansion, and I'm sad that Valve haven't brought back Corporal Shephard or Race-X in any future titles.

useless outside doing a few mandatory grapples. The BFG is just kinda disappointing all you do is travel to some random ass place i xen and get maybe a med-kit and a few shotgun shells, and its attack is also just boring.  the shock roach is like the hive hand but it doesn't track the enemy.  The sniper rifle is just kind of a meh, when i tired playing i would hit the black ops and they would just keep charging at me. The wrench is cool, and actually a really go idea for a melee, but its weighed down by the fact that there are 2 melee weapons. The Saw and desert eagle are fine and are actually a decent inclusion. 2: Most of the enemies are annoying to fight, the pit drones, shock troopers, vortigore, black ops + the bosses. 3: Level design. Now to opposing forces credit when it gets a level right, it gets it right, but most of the time you're fighting your way through a sewer, storage building, storage yard, or a generator room of some kind. all of these places look the same and are boring the few maps that were actually cool were gone in like 3 minutes because they were low to no combat. Also why the hell are there so many elevators in this, within the first 4 chapters you like gotta use 10 elevators and its always like a little platform with a button. 4: Community Praise. Before I even started getting into half life I remember watching multiple videos talking about opposing force and why it was great and that really gave me the idea that it was a fun game to play, So i got real hyped to play it and well it just wasn't that good.", "timestamp_created": 1683349459, "timestamp_updated": 1683349459, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137860266": {"recommendationid": "137860266", "author": {"steamid": "76561199137647064", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 681, "last_played": 1690567361}, "language": "english", "review": "good game. makes you feel like a badass", "timestamp_created": 1683342501, "timestamp_updated": 1683342501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137853302": {"recommendationid": "137853302", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095419695", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1693369600}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved this!!!", "timestamp_created": 1683330055, "timestamp_updated": 1688969974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137851770": {"recommendationid": "137851770", "author": {"steamid": "76561199465610461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1683326753}, "language": "english", "review": "this game 24 years and still no sequel remaster/remake  to this masterpiece \nwhats taking you long valve??!!! \n", "timestamp_created": 1683327413, "timestamp_updated": 1683327413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51792830228805542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137851766": {"recommendationid": "137851766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969448795", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1683327326}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego te da unas vueltas y se supone que es corto, me lo pas\u00e9 por compromiso pero es una verga\npero si te gustan los laberintos, si est\u00e1 bueno", "timestamp_created": 1683327407, "timestamp_updated": 1683327407, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458015263080596924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137842081": {"recommendationid": "137842081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087633585", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 538, "last_played": 1687219002}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice expansion with more weapons and new enemies.

I played this after Blue Shift - Blue Shift was very \"meh\" and quite pedestrian, whereas Opposing Force was a really nice alternative perspective on the Half-Life Black Mesa campaign.\n\nThis really reminded me why I liked the good bits from Half-Life - the gun play is really satisfying, with the variety of weapons making combat varied and interesting. I think overall this was tougher than in Half-Life, and if the campaign was too much longer, maybe IO'd have found it to be a slog. But no one section overstayed its welcome. Even the bits in Xen\u2014which I *really* didn't enjoy in Half-Life\u2014were okay; some of the platforming was frustrating, but again it didn't drag on too long.\n\nThe final boss was, of course, rubbish, and the feedback about doing real damage was a tad too subtle for my taste, but I don't think I faffed around for *toooooo* long not achieving anything.\n\nI encountered some bugs that were a bit annoying - one was where weapons were unselectable, In think because the game didn't deem me to have picked them up (only having the space available in the inventory). This was annoying, but not major or showstopping. I also had the issue with the final teleporter after the final boss & had to select the final [scripted] chapter from the console. I'd have wated less time on this if I knew for certain this was a known bug!!\n\nBut overall, this was really enjoyable, and only made me look back on Half-Life a bit more fondly than I did immediately after playing that game (I really didn't like Xen.....!!)

People adore this game, some going as far as saying it's not just better than the original, but one of, if not, the best game in the series, and I have to be honest, I'm not seeing what everyone else is seeing. Now, don't get me wrong, this is an excellent game, but I don't think it's the flawless masterpiece so many claim it is\n\nThe game is very ambitious, and adds a lot of new stuff. I think all the new weapons are great, but I could not care less for the new enemies. The new alien creatures are much more annoying and tough to kill than most of the originals, and I already hated the assassins, so fighting the black ops is always an absolute chore, made even worse by the fact that, unlike Half-Life, they are very common, and are mixed in with aliens at times.  These new enemies made me dread combat in general, which is sad because the new guns are probably my favorite aspect of this expansion\n\nEnough negativity tho, there's much more positive here than negative. Level design is pretty solid, and feels very fresh. There's even some areas returning from the original Half-Life. Sure, the combat that takes place in them may make me want to never touch a videogame again, but the areas themselves are very cool and well designed. You also get help from your fellow marines, along with Black Mesa personel (mainly because Shephard didn't know he was meant to kill them.) It results in a game that makes you feel far less lonely, since you pretty much always have a buddy not too far away. Plus, the matines have great path finding, always have fun dialogue, and are genuinely useful in combat, along with being necessary for progression. The game is also much shorter than Half-Life, but is still longer than Blue Shift, landing in that perfect little sweet spot, at around the 5 hour mark for a casual playthrough. The campaign is also designed to be a mirror of Half-Life's, so you get a version of all your classic Half-Life set pieces, like the blast pit or Xen, while still distinguishing itself from the original\n\nIn general, I like Opposing Force, but I can't bring myself to love it. Personally, the combat is way too annoying, which is a big issue for an FPS game. That being said, it's a great game, and I wouldn't blame anyone for finding it better than the original, despite how much I dislike big aspects of it.

It adds many new features to the game and continues building on the plot in a such a way that skipping it doesn\u2019t hinder your understanding of the next entry.\n\nThe platoon mechanic is a neat idea, but a lot of its potential seems to be hindered by scripted events and navigational issues. Very rarely did a soldier follow me for more than a few corridors, let alone entire missions. I suppose I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, though. After all, the game\u2019s a quarter-century old and was already pushing the boundaries of the genre as a whole. Still, it's a little disappointing. In similar respects, the rope is also a cool addition, albeit extremely buggy. The grappling hook is another great addition. I think what I\u2019m most surprised by is the fact that the devs remembered to add segments involving these features all throughout the game.\n\nThe expansion does have a few issues, though. The night vision goggles are a cool alternative to the flashlight, but in just about every scenario, you\u2019ll end up turning it on for one short vent system, then turning it off again immediately after. The only time you\u2019ll ever use it for an extended period is during the chapter \u2018Foxtrot Uniform\u2019, which is where I feel the expansion starts showing a massive decline in quality. Much like the original game, the last few chapters are very poorly designed. What you\u2019ll find is essentially back-to-back gauntlets consisting of high-level enemies, all of which are severely lacking in ammo and even more so in health. It isn\u2019t fun in any way and I hope whoever was responsible for coming up with the idea was given a stern talking to and forced to undergo a comprehensive shortcourse on level design.\n\nOne thing I\u2019m a little curious about is in regards to the Powered Combat Vest. The tutorial showcases four different charging methods for this item, but during the course of the game, I didn\u2019t find any commercial charging stations at all, and was only able to locate one military charging station. Maybe I didn\u2019t look hard enough, maybe they just forgot. Either way, thought it was worth jotting down.\n\nOverall, pretty enjoyable experience.

Opposing force has some fun weapons and is a neat side story to the original Half-Life that is fun for the first few hours.\n \nAfter about the halfway point there isn't a single enemy encounter that isn't incredibly annoying with either way too many enemies thrown at you, too many overpowered enemies in one spot or just generally not giving you enough health pickups. All the difficulty feels either unfair or artificially induced from going to fights few little HP.\n\nWhile the new weapons are fun, they're incredibly situational and mostly not as fun as what was in base HL. Also many seem to overlap in function far too much with other weapons in the game or are not distinct enough from the weapons they replaced from base HL. Overall the weapon sandbox feels a little confused and poorly thought out.\n\nOnly two of the new enemy types are remotely fun to fight, with the more fun of the two being hardly utilized. The others put the base game's most obnoxious foes to shame by a mile\n\nTo top it off the final boss is (admittedly far less annoying than base HL's) incredibly lame and far too easy\n\nIf you are in a pinch and desperate for more Half-life I suppose it would do, it's not awful.

The story is as simple as every other Half-Life game of its time, but with important additions. For instance, it expands on how the other side dealt with the situation and poses more questions about [spoiler]the nature of G-Man and the true importance of black mesa research.[/spoiler]\n\nThe gameplay has the same foundation, but with the flashlight being replaced by night vision, which can be slightly annoying to the eyes. Additionally, the game allows you to have more than one NPC following you. As mentioned before, there are new guns, some bad, some very good.

Mesa.\n\nLos cient\u00edficos y los guardias de seguridad que sobreviven luchan para escaparse. Respondiendo r\u00e1pidamente, los militares de Estados Unidos inician una operaci\u00f3n masiva de \u201climpieza\u201d para suprimir la presencia extraterrestre en el Black Mesa as\u00ed como \u201csilenciar\u201d cualquier testigo. Cuando el juego comienza, el protagonista Adrian Shephard es parte de esta operaci\u00f3n. Despu\u00e9s de que su avi\u00f3n de transporte sea derribado y que el resto de su unidad muera, se aborta la misi\u00f3n de \u201climpieza\u201d y Shephard re\u00fane fuerzas con los supervivientes dispersados que buscan escape.\n\nEn su camino se encontrar\u00e1 con una hasta ahora desconocida raza, la \"Raza X\". Una raza hostil tanto a los humanos como a algunos tipos de Xenianos.\n\nMientras que la batalla comienza a favorecer al ej\u00e9rcito extraterrestre, Shephard observa que las fuerzas militares han ordenado salir de all\u00ed. Las fuerzas de los Black Ops (vistos vagamente en el primer juego) est\u00e1n actuando independientemente de los infantes de marina; siendo enemigos tanto de HECU como de Black Mesa y los Xenianos; tratan de controlar la situaci\u00f3n; pero esto claramente no es posible, y deciden hacer detonar Black Mesa con una bomba termonuclear. Shephard desactiva la bomba pero ve m\u00e1s adelante a G-Man que la reactiva.\n\nLuego de que el protagonista Adrian Shephard logra vencer al extraterrestre proveniente de Xen \u00e9ste es teletransportado a un avi\u00f3n (Osprey) similar al cual viajaba Adrian junto con otros cabos al principio, donde tambi\u00e9n se encuentra G-Man y le explica que debe dejarlo detenido en un lugar donde \u00e9l no pueda revelar nada de lo ocurrido en los Laboratorios de Black Mesa.\n\nExcelente extensi\u00f3n 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1679880839, "timestamp_updated": 1679880839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135518064": {"recommendationid": "135518064", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996445636", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1567484007}, "language": "english", "review": "This Half-Life is a little odd. Gearbox Software and Valve Software are credited as co-creators of the game, but the game does not live up to the quality level set by the original Half-Life, or even the Half-Life expansion Half-Life: Blue-Shift of which I am a big fan. You reach a point in the game where you are fighting against are very strong aliens who don\u2019t die easily, and you can\u2019t even replenish your ammunition. Also during these moments, health pick-ups are rare. You\u2019re facing marines more powerful than you. You pour bullets into them, but they\u2019re still standing and shooting you. Though it seems alright at the start, the expansion pack really isn\u2019t worth loading.\n\nWhile the original Half-Life had serious puzzle solving, there is basically one puzzle in this game, though it was fun to solve. The final boss is neat, although amazingly, the game will not finish with OpenGL graphics selected. I was playing on Linux, and switched to the Windows machine to see the ending because the end of the game just doesn\u2019t happen on Linux. I would have expected much better bug testing for such a high-profile franchise. Surely they could have made a patch?\n\nAlso disappointing are the lack of good music tracks. The original Half-Life was ahead of its time with quality techno / electronica, but I remember only one half-decent track, and that was all. Graphics are on par with the original, as you would expect.\n\nThis is my least favorite Half-Life.", "timestamp_created": 1679879865, "timestamp_updated": 1679879865, "voted_up": false, "votes_up":

The beginning, of course, is boring due to being forced to wait around pointlessly, but after that it's all pretty action-packed with some really good set pieces.\n\nMinus a few hitscanner-heavy areas, it was all good fun and it did a good job stringing me along to the finish line. And that's a feat, because my patience is thin due to having a backlog with 400 games in it. I didn't expect to finish it, as I had originally intended on Alt+F4-ing during the intro helicopter ride and then telling myself I had given it the 'ole college try so that I could cross it off my backlog.\n\nSo would I recommend buying this, or playing this?

Environments are drab and boring: you're constantly wandering around a grey corridor listening to the same 1-second clip of electricity crackling. Very poor sense of atmosphere.\n\n2. \"Puzzles\" are both cryptic and mind-numbing: often-times the solution to clearing a room is simply waiting for a scripted event to finish.\n\n3. Horrible jump vertical: you need to crouch-jump to overcome a milk carton. Surely a soldier is more athletic than this? I know crouch-jump is in the original, but this game makes you jump on boxes constantly. \n\n4. Feels like a chore to play: I'm not given any motive except getting out of the aforementioned boring environments. \n\n5. I HATE the wrench. \n\nPositives:\n\n1. New enemies are sort of cool. \n\n2.

still held in high regard by many gamers. That's right, I'm talking about Half-Life: Opposing Force. Now, before we dive into this, I have to say that I'm a huge fan of the original Half-Life game. It's one of the greatest first-person shooters ever made, and it's still a blast to play today. So, naturally, I was excited to check out Opposing Force and see if it could live up to the high standards set by the original game.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the story. In Opposing Force, you play as Adrian Shephard, a member of the military sent in to clean up the mess caused by Gordon Freeman in the original game. The game takes place in the same setting as the original game, but you'll be exploring new areas and encountering new enemies.\n\nOne thing that Opposing Force does really well is the way it expands on the lore of the Half-Life universe. You'll get to see more of the Black Mesa facility and learn more about the creatures that inhabit it. It's a nice touch that adds more depth to the world. But let's get to the gameplay. Opposing Force sticks to the same formula as the original game, with plenty of exploration, puzzles, and shooting. And I have to say, the shooting is just as satisfying as ever. The weapons all feel great to use, and the enemies are challenging without being frustrating.\n\nThe game also introduces some new gameplay mechanics, such as a grappling hook and a few new weapons. These additions are welcome, but they don't fundamentally change the gameplay in any significant way. They're just nice touches that add some variety to the experience.\n\nNow, I do have to say that Opposing Force isn't perfect. There are a few moments where the game drags on a bit too long, and the final boss fight is a bit underwhelming. But these are minor quibbles in an otherwise fantastic game.\n\nIn conclusion, Half-Life: Opposing Force is a worthy companion piece to the original game.

"language": "english", "review": "I'm not even really sure where to begin when reviewing a game like this. It's a real mixed bag, and complain as people may that Blue Shift wasn't as good, this game isn't so perfect either. I'll start by saying it's a really solid expansion pack for Half-Life, but I'll also add it's a seriously overambitious one as well. You'd think Gearbox were trying to make a full-on sequel! The main story goes on for a very long time, but this is hardly a bad thing. The amount of weapons you get is a little staggering, and I would have definitely cut out a decent portion of them. Do I really need a big, clunky wrench for two minutes before you give me the far superior knife anyway? And what's more, you even get new enemies to fight. Like I said, the game is overambitious, and also takes some liberties with the plot as well. (G-man seems to actively step into certain situations to either aid or impede the player, the Race X aliens are never seen/mentioned in any other Half-Life game, and we even witness the facility get freaking nuked.) \nI think my biggest issues with this expansion is its unbearable difficulty. I've beaten this game on hard, but even playing on medium is really unforgiving. Yeah, it's one of those games where they give you little to no health all the way through, but the odds are almost balanced out with all your weapons and ammo. But the brutal enemies (seriously, to hell with those shock troopers) mixed with some really basic, uninteresting level design only serve to piss me off. \nI do applaud the really close attention to detail here and there however - it's as though Gearbox realised how vivid Valve's game was and they wanted to mirror that. Once again though, they might have gone a little overboard. \nAdrian Shephard is quite an interesting character, probably second only to Gordon Freeman himself in levels of badass-ness. But enjoy him while he lasts here, because it's the last we'll ever see of him. \nI used to hold a big grudge against this game for its difficulty and very irritating Goldsource checkpoints that always seem to put you back twenty minutes, but I will admit it's better than Blue Shift. And not that it needed it, but we even have a multiplayer mode that is unfortunately dead. Some of the maps are really quite interesting, and for the first time we can even get a shot at playing capture-the-flag in Half-Life. \nI think what I'm trying to say is that Opposing Force has a ton of cool stuff - weapons, characters, a compelling story, cool enemies - but it perhaps goes a little too far. It is just an expansion at the end of the day, and I would still always recommend the main game over this in a heartbeat. Ironically, it's probably still the best game that Gearbox ever managed to produce, which is... depressing... but as a Half-Life game it really does excel.", "timestamp_created": 1676814142, "timestamp_updated": 1676814333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133118428": {"recommendationid": "133118428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970470794", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1676760424}, "language": "english", "review": "Otis is so god damn underrated.

All 3 campaigns happen concurrently and you see bits and pieces of the other events from the perspective of the one you're in, often passing through the same locations at different times and different ways.
