La persona con la que nosotros hablamos dentro del juego a trav\u00e9s de mensajes crea portales a los archivos principales, con los que se puede interactuar.

In this game you face Satan himself, who in this reality is a crappy game developer trying to gather souls through microtransactions and shareware in his terrible products. I love the concept, just imagining the lord of hell hastily adjusting his hackjob code in the middle of you playing - he's even being really polite about it! Okay, most of the time. At the end of the day, you still have to break everything, there is no other route around it (and that's fine).\n\nBecause of the premise, gameplay isn't really all that sophisticated, but it's surprisingly good. Navigating the system is kind of like a point n click game, you're rewarded for your keen eye as you look for details and pay attention to chat dialogue. The \"actual\" Pony Island game is an endless runner of sorts, just very simple. But I think the best part are the puzzle segments with coding (and, uh, butterflies). Starts very basic, but quickly builds up into REALLY testing your brain. That last puzzle is an absolute monster, and even after beating it twice I still can't tell you how I did it, and looking up videos online of others trying to provide a solution showed to me that I'm not alone in that impression.\n\nVisuals are easy to trivialize as run of the mill faux-retro pixel art, but if you soldier on and pass at least the first act, it's easy to see that that's not really the case - it's a conscious direction to convey the setting. Certain scenes clearly show that yes, the creator(s?) of the game CAN do good graphics, it's just that Lucifer isn't too hot at it. Music, however, though often absent in favor of an ominous humming of the game cabinet, is pretty solid all over. It's comforting to know that at the very least, the devil is decent at making chiptunes (unless they're stolen lol).\n\nLastly, I really like how many secrets are hidden here, despite Pony Island's short length. There's an additional thing to do at just about every corner, and a lot of these serve to expand on the plot in a cool way (or make a reference to the opening of Malcolm in the Middle, which is cool too I guess). However, just like Undertale, this game also will make you question if 100%ing the game is the right thing to do... but fortunately isn't as harsh and unforgiving about it. Again, at the end of the day it's still a game, so I actually like this approach better (and yes I did 100% it). Though maybe because of its short length, I found it hard to care about the characters.\n\nStill, it was a fun experience and even though indie gaming has seen a lot of similar stuff in this age, I nonetheless recommend you try it too.

Time to write a review for this game. Wow what a journey. It was awesome. I cannot believe that one person was able to get me to play what I consider a masterpiece. Daniel Mullins, you always make such great, detailed, and masterfully intertwined games. Everything that occurred in this game had a reason to do so, everyone that did something in the game had their own motives, and the player themselves even had their own backstory. I always love a game that refers to religion, historical events, or some other thing that occurred in real life as some part of it's story.

not\n\ngetting wings cause when you did\"nt saw a pony with wings\n\nand this is all\nreally\nthis all after it just a filler to gain enough letters so i could look smarter\n\nnow that i showed you how smart and funny i am\nill get into the review itself\n\njust a little disclaimer\nthe stories it self is quite damb but what that carries him is first of all how it telling him\nand the idea of how it telling him\nand i know it the exact same phrase putted otherway\nbut ill just start off\nthe games story is working in layers\ntheres the damb and over the top story of a \"soul\" who got trapped because of a game\nand theres the other soul whoose also got trapped and helps him get out by finding week spots in the computer and destroying the core of it\nand they doing this by traversing through games which got weirder and weirder as they got more deeper into beating the cores\nand somhow when they finnaly beat the last one he got freed\n\nbut its not just it\nthe game also has another story\na story which i really like the idea of\nis a story about a game frenchise\na forgotten/obscure frenchise who slowly got weirder and weirder\nas the creator got desperate desperate cause what we all want in life\njust someone to expirment what his done\nbut also to ignore what he dosent want\nand it shown magnificlly in one scene\n\nsoo this story is kinda like that\nit stared by a regular wholesome simple game kinda like dino whoose the great protag is a pony who jumps around to not get crushed a stick\nor somthing i really dont know how its called\nand through all those games its changed\nits get a laser beam\nits get wings\ngets actual levels\nand a fuuny little charecter whoose just very accidently being called lovey\nand being a little bit similar to another charecter\nbut its really not metter\nits get bosses\nits get depth(like 3d)\n\nits actully really cool in this frenchise you can kill both the satan and jesus\nand all of those games combiend really tell a full story about a game frenchise who changes\nand showing the psyche of the creator and its desendence\n\nwhat what ill say\npicture a game which really close to your heart\n(but it have to be running or runned series then it\"ll not work)\nand take all those games\njust exaturate the main vibe and idea behind the game\nand crunch it into a hour and a half game\nand you'll get this\nits somthing which not played for its story\neven not for its gameplay\nits something you play for the expirmence\nand this game is really a one of a kind piece of art\n\nedit:kinda like this review\nbtw im so funny.", "timestamp_created": 1688264660, "timestamp_updated": 1688264660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

With Pony Island, you can see the genius that led to Inscryption (one of my favorite games of all time). \n\nThe humor is especially strong in this one--I LOLed quite a bit. My favorite gag was [spoiler] \"You killed Jesus!\"  bwahahaha [/spoiler]. Like other games in what I loosely call the \"fourth wall breaking\" genre (see: This Is Not a Game, Stanley Parable, Liminal), this game never lets you forget that you are playing a game, with the purpose being to destroy the game as you are playing it. The use of Jesus/Lucifer was fun, although I think Mullins did well in getting rid of the religious iconography and moving into a more fantasy direction with Inscryption. \n\nAt one point, the game did a total gotcha! to me--I was 100% startled. For those who've already played: [spoiler] When it pretended to be a friend on my Steam Friends' list, I literally closed the game and went into my Steam privacy settings, because I was freaked out that anyone could be watching me play a game. When I realized it was a trick, I shook my head in chagrin. He did something similar in Inscryption, but I'd forgotten it was possible! [/spoiler].\n\nThere's a distinct quality to Mullins' games that I haven't found anywhere else--a wry sarcasm, a humor that plays on gamers' expectations for a game. It's oddly comforting. Unlike so many other games, you can't predict what's going to happen next, and what does happen is usually something you would never, in a million years, have considered. The creativity and originality of it is mind-boggling.  \n\nIf you dig indie gems, try this one (and Inscryption, obvs).", "timestamp_created": 1685669449, "timestamp_updated": 1685669449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576719582080841064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139320993": {"recommendationid": "139320993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024959108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131, "last_played": 1638305186}, "language": "english", "review": "Very lovely to play a game filled with clever and compelling ideas, and which is clever enough to deliver them in a focused package, before you can get bored of them, like a quick punch to the nose.", "timestamp_created": 1685543500, "timestamp_updated": 1685543500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139318806": {"recommendationid": "139318806", "author": {"steamid": "76561199128858435", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1685541177}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting meta esque game", "timestamp_created": 1685540813, "timestamp_updated": 1685540813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139288122": {"recommendationid": "139288122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043568683", "num_games_owned": 1289, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 375, "last_played": 1685483339}, "language": "english", "review": "just crazy", "timestamp_created": 1685485244, "timestamp_updated": 1685485244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139282109": {"recommendationid": "139282109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358245276", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1685475542}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished the game with a smile on my face, EPIC GAME!

With its unique blend of genres, unexpected twists, and distinctive presentation, Pony Island captivates players from start to finish, leaving them contemplating its enigmatic charm. While not without a few minor hiccups, it is undoubtedly an experience worth undertaking, earning a solid score of 4/5.\n\nAt first glance, Pony Island appears to be a simple and innocent arcade game featuring adorable ponies. However, beneath its seemingly innocent exterior lies a dark and twisted narrative that unfolds in ways you could never anticipate. The game takes pleasure in subverting expectations, constantly challenging and engaging players with its clever puzzles and unconventional mechanics.\n\nThe gameplay of Pony Island is refreshingly unique. It blends elements of classic arcade games with puzzle-solving and a touch of meta-narrative. Maneuvering through the glitchy and glitch-filled levels, you'll encounter obstacles, riddles, and unexpected surprises that keep you on your toes. The way Pony Island subverts traditional gameplay conventions and breaks the fourth wall is a stroke of genius, creating a truly immersive experience.\n\nThe storytelling in Pony Island is where the game truly shines. It cleverly weaves a mysterious and thought-provoking narrative that keeps you engaged throughout. The way it incorporates themes of technology, mythology, and existentialism is intriguing, often leaving players questioning the nature of their own reality. The game's plot twists and unexpected revelations are delivered with finesse, providing a memorable and satisfying experience.\n\nVisually, Pony Island employs a retro aesthetic that pays homage to the classic arcade era. The pixel art style, combined with glitch effects and eerie atmosphere, creates a distinct and memorable ambiance. The sound design complements the visuals perfectly, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that enhances the game's overall tone.\n\nWhile Pony Island is a remarkable experience, it does have a few minor shortcomings. Some puzzles and mechanics may feel repetitive after a while, and a few segments could benefit from further refinement to maintain a consistent level of engagement. However, these minor flaws are overshadowed by the game's overall uniqueness and creativity.\n\nIn conclusion, Pony Island is an indie gem that pushes the boundaries of traditional gaming. Its unconventional narrative, inventive gameplay mechanics, and distinctive visual style make it a captivating and memorable experience. With its intriguing twists and thought-provoking themes, Pony Island stands as a shining example of indie game innovation.

So, with absolutely no idea or preconceptions, I opened up Pony Island. Here's a few non-spoilery feelings about it.\n\nReally Good: If you enjoyed the mind of Daniel Mullins in a game like Inscryption, you'll love the overall feel of the game. The plot points feel like something you would expect from on of Daniel's games, and that's not a bad thing at all. The mood and the personality of the game were pretty cool. DM's trademark dark humor and attention to detail is here. I really liked the very very end. (no spoilers)\n\nThe Kinda Good: I really enjoyed the puzzles (at first - more on this later) and felt that going through the code of the game was quite interesting. The gameplay was easy to learn and understand (more on this later, too!). \n\nThe \"ugh\": The puzzles become very repetitive towards the end. While the puzzle idea is novel, and the puzzles offer a nice degree of challenge, they become a chore towards the end, and I rolled my eyes when I had to play them. Luckily, this only happened towards the end of the run. The gameplay was perfectly fine, and while I realize the importance of (basically) repeating the same thing over and over again, it didn't make for a really satisfying game play.\n\nThe \"I wish\": I know this game came out nearly 7 years ago. I firmly believe that Daniel, knowing what he knows now, would be able to make this game an absolutely legendary game. \n\nOn its own, it's definitely worth a punt, especially if you're a fan of Daniel Mullins or you don't mind interesting puzzles (that may get a bit repetitive towards the end).

Like being fooled by the tag \"Psychological Horror\"? Like being tricked this is one of those games that fuck with you like When the darkness comes or (it's lesser doublet) Stanley Parable? Well spoiler, this ain't. After you strip away the pretentiousness (better use a spatula, or a blowtorch...), it's a basic mini-game collection with a lot of annoying parts (especially that last butterfly puzzle and the Beelzebub fight that NEEDS TO HAVE A FUCKING HEALTH METER) you really don't want to play in the year 20XX (hell the Atari 2600 had better games than the minigames in this one, and with a scoring system too). The story is passable, but certainly nothing special \u2013 and that's the real downfall of this game. For a story like e.g. Portal, I am willing to suffer through bad and boring gameplay (the gameplay in Portal did inded get really old and annoying in the second one, for the record), but not for something that turns more nondescript and generic the longer it goes on. Pony or Satan (who only spouts some generic platitudes and can't even be called a character despite being the vague villain of this game), nothing means anything to me or leaves any impression on me here! And of course, there's the tiresome \"collect tickets hidden literally everywhere in the game\" achievement that forces you to replay the game if you actually want to experience it for yourself the first time you play it (like I as a gamer usually do \u2013 minus the overly hard puzzles that would take away too much of my time and brain cells) and not just follow the guide to a T the first time (which definitely is the better strategy for the true achievement hunter). That would be ok if this game had replay value... but yeah... nope.\n\nDespite what I said, this would still be a sideways thumb if Steam allowed that, as the structure of the game is still pretty creative (though the \"pony\" trope is everything but), but alas, as Steam is as black and white as [insert political comparison relating to America in the 2010s+ here] it's a thumb down. Truly a sign of the times.\n\nBtw, I would've been literally stuck on the \"text adventure\" screen cause I didn't know how to go back to the menu, and apparently (unlike in ANY actual text adventure ever made, or DOS for that matter), you cannot have the screen repeat itself so you can see the list of commands again) if I hadn't looked up the situation in a video guide. Your call whether that's a \"Did not do the research\", or \"Did they even test this game before they released it?\" Thank Satan for creating the internet...\n\nPS: Do try out When the darkness comes.

Sin embargo, r\u00e1pidamente se convierte en una experiencia mucho m\u00e1s profunda y surrealista. El jugador se encontrar\u00e1 desafiado a resolver puzles ingeniosos, interactuar con el propio sistema del juego y sumergirse en una narrativa meta que trasciende los l\u00edmites de la pantalla.\n\nNarrativa y atm\u00f3sfera:\nLa narrativa de Pony Island es uno de los aspectos m\u00e1s fascinantes del juego. A medida que el jugador avanza, se descubre una historia oscura y retorcida, llena de giros sorprendentes y momentos desconcertantes. La trama se construye cuidadosamente para mantener al jugador en suspenso y pregunt\u00e1ndose qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 sucediendo realmente en el mundo del juego. La cuarta pared se rompe de manera creativa y constante, a\u00f1adiendo capas adicionales de intriga a medida que la narrativa se adentra en temas existenciales y filos\u00f3ficos.\n\nEl juego logra una atm\u00f3sfera inquietante y opresiva, gracias a su estilo visual y sonoro. El dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico combina elementos retro con efectos visuales sorprendentes que juegan con la percepci\u00f3n del jugador, mientras que la m\u00fasica acompa\u00f1a perfectamente la atm\u00f3sfera, alternando entre melod\u00edas encantadoras y tonos oscuros y perturbadores.\n\nJugabilidad y dise\u00f1o de niveles:\nLa jugabilidad de Pony Island est\u00e1 compuesta por una serie de ingeniosos rompecabezas y desaf\u00edos de plataformas que deben superarse para avanzar en la historia. La mec\u00e1nica del juego se mezcla con la narrativa, creando una experiencia inmersiva y \u00fanica que desaf\u00eda constantemente al jugador a pensar de manera creativa y fuera de lo convencional. Cada nivel presenta nuevos obst\u00e1culos y sorpresas, manteniendo la frescura y la emoci\u00f3n en cada etapa.\n\nOriginalidad y metaficci\u00f3n:\nPony Island es un ejemplo sobresaliente de metaficci\u00f3n en los videojuegos. A trav\u00e9s de su narrativa y mec\u00e1nicas de juego, el juego desaf\u00eda la noci\u00f3n tradicional de lo que es un videojuego y cuestiona la realidad misma. La originalidad radica en c\u00f3mo se mezclan los diferentes g\u00e9neros y elementos, as\u00ed como en la forma en que el juego involucra activamente al jugador en la experiencia y la historia.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n:\nPony Island es un t\u00edtulo imprescindible para aquellos que buscan una experiencia de juego fuera de lo com\u00fan. Con una narrativa intrigante, una atm\u00f3sfera inquietante y una jugabilidad innovadora, el juego lleva al jugador a un viaje surrealista y filos\u00f3fico que desaf\u00eda las expectativas. Su originalidad, ingenio y capacidad para sumergir al jugador en un mundo desconcertante lo convierten en un videojuego que deja una impresi\u00f3n duradera y que ser\u00e1 recordado como una obra maestra de la metaficci\u00f3n en el mundo de los videojuegos.", "timestamp_created": 1668024137, "timestamp_updated": 1691019328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125202468": {"recommendationid": "125202468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190380543", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 598, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1668002933}, "language": "english", "review": "Pony Island is a weird but brilliant game where you try to escape an arcade machine.

A puzzle adventure game, with multiple layers and an abundance of hidden easter eggs - all accompanied by many achievements.\n\nOn the surface it is a runner game, booted up on an old arcade machine owned by the devil himself. You are set forth with discovering who you are/were and destroying said machine.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and the sound effects do not pose as annoyingly repetitive. The art style is adorable, with multiple changes throughout the game. Game is split into multiple acts, each with its own unique take. Main controls are \n your mouse, although you are confronted with an interactive chat which helped to completely break the fourth wall and immerse yourself within the game.\n\nPony Island was not too difficult and is easily completed within 2-3 hours. Pony Island could be seen as somewhat repetitive at times, although each act has a fresh new look. I went back and thoroughly played through to ensure I found all the tickets, and any hidden easter eggs - this is also well catered to as you have access to each individual act/boss fight which prevents you from having to restart the entire game to gain certain achievements. Achievements are mostly easily obtainable apart from the hidden ones. The game does not require you to do any grinding for the achievements.\n\nLabelled as a horror, it does have certain horror elements although would not call it horror. From the beginning of the game, up until the end, your expectations are completely unpredictable as the game is consistently evolving. The cheap price tag that comes with this gem, compared to the large amounts of mass produced asset-flips on the Steam store with a dearer price - makes this game a must buy.

It\u2019s the fact that the game runs on an arcade machine possessed by the devil himself that earns its horror tag. \u201cWorks as intended\u201d phrase is quickly put in unique context as the game twists and bends to the whim of a moody influence behind it. While mild in its fear factor, Pony Island is full of unorthodox creativity and delivers its ideas with truly impressive ingenuity. Curiosity of what the devs came up with next is enough to keep the player seated throughout the game\u2019s runtime.\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2873715716[/url]\n[b][i]ERMAC[/i] wins[/b]\nOne would struggle to find a better caption regarding Pony Island than the one present on the game\u2019s own store page \u2013 \u201cIt is not a game about ponies\u201d. While keeping things as ambiguous as humanly possible, it conveys the core idea of the game. The fence-jumping pony is merely a point of reference, used to show the player a game that twists and falls apart as the story progresses. The true gameplay would be solving a set of puzzles portraying the player\u2019s interference with the Pony Island\u2019s code, that while making the progress possible, also makes it increasingly unstable. Well, the title being possessed may also have something to do with that particular aspect.\n\nWhile some may find the game\u2019s distorted imagery slightly unnerving, its horror elements are downright negligible. To my eyes Pony Island is foremost a love letter to glitches. In a faraway land of the 90\u2019s, when games often pushed technological boundaries of their respective systems, their capacity for short-lived or even one-time issues was substantial. Without widespread internet to patch the thing or distribute the news, these glitches often had an air of mystery surrounding them. Was it a simple error, or perhaps a hidden character in your favourite fighting game, whose means of unlocking are yet to be discovered? More than anything else, Pony Island pays a tribute to glitches\u2019 role in creating gaming\u2019s own set of urban legends. A nod to something nowadays almost entirely lost to technological advancement.\n\n[b]Settings>Advanced Settings>Enable Free Will[/b]\nReference-laced gameplay would be more than enough to fill the game\u2019s roughly 3-hours long runtime, yet this title goes on an extra mile with a layer of delightfully self-conscious humour worked into it. As it evolves throughout its playtime, Pony Island continuously toys around with its own formula in increasingly creative fashion (nausea-inducing Pony 3D blew me away). Furthermore, this title smuggles in more than a few jabs at both notion of the game development and how the player\u2019s interaction with the game gives a meaning and context to its message. Pony Island pitches a couple of thought-provoking ideas if you are willing to read into it a little, turning this title into something much more universal than a throwback to glitches in old games could ever hope to be.\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2873716030[/url]\nAll things considered, this game squarely earns its demonic pony/10 rating. While not scary at all, it\u2019s an enjoyable piece of human creativity, neatly wrapped to be downed in a spare evening.

Primero existe \"Pony Island\" que es el juego que jugamos en la pantalla frente a nosotros, esta la propia pantalla que vemos el cual contiene pony island y el contacto con otros personajes de la historia, pero esa pantalla esta enmarcada en un aparato que no es un simple adorno, aparte de la pantalla se encuentra insinuado una realidad fuera de esa pantalla que en momentos se logra ver que pareciera un salon de arcade  y por ultimo al final se revela una ultima rotura de la 4ta pared para concluir definitivamente con el juego. La forma en que esta dise\u00f1ada la trama da mas interrogantes que respuestas, pero eso hace que sea mas interesante el pensar en que ese purgatorio creato para peleadores de las cruzadas obliga a los caballeros a jugar malos video juegos por toda la eternidad hasta que se rindan y otorgen su alma al demonio... o alguna otra tonteria por el estilo.\n\nOtra cosa que podria decir es que aun que muchos de los puzzles parecieran acertijos de programaci\u00f3n, no los considero completamente como tales ya que las direcciones para guiar las instrucciones no recuerdo ningun programa que se maneje de forma similar, aun que supongo que es una proximaci\u00f3n de las funciones que mas adelante se ven como el \"go to\" o el portal morado. Pero en si dudo que alguien mejore en su habilida de programaci\u00f3n con este juego, aun que alguien que sepa programar tal vez se le facilite mas por tener una estructura familiar.\n\nSin duda esta es una experiencia bastante experimental que me alegra haber probrado, aun que es dificil decir a que clase de persona podria recomendarselo, \u00bfAmantes de los rompecabezas, de los ponis, de demonios? Quizas la gente simplemente deba darle la oportunidad a ciegas.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfMjmGQlinA", "timestamp_created": 1662359451, "timestamp_updated": 1674075900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121740923": {"recommendationid": "121740923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120907419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1663021891}, "language": "english", "review": "A GOOD GAME ABOUT DEMONS PONIES AND KILLING JESUS VERY GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1662306541, "timestamp_updated": 1662306541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121730017": {"recommendationid": "121730017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821827618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1656526607}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[b] REQUISITOS [/b]\n\n\u25a0 Patata PC\n\u25a0 Bajos\n\u25a1 Medios\n\u25a1 Altos\n\u25a1 Ni un ordenador de la NASA lo tira\n\n[b] ESTILO ART\u00cdSTICO [/b]\n\n\u25a1 Lloro sangre\n\u25a1 Ta feo\n\u25a1 Meh\n\u25a0 Buenardo\n\u25a1 Bien hermosote\n\u25a1 GOD\n\n[b] SOUNDTRACK/OST [/b]\n\n\u25a1 Mejor mute\n\u25a1 Malo\n\u25a1 Meh\n\u25a1 Bueno pero justito\n\u25a0 Buena rola\n\u25a1 Sube el volumen al 200% \n\n[b] DIFICULTAD [/b]\n\n\u25a1 Anda que te anda, to recto, no pares\n\u25a1 Simulador de puertas\n\u25a1 F\u00e1cil\n\u25a0 Promedio\n\u25a0 Dif\u00edcil\n\u25a1 Pro challenger de la vida\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY [/b]\n\n\u25a1 Injugable\n\u25a1 Malo\n\u25a1 Meh\n\u25a1 Intermedio\n\u25a1 Buen gameplay capo\n\u25a0 Excelente servicio\n\n[b] HISTORIA [/b]\n\n\u25a0 \u00bfQu\u00e9 es eso?\n\u25a1 Mal\n\u25a1 Mejorable \n\u25a1 No se acaba de entender\n\u25a1 Bien\n\u25a1 Original\n\u25a1 Epicarda, ni Steven Spielberg crea tal obra\n\n[b] DURACI\u00d3N APROX.

The ending of escaping with the ponies felt great, for 20 seconds before being back to the stale jumping and firing. It was a cool trick how a friend on steam messages you to distract you. The other little tricks are mediocre, even if it's just pixel other games have been a lot more creative with tricks like \"dude stop\". The pixel affects/glitch affects are decent but not nearly as amazing as Tamashii's/Teocida's glitches and pixel art. Not sure why people love this game so muc, we get it, it's a pony but jeez this game is so boring and uncreative. If you want an S tier puzzle game play The Room. If you want an S tier demonic game play Tamashii, Teocida and Estigma (all by Vikintor). This game just has baby demonic elements in it that it's insulting. I love games/movies that are demonic so this game is very insulting for being so weak, stale, and uncreative about it. I wish i had played this game right away that way i could get a refund but sadly i got to this after 2 weeks had passed. NOT worth 5$ unless you want to see how boring it is to then refund it after.

I didn't like the generic pony levels and found them very repetitive. I mindlessly played through them unless it was a special level. The game is at its best when you're playing the desktop sections and searching for well-hidden secrets. \n\nIf you have an evening free, I'd recommend this on sale.\n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1657428746, "timestamp_updated": 1657428746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118521215": {"recommendationid": "118521215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129108828", "num_games_owned": 584, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1657384830}, "language": "english", "review": "I was gassed while playing in the arcade", "timestamp_created": 1657385031, "timestamp_updated": 1657385031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118511980": {"recommendationid": "118511980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342295859", "num_games_owned": 1925, "num_reviews": 250, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1657373342}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h3]\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Graphics \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f[/h3]\n\ud83d\udd32 You forget what reality is\n\ud83d\udd32 Beautiful\n\u2611\ufe0f Good\n\u2611\ufe0f Decent\n\ud83d\udd32 Bad\n\ud83d\udd32 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\ud83d\udd32 MS-DOS\n\n[h3]\ud83c\udfae Gameplay \ud83c\udfae[/h3]\n\ud83d\udd32 Very good\n\u2611\ufe0f Good\n\ud83d\udd32 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\ud83d\udd32 Mehh\n\ud83d\udd32 Watch paint dry instead\n\ud83d\udd32 Just don't\n\n[h3]\u2620\ufe0f Difficulty \u2620\ufe0f[/h3]\n\ud83d\udd32 Just press 'W'\n\u2611\ufe0f Easy\n\ud83d\udd32 Significant brain usage\n\ud83d\udd32 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\ud83d\udd32 Difficult\n\ud83d\udd32 Dark Souls\n\n[h3]\u26cf\ufe0f Grind \u26cf\ufe0f[/h3]\n\u2611\ufe0f Nothing to grind\n\ud83d\udd32 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\ud83d\udd32 Isnt necessary to progress\n\ud83d\udd32 Average grind level\n\ud83d\udd32 Too much grind\n\ud83d\udd32 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\n\n[h3]\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc66 Audience \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc66[/h3]\n\ud83d\udd32 Kids\n\ud83d\udd32 Teens\n\ud83d\udd32 Adults\n\u2611\ufe0f All\n\n[h3]\ud83c\udfb5 Audio \ud83c\udfb5[/h3]\n\ud83d\udd32 Eargasm\n\ud83d\udd32 Very good\n\u2611\ufe0f Good\n\ud83d\udd32 Not too bad\n\ud83d\udd32 Bad\n\ud83d\udd32 I'm now deaf\n\n[h3]\ud83d\udc7e Bugs \ud83d\udc7e[/h3]\n\u2611\ufe0f Never heard of\n\ud83d\udd32 Minor bugs\n\ud83d\udd32 Can get annoying\n\ud83d\udd32 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\ud83d\udd32 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n[h3]\ud83d\udcd6 Story \ud83d\udcd6[/h3]\n\ud83d\udd32 No Story\n\ud83d\udd32 Some lore\n\u2611\ufe0f Average\n\ud83d\udd32 Good\n\ud83d\udd32 Lovely\n\ud83d\udd32 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n[h3]\ud83d\udd53 Game time / Length \ud83d\udd53[/h3]\n\u2611\ufe0f Long enough for a cup of coffee (0 - 2 hours)\n\ud83d\udd32 Short (3 - 7 hours)\n\ud83d\udd32 Average (8 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story]\n\ud83d\udd32 Long (21-60 hours) [if you complete everything]\n\ud83d\udd32 Very Long (61-100 hours)\n\ud83d\udd32 To infinity and beyond (100+ hours)\n\n[h3]\ud83d\udcb0 Price / Quality \ud83d\udcb0[/h3]\n\ud83d\udd32 It\u2019s free!\n\u2611\ufe0f Worth the price\n\ud83d\udd32 If u have some spare money left\n\ud83d\udd32 Not recommended\n\ud83d\udd32 You could also just burn your money\n\n[h3]\ud83d\udcac Comments \ud83d\udcac[/h3]\n[h2]Short Game Description[/h2]\nPony Island is a weird short story, but an entertaining one, that will make you think.\n[list]\n[*][h3]Positives[/h3]\nTalking about the positive aspects, the game uses a theme of colors that fit perfectly to the game, making the game mysterious and interesting.

You are stuck in a limbo like arcade machine playing a game about ponies... the devil has a thing for ponies, who knew. This is one of those screw with you games, which did get me off guard. Honestly it only tricked me, cause the person messaging me, I haven't heard from in awhile and I was super confused okay. The puzzles are easy enough, and the arcadey parts were fun. There are multiple endings and hidden secrets. And I'm glad it was long enough for one sitting, cause I think it would lose something if it when on too long, you get what I'm saying. I highly recommend this, and glad my friend forced me to play it........

But I've probably played a little too much of these and the element of surprise is long gone. The mind blowing part of the game seems a bit less even close to 0 for me, but there's still humor that made me laugh so I can say i still enjoy it nonetheless. The platforming (shooting?) part is pretty mediocre in both difficulty and stage setup so, they kinda felt a bit too easy for veteran platformer, but probably just right for amateur player so I can't say it's bad either. The Chat AI of the game isn't great and very unresponsive, which made the whole type your own question and sentence thing looks.. extra and needless. And speaking of extra, the Secret Ending really seemed like an \"extra\" entertain just to get the completionist to delete the game a.s.a.p... which... imo.. is a well done expression. Especially with the expressionless last boss. lol!\n\nFor those who haven't played a lot of this genre, i bet you can still get quite a lot of mind blowing surprise from it.

La compa\u00f1\u00eda est\u00e1 en sus primeros a\u00f1os, quien sabe lo que tendremos en un futuro cercano.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Historia: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Controlamos a una persona que se encuentra en el limbo, directamente se pondr\u00e1 a jugar Pony Island, un juego de arcade un tanto curioso, porque parece no estar terminado. \n[*]La historia es un tanto simple, pero el como es contada, he ah\u00ed la magia del t\u00edtulo, el juego constantemente te plantea varias cuestiones, b\u00fasqueda de informaci\u00f3n y decisiones, siempre hay nuevas opciones por las cuales expandir la historia.\n[*]Algo importante es que el titulo hace muchas alusiones al ocultismo, as\u00ed que si alguien es sensible a estos temas quiz\u00e1 el titulo no sea de su agrado. De mi parte, siento que solo juguetea con estos conceptos, no es extremo con las referencias al se\u00f1or de las 3am.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Gameplay: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Es un juego de puzles que rompen la 4ta pared, adem\u00e1s de tener cosillas de plataformero y amidakuji.\n[*]Es complicado definir el gameplay sin ir a los spoilers, pero lo m\u00e1s b\u00e1sico es que el juego pide varias veces que busques informaci\u00f3n dentro de carpetas, men\u00fa de opciones, cuadros ocultos o listas de c\u00f3digos. El juego siempre tendr\u00e1 una salida, pero el encontrarlo es lo complicado y divertido. Algo por agregar es que el titulo hace muchas bromas a otros g\u00e9neros de juegos y a la industria en general.\n[*]Tiene peque\u00f1as secciones de plataformero al mas puro estilo del dinosaurio de Google, un endless runner donde tendremos un poni, que adquirir\u00e1 habilidades con peque\u00f1os desaf\u00edos por superar.\n[*]Tambi\u00e9n tenemos secuencias de amidakuji, que son niveles donde tendremos que guiar a un patr\u00f3n que se desplaza hacia abajo, la idea es llegar al final con ciertos requisitos. Son algo f\u00e1ciles, peque\u00f1as distracciones a la locura que es la historia.\n[*]Al terminar el juego podemos elegir cap\u00edtulos para sacar los logros. Tambi\u00e9n tenemos algunos coleccionables en forma de tickets, muy ocultos para sacarle todo el jugo a la experiencia.\n\n[*]Ahora veamos algunos problemas:\n-A veces si a veces no: Lo divertido del t\u00edtulo (la b\u00fasqueda de informaci\u00f3n) puede ser un tanto confuso, a veces no es tan obvio, hay que tener mucho ojo en todo lo que hacemos. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Gr\u00e1ficos: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Son impecables, sabe c\u00f3mo enga\u00f1ar al jugador con su apariencia, adem\u00e1s que le da un estilo visual muy \u00fanico (al momento de romper la 4ta pared). \n[*]Un peque\u00f1o detalle es que el juego est\u00e1 adaptado para otra \u00e9poca, porque algunas bromas no se adaptaron del todo bien al Windows 10 o m\u00e1s.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]+M\u00fasica y sonido: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Musicalmente no hay tonadas memorables, pero si hay momentos donde tensarte con m\u00fasica chiptune. Los sonidos tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n en la misma categor\u00eda. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]+Accesibilidad: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Tiene texto en espa\u00f1ol y otros idiomas.\n[*]Se puede jugar con mouse, con algunas entradas para jugar con teclado. El juego te recomienda usar un mouse, el trackpad puede tener errores (ambos clics a la vez).\n[*]El men\u00fa de opciones tiene una amplia gama de resoluciones. \n[/list]\n\n-----\n[h1]+En s\u00edntesis: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]\u00bfPodr\u00e1s liberar tu alma del extra\u00f1o juego Pony Island? Int\u00e9ntalo, te sorprender\u00e1 lo maniobrero que es el t\u00edtulo. Quien sabe que pasar\u00e1 con este mundo de ponis y su extra\u00f1o lore detr\u00e1s.

The difficulty: It fluctuates, A LOT! Sometimes, it's a really easy thing, and other times it's confusing to all heck as how you're supposed to get through a section (Jesus Christ is making me cross).\n2. The volume: It is LOUD. I had my headphones on half volume and my stream was turned down and it was still LOUD. The music and ambiance were frankly wayyyyy too loud at times.\n3. The length: The length of the game kinda hurts my feelings towards it. It's a really short game, which shouldn't take you more than three hours, even if you are messing around and not very good at the game. But, that's okay considering the other good parts.\n\nNow the meh stuff, and there's only one thing here:\nThe gameplay loop: It's honestly fun, but with the difficulty being fluctuating, it feels like it drags the game down a bit. But it's not bad, but it's not great. It's just, good.\n\nNow the good stuff:\n1. The Puzzles: The puzzles really are one of the shining points for this game. As short as they are and how like, scarcer they become, they're one of the strongest parts to this game because they're simple, but enjoyable. One of the strongest parts of the game by far.\n2. The Secrets: The secrets are honestly not terrible. They're good in that they collecting of tickets is fun to figure out the weird things you need to do to get them. And that's not a bad thing. Certainly made me feel good when I managed tp figure different ones out.\n3. The Story: The story is simple, and that's why it's good. It doesn't overstay it's welcome, and it's not overly complicated. I won't spoil it, but it's a really good story, and the gameplay compliments it really well.\n4: The Music: It's honestly surprisingly good. Despite my gripes with the music being too loud, it's honestly quite good music. There's not a single track that I heard when playing the game where I thought \"Ugh this music blows.\" GG to the composers. The electronic beats and general atmosphere really was quite good for each and every scene.\n\nTL;DR\nI'd rate this game a 3.5 out of 5 for it's merits and it's price point. I'd highly recommend getting this game in the Inscryption beginner bundle as it's more than worth getting at that price point. It's a good game with a few things that I didn't enjoy, but they seemed more personal to me.

It's interfused with a \"coding\" game in which a cursor automatically steps through the program and you have to direct it towards the goal making sure necessary conditions are fulfilled. While that's clearly more demanding than piloting an autorunner, it's still fairly straightforward, most of all if you're used to more challenging puzzle games and know how to code.

La raz\u00f3n de esto es que el juego nunca para de recordarnos que lo estamos jugando, y todos sus puzzles son resueltos de maneras poco convencionales que con creatividad pueden ser resueltos.\n\n De la historia simplemente no se puede hablar, porque el juego es demasiado corto y porque mientras menos sepas m\u00e1s la vas a disfrutar. Solo tienes que saber que, aunque no te pondr\u00e1 emotivo, te sacar\u00e1 constantemente del comfort al que los videojuegos nos tienen acostumbrados, y esto lo hace \u00fanico.\n\n Gr\u00e1ficamente, el juego tiene muy pocos p\u00edxeles, pero los efectos de distorci\u00f3n, el dise\u00f1o de niveles y puzzles har\u00e1n que realmente el juego se sienta como una pieza que jam\u00e1s se repetir\u00e1.\n\n Su jugabilidad es maravillosa. Sus niveles de \"acci\u00f3n\" se sienten r\u00edtmicos y precisos, y cada uno de sus puzzles se siente extremadamente diferente al anterior. Jugar el par de horas que dura este juego te mantendr\u00e1 enganchado de principio a fin, y un poco m\u00e1s.\n\n El apartado sonoro nos recuerda que estamos en un juego que, aunque no trata de horrorizarnos, nos perturba e incomoda constantemente con sus efectos oscuros y perturbadores. Tiene casi 2 canciones, pero ambas son excelentes y se sienten muy \u00e9picas, haciendo que las escenas de acci\u00f3n se sientan realmente como una aventura.\n\n Poco y nada se puede decir de Pony Island sin arruinarle la experiencia a alguien, pues vale much\u00edsimo la pena.

start off by addressing what should be the obvious by now. It is one of those indie games that try to subvert your expectations about what it means to 'play a video game.' And by the by, I think it does it with marginal success. I really feel like to give this game justice, you have to go in blind and lower your expectations, which already isn't the best thing to say about it. But I say this as someone who genuinely enjoyed his time playing this game and (for some reason) teared up at the ending, this game doesn't know what it wants to do with itself. There are so many expectations and directions the premise and early game set up that I feel lead to dwindling results. And the ending result we do end up with is either really cool and meta, or just lame and flat. And I think that entirely depends on how much you think about what this game is doing and could have done. \n\nJust.

En cambio tiene algunos momentos memorables en los que juega contigo a su antojo, y ya por eso merece un tiento, por no mencionar el jefe final: ese combate bien merece el precio que hayas pagado por el juego jajaja\n\n3,5 horitas bien merece tener la experiencia con Poni Island, pero si de verdad quieres que te vuele la cabeza y flipar con una oda a la perturbaci\u00f3n, burla, enga\u00f1o, asombro y desconcierto no lo dudes, hazte un favor y reg\u00e1late INSCRYPTION de Daniel Mullins, C\u00f3mpralo al precio que est\u00e9 ahora mismo porque vale mucho m\u00e1s de lo que vayas a pagar por \u00e9l. \nDE NADA.", "timestamp_created": 1643061806, "timestamp_updated": 1643061806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108685149": {"recommendationid": "108685149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088098636", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1643032984}, "language": "english", "review": "great game.\nno explanations needed.", "timestamp_created": 1643033113, "timestamp_updated": 1643033113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108662615": {"recommendationid": "108662615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198885415377", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1642998884}, "language": "english", "review": "S\u00ed.", "timestamp_created": 1642998940, "timestamp_updated": 1642998940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108658212": {"recommendationid": "108658212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797631561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1642991849}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok.

The game feels like it is trying to be clever, but it never left me feeling anything more than frustration for more than a few seconds. Pony Island gets a few things right, a few things that are a mixed bag, and the rest feels like a case of the developers thinking their you-know-what don't stink.\n\nThe Good\n\n- The premise/idea is really cool (it should feel much more interesting than it ever fleshes out to be; complete wasted potential)\n- The story occasionally has a few good (VERY fleeting) parts that engage for for a (VERY) brief duration\n\nThe Mixed Bag\n\n- The puzzles are fine, nothing special but make you think; I have never done puzzles like these before\n- The music fits for what the game is doing\n- The price makes you feel less bad about having completed it; at only $5, you can't complain too much if you don't like it (and even more so on sale for liek $1.50). If it doesn't resonate with you (like it has festered with me) then it's not too big of a deal.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- The game play is repetitive to a serious fault; many people would likely say that the game is designed to be this way due to what happens while you play. I think that is bullshit. If the game play is designed to be bad then the game play is bad, end of story. It MIGHT have been ok IF...\n- The story goes nowhere and is a complete letdown. I was never truly engaged in what was happening, nor did I really care all that much. The game goes exactly where you think it will go; it surprised me exactly ONCE, and it was so short-lived as to be trivial. If the story had done something interesting, I MAYBE could have understood the game play being intentionally stupid. But it didn't. Do not expect anything as you go; there is no payoff, no reveal, NOTHING that you wouldn't expect.\n\nIf you don't mind spending a few bucks on something that might be a turd (like this) then feel free to ignore this. Otherwise, you can safely skip over Pony Island.

couple of great ideas weighed down by a lot of tedium and an overarching story that frankly is not that compelling.\n\nThe idea of a video game created by the devil is extremely compelling, but annoyingly enough, most of the material based off of that concept are annoying and dated jokes which at least partially hinge upon the conceit that ponies are inherently funny subjects, as they are enjoyed by little girls. If you don't buy into the veritable comedy goldmine that is \"pony humor,\" a big portion of the game will not land for you.\n\nThe gameplay itself also straddles the line between enjoyable and tedious. It's certainly fun to blast demons with your big pony laser, but after an hour or so of gameplay, you begin to realize that the core gameplay loop doesn't actually change all too much. You play as a pony, you jump over barriers, you rotate your head around with the mouse button and use your laser to kill things. Rinse and repeat.\n\n The big exceptions to this rule are the \"coding puzzles\" and game engine interaction (title screen, etc). I have nothing to complain about here, as with the exception of one very obnoxious puzzle at the end, these are uniformly enjoyable and should have been the bulk of the game. These are also the only sections in which you feel like you're in a real back-and-forth with the devil, which is very sad.\n\nAs for the story, it's passable. Your job is to break out of the devil's combination computer and arcade machine. The devil does not want you to do that, and would rather have you playing Pony Island forever. Antics ensue. There are a couple of \"easter egg\" areas which hint at a larger story, but you figure out exactly what that story is after only visiting a few of them. Again, it's not horrible, but nothing to write home about. The big issue is that the nitty-gritty of the plot is very hit-or-miss. Some parts of the experience are genuinely intriguing, while others are dull and should have been removed from the game completely. The third act in particular was almost entirely superfluous, unless, again, you're really really really into \"pony humor.\" The best thing I can say is that the characters had some nice interplay, and that's it.\n\nThe big thing with Pony Island that everyone remembers are in the penultimate boss fight. It's definitely the highlight of the game, and depending on how accepting you are of the short time-frame they're present in, they may be worth the price of admission for you alone. I won't spoil anything, except [spoiler]that they're some of the first examples of the sort of gameplay present in a lot of later, more widely-acclaimed games--including Inscryption, which was created by the same developer and renders Pony Island *ALMOST* entirely obsolete.[/spoiler]\n\nOther than that, there's not much to say. The music is good. The characters are all fine with one exception, who serves as another example of the dated humor in the game. The presentation, while not unique, is remarkably uncommon and serves the game well. It's simply a very middle-of-the-road experience, with the exception of the one boss fight I mentioned earlier.\n\nAgain, I wouldn't not recommend Pony Island. It's a short experience, and it's not a horrible one, so I can't in good conscience say not to buy it. I got it on sale and I don't regret the purchase. The game is hardly a must-play, though, and there's a lot of competition in its field. Buy it if it's on sale and you're okay with wasting about thirty minutes of your life jumping over hurdles.\n\nAlso, if you haven't yet, play Inscryption.", "timestamp_created": 1641290728,

The game serves as a nice foundation to the humorous, horrific and real style of gameplay and storytelling that Daniel will be known to use in his later games \"The Hex\" and \"Inscryption\", the latter being my favorite from him. I won't spoil much about the game but I appreciate how close the retro aspects of the game feel and the mechanics, weapons and designs of the areas you will encounter are minimal enough to still create some kind of a world and narrative. It's a important stepping stone for Daniel and if you got only a dollar to spend right now (if you're viewing this during a Steam Sale), I would HIGHLY recommend this game. Don't do lots of research though and NO, this game isn't about ponies.", "timestamp_created": 1641152843, "timestamp_updated": 1641152843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

I played less than 5 hours and got 100%, yes maybe not enough game time for some people to justify the purchase, but the game is not that expensive so I would say it is worth the price. 8/10\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[ALERTA DE SPOILER]\nEste juego es genial, me dio sensaciones similares jugandolo que jugando juegos como \"Undertale\" o \"There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension\". Me gustan los juegos que tienen meta-bromas o que SON meta ... no es demasiado largo pero tampoco demasiado corto, tiene una cantidad aceptable de logros, por lo que no es aburrido tratar de obtener el 100%. Los controles son f\u00e1ciles, lo cual es bueno, la m\u00fasica y los gr\u00e1ficos son simples, lo que no es ni bueno ni malo, pero es algo a tener en cuenta. La historia es lo suficientemente interesante como para mantenerte jugando y hacerte volver a jugarlo para obtener los secretos. Jugu\u00e9 menos de 5 horas y obtuve el 100%, s\u00ed, tal vez no sea suficiente tiempo de juego para que algunas personas justifiquen la compra, pero el juego no es tan caro, as\u00ed que dir\u00eda que vale la pena el precio. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1640467782, "timestamp_updated": 1640467850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106523809": {"recommendationid": "106523809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992689577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1640465940}, "language": "english", "review": "Idea is very interesting, very well done.

In 2016 I remember seeing this game and thinking it was genius as did everyone else; but only seeing it through YouTube lets-plays.  Bought it recently out of reignited interest and it defiantly kept my interest at the start. But it rapidly deteriorated.  I don't know how you turn the concept of damnation disguised as an arcade boring, but they managed it. \nThe gameplay is incredibly bland with some harsher mechanics thrown in every now and again to pretend like there is an upcurve in challenge that is never actually there.  It's a cycle of jumping and holding down right click. Then releasing right click to have the instantly-rechargeable laser bullshittery recycle so that you can spam it again. This is how all enemy encounters are. This is how the fight with fucking digital Lucifer goes. How do you make that uninteresting? I don't know. But they managed it. \n\nThat's not the worst part in my opinion. The worst part is how the game views itself - thinking its way more clever then it actually is. Getting past the basic \"WOAH!! I KNOW WHAT THE FOURTH WALL IS!\" breaks, you get a barrage of unfunny, uninteresting and sometimes cringey dialogue. With a clear window of whoever writing it being full of themselves. At the same time, while taking itself too seriously the game manages to be disassociated from anything its talking about. You know how we were apparently asleep for over 300 years and absolutely nothing changed other then the start that degrades in 3 seconds? You know the guardian of the last core, the hyper-intelligent AI that just plays a mindgame with you for a moment and then says \"yeah sure, you can now entirely ignore me. have the delete file for the third core\"? Both of these things have great, great interest within them. They could be explored infinitely, and aren't. instead they're treated as either 3 lines of dialogue, or a shitty mindgame. \n\nThis is a husk of a game. There is no substance. There's an interesting concept barely utilized. Perhaps at the time, this was a groundbreaking creation of meta games. An entirely new genre of games where it bleeds between the reality you live in as a player and the reality it has in store. But it's only been five years, and it's managed to drain any value it had. Do not buy these days unless its on sale and you have money to waste; but still be warry. Those two hours may feel like eight.\n\n...The puzzles are cool though ig", "timestamp_created": 1640341120, "timestamp_updated": 1640341120, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472817748785018921", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106405960": {"recommendationid": "106405960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344472151", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1640247576}, "language": "english", "review": "ya", "timestamp_created": 1640327271, "timestamp_updated": 1640327271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106391894": {"recommendationid": "106391894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349687845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1635496478}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fun.

Maybe If I played Pony Island at the time of release I may have been more blown away by the meta gameplay and interesting mechanics.\n\nPersonally I would say that this game should be free, not because it is bad (which is isn't) but because it doesn't offer much anymore regarding the themes it centres around, and The Hex does almost everything better with a near identical theme: the story, characters, world building, length, meta mechanics, variety in gameplay, actual mystery. \nAlso, being only around 2 hours long, Pony Island doesn't strike me as something worth paying for unless you specifically want to support Daniel and his team, which I wholeheartedly agree with.\n\nIf you want to give it a go you'll likely enjoy it and not regret your purchase. If you want to play a fully fleshed out game with almost the exact same themes, then just play The Hex or Doki Doki. But I'm still recommending this game since it is good in it's own right, just not \u00a34 worth of content, maybe at the time of release but not anymore.\n\nNow I will go back to playing Inscryption, since Daniel Mullins looks to be getting better and better as a developer every time he releases a game.\n\nWhen I Stopped Playing: \nCompleted, but not to 100%. I wasn't interested enough to try and get all collectables.\n\nRating:\n7/10\nGood ideas and a good prototype for Daniels more recent and more fleshed out games. Just not necessarily a great full game in it's own right.", "timestamp_created": 1639008907, "timestamp_updated": 1639008907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105490698": {"recommendationid": "105490698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198938556968", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1639008172}, "language": "english", "review": "you get to play as a pony just as advertised", "timestamp_created": 1639006179, "timestamp_updated": 1643380394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486725687980651855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105480651": {"recommendationid": "105480651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047594997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1651963536}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought my little pony went differently", "timestamp_created": 1638991689, "timestamp_updated": 1638991689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105474681": {"recommendationid": "105474681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041282157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1646919542}, "language": "english", "review": "yes satan", "timestamp_created": 1638984595, "timestamp_updated": 1638984595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467836260795593262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105470982": {"recommendationid": "105470982", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998946727", "num_games_owned": 793, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1638944196}, "language": "english", "review": "Pony Island is a B+. I came here *after* playing Inscryption and watching a Let's Play, which really isn't the best way to experience a Daniel Mullins game, but it's been long enough that the secrets are long since out. Even knowing what I was in for, it's an excellent mind-screw of a couple different genres. It can be beaten in just around two hours if just care about the plot and not the 100% run. I really like it.\n\nThe thing I've noticed about Inscryption and Pony Island is that Daniel Mullins WANTS you to beat the game. During the action scenes of Pony Island, you get plenty of subtle help if you die. For example, if you keep dying by falling onto gates, the gates VISUALLY stay the same but their HITBOXES get a little skinnier. Enemy attacks are the same way, where if you die to several projectiles, they might need to hit more than just your little pony rump in order to register as a hit. There are no direct \"Difficulty Levels\" per se, but it's clear Mullins wants gamers of all skill levels to be able to experience his story. Respect.\n\nInscrpytion made me a Daniel Mullins fan, and Pony Island just solidifies it.

games\" that is impossible to discuss without somewhat spoiling it. So, read this at your peril!\n[*] A curious game where the actual act of playing itself isn't that \"fun\" - which is part of the point! (Again, impossible to talk about further without giving stuff away.) The actual points that the game is making (as well as lots of the jokes) are totally worth experiencing, which makes the lack of \"fun\" from the game itself feel like its own commentary.\n[*] Some of the story elements are awesome, and others are tacked on and weird. [spoiler]So you're a 13th-century Crusader who got killed and added into a video game purgatory? .... Okay? [/spoiler] And on the other hand, [spoiler]metafictional video game hell that spoofs your Steam inbox and makes a statement about game design itself? Amazing.[/spoiler] It's like the [i]NES Godzilla[/i] creepypasta turned into a game - both the good and the bad bits.\n[*] The hacking puzzles are great, though a certain aesthetic switch later on makes them ironically more abstract than in the pure ASCII-text of the first and last thirds of the game.\n[*] Extremely reminiscent of stuff like \"The Stanley Parable\" and \"Undertale\" in both humor and approaches to metafictional games. I don't think this is as good as those (too many of the aforementioned story beats that don't really gel with anything else, and not in the good-schizoid way of most surreal fiction). And, it's still worth checking out for fans of games and games-as-games.\n[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1637808629, "timestamp_updated": 1637808704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103588730": {"recommendationid": "103588730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086166657", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1637976358}, "language": "english", "review": "INVEST IN SATANTECH STOCK, IT\u00b4S THE NEXT APPLE!", "timestamp_created": 1637798832, "timestamp_updated": 1637798832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103486955": {"recommendationid": "103486955", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994638727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1637615081}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, Christian, God-loving game for the whole family.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1637784143, "timestamp_updated": 1637784143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534883737564086914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103381274": {"recommendationid": "103381274", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961174970", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 154, "last_played": 1451978397}, "language": "english", "review": "Unicorn Surprise Cupcakes!\n\nINGREDIENTS\nmixing bowl\n24 cupcake cases\ncupcake tins\na piping bag and nozzle\nfour eggs\n250g caster sugar\n390g butter\n250g self-raising flour\n1 tsp vanilla essence\n1 tsp baking powder\n290g icing sugar\none block of white regal icing\nfood colourings of your choice\ndecorations of your choice\nsweets \u2013 small ones work best\n\nHOW TO MAKE THEM\n1. Beat 250g of butter and the caster sugar together until light and fluffy, then add the flour to the bowl and mix well. Beat in the eggs, vanilla essence, food colouring and baking powder. Once it\u2019s thoroughly combined, place the mixture into the cupcake cases. Bake in the oven at 180\u00b0C (gas mark four) for about 20 minutes. They should be springy to the touch and a light golden colour. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool.\n\n2. To make the buttercream icing, combine the icing sugar with the remaining butter. Add a few drops of vanilla essence and a food colouring of your choice. Once mixed, place in the fridge to chill until you\u2019re ready to use it.\n\n3. While the cakes are cooling, you can start to make the decorations. Take the regal icing and split in half. Add a few drops of food colouring to one half, then knead the icing until the colour is evenly distributed.\n\n4. Take a small amount of each of the pieces of icing \u2013 about the size of a large pea \u2013 and gently roll them out into two thin sausage shapes.\n\n5. Place the rolled out icing sausages next to each other, then twist them round each other, pinching one end to form the tip of the unicorn horn. Repeat steps three and four until you have one unicorn horn per cupcake.\n\n6. To make the ears, take the uncoloured icing and make two balls of equal size \u2013 they should each be roughly the size of a small marble.\n\n7. Take one of the balls and, using your thumb and index finger, mould the icing into the shape of a small pony ear. Repeat until you have two ears per cupcake.\n\n8. Once the cakes are completely cool, use a knife to cut a small circle in the top of them. Remove the top, and cut off any excess until just a small disc remains. Fill the cupcake with sweets, then place the disc back on the cake. Repeat until all the cakes are filled.\n\n9. Remove the buttercream from the fridge and spoon into the piping bag. Swirl the icing onto the cake in a spiral, finishing with a peak in the centre.\n\n10. Place a horn in the centre of the cake with an ear on either side, pressing them firmly in place. Then add your choice of decoration \u2013 you could even use edible glitter to add a bit of sparkle!", "timestamp_created": 1637749430, "timestamp_updated": 1637749430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

It clearly is really effective for some, but it just left me feeling a bit bored.  \n\nI should preface this by saying I tend to prefer games with a bit more mechanical meat to them, but I do love games with a good story.  But I never felt like Pony Island had either.  The idea of a cursed children's game sounds interesting, but it quickly lost its charm for me after its first big, \"I know I'm game, you are at my mercy wooOOooOoo\" moments, which happens fairly early on.  I'm not sure why this is, it is more of a puzzle / visual novel game which is defo outside my comfort zone, but if I had to guess the culprit - it was probably the writing.  \n\nI never felt myself immersed due to some really awkward dialogue and ironically the 4th wall breaks, with the attempted creepiness of breaking the game usually just serving to remind me I'm only looking at 1's and 0's.  I never connected to the narrative, and I wasn't interested to see it go forwards because it never sold itself to me as more than a video game.  This is coming from someone who gets attached to his X-COM characters too, so I CAN be immersed into games.  \n\nI think the tonal dissonance the game tries to create with its premise is interesting and could be expanded further in a game that uses it with more restraint, but I don't think it works on someone like myself.

The game is from the creater of the new game inscryption. Since one of his previous games was on sale and had good reviews, I wanted to check it out.\n\nThe game features 3 different gameplays and a storyline breaking continously the 4th wall.\n\nFirst and main mechanic is an endless runner. This was not a lot of fun. At the beginning, it's too easy. Later on, it becames a little challenging, but not in a fun way.\nSecond mechanic is solving puzzles by putting direction arrows in code. This is not much fun and just clicking. Only the very last of these section required actual thinking.\nThe third mechanic is about clicking through the desktop of a computer, advancing the plot and finding secret tickets. Finding all tickets results in a different ending. Findings the secret tickets was the best part for me, but it's probably not for everyone and can occur to people as tedious.\n\nI can't recommend this game because none of the gameplay elements were particularly fun.

You befriend the other ponies and race off towards the big blue skies where nothing can stop you, and you will smile and cry out with cheerfulness as you run on the rainbows. It is a dreamland to frolic around in and filled with beautiful days that never see gray clouds. Or, is there something more? Was that the game you were expecting?\n\nWhat lies in Pony Island is a dark, disturbing yet intriguing world where you and the souls of other players of Pony Island are trapped inside the arcade machine, doomed to remain until eternity. You are property of the devil. You are not free. That is, until one brave, mysterious soul offers you the chance to be freed. When the opportunity arises, destroy the core files of the arcade cabinet, and all can be freed. The devil will persuade you and trick you not to take such actions. He will go out of his way to stop you.

Most of the game is controlled by the mouse, however there is some parts of the game that are text based, as you need your keyboard to type things, but it's limited.
