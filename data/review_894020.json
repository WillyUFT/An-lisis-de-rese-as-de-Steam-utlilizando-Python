I cannot get the files to sync at all. It is very frustrating...\n\nAnyway, this game is fine. Everything is above average but I just don't feel like it was great. I see  many people saying it will be a memorable game for them and I can't really imagine why other than a short, slightly unique story.\n\nCombat is fine. Fluid enough but not going to be remembered for just that. You got your rolls, your swings and your awkward ranged that you won't be able to weave into the fights too often. PS you can hit back magic bolts at enemies.\n\nThe level up process is just a standard kill things to get souls (lol 1 soul bullshit things mostly...) or you pick up orbs worth literally 100x the amount of killing an enemy. That won't be changed at this point in the game's life but it is a joke in my opinion. These souls will let you level up one of your four or five stats. Roll faster, swing faster, swing further and cast ranged faster. Standard upgrades.\n\nNow there are a few enemies worth 10 and even fewer worth 50 however combat versus them is boring. Maybe that's where the souls like comparison comes in from some people. You swing once, maybe twice, then you roll away. Then repeat. Not even mildly challenging. Just time consuming.\n\nThis game needs a fucking map too. Metroidvania style games usually have a map. No matter how crude it is.\n\nSpeaking of dedicated buttons, ranged attacks can usually be thrown without having to aim. This rewards people who are good at twin sticks if they can tell where your character is aiming. This game does NOT allow you to do that. You have to stop and aim with LT then shoot with B ( or whatever your controller does). \n\nThe backtracking is fucking brutal. I am all for having to backtrack a little bit in some games but holy hell, there are so many small things you have to backtrack for to finish up this game that I don't even care my steam deck isn't syncing to my main computer for me to finish. I don't want to go back to every world (there's only like 3 and they are well) to just get a few level ups or collectibles, but some people might. I'm at like 76% complete without doubling back for stuff.\n\nStory is good. Unique enough but not a hall of fame contender. Art is gorgeous too but I've seen this style plenty before, too.\n\nAll in all, I paid like $8 for this and played it on vacation when one of our hiking days got rained out.

However, It isn't entirely without faults, though, especially when talking about the utterly disappointing and mediocre upgrade trees specifically how weak and incrementally little they affect the gameplay, and the relatively boring progression of weapons you can unlock that doesn't do much to shake up the combat.

It works perfectly on Steam Deck as well.\n\nThe game consists of traveling to different areas and using one of five weapons and four abilities that you slowly unlock to find secrets, defeat enemies and open new paths. In classic metroidvania style, some areas can only be accessed or opened with an ability you get later. Traveling between areas is fast and easy thanks to a hub area, so you constantly discover new things. The story fits the mood of the game and the artstyle in general is fantastic, making the game almost feel like a miniature playset unfolding before you.\n\nWhile the game does not overstay it's welcome and is only about 9-13 hours long, depending on how much you want to get 100 %, it does feel a bit lacking in some aspects. Combat is generally pretty easy as enemy patterns are predictable and there are only a handful of them for most of the game. Exploration via abilities is cool, but to get 100 %, you need to do a lot of backtracking and find some items that there is no hint for if you missed them, particularly the seeds and shiny things. That means that, if you miss something, you have to travel every area again to find a spot you may have missed, which can be frustrating (unless you use a guide of course). \n\nMovement also feels a bit floaty and \"drunk\" at times - I found myself falling off of tight pathways a lot when just trying to move straight. The game has an upgrade system using souls from enemies or pickups, but getting all stats to max is impossible in one playthrough without excessive grinding (I was about 4000 souls short even with a lot of exploration), so focus on the stats you prefer.\n\nOverall, though, those are nitpicks. The game works, is fun for the most part, and has a fantastic soundtrack and gorgeous presentation.

Gameplay consists primarily of exploring large and often complex areas that function effectively like 2D Zelda dungeons. Having omitted an overworld in the traditional sense, Death's Door's developers have crafted roughly 10 dungeons that lead into one another, some paired together such as the Estate of the Urn Witch and the Furnace Observation Rooms to create the sense of one large and true dungeon, but the lack of any separation between overworld and dungeon as there is in Zelda highlights that the entire world (with the exception of its hub location) functions as a series of dungeons.\n\nBy creating a vast series of Zelda dungeons, Acid Nerve place a lot of whether the game works or not on to its level design, and fortunately they deliver on that promise, the isometric view allowing for more depth than a traditional Zelda dungeon and intricate looping locations that are a joy to explore. Some are populated with enemies, creating a sense of fast paced action, others with puzzles such as lighting lanterns, hitting switches, collecting keys, and other staples of the Zelda series. Importantly, both work, aided by the game's strong art direction and charming visuals. Mansions, flooded ruins, factories, each has a real sense of place.\n\nAnd at the end of the 'partnered' dungeons is a boss to fight, requiring understanding of your basic moveset and the boss' attacks. While by no means a scratch on the kind of boss you would expect to fight in a more combat oriented game such as Devil May Cry or even more recent Zelda titles such as Breath of the Wild, these are fun encounters that perfectly encapsulate the spirit of old Zelda bosses without copying their formulaic approach to items, and their designs match the world perfectly.\n\nI also want to take a quick moment to acknowledge the incredibly creative and intelligent approach to health and checkpoints in Death's Door. In the years since Dark Souls, many games attempting a similar style of adventure have mimicked the estus flasks system, but Death's Door has come up with a new approach. Scattered around the world in places where a checkpoint would be useful are big green pots, and scattered around in little hiding places are seeds, single use consumable items. Planting a seed in one of these big pots causes a plant to grow that can be eaten to restore all your health, but the catch is that plant will not regrow unless you die. Healing is limited to these specific spots, and every potential checkpoint prompts a choice based on the amount of seeds you have, how far into an area you are, etc. It's a fantastic approach that should be commended.\n\nUnfortunately, there are shortcomings to Death's Door, and I use the term purposefully because I don't feel that there are truly any negatives to point out, only things that could have been developed further. Firstly, the game's length. On your adventure there are only 3 giant souls that need to be collected, an admittedly paltry amount especially when compared to the most recent 2D Zelda game, 2013's A Link Between Worlds. In that game, three pendants are required to be collected only to unlock a whole other realm, with a further 7 dungeons in it, effectively the start of the real meat of the game, and A Link Between Worlds is only following in its many predecessors' footsteps. Finding 3 quest items in a Zelda game often means the main game is about to start, yet in Death's Door it means things are wrapping up.\n\nAnother shortcoming is in the game's puzzles. While fun and often unique to each area, the puzzles are on the light side in terms of challenge. By no means is this terrible, but considering the games it draws influence from, I would have hoped for some tough as nails head scratchers by the endgame.\n\nFinally, there's no map.

When I want to do a special attack and see that one enemy prepares to attack, I chancel attack and hit the dodge button, but I still get hit. Sometimes I hit the dodge button 5 times and I still get hit. What I really love is when I dodge, get stuck on one enemy in the process, so another one hits me. There are constantly a lot of enemies and you only have 4 lifes (at least till to the point I played). You can charge them on flower pots, but not in the middle of fighting. There are quick saves along the way, but you still need to walk a little again to the point you were before death. I think this game wants the player to die a lot to collect a loooot of souls from enemies to level up (1. Level 400 souls, 2. Level 600..) all four combat styles. This feels a little too much for such a game. But maybe thats just me.

Every single enemy will have their very own attacking patterns, vastly different from each other with really original twists to them. You are free to use not only the environment to your advantage but also to pivot certain enemies' attacks against each other.\nThe boss fights are challenging without being frustrating, it's not Hollow Knight difficulty, but it is enough to keep you engaged and paying close attention to enemy attack patterns.\nThe character and world design really pull you into the world as well as the story line, and although I wasn't counting on it, I ended up really enjoying the process of putting the story together bit by bit.\n\nAll in all, even though there are some pain points (the most painful one being the lack of a map, for example, which I felt sometimes caused me to miss certain hidden areas of the level and kind of discouraged me from backtracking as much as I would have had I had a map), I had such a great time with this game, the fluid and challenging combat, the whimsical characters and the absolutely lovely art style and soundtrack made it a memorable experience and one I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone", "timestamp_created": 1699103158, "timestamp_updated": 1699103158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149458926": {"recommendationid": "149458926", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972173117", "num_games_owned": 826, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1159, "last_played": 1699032643}, "language": "english", "review": "Contains possibly the cutest corvid to ever reap souls with rain gear.

This takes you on an adventure through  eerie, unsettling lands while feeling the heat from the bureaucrats at the office of soul-reaping.\n\nThe strongest point of Death's Door is the level design. It's incredible. Main areas are large and semi-open, with paths looping seemlessly. It makes it so the player is never lost wandering aimlessly in search of another door, while at the same time giving them the ability to explore and maintaing the illusion of a vast world.\nSimiarly to Zelda, it also features more enclosed and segmental dungeon-like areas. You collect keys, battle mini-bosses , and unlock doors that eventually lead you to a big boss.\n\nAs in Zelda, you will also obtain new tools along your journey that let you access new areas. But in Death's Door, each tool also significantly changes how you will control the character: the game ups its pace constantly. It's a thrill, knowing that you are always on the verge of getting another shiny toy that will enhance your character and allow you to do even cooler things.\n\nTo sum it up, Death's Door is a fantastic game.

It's fun, it's a fine game. But that's all it really is to me, fine. I'm about 50 % in of total game completion atm, and let's go down the list.\nThe bosses? Really nothing special.\nThe difficulty? Apparently some people really struggle, but to me it's super easy. I have 24 seeds that I haven't planted because I don't really need the health going through the levels.  Just don't attack when it's obviously a bad idea, stick and move a little, and use a lot of magic arrows. Being easy isn't a problem, of course though, but it's a very simple action game. \nYou have a simple few-hit combo, a charge, and a hard to use dodge-roll attack, plus the magic. And all the upgrades this game gives you either stat-wise or through new magic and weapons won't radically change anything. I wish it had couple of different combos ala DMC 1 with diff timings. Or charging your weapon with diff timings does something else. Or the weapons actually changed your attack more.\nYou don't have any bullet-hell kind of action so your spatial awareness or positioning doesn't actually have to be that good. The game doesn't really pressure you with too many enemies. And the bosses aren't gonna be aggressive or fast like Dark Souls or Hollow-Knight (and there's only been 2 bosses so far, and the frog guy kinda just sits there and throws bombs at you.). The biggest curve-ball is that some enemies have some delayed attacks, or poor tells between their 1 and 2 hit combos.\n\nThe music is fine, but isn't the best you've heard, and the style of the game is nice, but not ground-breaking. The writing doesn't have a lot to it. Just like in terms of design, Urn Witch has a much better story than the Frog King.\nAnd lastly, the dungeon: Most of the puzzles in this game involves finding your way to a vertical spot in a room from which you can light a torch from afar, and things like that. They aren't exactly high-tier puzzles, but I like them, keeps the flow going. The layouts are fine though, and the enemies are good.\n\nI really wish this game at least had better movement. You spend so much of this game just dodge-rolling just like you would in 3D Zelda. Your new abilities just boil down to new barriers you can unlock now, sometimes through back-tracking. And you can't go out of order in the game either because harder areas are blocked by things you can't open yet, like not being able to bomb a cracked wall.\n\nReally, I've had some fun with the game, it just really isn't doing anything I can be impressed by or really consider a good amount of fun. I'd recommend other, better action games, especially considering its price.

It's a problem when using daggers or using any range ability. But with bow and hook it's mostly fine, since they have an arrow that shows direction. Could've added some indication of where my crow is looking at though.\n2. Fact that you can fall off from a lot of places is annoying. Annoying AF sometimes. I don't want to be careful when just walking in places that are regular roads where I already killed everyone and yet I have to carefully move and track my crow with my eyes to not fall off.\n3. Perspective can be confusing in a few places.\n4. Nobody tells you that it's possible to open shafts by falling on them while attacking. I learned it accidentally so late in the game.. It was a disappointment, cause I didn't have access to a lot of cool side stuff.\n5. No map. Levels are confusing by design. You can navigate, sure, but it's very hard to remember all paths you checked. Some map would've been nice. \n6. Some mobs were pain due to their collision models (as well as some bosses).

To start with what you'd notice first, the graphics are beautiful; especially for an indie.  It has a very striking style that compliments the game very well; I always found myself wowed by the varied environments this game has you exploring. It easily stands as one of the best looking indie games I've ever played.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't slouch either, it starts of simple enough, but with the multiple weapons and spells you can acquire alongside the upgrade system it truly becomes something special. It takes that classic Zelda combat and makes it more dynamic and engaging. Throughout the game you encounter many unique enemies that compliment each other in battle; making you play your best and utilize all your tools to succeed.\n\nNow when you aren't battling, you are exploring, and man the levels in this game are just plain satisfying to explore. They are very intricately designed with many secrets and parts that loop back on each other, not to mention new abilities allowing you to backtrack to find even more secrets and collectibles. Speaking of collectibles, while there are many that are there just for the sake of finding them, the majority are either souls for leveling, or seeds; this games healing system. There are a certain amount of pots scattered around each area, and if you have a seed in your inventory you can use it to plant a soul fruit: a full heal that respawns only once the area is reloaded (or you die). It's great because you always have the decision to press on and save your seed, or cash out for safer exploration. Thorough players are rewarded with many more seeds, allowing for more leeway in exploration. It's a great system that isn't too punishing and encourages you to explore these levels.\n\nBut what really makes this game shine are the characters and writing, all the characters are super lovable and written well. Most of the games jokes really land and it makes you much more attached to this world. I won't spoil the story but I will say it gets much deeper than I expected when I played it. Gotta give a shout out to the score, can be epic and intense, or melancholic and atmospheric, with great use of motifs, truly something special to listen to.\n\nThis is an game that will stick with you, the world, characters, exploration, and story come together to create and incredibly tight experience. This game doesn't stand out because of any \"hook\" or big gimmick; it stands out because of the pure, polished, and refined yet simple experience it gives you.

Like anybody else I get interested of this game because of its visual style. The characters looks like they comme from Hayao Miyazaki film and the level design is in the style of Monument Valley. \n\nThe visual part is the strongest of the game. Everything else is mid or not good. The music is nice, but forgettable. The controls are decent, but could be less delayed.\n\nAbout the negatives. Trying to navigate without a map is a handicap. I guess it's not there because of the secret locations, but it doesn't justify it. Half of the time you get lost because everything look the same. Imagine not having a map in a Metroid game. The weapons are all the same, you end up using the first weapon through out the whole game. The power ups barely change the combat. They add so little that I thought that it was broken. You barely feel any difference in power when you maxing up a stat. Last thing which could look insignificant is the sound design of swinging the sword. There's not satisfying sound when you are swinging the weapon. \n\nIt's inspired by many games, but it doesn't do hommage to their legacy, it just copies some mechanics and turn them into a shallow game play eventually.

The characters have fun, dynamic dialogue to draw you into the world, with some being quite relaxed and natural, and others feeling more grand. The overall assortment of personalities found throughout Death's door make each interaction joyous and fun. The combat based on a relatively simple short ranged + long ranged + dodge system, but, it's cranked to a nice level which gives fighting foes challenging, in addition to each creature you face having a unique pattern for takedown.\n     \nHaving 100%ed the game on my first save, I appreciate the level of detail put into the world of Death's Door, giving players vast opportunities to find hidden gems of story and gameplay along their journey. If players choose to follow the main story only, the game has a satisfying relative playtime, but if players want to wander the maps, there is a significant chunk of playtime that is worth spending. The story itself is rich, and the theme that is explored really shines a light on the hues of death, grief, and healing. The darker overall meaning of the game is brought out through incredible time you spend in game, as you piece together a worthwhile adventure. \n    \n In the total scheme of the game, there is very little I find worth noting that is bad about the game. It's risk/reward system for fighting and exploration is well balanced, and the only complaint I would have is the amount of walking required. On the other hand, having gone for 100%, I chose to spend the time walking, where the average player will most likely not run into this issue so much. \n    \n I appreciate Death's Door, I absolutely think it was worth playing.

Mechanically, it's more metroidvania than soulslike, the combat isn't terribly complicated or hard and that was an intentional choice. The really interesting stuff is the storytelling and the puzzle design, both of which are quite good. This game is full of human touches, like the funerals for the bosses after you kill them, and the collectibles have the souls quality of sometimes giving gameplay hints, so keep an eye out for that.\nSo go ahead and play it, it's more than worth your time. \n\n!!!SERIOUS SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT!!!\n\nIf you haven't got the true ending (??? achievement on steam) I'd highly advise getting it, it's a very strong element of the story in my opinion.\n\nOkay? Okay.\n\nThe third act, with the Yeti, is the weakest one in my opinion. Learning about prior lords of doors is great and all, but the thing I liked about act 1 and 2 was the threats seemed active, like there was an unfolding situation. Betty (her name's Betty, right?) is just not as much of a presence as the Frog King and Grandma, both of which represent actual moral failings, as opposed to the dark souls thing of \"this just lived a really long time and is messed up now.\" The real strength of this game is where is breaks out of that trope - goes into what people actually would end up like in a world without death, which I'd compare to Dark Souls II if the restraining order would let me.\nSo when you cross into the door, and there's nothing but an infinite white plane, driving your mentor mad from the wasted time - that's a great moment, and a great boss fight. That's really the moment that made me realize this game was worth talking about.\nAnd then, the Lord of Doors totally sticks the landing! Best villain monologue of its type, the Lord is both completely a villain and innately understandable. The fight is great: the first phase is cinematic without being railroady, and the second is the game's most complex and interesting melee combat that doesn't take you too off-guard. It's a great end to the story.\nBut then, the post-game stuff is also really good, paying off unique oddities in the world and inviting the player to revisit the old puzzles with some new enemies and bosses. Whereas a lot of combat-heavy games feel draining to go back over, replaying the areas in Death's Door is mellow and puzzly, which would be boring if you hadn't had to fight for your life the last time you were here. It's a great way to solidify the world as a real place, and the puzzles all build up an intriguing final reveal.\n...which honestly doesn't live up to expectations for me. The final cutscene shows a lot of effort, clearly someone cares deeply about the lore they were looking to elaborate on, but it just doesn't feel built-up in the same way as the main story.

Buy it if you want a fun single-player game.\n\nLong version: This game is great; probably one of the best single-player games I've ever played. It reminds me more of the old-school style of games with a short but fun self-contained story. The combat is very simple: attack, dodge, and spells, but the enemies manage to keep the game at a difficulty that lets you plow through most fights easily, but you can still die if you make a few small mistakes. Another key aspect of this game is puzzles. Most of them are short and sweet. They might make you think a little bit but they never feel too hard to understand or too easy to the extent that they've overstayed their welcome. Another aspect that I've seen most games ignore is the soundtrack. This game nails it. It has some of the best OSTs of any game I've played. I've seen some people complain about a lack of map in these reviews, but don't let that sway you. The game isn't a maze, and unless you have the spatial memory of a fly you won't get too lost. That said, this game isn't without flaws: the biggest being a select few of the puzzles being absolute BS to understand, and while most of those are optional, some are required, adding some unneeded frustration to the game.\nOverall, I'd give it a 10/10.

In fact, the quality surprised me in the beginning.\nI went in blind and got hooked by the tight controls, interesting settings and great music. Combat was fun too. Yet soon, this initial interest was lost upon tedious yet boring exploring, a story that never quite kicked off, progression with little meaning and impact, all to similar enemy varieties and bland secrets. \nIt is not one big flaw that made this game unlikable, it\u2019s the sum of many small aspects which in the end covered its redeeming factor. That being said, it does have good reviews, so I do wonder if I\u2019m simply not the target audience, then again, this genre and setting is what I normally love. \nOne of my biggest gripes about this game is the lack of a map. I know this was done to increase immersion, and maybe it was done being inspired by tough as nail games with frequent deaths, but in this game it does not work. While exploring I barely ever died, and the world, partly though the top-down view is just too repetitive to be rememberable. This, together with the fact that I played this game with some breaks in-between meant that immersion was constantly broken by tedious searches to find that one secret I swore I saw somewhere. \nIn the end, I gave up searching for secrets, knowing I missed on some hidden content. Yet what I found was too unrewarding to make up for the loss of time.

This is a fun experience with nice graphics and really well made music (not distracting, enhances the atmosphere, love it). Difficulty can seem steep at first, especially if you try to bulldoze your way through the game - it looks like a hack-and-slash, it runs like a hack-and-slash at first, but, essentially, it's Dark Souls in an unusual dressing.\n\nThe main attraction of the game is slow, methodical combat. Take your time, learn your opponent's attack patterns, movement patterns and you'll do just fine. I tried to play in a \"button-mash, beat-em-up style\", just to get pounced again and again by the computer opponents. But then I learned to take it slow and the combat became easier and the game became much more enjoyable!\n\nThe story is nice, although it may be aimed at a specific type of personality or world view. The jokes thrown around the game are fun and a pleasant distraction from all the combat.\n\nThe game is rather short, you can beat it and 100% it in under 20 hours. The game packs enough content to keep things fresh for the duration of the game, with some minor backtracking to collect things you couldn't reach at an earlier point. There are some missable achievements, but you can either do a second play-through, or study missable achievements beforehand.

Well, my honest thoughts could be summarised as follows: this is a great game, done masterfully and is pretty much a guide on how to make a good game in general. It shows how Acid Nerve has developed over the years and matured.\n\nEverything works as expected: no bugs, at least for my experience; smooth animations, clean and distinctive visuals.\nAnd yet... The overall package felt underwhelming, at least for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've enjoyed playing this game, but I can't deny that it doesn't really feel like an Acid Nerve game. Given that they've not made countless games, it may sound a bit over the top, but what they have established with Titan Souls was pretty clear.\n\nLet me explain. I'll start with what convinced me, and then I'll dive more into the reason behind what I've said before.\n\n[h3]The Good[/h3]\nI think that, visually, the game looks good. It's straight to the point, clean, recognisable. When you first start your journey, the greyness of it all sure will catch your eye, no doubt about that. Combine that with a really solid, catchy soundtrack and you've got an appealing bundle.\n\nI appreciate the fact that the items you pick up can turn out to be useful to unlock certain things, areas and such. At first, I didn't really pay much attention to what I've picked up, simply acknowledging the items, but when I started to notice I was pleasantly surprised. \n\n[h3]The Other Stuff[/h3]\nOkay, so. Bare in mind that this can be summarised as a \"Meh\" section.\nFirst of all, I was really bothered by the fact that a studio which made its boss battles titanic, epic, memorable, settled down for a more washed up experience. In Death's Door, the structure is very much different, yet pretty basic: you have your normal, elite and boss enemies. There are some secrets here and there too, but even there not much to really keep you invested.\n\nWhat bothers me is that each encounter in Titan Souls was really memorable, harder and certainly more \"fair\". Not that it isn't fair here, in fact it is way too easy! I haven't struggled even a bit while playing this, which can be good to some, but I expected more. Here, you'll have to settle with the fact that you'll be mostly dealing with weak, repetitive mobs and elite enemies that really have too little variations to be appreciated fully.\n\nThis is the best example of quality over quantity. While there were many bosses in Titan Souls, the fact that there were no mobs made it much more intimate and challenging. More original, too. I would have never expected to treat enemy encounters as a chore in an Acid Nerve game.\n\nI've said before that Titan Souls was more \"fair\", and yet I've said that Death's Door is really easy. How come? Well... it all comes down to the core combat design choices. In titan souls, you had an arrow, and the enemy had a weak point. It was [i]fair[/i]. And, on top of that, when you managed to defeat the enemy, you had that moment of silence. You really felt the weight of your actions.\n\nHere, well... not really. Having mobs around and encountering a small amount of bosses really made me lose sight of how important my duty as a Reaper was. Well, if I had to stay true to the lore, feeling like this should be canon since being a Reaper is like having a full-time job. I don't think there are many memorable moments in Death's Door, if at all.\n\nMaybe the only memorable ones were the true ending and a certain boss in a graveyard, but that's it.\n\nIf it weren't Acid Nerve, maybe I would act differently, but... Ugh.\n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is dialogue... I really think it doesn't give anything to the game, and it doesn't feel engaging as it should be. It felt flat, strangely comical, and it tries to build up lore without taking itself seriously as it should've. Narration in Titan Souls was way more effective, and no one ever had a line of dialogue there. \n\nAs someone mentioned in another review, level design really lacks here too. I remember the labyrinth forest in Titan Souls in order to get to the boss, and it was an interesting design choice. The world made you invested. Here, not so much... I was just going from point A to point B while pulling some levers and having the same boss dialogue structure in different areas.\n\nThere are some honorable mentions, though. The Old Watchtowers were cool, in my opinion. And the Estate Of The Urn Witch was interesting, too.\n\n[h2]So... Bad Game?[/h2]\nNo, it isn't a bad game. It just felt flat and generic, especially after a few hours. It's a game done by the book, flawless in the implementation, with all the elements working properly and a solid gameplay. It just didn't resonate with me at all, as if it hadn't a solid story to tell. \n\nI still recommend you to play this, because of how good the development side of things is, because it makes you appreciate how talented these developers are.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/]More reviews here[/url]\n[url=https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/noclip]My game[/url]\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/@bottolo/featured]My YouTube channel[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1690578929, "timestamp_updated": 1690579071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142978879": {"recommendationid": "142978879", "author": {"steamid": "76561199080897778", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1691086481}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1690577037, "timestamp_updated": 1690577037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142967616": {"recommendationid": "142967616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150553196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1690801461}, "language": "english", "review": "bumfluff", "timestamp_created": 1690563781, "timestamp_updated": 1690563781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142962006": {"recommendationid": "142962006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053507819", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 812, "last_played": 1690556356}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfectly pairs an engaging and melancholy story with core mechanics that are easy to pick up but challenging to master.

The first thing that instantly sticks out is the game's sense of humor. There are a lot of fun characters with funny little quirks that, while not strictly necessary, add a lot to the world. Exploration is also very interesting, with tons of secrets and shortcuts to find. I do have to say that it can be frustrating going back through the areas trying to find what you missed, especially in the endgame and post game, but I'll get into that later. Combat is perfectly satisfying. You do just enough damage to feel like every hit counts, and I rarely felt as if it was unfair. Unfortunately, it isn't balanced very well for the weapons that aren't the default sword, but it's still fun.\nMost of my complaints with the game are minor nitpicks that relate to endgame content, so kinda spoilery stuff ahead, but I'll try to keep my language ambiguous. There are some things that the game, for some reason, doesn't really tell you or even hint at. It took me ages to realize how access sewers, or even that those weird circular platforms were sewer entrances and not some mystical teleportation pad. Also, there is an attack some late game bosses do that slows you down to the point of barely being able to avoid anything. I was on my third or fourth attempt of the final boss when I realized you had to mash to get out, which didn't feel like me gaining skill in the fight, and just left me feeling stupid.\nAs for the post game, most of it is pretty fun. New secrets are accessible in all the areas, with stronger enemies around everywhere. However, there is one thing that is incredibly infuriating. One of the items you need is locked behind a door which only opens once you've planted every seed in the game. This is mostly fine, since most seed pots are easy to find just in the normal process of playing, but you'll definitely need hints to find the last few. The problem is that the NPC which gives you these hints is at the door for which you need the seeds, but he isn't there when you arrive. You have to leave and go back to the area, which is not at all intuitive and cost me lots of time before I read a guide and realized that he appeared if you went back. Whatever, one small annoying quest, surely the true ending is worth it? ...Not really. When I went into the room you can get to after doing everything else, I thought it was a boss arena, and when this big [spoiler] showed up and was presented exactly the same way all the bosses were, I thought I would get a cool climactic superboss. Instead it's just... a cutscene. A cool cutscene, which brings some loose threads together and has cool implications, but still just a cutscene.\nBut please, don't let what I've said dissuade you from buying this game. It's still got a solid core of gameplay and story, and I had a blast playing through the main bulk of it.

It's a hack and slash. You use a melee weapon that has a light attack, a charged attack and a dash attack. For ranged combat you have 3 spells. There isn't really variety in weapons, since they are very few and only change stats like slightly more damage, faster attack speed and bigger reach.\nUnfortunately, outside the bosses, the enemies have very few attack patterns. The majority of the time you are just mashing the light attack button and then dash away to dodge an attack, maybe use a spell to attack from range, and then repeat for the next encounter.\n\n[b] Environment: [/b] Enthralling and mysterious dark fantasy world with hand-crafted landscapes offering haunting beauty and unique charm. The visually striking environments play a crucial role in enhancing the narrative and gameplay, creating a memorable and immersive experience throughout the game. I would say this is the strongest feature of this game.\nTraversing through the environment is semi-linear, where you unlock different paths with new abilities found in the previously explored locations. The only complain I have for this is the lack of a map to visualise the overall connection between different places in the game.  \n\n[b] Sound: [/b] It features an atmospheric sound design that complements its environments, immersing players in the mysterious world of the game. The audio enhances the overall experience.\n\n[b] Story: [/b] The lore of Death's Door is charismatic, drawing players into its unique world of crows as reapers and the balance between life and death.

There isn't really variety in weapons since they just change some stats like slightly more damage or faster attacks (aside the hammer perhaps, it does a lightning effect when hitting enemies but I used it very little).\nUnfortunately the enemies outside the first and maybe last boss have very few attack patterns. The optimal strategy is just doing a full string (or almost) and then dash away, then repeat. This, for every encounter in the game. The only difficult spikes are at the beginning, when you do the least damage, and when there are multiple ranged enemies, but nothing too extreme. The game would have been far better with more enjoable encounters.\n\n[h1]Upgrade System[/h1]\nThis is maybe the weakest part of the game. You get to choose 4 types of upgrades (melee damage, movement speed, attack speed, ranged damage) 5 times each, but are so marginal they could have just removed them and the game wouldn't change that much. For example you need the strongest weapon and 4/5 strenght upgrades to one-shot the basic enemy (instead of 2 hit with the basic weapon and no upgrades). \n\n[h1]World Building[/h1]\nEnvirnoments and lore are fine, nothing too deep but definitely enjoyable. The worlds are fairly small overall, but packed with secrets and stuff to collect.\n\n[h1]Post-end game and Backtracking[/h1]\nBeing a Metroidvania you will do backtracking at some point for secrets and upgrades, if you enjoy the genre it's exactly what you're looking for. In this game, backtracking contends the spot for weakest part of the game with the upgrade system. The first time you unlock the final upgrade you definitly still enjoy the game because you know where to look, or you just wonder around discovering stuff. But once you finish the main game you basically unlock a new \"version\" of the entire game map that is no other than the world with maybe very slight differences, new dialogues, new secrets to discover and basically no enemies for a large part of the game. This wouldn't be a problem if you had movement skills or just faster movement. Like I said, the upgrades are very marginal and a maxed out movement speed isn't fast, just slightly faster. And you walk around very, very, much. The last 3-4 hours of the game was just that, wondering around slowly. There is a quest in which you have to traverse across the map by foot without using teleports, it was the most boring 15 minutes of the game. And what's the reward for all that? The last item for your \"random items\" collection, couple of boss fights (at this point of the game you're maxed out and you know the strategy) and a \"true ending\" that basically tells you nothing that exciting. I would recommend to just look all that stuff up, it isn't really worth experiencing in my opinion.\n\n[h1]Conclusion: 7/10[/h1]\nAt the end I would still give the game a decent grade, the main part of the game is enjoyble even without a decent upgrtade system and repetitive encounters (that foruntately are very fast at least) and is definitely a good 8-10 hours.\nCould have been a little gem with a little more depth.", "timestamp_created": 1689880908, "timestamp_updated": 1689880908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142482718": {"recommendationid": "142482718", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072837253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 657, "last_played": 1689951769}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego, cortito y entretenido se pasa un buen rato la verdad", "timestamp_created": 1689878472, "timestamp_updated": 1689878472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142481355": {"recommendationid": "142481355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027739255", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1689436253}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm still depressed after playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1689876857, "timestamp_updated": 1689876857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142479857": {"recommendationid": "142479857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043328608", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1042, "last_played": 1667946394}, "language": "english", "review": "really fun little soulslike with a good story too", "timestamp_created": 1689874987, "timestamp_updated": 1689874987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142471191": {"recommendationid": "142471191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040028889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1691858541}, "language": "english", "review": "very gud", "timestamp_created": 1689864562, "timestamp_updated": 1689864562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142457813": {"recommendationid": "142457813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144337854", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 744, "last_played": 1689835912}, "language": "english", "review": "who would hate on a tiny crow beating up egocentric jesus?", "timestamp_created": 1689846091, "timestamp_updated": 1689846091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142455006": {"recommendationid": "142455006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170957510", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1689584500}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tiene algo que lo hace unico y eso fue lo que me hizo finalizar la historia.

I got the \"real ending\" but I won't be doing the umbrella challenge. The real ending for me was the right sweet spot where completing the last few things would be more tedious than fun for me and that's totally fine.\n\nAs the spiritual success to Titan Soul, it achieves something that few other games do in terms of successfully translating a 2D game into a 3D one. Now before you say that the game basically takes place on a series of 2D layers, that's not the point. There are still difficult technical challenges in that format that would have been different to Titan Souls and a lot of gameplay can fall through those gaps if the developers don't put in enough care. Acid Nerve obviously [i]do[/i] care that care can be felt in all kinds of enjoyable little details through the entire world.\n\nI highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone. I'm not a hardcore gamer and as I've gotten older, I've become more impatient (since games compete with a more complex like than when I was a teenager). In short, I don't have the patience to try the same thing over and over and to weather the frustration of time lost to a challenge curve that's too steep. Death's Door hit my curve pretty much perfectly.\n\nIf I am to make one criticism is that I played this game for a bit about a year ago but then put it down for a while. When I came back to it, there was no clear way for me to know what I was doing. I basically had to run around aimlessly until I triggered an event. That is to say, the game is best played inside a time-window where you can keep what you were doing in your mind. That said, the only penalty for not doing this is a bit of running around and trying to find the right event trigger or NPC to talk to.\n\nThe endgame is handled particularly well, however. Without spoiling anything, there are clear signals to indicate which parts of the world require more attention and which can be ignored making the final explore and completion phase more dense with meaningful gameplay.\n\nAll up, best game I've played for a long time and maybe the best of its genre I've ever played.

While the story incorporates elements of the hero's journey, as the MC is forced to embark on an adventure, the main character feels like a pawn being moved around without any agency of their own. (Thereby giving the player the same feeling.) \n\nAt the start of the game you get screwed over, but are then forced to do the job of the guy that screwed you over because \"Well, sorry, but I'm too old to do it and you can't go back so what else are you gonna do lol? Grow old and die?\" What kind of motivation is that? It turns the entire game into a chore I'm doing for *somebody else* who is already inherently unlikable. Why? If I was seeking my revenge against him, or leading an investigation into the theft, or if there was any more mystery to it besides \"there's this door, something neat might be behind it if you finish the game\", I might feel more compelled to play, but right now? I just don't.\n\nThe game has decent puzzles, but has combat that so far feels very same-y. I obtained a new weapon, and while it was supposedly different than my sword, it didn't feel different enough to warrant changing my play style at all, so I just ended up playing the same as I had been. \n\nI've encountered some bosses, and sometimes I wish they'd telegraph their movements a bit better, although it's not terrible. There was one mini boss I had to fight three times, but the 2nd and 3rd time was just the same boss but with infinitely spawning adds, which didn't particularly impress me. Additionally, for many bosses it felt like there wasn't a moment of respite where the boss was recovering from its big attacks for me to go ham on it, like I would kind of expect there to be. There was just the brief period between the attack they just finished and their next attack. I didn't particularly like this rhythm of boss fights, although this may be personal preference.\n\nAll in all, It's serviceable. If that's good enough for you, then by all means, get the game, but I don't think I'm going to play it much more. It feels too polished to give it a low score, but in my opinion, its execution keeps it from being truly enjoyable. \n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1687189231, "timestamp_updated": 1687189231, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477667510509490967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140337900": {"recommendationid": "140337900", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971082447", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1687216712}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1687188172, "timestamp_updated": 1687188172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140327689": {"recommendationid": "140327689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855617611", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1529, "last_played": 1689116203}, "language": "english", "review": "Very beautiful, charming game about death :]", "timestamp_created": 1687173643, "timestamp_updated": 1687173643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140294530": {"recommendationid": "140294530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000514936", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1687114845}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little Zelda-like.", "timestamp_created": 1687114871, "timestamp_updated": 1687114871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140278245": {"recommendationid": "140278245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101639574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1209, "last_played": 1690545434}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amazing game, once you finish a game, you'll lose motivation to collect other collectables but that night mode made lot of difference.

(except the boss battles music, those were decent)\n- story is also OK-ish although it didn't matter much to me.\n\nOverall if you are a fan of Hollow knight or Hyper light drifter, there is a high chance that you would enjoy this game (although probably not as much).", "timestamp_created": 1686502384, "timestamp_updated": 1686503113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139892246": {"recommendationid": "139892246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102481400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1687025339}, "language": "english", "review": "1", "timestamp_created": 1686492147, "timestamp_updated": 1686492147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139871002": {"recommendationid": "139871002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254220073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1029, "last_played": 1686543848}, "language": "english", "review": "You can beat the game with an umbrella and feel cool because of it", "timestamp_created": 1686457189, "timestamp_updated": 1697819488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139862613": {"recommendationid": "139862613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360241288", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 999, "last_played": 1684337380}, "language": "english", "review": "Chef's kiss.", "timestamp_created": 1686441402, "timestamp_updated": 1686441402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139862426": {"recommendationid": "139862426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196106018", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1418, "last_played": 1686440954}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely adored this game.

It's a solid enough system in it's right, but all other mechanics within that bucket are rather underutilized. Too with the different weapons and the upgrade system. I didn't really feel the upgrades in and of themselves did much to really spice anything up. Too with the weapons that - for being rather cool looking - didn't do much to really vary the gameplay. Honestly, you could very well stick with the starter sword for the whole game and feel little to no effect. The only one that has [i] some [/i] altercations to the way it works is the hammer with the shock attack and very long heavy attack windup but the others very much feel like typical \"quick but low damage\" and \"slow but high damage\" variations with no more thoughts to their design. Magic attacks too feel very much the same apart from the bomb which is hard to use in fights for it's slow charge.\n\nPerformance and graphics wise it is solid. Played it on my Steam Deck and had it play at a solid 60 fps with the APU at full load, which meant it could only play for 90 mins on full charge. But, in short, it looks well and will play well on just about any system.\n\nStory is very confusing. The beginning and the \"main hook\" with your assigned soul being stolen and having to figure out how it ties in to the upheaval of the word to not spoil much. But honestly, I don't even how much I really [i] can [/i] spoil in this game. The midpoint of the story feels utterly nonsensical and it's only in the end it tries to take itself seriously about the whole prospect of death and what is sacrificed trying to reach immortality, but by that point it's too little too late for the game. \n\nThe only thing I feel redeems it is the puzzle and platforming outside of it. It's well thought out and can be quite a mind tweezer trying to figure out how to move through an area and in that regard they do feel quite well designed and memorable so the lack of a map doesn't feel like a issue in the game. And the secrets inside of the game are also rather well thought out with the one caviat of the man-hole covers and NEVER being told you have a ground-pound attack you can do from the air to access them. I had to google that to figure out what their purpose was.\n\nAll in all... It's decent. It's a fine enough little time waster I'd say you should get on a sale if it interests you.

Its just weak, all the weapons feel the same since they have basicly the same or similar attack range / attack speed, with the same animation. And on top of that they are the worst, i had an easier time doing the umbrella achievement( use only the umbrella, so basicly go full magic attacks) because masgic has more variety and is stronger.

It's a wonderful mix of laid back and challenging game play, but all really high quality.  If I'd tested this game without knowing who made it I would have guessed Nintendo.

I missed the old way of having to remember where things were in the world and this game really gave that to me and hidden features were done in a really great way- right in front of you but hard to see.

The generic enemies are not that special, but they are actually not annoying which is unusual.\n\nThere's an assortment of weapons, tons of shinies to collect and some pretty sweet environments to spend a chunk of your time on. It is a fun game to experience. One thing of note in fact is that each boss gets a eulogy and burial. And the final boss is not the end of the game... I personally also really dig the way they introduce the character Pothead, a definite nod to Siegward, Siegmeyer and Sieglinde from the Dark Souls trilogy.\n\nIf I have to voice some gripes though? The final boss' first battle is an obstacle course slog. Doable, but it drags on too much. And the umbrella challenge achievement does require you to not even swing your default weapon until you pick the darn thing up and switch to it. Some areas also have enemy spam with cheap death opportunities on top due to Crow being unable to swim or fly. Some more bosses or enemy types would've been nice to have.\n\nAll in all, I'd say Death's Door is well worth the money and time you need to put into it, but know that its a short game and not too

It's simple, but it does simple well and it's strengths are by far what I listed above. If you want a hardcore gaming experience this may not be for you.\n\nEdit: I beat the game at around 8.5 hours. I can tell there's definitely a lot of extra secrets that I could go back and explore the world again, so that could probably extend gametime a bit. I won't because my backlog is too big for that. Some may feel like the price doesn't reflect that kind of length, but this game was pretty quality all the way through.\n\nMy biggest complaint after looking at the whole thing, is that the bosses. They were cool and had great themes, but usually repeated the exact same 2, maybe 3 attack patterns over and over again which weren't all that difficult to read. The difficulty with them came usually at the extent of how many hits you had to land and sometimes felt very spongy - so sometimes I found myself getting a bit bored because I \"got\" the boss but had to sit through the same 2-3 attacks for a while before they were beat. I feel like I would have gotten all the bosses on the first attempt, but usually because of how spongy they were I got too greedy and would get punished and die. I wish I would die from having to learn the boss, as opposed to struggle with greed. The visual design and setpiecing of them though I feel makes up for that. \n\nI feel overall after finishing that I can recommend those who want a cozy, zelda like explorative experience with great atmosphere and setpiecing.

Mechanically, it's fine, if somewhat on the easy side. But it starts in an interesting and story-forward way with an intense ambiance and an interesting premise, and then just drops more and more of that story on the floor as the game goes on. By the end of the postgame, the final narrative sequence is mostly about a different game entirely, while leaving every narrative question I was actually interested in completely unanswered. \n\nIt probably feels harsh to give a negative review to a game that plays perfectly well just because of its approach to storytelling, but it's hard for me to exaggerate the extent to which that storytelling peaks in the first five minutes and goes continuously downhill from there. At the start of the game, everything about the character's role and their motivation for pursuing the game's objectives make sense in light of in-game events. But by midgame, you're just wading through trite non-sequitur video-game-isms that go unexplained and unacknowledged by all the narrative parts of the setting (e.g. the best non-spoilery example I can think of: every dungeon eventually teleports you back to a remote area of your headquarters where a crowned ghost-bird locked in a box grants you a new spell after an internal battle. It's a very video-game-y mechanic, but [i]why[/i]? Who're these birds? Crowns are a meaningful symbol, so why a crown? What's the link to your organization? Were these spells locked and hidden to keep them from people like you; if so, when and by whom? These details would fit perfectly well in the story and add appropriate complication... but instead, nothing and nobody else ever mentions them or expresses any interest in them, so they're just a wild out-of-the-blue mechanic and animation that turns the game farther toward no-context generic-fantasy. If there's going to be no tie-in to the rest of the game at all, it would be better if they were just items in a box without fanfare; having an elaborate visual spectacle with no meaning just makes it clearer that the game doesn't care about the [i]why[/i] of things anymore, and neither should you.) Postgame continues right off the deep end; video game logic rises to 100%, narrative justification falls to 0%, and a convoluted fetch-quest culminates in a cutscene that's mostly about a different game entirely (that game was fine; I'm not sure why its protagonist needed to take narrative splash-damage from the 'true ending' of this one).\n\nSo ultimately this review is dedicated to the escalating sense of disappointment I felt as each development in this game's story managed to further undercut the initial interest it piqued.

In between them is just samey lever pulling forever. The environment design is good looking but it's just used to facilitate straightforward basic level design without any depth and barely any variation besides a few slightly different ways to activate a door opening, and 90% of your time will be spent just running around finding switches to open doors so that you can open more doors in the same way. \n\nIt's ok overall.

Enemies were redundant and dull, with the bosses being the only real entertainment, and the inconsistency in fighting was frequent.

experiencing, albeit with some issues. \n\nIf you enjoyed playing Hyper Light Drifter, you'll easily scratch a similar itch here. This game revolves around going to different areas and defeating bosses after solving puzzles/clearing rooms, unlocking collectibles and new areas as you gain your 4 primary spells.\n\nThe game looks amazing and the controls are super responsive. You can tell the developers really cared about the game and poured in a lot of passion. The music is great, although it didn't stick with me as well as other game soundtracks. The use of leitmotifs was fun, and the music often fit their settings, but for some reason I don't see myself listening to the soundtrack outside of the game as much as I would with others. Originally, I felt that the music seemed repetitive at first because it definitely was - at least, before you get moving to other areas. As the game opened up more and more, that became much less of an issue and I found myself enjoying the soundtrack more.\n\nAs for story, the game definitely feels like it falls a bit short there. There are some great set pieces and a very intriguing world that is built, with some charming but one note characters. It almost felt like they had a vague idea on what they wanted to say, but the gameplay doesn't exactly lend itself to the story it's trying to tell, and otherwise characters show up maybe once or twice throughout the whole game for specific plot points and aren't relevant otherwise.\n\nAs for the combat, this ties into the game's controls and I'd say that they feel really good to use. Your attacks are quick and there's great feedback from each hit, especially if you're playing on controller and have some rumble enabled. However I do agree with a common critic of the combat - it's a bit repetitive. While the combat feels good, many combat encounters become a test of stamina. How many waves of enemies can you fend off back to back? \n\nI wouldn't say that it's necessarily not fun, I found myself enjoying dodging around while I kited enemies, deflected shots back at them while weaving in and out. The boss encounters are a bit challenging but once you get their patterns down, it's really satisfying to dodge in and out to get some hits in when you can. But if the combat isn't initially engaging for you, you may find yourself having a difficult time playing through the rest of the game because it's basically more of that. While there are different weapons to unlock throughout your playthrough, I found myself enjoying the default sword the most, and I didn't exactly feel a lot of variation in the combat even as you unlocked new weapons and spells.\n\nThe spells are more important for exploration than combat, too. They do have upgrades that you can get through finding challenge arenas throughout the world, but their upgrades feel almost like quality of life improvements than substantial power boosts. Again, if you don't exactly like how a spell feels, you're likely not going to like it much more after getting it's upgrade.\n\nAnother point of contention I had when I was playing through the game was that the lack of a map of any kind made navigating the world a bit more convoluted than I would have liked. Eventually, you get your feel for the areas, but on your first couple of times through, you end up just stumbling around and getting confused as to which room leads where. I would have also enjoyed a bit more indication as to what and where things you may have missed in an area are. As I was trying to 100% the game, I found myself running through areas I had already cleared over and over again, unsure of what to even look for while the game told me something was still left to be found. \n\nAn indication of just what I'm missing from an area would have been appreciated. At the same time, towards the end of the game, there are unlockables that cannot be accessed until you do something in a different area, leading to moments where I ran through an area checking everything, wasting time trying to find what I missed before realizing that completing a different area first would allow me to access what I was missing. I'm not sure as to if there's an elegant solution to this issue, but I wish it didn't feel like there was time being wasted that I didn't need to waste.\n\nEven with all of these critiques, I'd still highly recommend this game. For the price, you're getting a well rounded package that I still greatly enjoyed playing. While it doesn't break any new ground like some other games that send me to annoy and pester all my friends to play it, it doesn't exactly have to. If this game seems interesting to you, I can reasonably say that you'll likely enjoy your time with it. It's got some areas that need more refinement to truly make the experience smooth, but I definitely had a nice time playing through the game.

La perspectiva del juego, la vista, que no termina de ser del todo cenital pero no es la cl\u00e1sica para un juego en 3D tampoco, ser\u00eda m\u00e1s bien un h\u00edbrido, es algo bastante interesante por la novedad aunque puede hacer que se te envenene alg\u00fan combate m\u00e1s de la cuenta. La historia y los di\u00e1logos por ahora me han parecido bastante m\u00e1s graciosos de lo que esperaba (tambi\u00e9n depende del nivel de humor que tengas, hay que admitirlo). Como cosa negativa, algunas mec\u00e1nicas no terminan de quedar claras si no est\u00e1s muy atento, por ejemplo, tuve que acudir a comentarios de los propios desarrolladores y otros usuarios respecto al funcionamiento de los checkpoints que, aunque estaban en mi cara en algunos momentos, no hab\u00eda entendido bien como funcionaban. \n\nEn fin, buena chapa para haber jugado solo 4h, pero el juego me est\u00e1 encantando. Si te mola el g\u00e9nero metroidvania este juego, personalmente, debe ser un must.", "timestamp_created": 1681069258, "timestamp_updated": 1681069258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136380540": {"recommendationid": "136380540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078375000", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1681000856}, "language": "english", "review": "Is the game bad?  No, but it is so aggressively mediocre.  For all it's peers within the genre, it has very little that makes it stick out aside from maybe the theme.  All the weapons hit in the same arc and the only variance across them is VERY minor stat differences.  Like the normal weapon has an attack value of 1, and the big hammer has a damage value of 1.2 which makes it pointless since it only can attack twice between swings.  The daggers are objectively the best weapon in the game since the attack value is .8 but can attack six times in a volley (and also has the fastest attack speed).  The enemy variety is very low, and combat gets repetitive pretty fast.  I will say that the final fight was the most interesting part of the game.  The rest is just so, bland and boring.

It has simple artstyle, simple enemies, and simple mechanics. if it was all that however, I wouldn't say it is simply good, the game has amazing characters, incredibly good bosses with readable movesets, and banger OST.\n It's core problem comes with location designs, or as I would call them \"goddamn mazes\" and the amount of walking and backtracking in this game is beyond tedious. The game is also very linear, it tries to hide it by giving names of certain bosses you have to beat, but you only can access one, and the others are locked behind obstructions that can only be cleared by getting the ability in the area of the first boss. And with locations having collectibles locked behind gaining the abilities from other bosses areas it gets annoying. With the best idea to get all the collectibles you journey would have to go like this: 1. Go to the boss location 1 and get ability 2. backtrack and go get to the boss location 2 ability  3. repeat steps 1 to 2 until you get all abilities. Then finally you have the freedom to go all around and then start killing bosses in whatever order you want. Although all that criticisms I still enjoyed the game very much, the collectibles in particular are very purposeful, they are either objects with lore in them, or souls which you can use for upgrades. With that in mind I will say the game is incredibly fair. Not once when dying I felt that it was the game's fault. With all that in mind, I can recommend this game to anybody that wants some easy metroidvania on one or two nights.\nGetting to the true ending was time-eating and completely unfun tho. I wouldnt recommend doing that.\n", "timestamp_created": 1680938386, "timestamp_updated": 1680938386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136306732": {"recommendationid": "136306732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170950838", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1726, "last_played": 1681012472}, "language": "english", "review": "More than worth it for the price, stellar game.

The game is shockingly long for the content within. The purchaseable upgrades aren't fun or interesting. The upgrades to health and magic are very hard to find without spending absurd amounts of time. I never bothered to find an upgrade to a single spell because it involves painstaking backtracking in the very late game and every hidden item outside the weapons wasn't worth the effort invested up to that point. I didn't even know they existed until I looked up the achievements. (Don't even get me started on the extremely time-intensive un-fun achievements).\n\nThe combat is also pretty unrewarding, you have no way of healing and a small pool of health mistakes. The dodge roll feels floaty and you have to trigger it early, but some bosses and enemies are specifically built to punish too-early dodges. It's mostly just frustrating. At least the final boss fight has checkpoints, but they're pretty darn far apart.\n\nMy recommendation is probably to watch a stream of it, it'll be a more enjoyable experience.

I decided to give the game a second chance and I'm glad I did. While I still have some complaints (especially about that miniboss), and I'll go into them, I enjoyed the game thoroughly and 100%-ed it.\n\nFirst, the good. Although I have some issues with it, the gameplay overall is incredibly solid. Combat is fun and just feels good about 95% of the time, and exploration is interesting and fairly rewarding. The game is beautiful, although the relatively limited color palette does start to feel slightly stale by the end of the game. The music is really good, especially the high intensity tracks. The writing is also a standout, and is legitimately hilarious at times.\n\nNow for the negatives. There's a few mechanical issues that can get frustrating. Most of the magic/ranged abilities have autoaim, which is usually good, but sometimes will aim at the wrong thing, or in the case of the last magic ability, miss entirely. It's usually not an issue, but there's some portions where you need to cast quickly and accurately, so it can get a bit frustrating at those times. Works well most of the time though.\n\nI mentioned a miniboss that made me quit the first time I tried. The huge mace guys are, by far, the worst enemies in the game, and they appear about a half dozen times. The main issue with them is the way hitboxes in this game work. They are much larger than they appear visually, especially for ground AOEs (which is all the mace guys do). Now, normally, this is countered by the i-frames from your dodge roll. You just ignore where the AOE is hitting and dodge right before it hits, no problem. I don't particularly like the design of it, but it's functional. The issue comes with the mace guys doing 2-3 ground slams in rapid succesion. I frequently found myself dodging away from them, avoiding the first attack, only to still be in range of the second attack before my dodge roll came off cooldown. It was infuriating.\n\nThese enemies do become easier to deal with as you either upgrade attack, which gives you better range, or find one of the two weapons with better range. This lets you poke at them from the edge of their range and dodge away. It's not fun, but it's doable at least. I really wish these fights were better, though, because basically all the other minibosses and bosses are super fun to fight.\n\nFinally, some nitpicks. The game is a bit labyrinthine, so it can be hard to be sure you've explored everywhere. Thankfully, areas aren't too large, so it's not as much of a problem as it could be. Also, and this is just a personal issue, you can't 100% the game before the final boss. You can get almost to 90%, but the last 10% or so is only available in the postgame. Just a warning for folks like me to like to complete everything before the end boss.\n\nStill, even with these complaints, the game is very good, and I definitely don't regret giving it a second chance.

It has a nice balance of serious and funny> I actually quite enjoyed the plot so far! I still have a fair way to go but I think it has shown to be a strong point for the gameThe cons: - The checkpoints are tooooooooooooo faaaaar awaaaay - I'm not even kidding, the backtracking to get from your respawn point to the point of combat is insaaaanely long, I got so fed up and have died multiple times on the journey because all the enemies respawn again. this is especially a problem for people who suck at the game - like me :(- The healing points have a similar issue where they're too far and few in between given how far away the save points are- A lot of the combat isn't upsettingly difficult, but it happens so often where the platforms are just horrible and gives u more ways to die than the enemy itself. This is just a personal opinion but: i really didn't like it!! Picture this: you're rolling to dodge and then soon, you're falling off the edge into the water because the walkways are soooo narrow @_@I would give it a 3.8/5! Recommended for people who love a good souls-like with a fair bit of challenge. If you're not a regular hack-and-slash player like me, maybe not so much.

Sound and music? Perfect. Visual design? Beautiful. Combat? Fluid. But here's where things get iffy.[olist][*]Firstly, the WHOLE game is painfully linear. From start to finish, you travel in one long winding path that just happens to intersect back on itself sometimes, giving the illusion of these big, sprawling, complex landscapes. And no, I don't mean this in the way that zelda-likes or metroidvanias require looping back on themselves. What we have here is a whole lot worse.[*]Secondly, exploration is shallow. Along this linear path, you can stray from it here and there, and you'll often be rewarded for doing so, but it's always just that: the reward, which is always very minor. You won't find large hidden areas or secret paths or hidden abilities.[*]Thirdly, items, weapons and abilities. Yes, you unlock a few abilities that spice up combat and allow you to go back and pick up stuff you couldn't earlier, but there's nothing more than that. There are weapons to collect, but they lack diversity and balance, making only a couple have any use. There are items to collect, maybe like 25 or 30, but out of all of them, I can only think of 1 that had any use at all. The rest were purely for the sake of having.[*]Fourth, puzzles. Every puzzle in the game except maybe 1 is self-contained. Meaning if you have the tools to solve it, you don't need to leave the room to complete it. This makes puzzlesolving uninteresting and way too easy, at least for me.[*]Fifth, worldbuilding. Any depth that was added to this world is only conveyed to you [spoiler]at the end of the game. And there isn't really a whole lot of depth to be conveyed at all.[/spoiler][*]Lastly,[spoiler] the endgame. You set out to collect the MacGuffins, which requires a lot of backtracking, and along the way, the number of new enemies that you encounter could be counted on less than half of one hand. And once you collect 'em all, there's... (MAJOR SPOILERS----->) nothing. Not even a boss. Just lore, and at that point I hardly cared very much.[/spoiler][/olist]TL;DR:[list][*]Sound, music, visual design, and combat are very good[*]The game is linear[*]Exploration is shallow[*]Collecting things has very little value[*]Puzzles are dull and too easy[*]Worldbuilding is close to nonexistent outside of a few cutscenes[*][spoiler]The endgame is very close to pointless[/spoiler][/list]", "timestamp_created": 1679642286, "timestamp_updated": 1691929155, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135279662": {"recommendationid": "135279662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042001749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1117, "last_played": 1679629050}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game and story.

I had fun in this game, at least until the first boss fell. It's like a softer Zelda-esque game, complete with the \"darkworld\" when you can finally get to it. The opening stuff was fun and the first boss was even fun. I liked her house and the way she would show up periodically. There was even a fun new character to meet. The second boss and third boss left much to be desired, the latter not even showing up until the fight. Maybe give me a map too? Jeez. Sometimes those layers of areas were maddening to try and memorize where I needed one specific thing, particularly with the ghosts.\n\nThis is pretty much the summary of the whole game. Three bosses, final boss, then extra stuff if you want to 100% the game. The combat was fluid, but became tedious and boring. Bosses all had the same timing for dodges. You just picked the weapon you liked best and could capitalize on it's strength/speed. The achievements weren't even one of the parts of the game that made it fun. After running around for close to 4-5 hours finding shrines, I just gave up on the 100%. The music was very pleasant but the scenery was very melancholy. I understand that was probably the intent but still made it difficult to look forward to beating the game. Maybe change the world a little when a boss was beaten? This last bit will just be left open, since it's a spoiler to discuss it further. The story was \"interesting\", I guess.

Something goes awry after defeating your target and you lose the soul you have to deliver to the headquarters. Reapers usually can\u2019t die as long as they do their job properly. As you have lost the soul, you are now not immortal and have to get it back. On your journey you have to travel to 3 distinct areas to defeat three big beings to reap their giant souls. According to a big old crow, who stole your soul, in order to open the so called Death\u2019s Door the 3 giant souls are required to gain access to you target\u2019s soul again.\n\nWhile traveling the different areas the crow will face puzzles and battles, both which are not too hard but not easy either. The combat is good to understand, not too shallow but also not too complex so that you can quite enjoy it. Depending on the weapon you have a different range, can attack multiple times, charge attack and dodge attack. You will learn multiple spells to fight and deal with certain obstacles. There is an upgrade system you can access in the reaping headquarters. Basically you can level 4 different aspects (melee damage, magic damage, faster attacking/charging, more speed/better dodge roll), though each upgrade is fairly minor and costs more and more soul energy gained by slaying enemies or found in the world.\n\nThe areas itself are most of the time rather linear. In each area is one dungeon with a big locked door. Each time you have to gather the souls of 4 deceased crows to get enough energy to open the door and get a new spell to advance further. The concept is a bit too formulaic but each dungeon is very different to each other nonetheless so it doesn\u2019t matter that much. While being more linear there is still much to explore. Hidden doors, secret passages, places in previous areas which are now accessible, there is a lot to find. Sometimes the game plays with its perspective to conceal secrets, for example you walk to a corner of a wall just so that the camera shifts and reveals a secret area there. Most of the stuff you find is just soul energy used to upgrade your stats or life seeds which are needed to grow healing plants in pots spread around the world. A few weapons are scattered around the world, each feeling different in battle and usable in one way or the other. Though I did not use one weapon in particular because I was enjoying another weapon I found prior and latter got a weapon better altogether.\nSometimes you find some shiny trinkets which, besides a steam achievement and 2 used ingame for something, are mostly just for lore/fluff which yeah is fair, but don't expect something like \u201cOhhhh what a cool item I found, I wonder what it could be used for\u201d. Occasionally you will also find secret shrines which increase your health or magic pool when getting 4 of the respective kind.\n\nThe artstyle is awesome. Death\u2019s Door has a great and coherent look. The character designs are akin to some of the big animation studios some say comparable to Ghibli. Each area has a distinctive look. The Reaping Headquarters for example is almost fully grey with certain few objects giving a distinguished color.\n\nThe soundtrack by David Fenn is just beautiful. Each area has a great atmospheric soundtrack. I couldn\u2019t help myself but humming to the melody from time to time. Calm soothing tracks are followed by adventurous ones, some emphasising the urgency of your current situation, we even got some battle songs with a rather rocky guitar touch. All songs are fitting neatly together. Some have a recurring melody with a different arrangement/instruments/added parts which is really cool, especially when the melody came back in a guitar boss battle theme. The whole ost is available on YouTube if you want to listen to it before making a decision. Just let me say that alone for the ost the game is more than worth it.\n\nI like everything of the game, the gameplay, the artstyle, the music, the story, you name it.\nIt is a highly recommendable game for me.

The dungeon-crawling, souls-style game creates an interesting, enjoyable, and more welcoming title in the genre. As a *sword*-wielding, *projectile*-flinging, *soul*-stealing, acrobatic-avian, you have everything you need to explore the vast and intricate environments on your quest. Victories feel rewarding, deaths make you want to give it another go.\n\n[b]| Combat |[/b]\n[i]Dying is quick, Getting back to the fight is quicker[/i]\nDue to being a tiny bird, you are required to be crafty, quick, and precise to effectively cut through the demonic creatures that fill the land. The simple, yet effective combat techniques at your disposal are more than enough when facing the unique enemies and bosses that you will encounter. Death's Door may not delve as deep into various battle-styles, but this isn't without purpose as every fight feels unique and fresh due scenery, terrain, and opponent match-ups. Some fights are easier than others, but there are definitely multiple fights that end with [b] DEATH [/b] appearing on your screen in giant letters. Every death is quickly greeted with life and another chance to battle. There wasn't a single time that I felt frustrated in the presence of death, [i] even in a particular fight that cost me my life 20+ times [/i]. Almost every death had me going \"Yeah, I messed up there\". Die, Learn, Repeat until you don't die. \n\n[b]| Gameplay |[/b]\n[i]Shiny stuff... shiny stuff everywhere![/i]\nDeath's Door drops you into an environment that feels devastated, decayed, and abandoned. As you travel to multiple areas, you will find yourself dissecting every possible section to find any hidden secrets. You will be left wondering what happened here and why isn't anyone talking about it. There is a constant crave to find secret passageways, solve puzzles, and gather items as you advance forward. Death's Door is a trifecta, combining Zelda-Souls-Metroidvania aspects, all into one game. You are rewarded for exploration, but make sure you are always aware of where you are. One thing to note, you are not equipped with a map to navigate, resulting in a few minutes of backtracking and going through a couple of doors until you find your way. It fits the theme, but I wish my little crow had a better understanding of his surroundings.\n\n[b]| Sound |[/b]\n[i]Squawking in Harmony[/i]\nDeath's Door wouldn't be complete without its upbeat, electric-orchestral mix to aid you in your epic quest and intense fights. You might find yourself experiencing the battle theme over and over again due to [b]DEATH[/b], but you will be head-bopping the entire time. Your attacks are satisfying, from swift swooshes to heavy thonks. Occasionally, I found my audio volume adjusting mid-game to either very loud or very soft. I'm not sure what the cause of this was, but ultimately, it didn't take away from the experience.\n\n[b]| Conclusion |[/b]\nAll in All, Death's Door was enjoyable and intense. It's welcoming to players who might not be willing to fight through Elden Ring, but still challenging enough that most people will die a few times :) If you are okay with that, then I would absolutely recommend Death's Door. You can currently pick up the game for $20, which I truly believe is an absolute steal. I still have the post-game content to complete, but I couldn't wait to get my thoughts out about Death's Door.

It's a short game, but that lends itself well to the extremely tight execution. The narrative is equal parts whimsical and bleak, with a sort of Hollow Knight/Dark Souls energy that is currently trendy, but not yet over-done, and memorable characters and locations. The over-world hub is really intriguing as well, and I love the choice to only render certain things in color. And the music is beautiful!\n\nBut where the game really shines is in the game-play: namely, platforming, puzzles, and combat. The progression of platforming is really satisfying, giving you just enough \"roadblocks\" to make you realize you're probably going to need a new skill for that, and not to waste your time without it. As you gain skills, it really opens up the game, and it gives that good good dopamine. Puzzles are clever, though rarely difficult enough to really slow your progress, and flow nicely with the rest of the game. Combat is the true star here, offering an enjoyable level of difficulty and a learning curve that makes you feel like a god when you get into the groove. It requires you to learn each enemy's movements and attack patterns: when is it safe to swing at them? Once, twice, three times? When they curl up, they're going to roll at you! Dodge them, but not right away, or else they'll re-align to hit you as you come out of the dodge roll. Satisfying, frustrating, and absolutely blissful when you get it right :)\n\nMy two points of criticism are these:\n1) WHY NO MAP!?

I say that because I completed the game 100% in 8 hours and not once was it boring (maybe because I also enjoy finding everything). \n\nThe main enemies can be broken down to 7 types: the lights, the grunts, the archers, the casters, the heavies, the minibosses and the bosses. Other than the bosses, which is obvious that they have different attacks, each enemy type has variations I'd say a minimum of 2 and a maximum 4 or 5 with each variation becoming more difficult to deal with. \n\nThe combat has hit a sweet spot where it is fun, fluid and not insanely challenging, letting players at almost every skill range enjoy the experience.

Both games are isometric action adventure titles that take direct influences from NES+SNES Zelda and Souls-like games.  Both games have a degree of difficulty, especially with regard to bosses.  However, where Tunic spends its endgame in puzzles, Death's Door seems to spend its entirety in fighting and meeting characters.  \n\nAnd for that, this reminds me a lot more of TLoZ: Ocarina of Time.  There's plenty of memories here that are just going to stay with you, nifty characters that will either hit or miss.  Also like Ocarina, the story beats are far better delivered than the story itself.  Some bosses were the life of the show for the entire dungeon, and some just kinda show up and I must've missed a dialog somewhere on why I should've cared who they were.  You'll often return to your home base expecting to hear new dialog from your friend-crows, but they're repeating what they've been saying since the previous dungeon.  Heck, by the end-game, when your friend-crows are mounting their rally cries, you've largely forgotten their names... they're just \"crow who types\" and \"crow who smokes\"\n\nThe tone varies wildly from serious to screwball and I think that can play against a game that should've been more earnest at times.  Your crowtagonist has great characterization for a mute protagonist, but this game just keeps kicking them around as if they didn't just wade through an army of pouncing zombies.  More than a few scenes are just played for cheap laughs when you really just want to see your crow and their friends go through a character arc\n\nIn the end, I really love this game, and any complaints are because I want to see a sequel really nail what this missed.  \n\nThe crow must be protected from death at all costs!", "timestamp_created": 1674830647, "timestamp_updated": 1674830647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131653635": {"recommendationid": "131653635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991259827", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 486, "last_played": 1676477470}, "language": "english", "review": "Love love love this game!

This game has a really solid foundation, but has some design choices that make me scratch my head.

In fact, while we're at it, why do I have to hold the trigger and press a button to activate a ranged ability? This game isn't exactly showering us with different actions (you can dodge, attack, interact, and charge attack). Why can't spells be their own buttons? Or at least cast on the move? That would have made combat feel far more dynamic, and less like it was punishing me for trying to weave spells in (each has a rather long charge up before use too, making melee really the only option in many fights and boss fights). \n\nAnd the final boss fight is far too long.

Its gameplay, music, and the little world that it had built was fantastic. The story revolves around life and death in a lighthearted way. Throwing little bits of humor and quirkiness for the player to breathe in and enjoy. I could really feel for the characters and their role in the grander story. There was no other game that I've played that was just like it. Death's Door's story can get kinda deep and emotional which are juxtaposed with the frantic combat of the game (That's not to say that it's bad, It's really fun and paired with its excellent story it works amazingly). I think that is why it was able to pull me in so well. And to some people these qualities may push you away from trying it yourself and that's okay. I just ask that you please give it a chance if you're slightly interested. \n\nIt's a dear little game that holds a special place in my heart. Don't let it turn you down from playing it like it almost did to me. Give it a chance and enjoy yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1673929965, "timestamp_updated": 1673929965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130989020": {"recommendationid": "130989020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058873635", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1673897100}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the aesthetics, but hate combat, then hate the combat again.

You play as a lil' crow running around trying to collect the 3 magical macguffins to get to the final boss. It has everything you'd expect for the genre: overworld / hub to railroad you to the 3 themed areas in appropriate order, light puzzling and combat to unlock the boss dungeon, new item to use as a puzzle gimmick for part 2 of the dungeon, then boss. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but that's ok. The RPG elements are nice, and you can upgrade your character at a pretty decent pace, but the upgrades point-to-point don't feel terribly impactful. The controls are tight and responsive, iframes on your roll are very generous, and the enemies generally telegraph pretty well. The difficulty is quite low, but there's a mild spike for the final boss. There are no difficulty options aside from self-imposed challenge runs (namely, an achievement for beating the game with a weapon which deals 1/2 damage).\n\nThe art style is cute, with a muted tone reflecting the somber atmosphere of the stagnant world, but isn't afraid to splash in some color here and there. The story is good enough, with a cast of characters that is varied, but not especially memorable. The music is utterly fantastic from the main menu onwards, and really elevates the experience overall.\n\nI'd like the fast travel system to be a little more quick (particularly during the \"clean-up\" phase), but you can always just quit to menu to get to your nearest point if you don't feel like running back.

Yeah, I'm glad I came back. This was one of the most fun and enjoyable games I have ever played. Death's Door in my opinion is a Zelda meets Dark Souls blend. The overall gameplay and look give you the cutesy Zelda vibe with its cute graphics and humor. While the story and \"feel\" of the game will provide you with a Dark Souls feel. \n\nYou play as a crow reaper. You are tasked with taking the soul of a boss monster. Upon defeating it and moments from grabbing the soul, you are knocked unconscious by an older Grey Crow. When you seek him out, you learn that he was also sent on an assignment to collect a soul but it's locked behind a large door. The only way to open the door is to collect these large souls like the one you were about to collect. You must venture out and collect these large souls and open the door. As you journey though, you'll learn there's something bigger going on than you originally planned.\n\nAs stated earlier, Death's Door plays like a Zelda/Dark Souls hybrid. The view is isometric and you have a basic dodge roll, attack, and heavy swing. Learning enemy timings and when to attack is important since you only have 4 hit points and it's easy for you to...well...die! You don't get to heal often in this game as you have to find these strange seeds and plant them in flowerpots around the world, that's the only way for you to heal. You have to really get your skills up if you're gonna survive.\n\nThe world and exploration of Death's Door is what really drew me to the game. Each area is unique and just like any classic Zelda game, you be revisiting places often when you obtain new weapons and abilities to find secrets. There are collectibles, hidden shrines that raise your health and magic points, and currency. You'll be using soul currency to upgrade your abilities and I found the system very fair and noticed the changes with each upgrade. Deal more damage, increase the speed of your swings, your movement/dodge speed, or the damage of your abilities. You can upgrade your stats however your playstyle demands it (I personally went attack swing then damage build).\n\nThe music was very atmospheric and a treat for the ears. I especially enjoyed boss fights in this game as well. Each large soul is held by a boss, and each of them were fun to face off against. Once you figure out their gimmicks, you'll find that they aren't hard to defeat once you get their patterns down. Whenever I lost in this game, I always knew because it was me and not the game. There are hidden endurance rooms too for you to give your abilities passive upgrades as well so exploration and a keen eye is greatly rewarded in this game.\n\nLastly, I want to point out the great story and characters. While the game doesn't beat the story over your head until the little exposition dump towards the end, you get to meet a lot of characters in the world and it really brings it \"life\" (heh heh). I found myself really caring about the inhabitants of this world and what they were going through since the rules of death were all wonky because of your boss. What's even better is that once you beat the main story, you gain the ability to change the world to a night cycle and the maps change. More secrets to find, hidden bosses, and a true ending. I did my best to get the hidden ending, but I was just short 3% before I admitted defeat. I still enjoyed it though.\n\nAs far as gripes though, I can't really pick many out. I think this game would have benefited from a small minimap, especially when you're trying to find all hidden collectibles to get the 100%. Aside from that, I have no gripes. Every death I had was on me. Even when I dodge rolled off cliffs or into water, I knew that was on me and never felt like the game cheated me.\n\nFinal verdict? This was a major treat and great to play. I loved the story, the world, and the gameplay. Some enemies were a pain to fight but that comes with the territory of adventure games like this. The exploration and maps were memorable. Loved one particular boss fight that had me grinning. And I was pushed to go for the 100% even though I gave up towards the end.

I only played one similar game called Hob a year before and I really enjoyed that game so I thought I would have the same experience with Death's Door, I guess I was wrong, I dunno why I wasn't inspired by this game, maybe fallen out of love with this type of generic that quickly (that's possible) or if I needed to take breaks more breaks from it, either way, it's not fair for me to not recommend based fully on my unenergetic experience as generally, this is a good game, just a bit basic for my liking, some of that is due to the combat. I can live with Hob combat being the same way to some extent because that's not the point of that game, it's more so about exploration and solving puzzles, but for Death's Door, I was probably expecting something more in-depth to mix and match buttons. Instead, the combat is just standard and unexciting, like imagine upgrading your firebase ability to be able to.... burn enemies......, I mean I guess, but why couldn't it do that already?\n\nThis is down to personal preference I suppose, so that's why I'm constructing this review the way I did, now to unbias review as well as some things I like about this game, so not completing unbias? wait it is possible to make an unbias review even though a lot of media we consumed is subjective, I'm probably thinking too much, am I?\n\n[h1] Unbias Review?[/h1] \n\nBias aside, graphically this game is really polished and graphically vagrant to the blocking models and the stunning environment design inviting players to explore, solve some easy puzzles, and find some hidden secrets which are many if you look hard enough. Even if you're an outsider, there's no way you can't give the developer a massive appreciation for the way they implemented a like-dungeon atmosphere you can't help but look around.\n\nAnother thing great about this game is that the boss fight felt different from one another with their quirk and messages in the ways they fight. Let's talk about Betty (the yeti) for example, is more so a playfight the way she continually just bounces around and manoeuvre all over the area which makes her unpredictable, but you can understand why because she is just a child who wants to have fun. Or what about The Grey Crow who ends up being a boss-fight, I know surprise, I mean look at his character design, and don't tell me you don't think you'll end up fighting him. But yay, not to get off track, you'll end up fighting him but don't worry it's a good fight to the sorrowful piano chorus, as well as his movement in a sense of desperation and urgency like he has nothing to lose because he lost everything in that moment which I won't spoiler. I just wish we focus on him more beforehand so the reveal can be more impactful, still a good fight by the way he trying to cling to anything to take his anger on.\n\nAnother nice touch about the enemies in general now as I like how you can tell how much HP they have a lift by how much they are cracking, for bosses of course they are more durable, which goes to show despite being fragile like glasses they would try everything to their mortal souls intact. Thinking back on that as a metaphor, speak volumes about how many people, animals, or foes we encounter in this game really don't want to die but at the end of the day, death will always be there when it's the right time for them to move on. \n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] \n\nI know I mainly focused on the bossfight in this 'unbias' section, not that everything else about this game wasn't good I just I don't have anything interesting to say about anything else, so don't take it the wrong way. Death's Door is an alright game considering I played something like it before. But if you're new to this sort of game, give it a try and you may enjoy it more than I have. \n\n\n[hr][/hr] \n[b]Recommendation for people who played this type of game before- Low-mid Recommendation.\n\nRecommendation for kids (maybe as a last-minute Christmas or New Year present)- High Recommendation.\n\nRecommendation for people who never played this type of game before- High-mid Recommendation.[/b]\n[hr][/hr]", "timestamp_created": 1673137851, "timestamp_updated": 1683211111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130380004": {"recommendationid": "130380004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817564504", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 920, "last_played": 1673070147}, "language": "english", "review": "me like", "timestamp_created": 1673125863, "timestamp_updated": 1673125863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130379056": {"recommendationid": "130379056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114895869", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1673124519}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a lot of fun.

That's a tough one. This game has SO MANY good, fantastic things going on. It could've been one of those \"must play games\" of a \"100 games you have to play\" or something like that. However... some bad design choices hindered the experience so much.\n\nBut before saying the negatives, what are the good things?\nFirst of all, it's a Zelda Like game. You go through dungeons, get stuff to unlock another stuff (won't spoil), each dungeon gives you a secondary weapon that will help you throughout your adventure. \nCombat is simple in a sense that you have your attack, secondary attack (magic), roll and ability to charge your weapon attack.\nAnd you CAN'T simply hack'n slash your way through it (more on that later).\n\nCharacters are amazingly charming, the background story seems goofy but it has a lot of depth to it (it's about death, afterall). The style is a mixture of Ghibli, Disney and also it reminded me of some of the 90s point and click games (especially Grim Fandango, which isn't surprising).\nI liked the humor also. Nothing over the top. Again, very charming.\n\nSo you have a near perfect package. Near ruined by basically two things:\n\n1) Complete lack of a MAP! Being a Zelda-like game, that means the game has a lot of exploration and backtracking.\nAlthough the maps aren't really big (which is good because it's very fast to navigate through them), they are so full of details that it isn't hard to get lost.\nThe game kinda expects you to know your way by heart after going back and forth...\nWell... that does happen eventually, but why? Why not give players a map to make things more smooth?\nThat's a completely unexcusable fault;\n\n2) The combat and respawn. Like I said, it's relatively simple. Which is great. It kinda goes in a soul-like (or should I say 'soul lite') way. So, if you are not the most skilled player out there (my case) you will have to deal with couple of frustrations: dying and having to go back to where you died, because you respawn at the latest 'check point' (so to speak).\nTo be fair, older Zelda games are like that. If you died at a boss, you would respawn at the beginning of a dungeon and would have to go your way again till the boss.\nBut... why? It just makes the things more annoying!\n\nAlso, with the lack of a map, not only you have to go back to where you died, but you have to remember the way back there!!\nImagine how frustrating it can be!!\n\n3) Unlike Zelda, you CAN upgrade your stats.... by a bare minimum.\nThere are four stats that can be increased (Strength, Speed, Dexterity, Magic --basically. They are called something else in the game). Each stat can be upgraded five times by using souls that you collect.\nBut each upgrade is barely noticeable. Only after upgrading the whole stat you feel A LITTLE difference.\n\n\nSo, in the end, you have this nice package with a very very debatable game play.\n\nI only managed to stay and beat the game because its charm held me there. But those poor design choices really really detracted from the whole experience.\n\nDevs, take note: doesn't matter how pretty your game is, if the actual gameplay isn't fun, then everything else doesn't matter.\n\nIn the end I would wish there was a \"neutral\" rating here.

ENJOY!\n\n[b] things I liked [/b]\n\n- I LOVED the environments! from deep green, vibrant jungles to desolate ice capped mountains, the game invited you to enjoy all the levels with a nice mixture of exploration and secret discovery. There were definitely a few moments I was wowed by the visuals!\n\n- The boss fights were enjoyable as hell! Not only was every boss unique visually, but they all fought in different ways that forced you to always adapt. I was never too frustrated by any unfairness, and once you learned the boss patterns from some trial and error (as this game demands) they became less of a chore and more fun. \n\n- the storytelling and overall world design were an added bonus for me. I loved finding all the little trinkets that added some flavor text to the world lore, and finding all the odd characters living in the world was something I looked forward to cuz they always offered a little more insight into what was going on, and what happened before. Big props to the writing also, I thoroughly enjoyed it! \n\n[b] things I didn't like [/b]\n\n- some of the hit detection is wonky and it led to more than a few unnecessary deaths in combat...and sometimes outside of it when I rolled off a bridge or platform LOL. I want to say it isn't a big issue, cuz you learn QUICK to stop making the mistakes. \n\n- there are some systems in the game, like traversing the underground sewers via those gray disks you find around the levels that weren't explained and a few other little things that coulda used just a little more explanation. Did you know you can deflect almost every attack? Remember that going into this game! \n\n[b] final thoughts [/b]\n\nI seriously enjoyed the hell out of this game. There was almost no huge problems that made me angry, and I liked the combination of exploration, combat, and storytelling to make for a complete experience. I'm going to highly recommend this game for fans of quirky Zelda-likes. I also enjoyed the Achievement Hunting, I think it had a good mix of exploration and discovery.

This game is also a little difficult when it comes to \"how to progress.\" I understand when games, like Dark Souls 1-3, don't out right tell you how to progress with quest markers or maps and hold players hands less. The purpose of those designs in those games are to let the player explore and gain satisfaction when they discover things on their own. However, due to the more metroidvania nature of this game, I feel that some sort of map would have been really helpful.

This introduces a ton of back-tracking, probably worthwhile because the last couple boss fights are a bit much without extra health. There's a few other weapons to find, but they were mostly useless, the starting sword is good and there's little reason to change it.

At first I thought it was a little shallow, but if you stick with it, you eventually realize there's more to this game that meets the eye. The beautiful worlds you explore are littered with little secrets you may not be able to unlock just yet upon your first visit. I thought the level design was brilliantly done. \n\nIt's well polished, the characters are simple but charming, and the music I felt was very well done also.\n\nCombat is quite simple. The different weapons aren't much different from one another so it's basically a \"what feels good for your play style\" type of pick. There is some minor upgrading as well, but nothing very in-depth.\n\n[spoiler]There's some \"end game\" tasks to complete to get a more detailed lore filled ending. I usually will just look these up on YouTube, but the lovely music and charm of this game made me actually want to go and hunt everything down for myself.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall this is a 9/10 game for me. It checks a lot of boxes for things I like to see in a solo experience game. Some may thing 20 bucks is expensive for this, but I feel it's a fair price for the quality and love put into this gem.

Did not fail to deliver at all. \n\nGoing into it, I expected it to be another Indie title with a fairly loose story line that didn't really affect much in terms of, I guess, anything, but this game is surprisingly entirely story driven and it's actually a pretty solid narrative, too. I can't really delve into it too much because it's hard to talk about without spoiling anything, but it's good. It's also a secret [spoiler] sequel to Titan Souls, a game developed by this same studio previously. It's not blatantly apparent until you get to the true ending, though. I like it when a game can pull something like that off, even if I've never played Titan Souls to compare things to. [/spoiler]\n\nThe gameplay itself doesn't disappoint either. To compare it to a newer title, it's similar in terms of gameplay to Tunic, similar dodge mechanics, same engine, similar difficulty curves, yada yada. So if you've played Tunic then you'll probably enjoy Death's Door as well, and vice versa. That being said, the combat is more varied, you've got a few different weapon choices to better suit your playstyle, and a few ranged skills you can make use of as well. The dungeons and hidden secrets are also really well designed, and without a mini map I often found myself getting lost, which added a lot to the game, imho. \n\nThen ofc, there's the music. Top fucking notch. Every track is a banger, and I wouldn't even have heard of this game or cared about it if the music hadn't come across my Spotify list and absolutely slapped. \n\nOverall, good game, it's not expensive so just play it already, what are you doing?", "timestamp_created": 1671299926, "timestamp_updated": 1671299926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128708999": {"recommendationid": "128708999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314683166", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1000, "last_played": 1671250440}, "language": "english", "review": "Death's Door is a cute little birb game that combines elements of both classic Zelda and Dark Souls.

A pretty simple combat, a decent work on locations' style, music/sound, hitboxes that actually work, a consistent general approach to the gameplay -- it is repetitive in a sense, as each world of the main three requires you to look around to 'solve' four smaller parts of it. It might be boring; it had not been boring for me personally.\n\nBacktracking is a thing, and you have no map. With locations pretty big that might be an issue.\n\nBut... the game's true ending is kinda awful. Not the ending cinematic which is nice but the road to get there.\n\nThis is a metroidvania-lite with three main locations and the hub that has access to all of them. Locations divide into sublocations, each sublocation has a portal leading to it from the hub.\n\nOnce you have ended the game, you can switch the time of day. In the night, you now see the glow on the doors that lead into each sublocation. If a door is glowing that means the sublocation has less than 100% of possible collectibles, well, collected. \n\nAt the same time the night adds 7 obscure quests and/or additional collectibles. You need to solve this additional content now, for 7 lights to light up on the true final door. \n\nThose quests are mostly silent. For the most part you have no NPCs to tell you about them.  You need to interact with them in the wild and see how things change, or notice a pretty obscure object in the faraway dead ends of each location.\n\nI prefer playing without wiki, if I can help it. But this setup is basically \"you look at a glowing door wondering what the buck the door wants from you.\"\n\nOn the bright side though the night erases almost all the roaming monsters of the land.

Quirky, charming, beautiful, and just the right amount of challenging. It's truly lovely and I highly recommend you play it if it looks like your cup of tea!\n\nI only have a handful of criticisms. First, I wish there had been a map of some kind. It feels like not having one was a deliberate choice by the developers, which I respect. It encourages exploration and immersion into the game's world... but after beating the game, it would've been really helpful while hunting down secrets and could have cut down on the amount of backtracking. This is especially true for The Lost Cemetery region. Most of the regions are pretty straight forward, but even after 17 hours and 100%'ing the game, I still found myself getting lost there!\n\nAlso, like I mentioned, there's a lot of backtracking if you're trying to do everything there is. Although, most of the regions are small enough that it's not too much of an issue. There is \"fast travel\" with the doors, but they're not always close to where you need to go. That said, the doors at the beginning of each region are also the respawn points when you die. Luckily there's usually a door before each difficult section, but not always. This means you might find yourself having to walk from the door back to where you died several times.\n\nLastly, there's a gameplay mechanic that isn't taught at all during gameplay, and it isn't required to beat the game. However, you do need it for a lot of the secrets. So this meant I had to backtrack needlessly, because I went the entire game expecting to unlock another ability to access those secrets when really the game just dropped the ball letting me know I could already reach them!\n\nDon't let these few small issues deter you from playing it though!

If the combat was a bit better and graphics were better with more detail, this game could rate quite a bit higher.  \n\nPositives:\n\n- Neat mixture of melee and ranged combat. \n- Not too difficult, but satisfying combat. \n- Neat secrets where the camera will change perspective for a moment. \n- Simple cute story, not too much dialogue to bog it down. \n- Art style is decent with a neat focus on elevation to make the game stand out a bit. \n- Music stands out as \"special\". \n\nCons:\n\n- Graphics not very detailed.  Game is solid overall and would benefit from better graphics.  \n- Customization for your character is not a lot, Only few weapon choices and character spec choices (decent overall). \n- Combat could be faster, more responsive and improved, but can still be satisfying.  At times can feel clunky and unresponsive.  \n- Pacing for the overall game is good, but pacing near the end is not very good.  People may grow tired of the game near the end.  This aspect of the game could've been easily modified and fixed.  \n\nOverall solid Zelda-like.  Above average for genre.  One of my favorite Zelda games, but does not stand out as overly special.  Music is strong though.  Combat can be very satisfying, not too difficult.  Melee and ranged combination combat is neat.  There are a few things that could have made this game feel real special.  Although, it's still good. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1667271062, "timestamp_updated": 1694968390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502435624599456787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124728673": {"recommendationid": "124728673", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993643130", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1667235597}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game only if have a controller.....i got basically scammed", "timestamp_created": 1667235657, "timestamp_updated": 1667235657, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458715617656707764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124680454": {"recommendationid": "124680454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025608563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1551, "last_played": 1667086934}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun, pretty world to explore.

It's smooth, story is witty, there are jokes, all the bells and whistles you would want from an indie developer.\n\nBut the main thing (and this is just my opinion) is missing. This game lacks depth VERY BAD.\n\nThere is only one kind of slash attack and dash. After more than 3 hours of playime there is no difference at all. Fighting is just unbelievably boring and repetitive.

The first dungeon was very entertaining, the environment and enemies were well done, and I realized that I was in for a more Zelda-like affair as opposed to a souls-like. No problem, I like Zelda and again, I was having a lot of fun. \n\nHowever, as I continued to play, the flaws of this game started to become more apparent. Every dungeon is the exact same. The enemies vary a little bit but not much, and the way you approach each dungeon is the exact same. You have to go to arenas, kill a certain amount of enemies in order to free 4 trapped souls in each one. After you free the souls, you do a little gauntlet type encounter and get a new power, which you use to explore the rest of the dungeon. That's it. It is literally just walking from one room to another trying to find the room where you fight a bunch of trash mobs. \n\nA lot of care went into the first dungeon, and so the boring gameplay loop wasn't as apparent, however it is clear that the developers did not spend nearly as much time on the level design of everything past that, which is a shame. \n\nNow for the part that was the nail in the coffin for me: the bosses were incredibly dull. The art design and the writing on them is solid, however it is a bit uninspired [spoiler] you fight an old lady, a frog, a yeti, and a crow [/spoiler]. The part that makes them bad is the design. Each boss only has about 2 or 3 attacks that they just spam one after the other, so it only takes maybe one or two deaths to learn their patterns and perfectly counter them. The bosses also have about twice as much health as they really should, which turns the game from hack and slash fun to just wait for the boss to do their attacks, and then you hit them a couple times, and then rinse and repeat ad nauseum. This was particularly relevant on the second boss, who literally only had 2 attacks that he did one after the other, and you can only attack him when he's in between them. None of the fights evolve in any significant way. So you've spent an hour slogging through the same enemies through the dungeon just to get a too-long boss fight that you could do with your eyes closed. \n\nAnd then....came what I assume is the final boss, I wouldn't know because I could not be bothered to beat him. [spoiler] Referring to the Grey Crow [/spoiler] This boss had the most poorly designed mechanics of any game I have ever played, and again had a frankly ridiculous amount of health. I put all of my upgrade points into strength and melee attack speed, and it is clear that this boss is meant to be killed using ranged attacks. His charge attack just happens, with no warning or visual/audio cue, and if you touch him while he's doing it you take damage. So if you are close to him trying to melee him, he will just get essentially a free hit on you unless you play extremely conservatively. This combined with the aforementioned massive health pool, made this boss fight such an incredible slog that I felt my eyes crossing. That would be bad enough, but he also has a mechanic where every time you hit him a bullet spawns from a completely random point on his body. So you can take damage through absolutely no fault of your own. After the third ten minute slog, I closed the game and do not plan on opening it again.\n\nThere is a lot of talent on display here with the art style and writing, its just a shame that the game itself is so incredibly mind-numbing. And honestly, the final boss fight was so bad it made me wish I had gotten to it sooner so that I could request a refund.

There are many hidden collectables, easter eggs and also a hidden finale. The world unlocks gradually revealing new secrets and always giving you extra reasons to explore more.\n- Fantastic music.

Contains some SPOILERS.\n\nThe first and most frustrating thing is the slow pace of the game, especially at the beginning before you buy movement speed upgrades, while this game doesn't even have a map, so considering the fact that it has lots of backtracking it can be annoying and then probably you should just follow a guide or even use cheats to increase your movement speed if you want to discover everything yourself. A simple solution would be to have different movement speed during combat, but then again there are many respawning monsters so that could be also a nuisance, so maybe if it would be encounters instead, like in JRPG games, that you enter combat only upon touching monsters. Another thing regarding exploration is the ledges, that you can drop down by accident when trying to do something, whether it is to your death (which at least only damages you) or somewhere on a lower level requiring you to climb back up. Would be nice if you could just teleport between the doors without having to walk between the platforms, since again, it's just wasting time and nothing else...\n\nThe second problem for me was the boring combat, it's just button mashing and evading hits/projectiles and if you wish to finish the game with an umbrella for the achievement, it gets even worse, while you can heal only using checkpoints (doors) or the flower pots which have one time use per map reset and you have to hit something, whether pots/crates or enemies to replenish your ranged/magic attacks. So there isn't much choice for combat style. The upgrades don't seem to add too much either so it doesn't feel like there's progress.\n\nThe plot is straightforward and easy to follow and even if it may seem bleak, besides the bones of the dead crows (and their spirits) and the bodies of the enemies which remain on the ground, there are barely any scary or disturbing things. Though I don't understand, why can't the crows just fly? Or at least, glide, there's no explanation whatsoever for it.\n\nThe puzzles are simple and it's good that there are no real quick time events, besides maybe bull rush or crumbling platforms, but I didn't like the sewer thing, at the beginning I thought you'll need to unlock something in order to open them, like with other things (the ankhs for example), because why would I think right away that you have to jump smash onto them when there are no enemies there?\n\nThe art is very nice, it has ragdoll elements and mostly it's obvious what you can do with the various things once you're able, having the endgame content shown to you almost at the very beginning.\n\nThe endgame (night) content, which is something like New game+ I guess, is also nice since you are going back to previous areas to explore new content and on the way you can collect items which you missed previously, but again, since you don't know that it will happen, you might be backtracking a lot beforehand to collect those.", "timestamp_created": 1664792580, "timestamp_updated": 1664792580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123267162": {"recommendationid": "123267162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043403526", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1152, "last_played": 1664777954}, "language": "english", "review": "Use the umbrella and never switch.

[b]It\u2019s quite fascinating and enjoyable[/b].\n\nThe cast are all unique and well designed and thought out, have their own story, and give life and character to this game.\n\nThe game seems to shy away from the story at the beginning, but increases irregularly with time, culminating with a crescendo at the end.\n\n\n\n[i]Would have liked a more gradual increase or just a constant high level from the start[/i].\n\n\n\n[u][b]- Gameplay:[/b][/u]\n\n[list]\n[*][b][i]Combat:[/i][/b]\n\nIt\u2019s rather simple, but I like it. [b]It emphasizes other aspects of combat[/b] like telegraphing moves, learning attack windows, etc.\n\nOne thing of note is, ranged attacks require you to aim beforehand, the aiming animation takes more time than it should, and will not register any shot in the animation. This should be instant. As in you aim and shoot, and not aim, wait and then shoot. This was especially prevalent in a segment of the game where you are required to use the hookshot constantly and consecutively, within short windows. To add to this, most ranged attacks have a wind up. Add both together and you will miss short attack windows in bosses or move before it even registered. Very annoying.\n\nThe heavy attack in this game doesn't have an instant and hold variation. Even if you press it, it will act like you're holding and will release after a pre-determined amount of time, not accepting any inputs in the meantime other than a roll, a normal heavy with a hold heavy (like most other games) would have been better and would also flow better and give more agency to the player.\n\nAlso, a unified audio and visual cue and a zoom and vibration for both ranged attacks and full holds of the heavy attack and bow would've been nice.\n\n\n\n\n[*][b][i]Puzzles:[/i][/b]\n\n\nAlthough puzzles play a more \u201cminor\u201d role when compared with combat, especially early game.

Deaths Door itself is a somewhat tied to this one and the story is placed after Titan Souls. Which is done great in any ways. I see that sometime the level design and the camera can lead to one or more frustrating deaths. Compensated for that you get a simple fighting style. \nOne thing that i love about Acid Nerve ist there Sound and Visual Design. Things like the bow or the bomb do look and sound stunning.

All I can say is I wish I played it sooner. The game starts off relatively slow. The combat is very simple yet satisfying. Impacts with your sword feel like they have weight with a dense bassy thud when they impact enemies, immediately making the action fairly addictive. Right off the bat you soak in the music, an amazing mix of violins and flutes that have this dreamlike vibe that carries you through your exploration. The entire soundtrack is amazing and fires you up throughout the game and brings you down during the emotional beats.\n\nOverall visually the game looks stellar. It has a simple, stylized aesthetic, with strong pops of colour making some areas feel lively and other areas feel cold and dilapidated. Designs of enemies can range from really cool and fantastical to almost silly looking, which I personally feel can clash a bit too much.\n\nThe gameplay is where I was mostly conflicted. At first the game starts off really simple and slow. Much of the engagement comes from bosses or bigger enemy encounters where you are locked into a room and have to fight through waves. These moments progressively ramped up throughout the game creating some rivetting encounters. Once you acquire new skills the combat takes on a new life. Exploration is also very engaging. I found myself looking around every corner for secrets as the world is densly packed with things to find.\n\nStory wise, it's fairly simple and keeps you pushing through the game. A lot of interesting characters with incredibly well written dialogue. \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1664032842, "timestamp_updated": 1664032842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122737422": {"recommendationid": "122737422", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994586610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1664016522}, "language": "english", "review": "TRASH.\n\nYou should never make another videogame again, because this was clearly a mistake. From bad telegraphing to presumptive non-tutorializing to being far too fucking stingy about upgrade resources and expanding player options, this game offers up no opportunities in its first <2 hours for people to engage with it at their own pace.\n\nWhich projectiles are reflectable? Well there are purple and blue ones, and green ones, but not the red ones except sometimes??? How about what I can expect not to be able to shoot through and vise-versa for the enemies? Oh naw only I am affected by certain terrain features which block my shots, meanwhile the guy hiding behind the barrel-with-player-seeking-projectile gets to shoot at me without worry.\n\nTeleporting enemies who can gang-up on you in the boss arena? Check. \nTedious, confusing, maze like levels with a long and arduous run-back? Check. \nInability to heal during boss fights? Check. \nBosses that have 8 hours of attack window and 2 seconds they can be safely attacked? Check. \nAn upgrade system that does not offer you any ability to increase your sustainability and mistakes you can make while playing? Check. \nUseless joke weapon at the start and literally no new items or options expanded upon after two boss fights? Check.\n\nHow you managed to get the game running smoothly is beyond me, because the basic shit in this game that is incorrect is absolutely balls-on-a-truck-hitch levels of idiotic. Normally I am more polite, but this game infuriated me beyond what should be reasonable because I just had to know how far the inconsistency and bad design rabbithole went. The fact that you really have nowhere to go, no grinding or other \"features\" of the Dark Souls franchise you so badly want to fellate such that you sabotaged this game's entire design to replicate... it boggles the mind. Not only are you jumping faster than the player on many concepts which the game's cute art style and advertising imply should be more accessible, but you do so badly and without adequately offering up any real fucking options for engagement outside of an extremely fucking basic, and boring, hack slash and roll formula.\n\nI think what pissed me off the most, and what made me almost uninstall the game entirely, was killing a boss and being rewarded 100 upgrade points... after five tries. A quarter of a single upgrade (which mind you barely fucking expands your play options and is completely invisible when applied in such half-steps) of the first tier. It takes 1600 points to get the first blip of each of the four upgrade slots, and they are so limited in their attribute contributions that the level of OBVIOUS FUCKING PADDING that has gone into the stinginess of rewarding you for beating shit is on another fucking level. Again, Dark Souls does this better, and I do not fucking like Dark Souls. When I explored a small section with a SINGLE path I could deviate from the progression route that was accessible to me, I got 100 souls from an orb sitting out in the open with no combat challenge and no puzzle.\n\nWhat... what the fuck are you doing?! Why is walking into a room as rewarding as beating the second boss in the game??? The boss that took five tries, mind you, was the castle mech which has very janky damage boxing, gets to attack for what feels like hours (roughly 5s to 30s windows it is attacking), and is vulnerable to my attacks without trading hits for less than 2 seconds. It's got a flying phase where its immune to attacks, has a load of health with no health bar (just vague hints of damage based on how cracked its exterior gets), shoots fucking lasers and rockets sometimes AT THE SAME TIME, and can fire those rockets while walking around the map doing it's spinning attack that has really fucking ambiguous telegraphing on where it hits exactly... AND I took damage at one point when I tried to be cheeky and attack it with my sword while it was winding-up its laser attack and had not fired yet, but had no attack animation to hit me with.\n\nThis game not only jumps far faster than the player on its difficulty scaling and is bad at communicating reliably what will and will not damage you, when it will damage you, and your window of dodging... but there's an Ornstein looking mother fucker in the second zone full of pot-headed guys who has a tracking lunge attack which has such precise timing that in five attempts I could not dodge it once. That boss has ended my run of this game, because the run back is in an area I can scantly navigate without dragging all of the mobs like it's fucking 2006 and I'm a Bubble-Hearth Paladin in Wailing Caverns in World of Warcraft. Mind you, you have FOUR hits you can take and then you gotta do this shit all over again, and that means yes killing everyone and trying not to take damage so you can enter the boss that will get cheap hits you can barely avoid, and will simply attrition damage you into another attempt.\n\nPadding. Uninspired. Visually deceptive. And that's without talking about the respawning pot puzzle which clearly was designed by someone who wasn't interested in you solving it ambiently as a breather between combat sections. It is not fucking smart to introduce content that players want to try their hand at, and then do it so badly it is plainly unsolvable. No hints, no riddle, nothing, just brute force or look it up, and I decided not to look it up because I wanted to see if the developers of this game could design a basic fucking puzzle. The answer was no, you need a 'special item' to determine the specific arrangement of these 5 random pots out of an arrangement of 13 on a checkerboard 5x5 grid need to be smashed. Oh and your sword arc is too big to precisely smash them if you are standing too close, so you will be confused at first by fucking smashing 8 pots and seeing 5 of them reform, and 3 of them stay broken. When a puzzle resets, the ENTIRE puzzle should reset upon the failed attempt, you amateur hour lead pellet eating neanderthals.\n\nAgain and with emphasis: this is basic design shit. Shit that shouldn't be fucking happening in 2022, let alone the year this game was published to steam, things that should be on a goddamn NES cartridge. If you don't want someone to do a puzzle, do not make it fucking accessible, make it something that becomes active due to a teaching moment like those stupid \"shoot the arrow through a torch at a blank brazer\" puzzles, which frankly I would have never realized was a mechanic if it wasn't explicitly spelled out because I couldn't expect reasonably to know what the idiots who made this game fucking intended with half of the shit on screen.\n\nWhen four blue mage guys I was trying to run away from teleported into the arena with Ornstein, I quit the game, and I will play maybe a little of the sections I have beaten to record some footage and might assemble one of those youtuber video essays, because the incompetence here is on another fucking level. It is not new for games to be imperfect, nor is it new for people who are bad at a particular game to be mad about it, but it is new to me that someone who could play Dark Souls, base their stupid fucking cute looking bird game on that concept and fuck it up so royally. There was another moment I died in a locked, entirely too long for its section combat arena in the graveyard, and it was because I rolled off a ledge... something that I only understood vaguely could happen in certain areas because until that moment no ledges could be fallen off of into the void in a scenario where it can happen by mistake.\n\n1/10 runs well, looks cute, and plays like shit.", "timestamp_created": 1664018434, "timestamp_updated": 1664018434, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.325371623039245605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122725794": {"recommendationid": "122725794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009686435", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1092, "last_played": 1663905772}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was absolutely incredible.

The character also tends to get stuck behind the tiniest of obstacles. When you start the game your characters moves painfully slowly and his melee weapon has very limited reach. I urge you to quickly work on upgrading your character's abilities because after doing that the game becomes much better playable. Some (mini-)bosses in the early game gave me a hard time, but as I progressed through the game and got new / upgraded abilities, the fights became much easier - perhaps a bit too easy, because several of the late-stage (mini-)bosses I could defeat without taking damage in the first try. This is mainly because many (mini-)bosses not only look alike, their attack patterns are also so much alike that once you know how to beat the first one, the look-a-likes hardly have any surprises left for you anymore.\n\nI bought Death's Door because several reviews described it as Zelda-like. I foolishly expected these reviewers meant BOTW-like, but instead it is more like the old Zelda games, with a heavy focus on dungeon crawling. The game is quite linear in certain  area's, but in other places  you can go off in many directions and really wonder about the place to your heart's content, looking for secrets and other stuff to do. The lack of a map is a bit of a discomfort in the beginning, but on the other hand, the map is devided into several clearly distinct areas that aren't that big so I guess the exploring would become way too easy if a detailed map was available.\n\nI didn't care too much for the story, and the initial and true ending felt a bit underwhelming.

I feel that is accurate because I'm already near the end but I'm already backtracking to get things I missed. I think I can easily say, if you enjoyed a game like Ori, you will find yourself at home here except with a different perspective. The soundtrack and game play is VERY similar. It has an amazing soundtrack that is relaxing and chill with very  similar Ori vibes and it is basically metroidvania style or in this case, Zelda. You'll start out passing things that you know you should be able to access but cannot yet. At least not until you eventually find the tool or ability needed to do so.\n\nTo try to keep this short, I don't think there is much else to say. Graphically is does look really nice and has its moments where you can appreciate the art style. The crow that you play seems rather simplistic and at first I thought it was too cheaply made based on the animation but as I got in further (rather quickly), you'll notice everything comes together perfect. The enemy animations and physics, weapon strikes and attacks are all so fluid and seamless. Even boss fights are enjoyable because of the diversity involved.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this.

Okay soundtrack, I liked it, but none really stick with me or stand out. The main theme of the grey office level I can kinda remember because you hear it the most, but even that isn't too memorable. The visuals are great! I like the aesthetic but it's not too unique either in my opinion. Some of the animations before the chest boss fight are kinda cute.\n\nMy main issue with the game is the controls feel inconsistent, movement is very slow, levels are hard to navigate, the enemies and hit boxes/stagger feel strange, and the upgrades don't really matter. The movement when 90% of the game is walking should feel good, but it's just so terribly slow in these large levels, even with the roll. There is no use of the crow flying, or even gliding, which would have been more interesting. Especially after dying, you have to trek through half the level doing the same fight over. It's just kinda boring having to walk/roll half the game, and the speed upgrade doesn't do much unless you max it out. The levels are giant, which is cool! But without a map, they're very difficult to navigate back to something you found earlier because it all looks the same after awhile in the level.\n\nThe enemies and hit boxes also feel really inconsistent, as do some of the spell timings and how they aim. Sometimes it feels like there's an auto aim that actually makes you miss your target, or sometimes it charges but doesn't go off. The rolls/dodges also were very inconsistent, sometimes being hit in the middle of what I think is the immunity frame. I understand getting hit before the immunity frame, or after, but sometimes I'd get hit when I dodged and timed it right (although, there may be no immunity/dodge, but then what is the point?). \n\nAlso, for the amount of soul the upgrades cost, they do practically nothing. It's not very visible in game, I upgraded the strength 3x and most enemies still took the same amount of hits as without an upgrade. The magic one is probably the best, I felt that it's upgrades were slightly more visible (but I also collected the power ups by defeating the minibosses, so I'm not sure if it was the upgrades or powerups that made it stronger).\n\nThe story was the worst. Pretty lackluster, and just pretty boring. It was pretty predictable who the big bad was, there weren't much plot twists. The lore or backstory to the game feels pretty tacked together, and the story isn't really cohesive. The logic of the bad guy didn't make sense. I get not wanting to die, trust me, but with how the world is built he can't do much about it, so there's not really any reason to do all the stuff he did. It also still doesn't make sense why he did any of the stuff like closing the doors if our character was still able to use/open them? If he was trying to isolate the crows so they wouldn't reap him? Idk, he let them stay in business and use his doors and is then killed by letting them do that. When previously he locked all of the doors, but now he's letting them be used again? Idk. I know I'm thinking too much about it but dang, I didn't really enjoy the game or the controls, or the story. I only enjoyed the graphics, but so many games have good graphics it doesn't mean much.

De hecho, estaba bastante bien.\nY en el episodio de hoy de Manqueando... \"Death's Door\"\n\nDe \"p\u00e1rajos\" va la cosa. Encarnamos a un cuervo que tiene que recolectar un alma. Pero todo se complica y... hasta aqui puedo leer. No voy a spoilear nada, tan s\u00f3lo dir\u00e9 que la historia est\u00e1 bastante bien y que pese al aspecto del juego, no es para nada infantil. Eso es bien.\n\nPero... \u00bfque es esto? Pues un metroid con perspectiva isom\u00e9trica y gr\u00e1ficos simples pero muy vistosos. T\u00e9cnicamente bastante bien en todos sus aspectos. Ni bugs ni gaitas, que yo me haya encontrado al menos.\n\nLa jugabilidad... pues m\u00e1s o menos como en un Diablo, principalmente por la perspectiva, pero no tiene nada que ver con el mismo. Tenemos posibilidad de golpear, cargar ataque, usar habilidades secundarias, rodar para evitar da\u00f1o... ese tipo de cosas.\n\nLa dificultad es el punto m\u00e1s... llamativo. Es alta, pero b\u00e1sicamente porque no tenemos curaci\u00f3n. Y me explico...\n\nA lo largo del juego, iremos encontrando unas semillas que podremos plantar en unas macetas que tambien iremos encontrando. Si las plantamos, podremos usar las flores resultantes para curarnos 1 vez. Hay varias de estas por cada escenario, pero solo si plantamos semilla podremos usarlas. Algo que le da al tema un cierto toque estrat\u00e9gico, ya que nos obligar\u00e1 a elegir donde plantar dichas semillas. Se rellenan si regresamos al lugar tras haber ido a la \"oficina\".\n\nSin embargo, cuando lleguemos a un enfrentamiento con un boss, no tendremos curaci\u00f3n de ningun tipo, lo que har\u00e1 que durante ese tipo de enfrentamientos (o en salas cerradas con oleadas de enemigos), la dificultad se dispare un poco. Pero si yo he podido... \u00a1vosotros podeis!\n\nY bueno... no s\u00e9 que m\u00e1s puedo a\u00f1adir. Buen control, dificultad tirando a alta sobre todo en bosses, buena m\u00fasica y apartado t\u00e9cnico, unas 15/20h para pillarlo todo (13h me ha llevado sacar un 89%), asi que en general todo bastante bien.\n\nAh si... se me olvidaba. NO HAY MAPA. Eso es un kgad\u00f3n importante, sobretodo para el backtracking.\n\nPero pese a ello... lo recomiendo y le voy a cascar un pedazo de 8 como un sol.\n\nY en el pr\u00f3ximo episodio de Manqueando... no clue yet.

It has a nice and clean visual presentation, but the gameplay beneath holds no depth or engaging experiences. \n\nCombat is one note. You swing, you roll and have a projectile you need to charge and that's about it. It's very easy, but it is more a test of patience than anything. There's also a subset of attacks you can't even really react to, you just have to keep moving to dodge everything and poke enemies to whittle down their health.\n\nThere is an attempt at some combat variety. Different weapons, they all look different, which is nice. However their impact on game-play is almost unnoticeable. Some swing faster, a bit wider etc. All moving knobs of damage, speed etc. But in the end they all feel the same. You can also upgrade your character and these are similarly boring and barely noticeable. Move slightly faster, deal slightly more damage, swing slightly faster etc. What game really lacks is unique abilities, interesting weapons, or even enemies. A small nitpick, the presentation of the game is very smooth and clean. But the combat animations are woeful. There's almost zero attack animation, your weapon teleports back onto your character. It immediately stuck out like a sore thumb to me the very first time I swung my sword. This isn't earth shattering, but is an odd drop in quality compared to the rest of the games presentation.\n\nThe games main emphasis seems to be on its combat. There are some puzzles. However they are also very boring. Simple push the switch puzzles, light X torches etc. Utterly lacking in creativity or difficulty. \n\nThis game also has a lot of walking. I even tried to max upgrade my speed ASAP just to minimise this backtracking. It is hurt very much by the lack of a map. The lack of a map is not an inherently bad thing, however you need to make your areas distinctive. There's clearly been some attention to this and some areas are like this, but others aren't. It becomes more problematic in places such as the forest, where everything just feels like rock, grass and elevated terrain. I'd spend a lot of time just finding the next place to go.\n\nOne thing the game does have going for it, is its atmosphere. The game is very calming, music very mellow, very chill. With its mostly clean presentation, it certainly looks polished on the surface.\n\nI haven't beaten the game, so can't comment on the story in its totality. However, it doesn't seem to be anything special after completing the 2nd dungeon.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for something with interesting game play or puzzles, you won't find that here. If you don't care about the game play, and just want to listen to some mellow tunes in a well presented package, you may get something out of this (and maybe the story picks up?).", "timestamp_created": 1662218274, "timestamp_updated": 1662218274, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49151119589805603", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121678242": {"recommendationid": "121678242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930636366", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3150, "last_played": 1664093228}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1662213524, "timestamp_updated": 1662213524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121658726": {"recommendationid": "121658726", "author": {"steamid": "76561199138293892", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1056, "last_played": 1662616795}, "language": "english", "review": "This is such a cute game that deals with some heavy themes!

The game understands how to make its set pieces grand as well and the bosses are very fun to beat. After you beat the game there will be quite a bit of stuff to still do that does a good job making 100% this game quite a bit of fun. Some time ago I played and reviewed Titan Souls (Acid Nerve's other game) and complained about the constant down time after death to refight bosses that killed you, fortunately Death's Door does a great job, not just in companion with alleviating this issue, doing a great job reducing the down time that you might expedience.\n\nOverall a great game to try out, 100% completion time is about 12-15 hours with the main game seeming to be done in about 10ish. My only gripe is the lack of a way to re-fight bosses without starting a new game (something that is a bit more annoying as there are 2 achievements that are about doing something specific to specific bosses). These are not required to 100% the game, along with the beating the game with the worst weapon achievement but it still is a small annoyance. Especially as the bosses were fun to fight, and even without the boss specific achievements refighting some of them on my completed save would be fun.\n\nDespite all of that Death\u2019s Door is well worth the 20 USD price tag, and I would say even buying this at a low discount makes it a must buy, especially if the game seems interesting to you.", "timestamp_created": 1661641844, "timestamp_updated": 1661641844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121332165": {"recommendationid": "121332165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304710564", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2231, "last_played": 1661642325}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really good, one of the few games I have actually felt the unrelenting urge to complete 100%.

Gives me the old school lock & key vibe of 2D zelda's, but replaces puzzles with combat challenges and an even heavier reliance on exploration. The combat itself is, at times, a puzzle though. You're given a pretty solid move pool from the jump and the challenge comes with surviving these battles without the ability to heal during them. Very little room for error, but the penalty for failure wasn't steep. So it kept me coming back for more. By the end of the game, I was dancing around enemies. It was a good reward for mastering the movement and skills of my little crow friend.\n\nYou may wonder if being purely combat focused hurts the best part of zelda, the puzzles. I'd say no because the world is so rich with secrets and things to discover that it scratches the same itch. At least for me. There's no map in this game, like at all. I was originally weary about this discovery, but I started to be more observant. This game rewards you consistently for that, so I began to admire this choice. So yeah, expect to get lost at first. But it's part of the charm.\n\nAnd the charm is what hooked me. This is one of those lore-based games akin to games like Dark Souls or Hollow Knight, with much of world-building delivered from searching for it. Death's Door does have a more direct narrative however. It tells the story it wants to tell in a nice way, and while the themes of death lean toward the melancholy, It knows when to bring in the levity to avoid being a downer. Don't be fooled, this game has a sense of humor.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent too. I found myself humming the main theme a lot, as it's used throughout but changed to fit certain moments and fights. I'm not musically inclined, but the best way to describe it vibe-wise, is that it sounds sad but hopeful. Bittersweet? A good example is the music that plays when you defeat a major boss. The melody that plays, after you defeat them and a certain character says their piece about the fight, is beautiful. \n\nIf asked what I didn't like, I'd probably say it gets a little grindy at the end. I got \"100%\" completion before getting all the upgrades because enemies give very little of the game's currency. Thankfully you don't NEED to be maxed out stat-wise. Most of the improvements are so gradual, that you really don't notice them anyway. Plus, I think I liked the fact that I took on a lot of fights without full power because it made those fights even tougher. What happened a lot for me was defeating a boss with 1hp left and feeling like a goddamn survivor. \n\nAh well I just ended up praising it again. Listen, this game is dope.

I tend to dislike being able to see things that I cannot collect, where the only obstacle is something that can be removed without any real engagement by an upgrade. Also don't appreciate having multiple different upgrades necessary to collect all of the items from a previous area, since it encourages more backtracking than should be necessary. Ideally, such things should be relegated entirely to more oft-visited areas, such as the game's various hub areas. Also, they don't ever express that you have a ground pound, despite it being needed for secrets across the full expanse of the game, leading to you needing to needlessly backtrack even more.\n\nStill a little buggy, but nothing game-breaking.\n\nUltimately strongly recommended.
