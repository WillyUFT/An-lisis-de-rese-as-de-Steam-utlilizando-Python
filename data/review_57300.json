It's an incredibly limited game, but it spreads what few ideas it has frugally enough to trick you into thinking it's something it's not. See, Amnesia isn't a horror game - not really. \n\nIt's just Myst. Seriously, this game is way more of a first person puzzler that uses it's atmosphere and exploration to tell a creepy Halloween story than it is a proper horror game, but it drenches the puzzles in enough mystery, darkness, and gore to hide that unless you really pay attention. The atmosphere is so oppressive and horrifying that you forget that there's no real bite to anything happening, mechanically. There's only a handful of encounters with monsters in the game where you have to hide and navigate around them to complete puzzles. Most of the time, you're walking around completing puzzles free of any monsters at all, but the developers smartly implement just enough instances of monsters suddenly appearing or jumpscares to keep you on your toes. This may be a section with no monsters at all, and it may be a section where a Brute appears around a corner and makes your heart rate jump through the roof. You won't really know until you're done and out of the area. Most of the tension is complete smoke and mirrors, with no real threat present, and when threats do present themselves they're trivial to navigate around.\n\nAll of that may disappointing at first - and I at first did find it disappointing - but it greatly works in the game's favor. The game's combat mechanics are nonexistent and the stealth mechanics aren't meaty enough to carry the game on it's own, which means that if you had been stopped by monsters every few feet while trying to navigate any given area to complete a puzzle, it would quickly become more frustrating than scary (looking at you, Outlast). So Amnesia spreads it's monster encounters thinly and ensures player death is incredibly sparse to prevent the tension from dissipating, while keeping tension high with great sound design and sanity effects that are used just enough to remain interesting without becoming overly distracting. Amnesia then spots areas with enough lore tidbits to keep you invested in the story that, while simple, is sold incredibly well with surprisingly excellent voice acting and pacing. The final piece of the puzzle is the length - Amnesia, like most horror games, is very short, and honestly depending on how good your puzzle-solving chops are you could likely finish this in a single sitting. It ends right when it needs to, right when the boring running and hiding is really beginning to wear through the veneer the game presents. It knows when it's done everything it can with the limited set of mechanics present, and leaves you before it become tedious. \n\nIt's incredibly impressive, and while I may sound like I'm giving damnation by faint praise I genuinely mean it. Amnesia knows it's weaknesses present from it's core concept, and instead of trying to shore them up by adding what would've been limp-wristed, boring combat or exhausting the player with repetitive adrenaline pumping hide and seek sections (once again, looking at you, Outlast)  it instead narrows it's vision and delivers a tightly directed, incredibly focused experience. I would never call Amnesia one of my favorite horror games, but I respect the hell out of Frictional Games for their smart use of scorched earth game design here.

I am officially no longer a chicken!  :)\n\nOverall the mansion portion at the beginning and the (we'll call it a) church portion at the end were by far the best.  The Dungeon was stupid and had too many monsters in it.  The least scary thing to have happen to you in a horror game is to die.  You have to have the possibility of death (because of the lack of that, Layers of Fear wasn't scary at all), but the game also has to be easy enough that you basically never actually die (and fool you that it isn't).  Outside of the dungeon, I died, I think 1 time, that was perfect.  But in the dungeon I died enough times that I started to learn the nature of the monsters, the capabilities of their AI's, things of that sort, and it not only ruined that section with frustration, but made them less scary for the rest of the game.\n\nThe sewers were also not great, they felt like filler.  The morgue in the sewers was good, but why was a morgue in the sewers?  The rest of the game was great though!  I also like that in the end it makes you think more about the Amnesia \"universe\" and makes me want to explore it more in more games.\n\nOriginal review follows.\n\n##############\n\n\nI have been aware of Frictional Games since the first Penumbra Tech demo came out.  I've always been a big fan of adventure games.  They are probably the only kind of game I'm likely to play all the way to the end.  I love solving puzzles to advance a plot.  The plot makes you care about the puzzles and the puzzles keep the plot fun.  To me it's the perfect kind of game.  Well, a lot of sites that like adventure games really were interested this Penumbra Tech demo and the kind of physics based puzzles it made possible.  Aren't we all getting tired of combining items in our inventory?  I certainly was.  I missed the greater variety of puzzles text adventures had and was going back to those rather than play another identical half-finished game from Microids.  So, I was excited to try this Penumbra Tech demo, and I enjoyed.  When Penumbra Overture and Penumbra Black Plague came out, I enjoyed those too.\n\nAnd then Amnesia came out....  Now, I'm no adventure game purist, I'm okay with cross genre affairs.  I'll happily play an action-adventure Tomb Raider type game, or a puzzle platformer.  I was happy with the frights, here and there through the Penumbra games; the worm sections were by far the scariest parts and yet they felt so clever to me and will always be what I think of when I think of those games.  But Amnesia it is just barely relenting terror from the first scene.  Going to a new room is a loathsome task because you know it will be too dark to get your bearings and there is bound to be something in there with you.  Because of the premise revealed by the title, your goal is not something you feel particularly motivated to achieve.  If I were really in this situation, I would choose to leave by one of the windows and contact the police.  I certainly wouldn't be going below ground level where they might be no way back.  Not too long into the game, I said, why am I putting myself through this?  And I turned of the game and forgot about it.\n\nThen Soma came out and I was lured back to Frictional games by a sci fi plot and an underwater setting.  I suppose it was a horror game, it did have monster, but Soma's monsters weren't too scary, less scary than the Penumbra fauna, in my opinion.  I was able to finish that and enjoy the game despite them, in fact they probably livened things up a bit.  Then I didn't really think about Frictional games for a while.  Their next game was a sequel or a prequel to Amensia, I wasn't interested in that.  But then I got that prequel/sequel (companion) in a humble bundle.  It wasn't what I was going after in the bundle, so I left it be until right now this Halloween 2023.  I thought, I should play horror game since I'm still up and everyone else is in bed and I should celebrate the holiday.  I loaded up Amnesia: Rebirth.\n\nI loved it.  (At least what I've played so far)  I was far more invested in the main character and her story than I was with this gormless Daniel of the first Amnesia game.  And what was happening to the woman from Rebirth had surprising developments right from the first couple of scenes.  Plus, I enjoyed that it was more sci-fi than supernatural.  It didn't have much for puzzles in the part I was playing, and it was barely scary.  It felt more like a walking simulator, than an adventure or horror game, but that was fine.  I mean I've hated most walking simulators, but that's mostly because even a story is usually barely present.  Rebirth, as I say, had a fascinating story.  But as I decided I liked that game a feeling of cheating came over me.  I've never finished Amnesia, what do I think I'm doing playing this sequel?  I ruin all the surprises of the plot of the first one.  Already, I've discovered that apparently the mystery of Amnesia is going to be rooted in science fiction rather than fantasy....\n\nSo, I clicked exit game on Amnesia: Rebirth and downloaded Amnesia again.\n\nI just hate this game.  Oh my gosh.  Why would anyone choose to put themselves through this?  It's just what I said before.  It's just looking in dark rooms of difficult to determine size, while at any moment something awful might happen to you.  There are really puzzles.  It's more just searching searching searching for whatever might serve as a key to the next area, all while trying to conserve your lantern oil and match sticks.  Good grief.  I think I'm about half way through the game at this point.  I suppose it is related to Rebirth in that there is some backstory about an archaeological expedition that uncovered some orb that I suppose is related to the things the woman in Rebirth is finding in her caves,  but my goodness, these little drips of information come so sparingly.  What reward is there for pushing on?  You finish one murky area, running at the last minute from some unholy monstrosity and the next thing you have to do is head through the next door for more of the same.  (By which I don't mean the game is repetitive.  Maybe it is a little bit, in the broad strokes.  But it's generally been pretty creative with just what the horrible thing is.  What you do in the water area, for instance, is much different from you do in the prison)\n\nI don't know who this game is for.  It's not for me.  I want to be driven forward by satisfying my curiosity, not by, I suppose, proving I have a steel will.  To an extent, if I continue and finish the game, I suppose that curiosity will be what pushes me forward, but more for what it will reveal to me for when I return to Rebirth, than whatever I hope to find in this game.\n\nBut do I recommend it?  Well, if you know that this is a scary game and that is the whole point of it, and you think that sounds like a good time, then yes, I highly recommend it.  I don't think you could possibly do any better.  \n\nIf I can bring myself to play more of this game tomorrow, perhaps I will update this review.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son found this game at Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3", "timestamp_created": 1698735520, "timestamp_updated": 1698735520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455434173345565796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149231891": {"recommendationid": "149231891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041968420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1698649241}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like awful physics puzzles and enemies more annoying than scary?

Getting that out of the way first, the game is dark in terms of it's story & visuals.  The areas of the castle send a feeling of unease, even in the quieter 'safe rooms' that act as smaller hubs.  The sound design only amps this up, not just with little nuances like additional footsteps, but different noises for each area that fill a sense of dread turning the corner.  As for the story, the player fills the amnestic shoes of Daniel, a man heading into the castle with a self imposed task of killing the castle's baron, Alexander.  The rest is filled out through notes & memories to piece together the actual reasons for being there.  The gameplay itself gives no way to defend, other than hiding.  A sanity meter exists alongside health, with the game's enemies & events damaging & drawn to a lowered state of sanity, being able to regain it by staying in light.  This keeps the experience tense throughout, not knowing what will come in the next area.  The game also comes with a selection of short stories & a DLC chapter titled Justine, unrelated to the main story, but short enough to provide a fun little jaunt.\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] The game can be quite brutal in certain areas once monsters appear.  At times, it can be difficult to tell if Daniel is hidden well enough to be properly ignored by them.  The main hiccup the game has is the title's hard mode.  While in the main game constantly finding sources of light can be fairly trivial if one knows where to look, hard mode severely decreases the amount of ways to light one's path by lowering the available collectables, removes autosaves, & requires a stock of inventory items to save the game, alongside making it so the player dies if sanity decreases completely.  This turns the game into a stop & go experience that may require trips back & forth to safe zones just to regain sanity, dragging the pace of the game to a crawl.\n\n[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS[/u]:[/b] Though many are gotten just for clearing The Dark Descent & Justice, alongside their 3 endings each, a set are reserved for failing a task, & certain collectable hunts.  The notes must be collected in both titles, though the diary entries don't count for that total for some reason.  In addition, there are 151 tinderboxes in the main game that must be be collected in a playthrough for an achievement.  This can be tedious, as some of them are very well hidden.  Finally, the hard mode is a chore to complete, as stated above, & can actually be more difficult than hunting all the collectables due to requiring knowledge of collectable locations in the hopes they spawned, which very few do.  Lifting the lantern up & down is the best way to maintain sanity from the darkness, & this just adds to the tedium.\n\n[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a wonderful, unsettling, & terrifying horror title that may not have been the first of it's kind, but kickstarted an array of horror titles of a similar kind for years to come.  This is a tentpole game in the genre, & deserves to be played by anyone curious on it.

Name a survival horror game post 2010, they inspired themselves with it.\nI could point you to how much dreary detail and evils lurk beneath each note that so many left behind. If there's one thing you should take away from this, its this: Explore and be thorough. You will find more useful items and lore that is truly truly worth it.\nI could summarize a brilliant story that reveals to you, bit by bit, evil, guilt and maybe, just maybe, redemption. The most you can hope for is truly disturbing imagery and darkness, ever encroaching darkness. It seems like the worst part, but you will find it's something far scarier than an enemy.\nOr I could tell you to put on the lights if you fear getting through it for years, like I did. There's no shame in consuming guides if that's what it takes. Or having a friend guide you, like I did.\n\nWill it prepare you for Amnesia: The Dark Descent? Probably not.\nYou play as Daniel, a man we initially know precious little about, and not in a good way either. We are in a castle that would probably be cozy, if not of the atmosphere and sound around us. We soon find out Daniel fears the dark and there's something... more to this. We explore the hallways and rooms, finding notes to help us make sense of this world. Soon enough we find a note to self. It tells us that:\nWe chose to forget how we ended up here.\nWe must kill Alexander of Brennenburg\nA Shadow is chasing us, a living nightmare.\nWith that we begin our dark descent.\n\nThe gameplay unravels with ponderous but constant pace. You have your stats, inventory, health... and sanity. Pretty soon we are introduced to some of the strongest sides of the game: The light/dark interplay with sanity. You gain sanity by progressing in game. You lose it by witnessing disturbing events, staring at enemies and staying in the dark. You're told the lower the sanity, the harder it is to deal with enemies. That they'll be alerted if it drops to zero. Sanity alters your perception of reality as it drops: your vision gets blurry and distorted, portraits and other objects change form, hallucinations escalate, sometimes you even hallucinate enemies. On top of the excellently made atmosphere, it can make your play a living hell indeed.\n As you progress, if you are thorough, you find tinderboxes to light up torches and candles, and lamp oil for your mobile lantern. You will also find notes to further explain the setting. Much stress will result from the dilemma of preserving sanity or expending the lamp oil with your lantern and/or tinderboxes.\n\nThe game rewards those who dare to risk sanity-harming events. You'll find more useful items and be able to appreciate the story more. It is best played cautiously, fearfully, diligently. As you progress, the game will introduce enemies to you: First meekly and from far away, but don't let it deceive you: Half the horror in game comes from your inability to fight the enemies. You can only hide and wait till they leave. You have options: Will you lose sanity to hiding in the dark, turning your fear into your friend? Depending on situation, you'll be trying to hide in rooms, in the dark, be as far away as possible, or will have no choice but to run away in harrowing chase. An occasional puzzle will bring some variety. The game is divided into many levels. It starts linear, but then introduces hubs, from where batches of levels are available to be tackled in any order, barring prequisite items to unlock access. As you proceed towards your goal and explore, the veil of amnesia will slowly wear off. You'll slowly realize who Daniel is, what was he up to, and the motivations and artifacts of those around him. This game features some of the most depraved and inhuman characters around, and to your and Daniel's distress, their works will be expressed here. On your journey, the Shadow, manifested in fleshy residue, will continue to follow you, as if chasing you. Without spoiling too much, let me just say: It is not an enemy. It's something arguably worse.\n\nThe evils we witness, the atmosphere, the constant and heavy sense of dread, would not be possible without a stellar sound design. Mikko Tarmia has crafted the OST with loving care, and the sounds you hear all make the horror of it all possible. The events we witness (from mere gust of wind to The Shadow going ham somewhere), the hallucinations of Daniel (there's gonna be plenty of that), even psychic attacks: The game revels in trolling you and teasing you with threat of danger, making you scare yourself, especially when it'd only make things worse. Yet much like the darkness, sound design will be your asset. The enemies are loud, and sound will be your main way to locate them.\n\nThe presentation is clearly from early 2010s, with pitiful but servicable textures for these days, and lighting from that era as well. It has its charm and will not stand in the way of you being engaged.\nYou will witness damp rusty sewers, castle hallways, storage areas, all in the usual rustic castle style. But as you progress, you witness spaces that are either beautiful, claustrophobic and disturbing, or otherworldly in its presentation. Machinery fitting 19th century will often be seen, and be object of progression or puzzles.\n\nThis is the game where danger lurks when you don't know what you're doing, but this fear can be overcome. As you go, you will start to know what you're doing, and how to handle encounters. You will harden, but the depravity of what you witness will only escalate. In the end, you will truly have made your dark descent, into what defined Daniel's misery. Will you turn your thoughts to vengeance? Or something more?\n\nA maddening, but ultimately sublime experience. Face a game that made history of the genre. Unveil guilt and hearken for redemption as your sins pile up. Know no defence against the enemy, and be pawn of powers beyond humanity. Relive nightmares. Become afraid of the dark in your own home. Become a lamb for futile sacrifice. Help someone and maybe be helped. Settle a debt and conquer your fears. All this and more in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\nA few tips:\n-I feared wasting tinderboxes and lamp oil more than any monster and got my ending with 10 lamp oils and about 30 tinders. Such supply is a peace of mind more than anything.\n-Be aware of places to hide in case encounter happens. They're scripted. \n-Play with your headphones, or whatever will easily indicate direction of sounds.

I only found a letter stating this... [/h1]\n\nToday, at almost 30 years old, I finished Amnesia: The Dark Descent for the first time. It all started in 2011, when we gathered our friends to play together, and I heard about this game for the first time. We loved to unite the guys together to play, especially horror games and we had heard that nothing beat this one. We were just teenagers, and we'd played some very scary games, but this one was so surprisingly strong, no one could even bear to watch directly, I was the only one who dares to play alone. With the little courage we had at the time, we only went to the Wine Cellar part, from there we alternated between the menu, desperately quitting the game, opening it again and the cycle repeating itself.\n\nI decided to pick up the game again 12 years later. The reasons were curiosity (if the game is still as terrifying as it was at the time), fascination with the story (even though I know little), and also because of this remarkable experience of mine as a teenager. After finishing the game, 12 years later, I share here the following updated findings with great sincerity and impartiality. First, we start with the [b] GRAPHICS [/b]. The game is a little dated, and for that I implemented a remaster made by a fan, which is widely used and known by the community, which gave the game an excellent upgrade compared to the original. Without a doubt, it doesn't compare to today's graphics and mechanics, but nothing that hinders your experience. The game is perfectly playable nowadays, not to mention that the lack of light in the game helps and alleviates a lot in terms of level of details, especially those with greater distance.\n\nNow the second factor, [b] ATMOSPHERE [/b]. I don't think any other horror game I've played until this day compares to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Perhaps Resident Evil (the 1st Remake) and Silent Hill 2 are the closest, but it really involves another complexity. The game is too dark. It has extremely uncomfortable ambient sounds, such as screams of torture, children's cries, creaking wood, footsteps and agonizing moans. Something truly diabolical. Resources, especially oil, are scarce in the game, and must be used in moderation, which induces the player to perform actions with a certain anxiety and accelerated pace, making you \u201cthrow yourself\u201d into the unknown and macabre environments of the scenario without know what awaits you. Finally, something that doesn't get talked about much and deserves real applause and recognition. The soundtrack... the game's soundtrack/sound effects are simply FANTASTIC. They fit perfectly with each segment of the game. Moments of hope, terrifying moments, characters, environment, chase, complete mastery.\n\nThird factor, atmosphere. I don't think any oth... oops... I just remembered, that was already written... now is the part where we will deal with the [b] ENEMIES [/b] of the game. The monsters.... ahhhh the monsters... how to define them? They are horrible, grotesque, with bizarre movements and soul-shuddering sounds. Add this to the darkness and the environment around you and the impact is powerful. To this day, I believe that no other creature has ever given me such chills. Furthermore, they do not appear so frequently, a factor that means that the quality of construction of moments is prioritized, causing greater apprehension and anxiety. This entire set makes each encounter desperate, unpredictable and remarkable. As you progress through the game, you will better understand how the mechanics and stealth through monsters work, reducing the tension level a little and increasing your confidence and courage.\n\nFourth and penultimate factor, [b] ENVIRONMENT/SETTING [/b]. Here, in my opinion, is where the game's creators rocks. The game takes place in 1839, in Brennenburg Castle, Prussia. This era has a lot of historical inspiration from the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment. The level of creativity and intelligence to set a horror game in an ancient era with historical involvement is brilliant! An extremely rich idea, opening up a river of possibilities and elements that were masterfully introduced into the game. A dark and gigantic castle, lamps, candles, books, potions, tonics, paintings, chains, barrels, everything perfectly placed. Imagine a time when science was moving in short steps... everything was uncertain, mysterious. Science or Witchcraft? Alchemy or Magic? All concepts were hypothetical, undefined. All this air of mysticism can be defined as a touch of elegance introduced to the game. All historical elements and settings are the foundation, the soul of the game that encapsulates all the previously mentioned terror and atmosphere.\n\nFinally, [b] STORY/CHARACTERS [/b]. I can't believe I've come this far..., but I must continue with courage and determination to finish my review. The game takes place only in the castle, but the story begins long ago before the game. Thanks to the amnesia, the game captivates us to look for all the pieces of the puzzle with determination and enthusiasm. Why we woke up like this, why we have to kill the castle baron, why horrible things happened, and so on. As you progress through the game, things start to become clearer and all your questions are gradually answered. The fact that we continue even when we shouldn't, directly concerns the mold and personality of the character Daniel, who you controls.\n\nDaniel is a fantastic character, who needs to go on a true hero's journey. Loaded with guilt and remorse, but with convictions and steely courage to determinedly achieve redemption and the incessant search for good at all costs. Antagonist or Protagonist? Villain or Hero? I don't remember anymore... it's up to you... just like... Alexander, the game's other notable character. Alexander is the stereotypical powerful and wise man. As Daniel himself mentions: \u2018\u2019A Renaissance man, like Da Vinci\u2019\u2019. Alexander is the man who sets out to help Daniel with his curse, offering his knowledge and technological advances in exchange for his service. But why then should we kill him? Should we kill the only man who offered us help? You will have to unravel these questions on your own... So I wish you good luck on your journey to discover the truth.\n\n[h1] FINAL VERDICT[/h1] What to say about Amnesia The Dark Descent then? A good, short and simple horror game? No! A LEGENDARY horror game! responsible for catapulting the careers of many famous YouTubers in the past, and who should pay their respects. A game with a thrilling story, captivating characters, iconic enemies, remarkable moments of terror and emotion, and everything can be proven by the testimony above. For me, it's the most iconic horror game in gaming history. If not, it is undoubtedly on the same shelf as Resident Evil and Silent Hill 2. My passion aside, it has been and continues to be chosen, by the general public and critics, as one of the best horror games in the gaming history and also the scariest game ever made. A good horror game gives you scares and fear, but a legendary horror game gives you an unforgettable, exciting and perpetual experience!\n\n[b] Final tips [/b] to have the best (worst) experience possible in the game:\n[b] (Don\u2019t) Play with the volume at maximum.

one of the scariest games back then for its atmosphere, use of the different light sources, story, mysteries and enemies.\nWhile this game hasn't age too well in terms of visuals, for its time it was very good.\n\nWhat truly makes this game so great is the different items that you get through the game, such as tinderboxes or oil, and you have them in your inventory, where you can also check your notes, health and sanity.\nThese make the game feel more alive, with sanity being an extra to make the game a bit more difficult if you experience some bizarre events, like doors opening by themselves or just by looking at enemies.\nI wish there were the shortcut keys from Penumbra, but that's just a minor nitpick or missopportunity they could have added.\n\nThe game also plays very well with the sounds and the flashbacks from Daniel.\nI also have to mention how you need to explore every room completely to find tools to progress through the game, and how sometimes you also need to backtrack a little bit.\nThere are also some pretty decent puzzles for some variety.\n\nThe monsters are very cool and spooky too and definitely one of the highlights from this game, while they can be buggy at times and maybe they are not as interesting as the ones from Penumbra, they feel accurate to how the game was made and its story.\n\nAnd speaking of stories, this game has custom stories that people can make on their own!\nI am surprised this game even had that for a game that was released in 2010, with a fairly easy to use level editor that is super intuitive.\nLots of custom stories are memorable such as House of Creep or The Great Work, or even some troll custom stories.\nIt was such an amazing idea that made a very dedicated community.\n\nThis game also has a DLC where you play as Justine, is more of a kind of \"love\" story with a new monster representing 3 people.\nIt was kind of decent, this game didn't need a DLC but it is cool that it has one!\nIt also has a short story called: Remember, which is a nice little extra that the game did not need...\nBut it's here!\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a timeless scary horror game masterpiece that still is very good today.\nIt has been one of the most memorable horror games in history, and the community around it it's awesome for more content.\nI would say this game is even replayable!\nI was spooked, had fun with it and there are lots of work and dedication put into this game.\n(If only the sequel was as good.)\n\nAbsolutely recommended.\nOne of my favourite games in history and definitely a must-have.\n9.4/10",

Mi experiencia con este juego ha sido una monta\u00f1a rusa de emociones, y estoy encantado de compartir mis pensamientos sobre esta experiencia de juego inolvidable.\n\nLo que me ha gustado:\n\nAtm\u00f3sfera Angustiante: Desde el momento en que comienzas, Amnesia: The Dark Descent te sumerge en un mundo de oscuridad y misterio. Los efectos de sonido inquietantes y la iluminaci\u00f3n tenue crean una atm\u00f3sfera de tensi\u00f3n constante que te hace sentir constantemente vigilado.\n\nNarrativa Profunda: La historia es el coraz\u00f3n de este juego. A medida que exploras el oscuro castillo y descubres los oscuros secretos de tu pasado, te ves envuelto en una trama intrigante que te atrapa y no te suelta hasta el final. Los detalles y las pistas est\u00e1n magistralmente tejidos en la trama, fomentando la curiosidad del jugador.\n\nDise\u00f1o de Puzzles Creativos: Los rompecabezas en el juego son desafiantes pero l\u00f3gicos. Requieren observaci\u00f3n y reflexi\u00f3n, lo que a\u00f1ade una capa adicional de inmersi\u00f3n al juego. Resolver estos enigmas es una satisfacci\u00f3n que te impulsa a seguir adelante en la historia.\n\nInteligente Sistema de Miedo: Amnesia: The Dark Descent se destaca por su sistema de miedo. No se trata solo de enfrentarte a monstruos, sino de lidiar con tu propia cordura. La falta de luz y la exposici\u00f3n prolongada a los horrores del juego afectan tu salud mental, creando una experiencia de juego \u00fanica y aterradora.\n\nLo que no me ha gustado:\n\nEn mi experiencia, Amnesia: The Dark Descent es un juego casi impecable. Sin embargo, algunos jugadores pueden encontrar el nivel de dificultad de los rompecabezas un poco alto, lo que puede ser frustrante para aquellos que prefieren una experiencia de juego m\u00e1s relajada.\n\nRecomendaci\u00f3n:\n\nRecomendar\u00eda Amnesia: The Dark Descent sin reservas a cualquier persona que busque una experiencia de terror genuina y una narrativa inmersiva. Este juego va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de simplemente asustarte: te sumerge en un mundo de pesadillas del cual es dif\u00edcil escapar.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, te sugiero encarecidamente que explores la experiencia del juego a trav\u00e9s de la lista de reproducci\u00f3n que has compartido ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBN6SRRGWrU&list=PLYrEreXttgr4PqRoUf7pSe-R6Pb3T-ARX ). Amnesia: The Dark Descent es m\u00e1s que un juego de terror; es una historia cautivadora que merece ser apreciada en su totalidad. Prestar atenci\u00f3n a los detalles y seguir la historia a trav\u00e9s de la perspectiva del creador puede ofrecer una comprensi\u00f3n m\u00e1s profunda y enriquecer tu experiencia.\n\nEn resumen, Amnesia: The Dark Descent es una obra maestra del g\u00e9nero del survival horror.

But the game is actually well paced, the zones are pretty brief, and there aren't even that many monsters in the game. What I did find weird, was that there are a few \"physics\" based puzzles where the solution is to throw an object at another object, or stand on a box so you can reach something.

Stack an interesting story on top of that and what you've got is a solid horror experience that sits up there with the best in the genre. [/h1]\n\n[b] Actual Review (Censored Spoilers): [/b] The fact that i'm over 10 years late to playing this game had no effect on the experience whatsoever. TDD is one of those rare indie horror games that actually has gameplay and isn't just walking through environments waiting for jumpscares to happen. Going in completely blind is the optimal way to experience the game, As your first playthrough is by far where the most enjoyment and terror will be found. There is some decent replayability if you want to dive deeper into the story and understand everything, however there isn't nearly as much excitement when you know where things happen and how there play out.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by just how interesting the story was, and it mainly being told by the environment and flashbacks was a good choice as opposed to cutscenes and the like. It starts out unassuming and slowly builds as you uncover the truth. [spoiler] There are a few issues with it however, such as Agrippa being such a late character to introduce for how important he is to the story, and because of that the game doesn't feel like it fully took advantage of him story-wise. [/spoiler]\n\nThe gameplay itself boils down to exploration, avoiding enemies, and resource management. Something that most of the later games are sorely lacking in. The various puzzles are pretty intuitive and there is ample breathing room in between the harder areas, which gives the game a nice ebb and flow type of feeling. Running into enemies is almost always instantly panic inducing, and the whole game revolves around you being constantly on edge wondering when one will show up. [spoiler] This is one of the reasons why the first playthrough is leagues better than returning ones. The fact that enemies have set spawn locations severely dampens the horror experience if you know that they don't appear randomly. However it does mean that cleaning up the back half of the achievements is less annoying, and also makes speedrunning this game consistent if you're wanting to get into that. [/spoiler]\n\nThe steam version also comes with the DLC expansion Justine. It's a short puzzle focused campaign that also has it's own set of achievements. The puzzles are definitely better than the ones found in the main campaign and really make you think outside of the box that the base game put you in.\n\nFinally, most of the achievements are story-related but a decent portion of them are ones you'll have to hunt on your own. There are two slightly annoying collectathon achievements but doing them on your second playthrough makes it more fun. The hard mode achievement also isn't too bad, you just have to know what you're doing. The Justine achievements can all be farmed up in under an hour as well.\n\nIf you're thinking of playing this game I hope you've been able to avoid spoilers! They really soil the experience but that's kinda just how the horror genre works in general. Blindly jumping in is the best way to play. Turn down the lights, save the achievement hunting til your second playthrough (if you're into that kind of thing) and crank up the volume. It's a pants-sh!ttingly good time. 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1697333373, "timestamp_updated": 1698053611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

I don't often enjoy horror games that omit combat as I find them too lacking in real substance as I just feel so limited. This game is one of those horror games, and the game play is as simple as can be. Minimal resource management, you have health items, tinder boxes to light a few light sources here and there, and oil to fuel your hand lantern. All other items you find will be key items for solving puzzles to progress. You'd think this means I wouldn't enjoy this game but I was pleasantly surprised!\nThe game's sanity mechanic requires you to avoid dark corners as being in the dark will decrease your sanity.\nLow sanity causes your character to hear noises, hallucinate bugs in their vision, and even make them harder to control. Being in lit areas helps you avoid this BUT makes it easier for monsters to spot you. This creates a simple but effective risk reward system where you sacrifice sanity by hiding in dark corners to avoid monsters.\nThe puzzles are serviceable albeit a bit cryptic at times when requiring to combine items you wouldn't really think to combine. The monsters are bit uninspired design wise for me, they look kinda silly but the feeling of being chased was still tense and put a chill up my spine as I imagined the things chasing me! \nThe story is told in a very fragmented manner and you will probably need to look up online to really grasp it all. But this feels intentional as the devs making it clear it is more about wandering and feeling the atmosphere which I think they succeed. The game captures the feeling of being a nightmare, dropping you into a moment that you feel scared and alone and you have no idea how you got there. \nMy only note is the sanity mechanic could have more effects to feel more risky. Like when I was at low sanity, I really didn't feel like it was making the game harder or putting me in more danger. \nI'm looking forward to checking out the rest of the franchise!", "timestamp_created": 1696999656, "timestamp_updated": 1696999656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147999339": {"recommendationid": "147999339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022492318", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1696976945}, "language": "english", "review": "great game very scary", "timestamp_created": 1696977048, "timestamp_updated": 1696977048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147978455": {"recommendationid": "147978455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055723203", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1152, "last_played": 1696889957}, "language": "english", "review": "Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an absolute masterpiece in the world of horror gaming. From the moment I started playing, I was completely engrossed in its eerie atmosphere and gripping storyline. This game is a true gem that stands out in the horror genre for several reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, the atmosphere in Amnesia is absolutely top-notch. The developers have done an exceptional job creating a sense of dread and unease that never lets up. The dimly lit corridors, haunting sound effects, and unsettling visuals make for an incredibly immersive experience. It's the kind of game that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and I found myself often holding my breath as I cautiously explored the mysterious castle.\n\nThe storytelling in Amnesia is equally impressive. The game slowly unravels its narrative, leaving players with a constant sense of curiosity and intrigue. The protagonist's amnesia adds an extra layer of mystery, making you eager to piece together the puzzle of what's happening. The notes and diaries you find throughout the game provide a rich backstory, and the voice acting is superb, further enhancing the immersion.\n\nOne of the standout features of Amnesia is its unique approach to horror. Rather than relying on cheap jump scares, the game focuses on psychological horror. It preys on your fears and messes with your mind, creating an intense feeling of vulnerability. The absence of weapons also adds to the tension, forcing you to rely on your wits and stealth to survive. This makes for a genuinely spine-tingling experience that's unlike anything else I've played.\n\nThe puzzles in Amnesia are challenging but never feel unfair. They require careful observation and critical thinking, adding an intellectual layer to the horror experience. Solving them is incredibly satisfying and gives a sense of accomplishment that complements the fear-inducing elements of the game.\n\nIn summary, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a must-play for any fan of horror games. It excels in creating a truly terrifying atmosphere, telling a compelling story, and providing gameplay that keeps you engaged from start to finish. It's a game that will haunt your thoughts long after you've turned off your computer, and that's a testament to its excellence in the genre.

This first-person horror adventure, from the creators of the Penumbra trilogy, immerses players in a Lovecraftian nightmare, leaving them stranded alone in the dark depths of a haunted castle filled with lurking terrors. In many ways, Amnesia surpasses its legendary predecessor, eschewing cheesy action sequences for a relentless, spine-tingling experience.\n\nYou step into the shoes of Daniel, who wakes up in the ominous halls of Brennenburg Castle with a severe case of amnesia. The game initially evokes a Memento-like vibe as Daniel attempts to piece together his past through notes, diary entries, and sudden flashbacks. While the amnesia trope might be clich\u00e9d, Frictional Games weaves it into the narrative with remarkable finesse. The story unfolds in intriguing morsels scattered throughout the game, beckoning you into a chilling castle inhabited by a protagonist teetering on the brink of madness, hunted by enigmatic horrors. From the outset, you sense you're being inexorably drawn toward a revelation that promises anything but a happy ending. Yet, you can't help but yearn to uncover the truth.\n\nThe storytelling and overall structure are exceptionally executed. Amnesia is a true horror game where peril is immediate. Daniel, bereft of weapons or supernatural powers, faces relentless danger from the outset. Confrontation is not an option; you must evade the nightmarish entities lurking in the castle's shadows. Direct confrontation leads either to insanity or a gruesome demise. But hiding in the shadows is no refuge either, for Daniel is so deeply unhinged that darkness itself terrifies him. Thus, you face a grim choice: linger in the pools of light, risking encounters with eldritch horrors, or venture into the darkness, inviting a one-way ticket to the asylum. Resources like tinderboxes and lamp oil, which illuminate your path, are scarce, prompting you to scurry between the scarce islands of light in this abyss.\n\nAmnesia orchestrates an atmosphere of constant unease. You'll find yourself darting through rooms, avoiding foes that may not even be there. The formidable adversaries are both rare and lethal, serving as occasional threats rather than relentless pursuers, preserving the game's focus on tension and dread over action-packed chases. The eerie castle rooms are masterfully designed, replete with decaying walls, rain-sodden holes in the ceiling, and solitary candles flickering in dimly lit cellars. The creeping sense of dread follows you like a shadow, enhancing the anticipation of impending horrors. The descent into madness is visualized through distorted colors, disorienting camera angles, and unsettling visual glitches. You're left perpetually uncertain about reality.\n\nSound design plays a pivotal role in amplifying the tension. Daniel's mutterings reflect his deteriorating sanity, rain pours outside, footsteps echo mysteriously, and sudden gusts of wind extinguish candles. Unexplained voices cry for help. The environment consistently conspires to unnerve you.\n\nHowever, Amnesia primarily offers an eerie experience rather than a grueling challenge. Although it excels in crafting an unsettling atmosphere and dousing players in dread through the \"fear of the dark\" mechanic, most of its puzzles are fairly straightforward. These puzzles involve key hunting, object manipulation, evading perilous jumps, pulling levers, and more. You may seldom find yourself stumped, as long as you remain observant and can navigate the labyrinthine castle layout. The puzzles, while not particularly difficult, feel integral to the narrative rather than contrived obstacles. Solving them leaves you with a sense of accomplishment.\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a haunting masterpiece in the horror gaming genre. Although its duration might be relatively short, around six hours of gameplay, the game's price tag of $20 as an online download compensates for its brevity.

With its immersive storytelling, spine-tingling atmosphere, and innovative gameplay, it quickly became a benchmark for horror games. In this review, we'll delve into the chilling depths of this game to uncover what makes it a timeless classic in the world of gaming.\n\nStoryline:\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent plunges players into the shoes of Daniel, a man who awakens in a gloomy, foreboding castle with no memory of his past. As he explores the eerie corridors and chambers, he uncovers a sinister history involving dark rituals, unspeakable horrors, and his own complicity in a series of gruesome events. The game's narrative is delivered through haunting notes, diary entries, and disturbing encounters, creating an immersive and deeply unsettling experience.\n\nAtmosphere and Immersion:\nThe game's greatest triumph is its ability to immerse players in its nightmarish world. The atmosphere is oppressive, with dimly lit hallways, creaking floors, and an omnipresent sense of dread. The sound design is exceptional, with haunting whispers, distant cries, and unsettling noises that keep you constantly on edge. The game's use of lighting and shadows adds to the sense of vulnerability, making you feel like you're truly in a place where every corner could conceal a lurking horror.\n\nGameplay and Puzzles:\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a survival horror game with a unique twist\u2014it emphasizes stealth and evasion over combat. You are unarmed and defenseless against the grotesque monstrosities that roam the castle, which intensifies the fear factor. Instead of battling enemies, you must hide from them, adding an extra layer of tension to the gameplay.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are cleverly designed, seamlessly integrated into the narrative, and often require players to think critically and creatively. They range from deciphering cryptic messages to manipulating the environment to progress, enhancing the sense of immersion and challenge.\n\nHorror Elements:\nThe horror in Amnesia is psychological, relying on fear of the unknown, a sense of helplessness, and the dread of what might be lurking around the next corner. The game's monsters are grotesque and terrifying, and encountering them is genuinely panic-inducing. Your sanity is a tangible gameplay mechanic, as staying in darkness for too long or witnessing horrific events causes Daniel to descend into madness, blurring the line between reality and delusion.\n\nReplayability:\nWhile Amnesia: The Dark Descent's main story may take around 8-10 hours to complete, its replayability comes from the different choices players can make throughout the game and its numerous hidden secrets and Easter eggs. Additionally, the modding community has created a wealth of custom stories and content, extending the game's longevity.\n\nConclusion:\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a genre-defining horror game that remains a masterpiece in the medium. Its commitment to psychological horror, outstanding storytelling, and unrelenting atmosphere create an experience that will haunt players long after they've turned off their computers. If you're a fan of horror games and haven't experienced this classic, prepare yourself for a descent into madness that you won't soon forget.", "timestamp_created": 1696385269, "timestamp_updated": 1696385269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147570402": {"recommendationid": "147570402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427436196", "num_games_owned": 632, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1646104326}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is scary and completely holds up years after its release.

Not to mention it's not worth the time analysing as I'm mostly focusing on my surroundings.\n\nThe scariest thing about this game is the castle/environment itself. The random events happening throughout make you expect there to be a monster around the corner but nope, it just happens to keep you on your edge, which is nice. They did a really good job at making this feel creepy, where every undiscovered room just begins to give me anxiety the moment I enter. The monsters are okay, however they aren't too unsettling because of how easy they are to avoid.\n\nNot really a fan of the puzzles. Most of them feel straight up impossible to complete without a guide. Objects aren't visible enough for me because 90% of the puzzles will be in dark areas.

For me this was my first playthrough and every counter, despite most of them being scripted monster encounters, did make me feel really terrified. Had my first \"NOPE\" moment in the Northern Prison after accidently turning the right corner instead of walking into the kitchen area.. \n\nThe Choir was the most tense experience ever, I had to follow a walkthrough since I was just too scared to walk around the dim hallway all on my own and at late evening at that. The sound of Brute growling in headphones and my imagination was already scary enough..\n\nThe Gatherers (aka servant grunts) are pretty stupid and they don't give too much effort to chase you, especially if you are being careful enough to hide behind a corner, any corner, and put away your lantern for a while. My best advice whether you are facing a Grunt or a Brute would be to wait for their hunting music to slowly go away because that would signal that the coast is clear and you can step forward.\n\nThe game is difficult but just like Visage, it's not \"unfair\" if you get killed by a monster numerous times they wiill spawn less. If you die it is possible for you to spawn close to the exit, that's what happened to me in the Storage room. I happened to respawn at the exact location when I died and only one grunts was chasing me for 5 seconds, I could almost literally see both the Grunt and the exit door right in front of me lol. Some players have trolled the monsters and it is possible to glitch them to get stuck on one place or make them fall down into an endless pit to get rid off them if you really have high skill, I don't but I have seen other people do it on YouTube\n\nAs for the story, well no spoilers but the game is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of gore, both audible and visual. You will be exposed to torture devices, disturbing noises and a whole lot of corpses, blood and dismembered body parts. If you are sensitive to all that kind of stuff I would suggest maybe not play this game.. but if that is no issue for you by all means, play it. It's a really good game and getting revenge on Alexander is actually both quite funny and satisfying. \n\nGeneral advice for beginners, you only have a very limited amount of oil in your lantern as well as tinderboxes so you'd need to preserve those items and use them sparingly. Don't stand around in the darkness for too long and move along quickly to avoid sanity drain. If you feel too scared just allow yourself to be killed by the enemy, not sure how it is like in the Choir but they generally spawn less when you get killed multiple times by them. Enemies can see you in the light so it is best to use every light source you have with extreme caution. \n\nBe patient with yourself and the game, take regular breaks from the game if being chased has caused you a big amount of stress, that is okay. The game auto-saves but you can also choose to save manually and just press continue to resume your adventure from where you left off during your last save. There are around 4-5 safe hubs where there are no enemy encounters so there are breaks in-between to allow you to catch some breath before putting you through another terrifying experience. The game has 4 endings and yeah, I think this is enough I can say right now to keep it spoilerfree\n\nGood luck if you choose to play the game and remember, patience is the key to making progress!", "timestamp_created": 1694121929, "timestamp_updated": 1694122210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145872507": {"recommendationid": "145872507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845978605", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1698782273}, "language": "english", "review": "Frictional Games is quickly becoming one of my favorite developers.

La experiencia no es la misma si jugas sin haber leido el cuento mencionado, pero aun asi es un juego de terror excelente. Hay que considerar que la obra se hizo en una epoca en la que el terror en primera persona no era un genero popular y los juegos de terror en primera persona de la epoca no tenian la calidad que amnesia para nada. Ademas, amnesia establecio varios cliches que se repetiran en casi todos los juegos de terror en primera persona, incluyendo outlast, como esconderse en un lugar cerrado con un poco de vision, la vision que se aclara automaticamente levemente para dar la ilusion de oscuridad de lejos, la fuente de luz limitada, los puzzles. Hoy en dia si sos un jugador experimentado en juegos de terror en primera persona, pero no jugaste amnesia, todas estas mecanicas te sonaran ya muy viejas y clasicas, pues amnesia creo yo que es quien las establecio en su salida con su moda. La musica no resalta pero no creo recordar que sea mala, tampoco los sonidos, de hecho algo muy caracteristico del juego y que hara que sea de terror en serio es el sonido que suena cuando un enemigo te esta persiguiendo. El apartado visual es un poco viejo al dia de hoy, pero con un poco de concentracion el juego si logra dar miedo y ambientar. En cuanto al lore, es uno muy similar al texto anteriormente mencionado, mas que similar me atrevo a decir que es una reinterpretacion no dicha, cosa que es un poco confuso y extra\u00f1o, sobretodo porque el impacto que busca dar el texto, en el juego a traves del lore no se logra, siendo unicamente los enemigos los interesantes en el juego, el lore no logra dar ningun miedo, por el contrario es facil no entenderlo. Esto lo considero un fallo, ya que podrian haberle hecho otra historia igual de buena pero que no sea justamente ese cuento de Lovecraft y de esa forma evitarian la comparacion, pero ellos se lo buscaron haciendolo tan obvio, si lo leiste sabras que es igual al amnesia. Aun asi el juego es excelente y logra dar miedo a cualquier adulto, estando este en el top 3 indiscutiblemente, juegazo.", "timestamp_created": 1693813557, "timestamp_updated": 1693813557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145636177": {"recommendationid": "145636177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010273875", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 740, "last_played": 1693806104}, "language": "english", "review": "more cuprite", "timestamp_created": 1693804494, "timestamp_updated": 1693804494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145632177": {"recommendationid": "145632177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192055815", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1693796616}, "language": "english", "review": "thanks i hate it, but also, a strong and immersive horror experience guaranteed to give chills for thrills. excellent sound design, chilling visuals, and an immensely unsettling environment make for the ideal horror gaming endeavor. it made me spoop my pants (i yelled a lot at very abrupt times).", "timestamp_created": 1693796926, "timestamp_updated": 1693796926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145625135": {"recommendationid": "145625135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101362408", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1539891317}, "language": "english", "review": "first monster ever who can fully fit my big manhood in it's mouth, good experience, i recommend", "timestamp_created": 1693784846, "timestamp_updated": 1693784846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145594797": {"recommendationid": "145594797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027328204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3278, "last_played": 1693749500}, "language": "english", "review": "Even all these years later, still a fine game.

The sounds that plays when a monster has spotted you and is chasing you is also really off-putting, but it does its job of getting your adrenaline pumping.  The sanity mechanic is very interesting, but I found that if you got stuck on a puzzle for a while you'd just kinda lose it all which is a bit frustrating.  The areas towards the end of the game are also not my favorite, I found the mid-game areas a lot more scary and interesting to go through.

No matter how many times I return to Brennenburg Castle, I am always genuinely delighted by such a turn of events.\n\nThe player has the opportunity to be part of the story of a young archaeologist by the name of Daniel. During an excavation, his team discovered a mysterious artefact in the shape of an orb. Suddenly, the site collapsed and Daniel found himself buried alive under the rubble. In his delirium, he started to see strange visions, and when he regained his senses, he noticed that the sphere had been split and its pieces had not fit together. Daniel miraculously managed to escape, only to find that something else appeared in his life and threatened to destroy him. The protagonist was then plagued by bad dreams and haunted by eerie images. His mind began to deteriorate, and numerous friends and doctors who tried to help him eventually perished under mysterious circumstances. He realised that it was the strange orb that was responsible, but he had no idea how to get rid of the curse that was haunting him. Desperate to find answers to his questions, Daniel sent letters to various scientific societies and to the friends of his professor acquaintance. Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful, and only after some time did he receive a reply from a certain Alexander, who said something along the lines of \"I know everything, come to me\". Upon further investigation, Daniel found out that this Alexander was of noble blood and was a resident of his own castle, Brennenburg, in Prussia. With no other options open to him, the protagonist immediately set off for the damp and foggy country to meet his new and mysterious patron.\n\nThis game once won me over with its narrative style. We are thrown into the thick of things without much preamble: we are in a huge castle and remember nothing, it is raining outside the window and a cold wind blows through the ornate corridors. Our uncertain footsteps echo around the room and we feel completely alone. Inevitably, Daniel will come into contact with the inhabitants. Their motives are not entirely benevolent.\n\nThe story is told in flashbacks. Despite this jerky form of narration, the plot is perceived as a whole, and at the end we have a complete assembled picture. Furthermore, in Amnesia, I experienced for the first time the mechanics of a panic attack in the protagonist, when he is in the dark for a long time and needs to be near a light source for a while to reclaim his sanity. As the light would have made us easy prey for the so-called Gatherers, it was a lot of tension for me every time I had to hide in the dark, but it was fun to stare at candles to regain my sanity.\n\nDespite the game's clever combination of light and dark sections and unusual mechanics, the intelligence of the enemies here is not particularly sophisticated, and they quickly lose sight of the player. The game has a large number of scripted chases, so one will not be able to avoid monster encounters entirely. The music that accompanies the chases, on the other hand, will have you cowering in your chair in fear.\n\nThe game certainly has a nice dark level design and a marvellous ambience. The dimmed lights and monsters prowling around in the dark create an outstanding atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Even though I have completed Amnesia several times, I still fall for this trick every time.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that there is a hard mode in which autosaves are completely disabled, monsters become more aggressive and alert, and manual saves cost 4 tinderboxes. In the regular game, these were used to light candles to restore one's mental health and to mark a path for one to follow in the dark. Besides that, one can memorise the location of all the tinderboxes, unlike the hard mode, where their appearance is random and each tinderbox is greeted with enthusiastic applause. Hard mode presents a serious and demanding challenge to the player, although there are a few differences from normal mode.\n\nNo matter how many times I have returned to Amnesia, I have always enjoyed the game's ability to tickle the nerves. The 'Choir - Main Hall' location constantly stresses me with its layout and the soundtrack playing in the background, so it has become my habit to slowly creep along the walls, literally feeling them with my backside and listening for every sound. It is an incredible place with an extremely eerie atmosphere and a powerful ambience!\n\nThe bottom line is as follows: Amnesia TDD is truly a masterpiece and one of the best survival horrors of all time!", "timestamp_created": 1691482868, "timestamp_updated": 1692000994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557046949863433838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143634734": {"recommendationid": "143634734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106031324", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1153, "last_played": 1665531581}, "language": "english", "review": "Look man there's a reason it's a classic.

Despite being a lover of outlast, my ability to play these games is always wavering, but at some point i managed to get through the entire story, and it is very good! I would confidently say it does what it intends to do and considering it was made in 2010, does it very well for its time. Enough time has passed since i played this game that i don't remember all of it, but i remember quite a bit and i enjoyed it all\n\nIf you are a horror person, this game is essentially part of the starter pack now. Its a masterpiece created in a era of gaming past but it still offers unique gameplay. At \u00a316.75, it is kind of steep for a singleplayer game and at about 10 hours of gameplay, but the game is so good that i would call it worth it, but i guarantee this game gets frequent sales and due to its age, will be incredibly cheap in them, so i recommend waiting if you are not sure. If you are, i would confidentially say its not a bad price.\n\nI would usually critique around about now the things i didn't particularly like about the game, or things it could have done better, but through a combination of constantly being scared for my life, and a little bit of memory loss, all i can remember is horror. Perhaps the game is actually as flawed as can be, but i assure you of one thing, if you immerse yourself, darkness around, surround sound in, alone, you'll be too consumed by horror to care or know. One thing i will say for sure, you absolutely must try to go into this game blind. It's extremely easy to trivialise otherwise.\n\nThey also have a DLC called \"Justine\" it seems extremely promising, but as much as it is its own side story, its made in a challenge format. It's supposed to be short, and thus they have decided that as it is short, and it is in a challenge format, that there is no saving. I understand this can appeal to some people, but with no sense of how long it is outside of completing it, and you having to spend a long time nosing around to complete the challnges in the \"good ending\", you rather have to prepare yourself for a long sitting, else its akin to Only Up, where you know the next piece, but you now have to start at the beginning. There is a way to make it so it can save apparently, but i'm here to chill, man! The less configuration the better, and in this case, i just wasn't motivated enough. I'll take a peak at a youtube video perhaps instead.\n\nOverall, the game has a resounding recommendation from me", "timestamp_created": 1691243297, "timestamp_updated": 1691243297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143414585": {"recommendationid": "143414585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391920557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 832, "last_played": 1691083371}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, the voice acting is amazing- deep emotion, story structure, gloomy visuals was put into this game, and of course good scares.

Plus, it has like tons of puzzles which was annoyed quite bit because it really makes me feel like i was playing more of a puzzle than horror game at some point lol. \n\nBeside that i must say although this game came out in such long time ago but still better than most survival horror games we have today. The story, monsters, and atmospheres were totally on point. Especially the invisible water monster is so well made. I got paranoid every-time i deal with that monster.

I've played through it twice, once when I wasn't experienced in horror games, and much later when I was. One particularly great part of this game is that it doesn't just try and surprise you into fear, it actively makes you engage with the horror in ways that feel totally hopeless. For example, there'll be many times where you're alerted to a monster in a location, whether they're behind a door or in the water or something, and you'll need to go where they are to progress. You're not just running away from monsters here, you're also constantly battling with yourself, trying to avoid them as much as possible and stay sane while knowing you'll have to invade their environments to go forward. The mechanics all work together really well to make this an unsettling experience. Ironically, it actually feels pretty fair, not trying to scare you or make you feel hopeless with cheap tricks, but crafting the environment in a way that makes those feelings slowly build with you.\n\nA good part too, is that the game knows when to let you take a breather. It makes sure to reward you with sequences that feel safe after a long time spent in danger, like the world itself is taking a breather alongside you. In that way, it also makes it harder to get used to the horror scenarios, so you really never feel like you properly adapt, which is a very good thing in a game trying to inspire fear. The atmosphere, and most of the puzzles/scenarios are just fantastic.

And it is good for many reasons like the soundtrack is great and and the visuals are stunning but that might read superficial.\nThe title tells a conpelling story from the beginning with short flashbacks and documents you must find because from the start the MC is as unaware as you are, which makes it all really fun to read. These papers are also really important for the gameplay because many of them are notes that will instruct you to find and make what you need to progreed through the game, this makes the information feel organic because of it all also being really well written. Under the topic of gameplay it must be said that it is all really fun, difficult at times but so rewarding, the solutions aren't obvious they're really unpredictable and interesting. The need to slide things open makes for great suspense and I need to see it more in other games. Which reminds me, the sound desing is amazing and so fitting. Back to the mechanics, they are truly simple but so challenging, you must manage your lightsources carefuly planning where you'll spend your tinderboxes so you don't waste oil. The puzzles are really clever and attention must paid, as, like aforementioned, there are hints in the texts. Though you might need to take this with a bit of salt as I am a very slow thinker. With all that said from here I'll be talking about things that appeal more to me.\nThe modeling, texturing, lighting and filters are so very appealing to horror fans, the color palette is just gorgeous, and so is the music. The narrative and atmosphere are imensely related to the Lovecraftian style and it uses the charecteriscs of the sub-genre beautifuly, it succeeds in making cosmic horror original again.\nIn conclusion, I absolutely recommend this title to anyone interested in horror and new to gaming because I'm actually late to this as well. Also if you're interested in the recent history of games this was really popular for some time.", "timestamp_created": 1689821621, "timestamp_updated": 1689821621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142437846": {"recommendationid": "142437846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128971747", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1689812971}, "language": "english", "review": "Bluds very sp00ky", "timestamp_created": 1689812987, "timestamp_updated": 1689812987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142411309": {"recommendationid": "142411309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174242413", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1689780281}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the best horror game. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1689780333, "timestamp_updated": 1689780333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553824365139007568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142385219": {"recommendationid": "142385219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095355172", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 3090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2745, "last_played": 1694231963}, "language": "english", "review": "Timeless horror classic with a massive backlog of user-created mods.

I do have to give it props to the horror of the game, because I can say that some parts of it was really horrifying and disturbing like the torture chambers, the monster design, but the atmosphere too. Frictional Games did one better than Penumbra by making it feel like you were actively being watched in the game, and made you feel on edge since you thought one of the monsters might pop up out of nowhere. There were really no areas that would make you feel relief of the monsters or not, since a lot of the times, you would think immediately of what was to come in the next room.

I had not [b]played[/b], let alone [b]finished[/b], many horror games before this. Mostly, this comes down to me being a very naturally anxious person who is stupidly easy to scare, thus I struggle to stomach them, so until this the only horror games I had completed were [i]'Omori'[/i], [i]'i live under your house'[/i], [i]'System Shock 2'[/i] and a few [i]'Five Nights at Freddy's'[/i] games. With this qualifier presented, I can say with confidence that Frictional Game's [i]'Amnesia: The Dark Descent'[/i] is easily the scariest game I've ever encountered, and in spite of some tiny flaws elicited such a strong emotional reaction from me that it would be remiss for me to not consider it among the medium's finest. \n\nAt first, the prospect of a 'sanity' metre\u2014an idea found immeditley quaint for lovecraftian games soon after the admittedly novel antics of [i]'Eternal Darkness'[/i] found their way dancing atop the GameCube\u2014and the titular trope making pose as the story hook had me worrying a potential glaze over was inbound, a worry quickly sedated by a realisation I had early in the game that even with all the red pus germinating in the walls, [i]'The Dark Descent'[/i] had been able to demonstrate a shocking level of restraint in the way it chose to unnerve me thus far. While worry would not be truly cured until later, Frictional's dedication to pacing had me intrigued enough to fully immerse myself in both the excellent atmosphere and writing. The technical quality of the writing found in the notes is quite the admirable one, since the game would have done perfectly fine narratively without it, hooking players into what is presently the story of a man going nuts in the dark trying to set his bad deeds right. The added digresional textures of colonial guilt and characterisation were certainly elevatory when they could easily have been detrimental, leaving me satisifed with their inclusion. \n\n[i]'Amnesia'[/i] is also quite effectivley dreary, with fantastic lighting and crestfallen texture work adorning it's traumatisied and despotic halls. Structures held a balance between intimidation and the alien tipping on both ends against the players comfort. Rooms can be tight and dark, spotted with brief drips of light which can become a pool only at the daring cost of the player's resources, or they can be looming, oversized and intimidating. This atmosphere of oppresion is essential to a horror experience, and well adjusted here. \n\nThe alleviation of my minor irritation at the value of a 'sanity' mechanic came with my introduction to the monsters of Brennenburg. Now, this doesn't happen until a few hours in due to the commitment to narrative pacing present in [i]'The Dark Descent'[/i] but they add a [b]lot[/b] to the game. First, they give the \"sanity\" mechanic a purpose beyond the superficial; as maxing out the metre renders the game unplayable, the sheer act of looking at the monsters will raise the gameplay into a horrid state, meaning the player is forced to keep their eyes off them! This is genius because it allows the player's imagination to do a lot of work for Frictional, having me wholeheartedly afraid of them from entry to exit. While the bugs-crawling-across-the-monitor illusion and other more superfluous consequences of loosing 'sanity' are silly, this contextualisation of the mechanic with a core player struggle was too complimentary to the rest of the game for me to dislike the feature. Wish they'd call it 'stress' or something though because 'sanity' still sounds mega silly. \n\nSome puzzles are a little dense, but all are ultimately satisfying, there's even some instances of emergent gameplay, which is always welcome! Really I have nothing to complain about here. Frictional have delivered a subperb, clever, and hauntingly beautiful horror masterpiece here which still holds up well over a decade later! This, my friends\u2014let us waggle our judging fingers at Bloober team as they piss all over team silent's legacy\u2014is the key to a memorable and powerful horror experience, subtlety and considered, oppresive mechanics!

The grim castle architecture and blood-smeared walls definitely help define the experience from a visual standpoint. The audio is much the same, outdated yet enjoyable.[/td]\n    [td]\ud83d\udfe5 The enemy AI is pretty foolish. The monsters hunting you rely on surprise appearances and their speed to catch you.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe game casts you into the role of Daniel, a Londoner who awakens in the dark halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle. With little to no memory of himself or his past, all that he remembers is his name and that something sinister is hunting him.\n\nDaniel sets off on his journey, dazed and confused, lost in the maze-like hallways of Brennenburg, until he comes across a note that he had apparently left for himself. The message details that he had forced himself to forget his past to preserve his innocence by utilising an amnesia potion. The letter goes on to urge Daniel to descend the castle in search of his host, a man named Alexander and to murder him and with one final warning that a \"living nightmare\" is chasing him and that he must find a way to escape because there are no means of fighting it.\n\nArmed with this knowledge and a trusty lantern he was able to scrounge for, he sets off towards the depths of the dark, neglected castle, with horrors and nightmares on his heels.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2999878783\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent does an exceptional job of immersing you in this story of deception, betrayal and discovery as Daniel descends into his own living nightmare. The plot is heavily reliant on you searching for and reading the notes scattered across the world, there is limited narrative to the game, and if you don't seek these out, you will be left wondering what is actually happening.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]\n[h3]The darkness, closing in.[/h3]\n\ud83d\udfe9 As you will quickly begin to understand as you progress through the story, light is your closest ally and worst enemy. It will protect you from losing your sanity as you wander the castle and witness the supernatural horrors that lurk within it, but you will also need to embrace the darkness to stay out of their sight. Managing this balance is entirely up to you.\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 Sanity is a very tangible resource in this game. It will fall as you witness supernatural events or if you spend too long looking at the horrors that roam the halls. The best way to manage this state is by sticking to the light. You can light candles and torches by utilising tinderboxes you can find scattered across the world or your lantern that requires oil to activate. Losing too much sanity causes your vision to blur and your senses to lose focus, and if left to fall totally will cause Daniel to collapse.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2999878703\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 The enemies are few and far between and mostly avoidable. They aren't very clever and follow some semblance of a scripted path. The best solution quite often is sitting in a dark corner for a few moments out of sight, and they'll usually get bored and walk away.\n\n[h3]A chance to redeem yourself.[/h3]\n\ud83d\udfe9 When you're not running, hiding and avoiding the nightmares, you will likely find yourself completing puzzles. There are dozens of puzzles to solve across the castle grounds, ranging in intricacy from simple to sophisticated.\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 Many of them are actually remarkably inventive and amusing, especially the deceptively simple ones.\n\n[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]\nAs up above, Amnesia isn't going to blow you away with flashy graphics or astounding visuals. It does provide a gritty, atmospheric world that does immerse you in this living nightmare. Despite its dated graphics and design choices, the game still managed to attain a stifled gasp at some of the more stressful panic moments.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2999878456\n\nThe audio is actually far more impressive though it's also dated. It provides a fantastic overall ambience to the world, where every footfall raises your tension, and the creak of every door you wish would be silent rings loudly through the halls.\n\n[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]\nAmnesia is an old game, and it's safe to assume most anyone can run it with a somewhat recent computer.\n\nThere were no graphical issues to report.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts - Very Good[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is a well-recognised survival horror experience within the genre. It paved the way for a lot of the mechanics we know in modern games of its ilk, and I believe it deserves a lot of praise for those commendable efforts.

And on that channel, [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i] would be my nemesis game. I\u2019d hold my head in my hands, loudly sigh, look straight into the camera and go: \u201cI really didn\u2019t want to have to do this (audible shrug), but here we are!\u201d. Boom\u2014cut to the logo, play the theme music.\n\nWell, here we are indeed, and although I didn\u2019t [b]have[/b] to do this, I wish I had! Instead, I\u2019m going off my own wants and needs, unremarkably adding my own voice to the tens of thousands\u2014maybe even hundreds\u2014that have been heard since this insanely influential game came out over a decade ago.\n\n[i]The Dark Descent[/i] has been a personal demon for a while now. For years, I considered it the title that made everyone forget what exactly it was that made horror games such a great and unique experience, pulling them away from tense battles of wit towards drama-driven, cinematic haunted house rides. Turns out, the monster under the bed wasn\u2019t as bad as I initially thought.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997611128\n\n[h3]The Heart of the Matter[/h3]\n\nThere\u2019s a peculiar sense of scale and isolation to the freshly industrialised world, when steam machinery was your best bet for long-distance travel. It\u2019s that specific point in our history that [i]The Dark Descent[/i] takes place at\u2014Britain is at the height of its power, and the ever-growing colonial tendencies of the Western European powers are ramping up to the Scramble for Africa. With real-world technological advances came new plot devices to get the curious adventurer far away from the comfort of his home (similar to how the advent of the e-mail was a godsend to any future immersive sim developers), and right into the mysteries that lie in wait across the Mediterranean and over the Alps in these new lands now ripe for the picking.\n\nIndustrialization and colonialism aren\u2019t quite what [i]The Dark Descent[/i] is about, but it\u2019s a story that is heavily informed by the period it\u2019s set in, as Daniel, a British archaeologist, finds himself pursued by a destructive, supernatural force after uncovering a strange artefact during an expedition in Algiers. With promises of refuge, he seeks the aid of one Alexander of Brennenburg, an eccentric Prussian nobleman and inventor.\n\nThus, Brennenburg Castle is where you\u2019ll be exploring, as unfolding events require Daniel to brave its darkest depths; a descent in many ways, as he comes face to face with the terrible truths that await him and as the welcoming, warm exterior of the castle slowly makes way for the gargantuan mechanisms and surreal architecture that lie further in.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997590832\n\nStrong art direction and an engaging storyline drive things forward in [i]The Dark Descent[/i]. As is survival horror tradition, uncovering what went down and how it went down won\u2019t exactly be straightforward, but will require additional effort to be uncovered. Fear is the barrier you\u2019ll need to overcome for all your goals around these parts, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nSurprise, surprise\u2014Daniel is an amnesiac, meaning he doesn\u2019t immediately remember much of anything, other than his name. Thankfully, writing journals and taking notes is everyone\u2019s favourite pastime in survival horror; there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, and the ones in [i]The Dark Descent[/i] are written with, and I\u2019ll be blunt, some damn inspired prose. What actually got me, though, were the loading screen tips having a subtle narrative impact of their own, by mimicking fragments of Daniel\u2019s memory clicking back in place whenever a new area needs to be loaded in.\n\n[h3] Wait, Survival Horror?[/h3]\n\nThat is what I said\u2014and so we are roped into the old action vs psychological vs survival horror debate.\n\nI'll admit it, I\u2019m a bit dismissive when it comes to all the games that [i]Amnesia[/i] inspired\u2014just look above\u2014but that's all because I'm a bit peeved that all my favourites started leaning into their action elements more and more around that same time, and psychological horror all but took over the stage. In reality, judging an entire subgenre on its worst examples, which all took the wrong lessons from this game, would be the same as stereotyping survival horror as horror-themed action schlock. Okay, before you say it, I agree that it is an accurate summation of [i]Resident Evil[/i], but it\u2019s so much more than that\u2014just like psychological horror can be more than hiding in lockers or running around until something screams in your face. \n\nI\u2019ll always get my jimmies rustled more by careful ammo conservation or the rationing of healing items in the heat of the moment, but I don\u2019t think survival horror is inherently scarier or, hell, even superior when compared to its counterparts. It just works better for [b]me[/b], and this game has, for a long time, been the presumed culprit of why I've been deprived of it for years.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997601113\n\nI say this because my choice to classify [i]The Dark Descent[/i] as survival horror doesn\u2019t come from a place of elitism, but its underlying mechanics. That's the point of survival horror\u2014providing the player choice when faced with their fears. [i]The Dark Descent[/i] makes the choice of not fighting back for you, but tries to offer other choices as much as it can to compensate. \n\nTake the whole physics-based puzzle system, or the way hiding and opening doors works. There are no one-button presses or quick time events\u2014it\u2019s all done by holding and dragging the mouse. Every item not glued to the floor can be moved, and each one you move to where it needs to be, every inch you open a door to continue onwards\u2014a victory. Even if it isn't taken as far as I'd have liked it to, It makes your presence in the world, and the imminent danger you\u2019re in, that much palpable.\n\nThe blur-inducing, screen-warping post-processing effects and abundant dark areas aren\u2019t just cheap visuals or lazy scare tactics, but gameplay elements; spend enough time near enemies or in darkness and Daniel's sanity will drop, causing him to hear or see things that might not be there. Still, inventory management is a crucial aspect of survival, you\u2019re just managing your lantern\u2019s oil and your supply of tinderboxes, used to light up torches and candles, instead of ammo.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s not a game that looks to punish failure with loss of progress. Death will leave you more or less where you left off, with the caveat that any spent resources up until that point remain spent. It\u2019s clear that overcoming your fear is the real challenge here, perhaps paradoxically now that your inability to do so earlier has left you in a worse place. Now, what does that remind me of\u2026\n\n[h3]Verdict[/h3]\n\nFor all the time it took me to come to [i]The Dark Descent[/i] and the rationale that kept me from it, I can\u2019t help but feel a little bit of remorse. I can\u2019t possibly fault it for a lot of the games that came after it learning all the wrong lessons, can I? It\u2019s not like I found anything during my playthrough that would warrant calling it a poor teacher.\n\nAs a friend put it, it\u2019s old and dated, not even breaking into his top ten, with a stifled gasp being the best it deserves.

Although it has gotten somewhat old, Amnesia: The Dark Descent brings core horrific immersion that is unmatched by most horror games nowadays.\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n[list]\n[*] The sound design is definitely polished. By the shear soundtrack and audio mix, you'll feel trapped in a nightmare that will definitely chill you to the bone.\n[*] The level design matches the progression perfectly, making key areas the perfect length to explore before moving on to the next without getting bored. All of the areas are incredible and threatening in their own way.\n[*] Although it can be quite complex to understand the whole thing, the story is amazing. This game is hands down a gem for horror storytelling, with good plot twists and extension of the lore through lots of notes (which are surprisingly worth reading compared to the majority of games).\n[*] The system requirements for this game are extremely low, pretty much anyone can run it decently. [/list]\n\n[b] Neutrals [/b]\n[list]\n[*] Both the graphics and the art style are decent, nothing too crazy, they hold up to this day. However, I've heard this game has mods that can make it look a lot better, I haven't looked into it unfortunately.\n[*] The gameplay is also decent at best. It's a mix of a formula loved by fans even today (such as finding tinderboxes to light the place, finding fuel to light your lamp...) but I found it to be a tad annoying sometimes. Resources aren't consistent between areas, thus making it a pain to learn how to manage them. Some people will find this better for immersion, some will find it annoying, that's why it's in the [i] Neutrals [/i] category.\n[*] The game's length is good. It took me around 8 hours to finish it completely. I haven't played the DLC yet (Amnesia: Justine), but I'll get there eventually.\n[*] Performances are great, but it feels like the game isn't optimised enough to hit over 100 fps even on a high-end PC for my part. I was somewhat disappointed. [/list]\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n[list]\n[*] If you're a completionist looking to 100% this game without a guide, it'll be a nightmare for you. Reading all the documents is enough of a pain, but it also requires you to find all the tinderboxes in the entire game. \n[*] The physics are wonky and outdated. Some will say it brings a charm to the game. I've actually encountered some bugs because of it that broke my immersion. This is an expected negative aspect considering the game's age, but I prefer pointing it out.\n[*] The horror aspects don't hit like they used to. Unfortunately, although the atmosphere is phenomenal, the monsters are goofy for today's standards, and I ended up laughing more than panicking on many occasions. Some scary elements may fall flat to most recent horror games, like Outlast for example. [/list]\n\n[b] TL;DR [/b]\nA classic and great horror game that (kind of) holds up to today's standards in many ways. The storytelling is amazing, the progression is great and it's fun to explore the depths of the Brennenburg Castle. The atmosphere is also really immersive. Most horror elements don't scare like they use to, unfortunately, and the physics are outdated. Those are both expected from a 13 year old game, but they definitely break the immersion on some occasion. If you're a completionist, you will suffer trying to finish this game without watching a guide. Overall, definitely worth playing if you're into horror games and good storytelling and don't mind this game's age.\n\n[b] Rating: 7/10 [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1687881070, "timestamp_updated": 1687914665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140796067": {"recommendationid": "140796067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069530127", "num_games_owned": 1658, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1604351045}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1687879702, "timestamp_updated": 1687879702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140791647": {"recommendationid": "140791647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098894542", "num_games_owned": 629, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 892, "last_played": 1688191280}, "language": "english", "review": "My favourite horror game of all time.

It has launched Youtube careers, an entire subgenre, and a number of copycat games - among them lots of drivel, but also some truly inspired works of art. Does it feel like a worthy precursor to modern interactive horror? Honestly, it feels like we haven't progressed that far from that initial achievement; Frictional Games' design feels timeless. It's mostly smoke and mirrors, but it cheats you in to such a powerful feeling of wonder and terror that it's hard to compare with anything else. I actually haven't finished it back in 2010 because the frights were nigh unbearable, but having played (and tremendously enjoyed) The Bunker earlier this month, I knew I had to give it another try. I enjoyed it A LOT, and I honestly don't think I've played anything like it. It's an adventure puzzle game at heart, the horror-oriented mechanics are not particularly developed, but the sound design does the work and the atmosphere is strong all the way through.

Young 11 year old me watched Pewdiepie play this game. I learnt english because of watching Pewdiepie play this game. Because of Pewdiepie and this game, I downloaded Steam and played Team Fortress 2. Couple of years later, I bought this game, as appreciation, but never played it, since I watched Pewdiepie play it.

A horror game that changed its genres landscape and cemented horror as one of the most popular genres of game. A game that (greatly) helped  Frictional Games and jump started the careers of world famous You-tubers such as Pewdiepie, Markiplier, CinnamonToastKen, etc.  A game that changed the way horror games are developed, indie or triple A, even to this day (for better or worse depending who you ask). But was it even any good in the first place? Does it hold up? What makes this game special? And why am I reviewing this game in 2023.\n\nWell, with the release of Amnesia Bunker yesterday (and seeing Amnesia Dark Descent at only $3 due to a steam sale), I decided if it would be a perfect time to start playing Amnesia and find the answers to these questions above. \n\nFirst of all, let's start with the positives. Spoiler alert, the positives far outweigh any negatives and answers the first two questions I started this review with with an astounding YES! Controlling your character is serviceable and smooth; no tank-like or clunky controls (Though turn that mouse sensitivity up in the settings since it's set at 1 for some reason). The physics engine really gives the gameplay some nice flavor and makes you feel a sense of freedom in such a creepy, linear, and confined space. Oh, and I forgot to mention about how the atmosphere: it's quite awesome. The sound design, music, lighting, set pieces, etc. compliment the game quite a bit. This game is essentially a masterclass in sound design and music, both impressing you and making you shit your pants at the same time. You have to make decisions based on sound cues and music that alerts and gives information about the monsters. Gives you a sense of dread and fear, which makes the game even scarier. The lighting and set pieces/environments really goes well with the music and sounds and nothing feels out of place. There are many dark spaces with occasional places of light or light sources that you can light up. It makes you feel that the monster could be lurking in any corner, just waiting for you to turn the wrong direction to snatch you up while it's unseen. It also makes you think before you use your lantern or use light sources since there is a limited amount of \"fuel\" (especially in hard mode).\nI've been yapping about the atmosphere, but what about more of the gameplay? How do you defend yourself? \nIts a first person survival horror game, and to answer the last question, the only way to defend yourself is to run and hide. This isn't Resident Evil where, even with limited ammo, you could and had to kill your enemies. This is Amnesia. You are playing as someone who is utterly defenseless and that adds to the atmosphere of this game. With the physics engine you could throw stuff at the monster, but that doesn't do much and is just a waste of time. Anyways, you also have a inventory system where you track your health, sanity, and fuel for your lantern. There are also certain objects that you need to collect and/or combine together to advance in the game. And with these objects you collect you solve puzzles, and there are quite a few, but not too much where the horror and gameplay is ruined (I'm talking to you Scorn) .\nLastly for the positives, I think the voice acting is well done and I feel is not talked about a lot I think. They fit the character very well and helps keep the story tight. There's no bad voice actors in my opinion, and thank God they didn't pull a Bethesda by using the same voice actor for many roles. But yet again, there are not as many characters in Amnesia, but you get the point. And for the story, it's very well done and makes you want to beat the game just for that, because it's very interesting and reveals itself over tine since your main character took Amnesia (duh vault417dan, we could've guessed). But I will not reveal anything specific, since that would be spoilers, and this game should be played.\nThere is also now workshop support, with makes it easier to access custom story, a gamemode that let' s you play fan made levels/mods which were created in the Amnesia engine. I respect Frictional Games for giving the fans this ability. It's a nice cherry on top to play when you're done with the main story even.\n\nOne part that I felt was neither a positive or negative was the graphics. They're serviceable, and while they've aged and weren't even peak graphics at the time, I don't mind. \n\nNow for the negatives. The monsters' can be idiots. Due to their flawed AI, you only need to hide behind an object or go above they're vision level and you won't have to worry about them. It's quite disappointing that the monsters that you were initially so scared of in the beginning get less scary over time, especially when you realize this. Also, speaking of the disappointing monsters, the first/grunt monsters look silly and derpy. Especially with how slow they are, it makes you point and laugh rather than tremble with fear. And there's one monster that had so much potential to be like the next killer Croc in Arkham Asylum,  but YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT! \nSome puzzles are just a little to long and dragged out as well. More of a minor complaint, but it can make the puzzles a little tedious.\nAnd my last (but not least) negatives are the endings. They are so underwhelming and disappointing that it can be jarring. With so much build up and epic gaming, you wouldn't expect this trash at the end of the yellow brick road. It won't make you delete the game or prevent you from replaying for completion, but it just makes you go \"What the hell is this?!\".\n\nNow for the conclusion, since this review has gone long enough. This game is so good and my favorite horror game. Even with a few issues, the game is still great and extremely replayable. It still holds up in 2023.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? PLAY THE GAME! As of now, it's only $3 and is a steal.", "timestamp_created": 1686167006, "timestamp_updated": 1686167006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139697981": {"recommendationid": "139697981", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961830076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1686070574}, "language": "english", "review": "We have outlast at home:\n\nThis game sucks and IDK what you guys were smoking in 2010 when you said this was a good game.

Released in 2010, it remains a landmark title that continues to terrify and captivate players with its atmospheric setting, innovative mechanics, and psychological scares.\n\nFrom the moment you step into the shoes of Daniel, a man who awakens in a dark and foreboding castle with no memory of his past, Amnesia: The Dark Descent plunges you into a world of constant dread and suspense. The game's greatest strength lies in its ability to build an oppressive atmosphere, using sound design, lighting, and environmental details to create an eerie and unsettling experience. Every creaking floorboard, distant whisper, and flickering candle adds to the sense of impending doom, keeping you on edge throughout your journey.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of Amnesia: The Dark Descent are centered around survival and stealth, emphasizing the vulnerability of the player character. Daniel is not a seasoned warrior; instead, he must rely on his wits and limited resources to navigate the treacherous castle and avoid the terrifying inhabitants that lurk in the shadows. The game introduces the concept of sanity, which deteriorates as Daniel encounters frightening events, forcing players to manage their mental state while facing unimaginable horrors. The unique \"sanity meter\" adds an extra layer of tension and immersion, as hallucinations and distorted perceptions become increasingly prevalent.\n\nThe puzzles in Amnesia: The Dark Descent are cleverly designed, requiring both logical thinking and a keen eye for details. They seamlessly integrate into the narrative, enhancing the sense of mystery and discovery. The game strikes a delicate balance between challenging the player and ensuring progression feels rewarding. The absence of combat mechanics further amplifies the feeling of vulnerability, making every encounter with the castle's inhabitants a terrifying ordeal that prompts strategic evasion and stealth.\n\nGraphically, Amnesia: The Dark Descent may show its age, but its visual design still manages to create a hauntingly beautiful and grotesque world. The dimly lit corridors, decaying architecture, and macabre imagery contribute to a sense of dread and unease. Combined with the exceptional sound design, which employs a combination of eerie ambient noises and spine-chilling music, the game creates an immersive experience that will leave you sleepless.\n\nOne aspect that sets Amnesia apart is its captivating storyline. Through fragmented memories, notes, and letters, the game slowly unravels the dark secrets of the castle and Daniel's past. The narrative is compelling, filled with psychological twists and revelations that keep you engaged until the very end. It's a testament to the game's writing and storytelling that it successfully merges atmospheric horror with a thought-provoking plot.\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent is not without its flaws, but they are minor in comparison to its overall excellence. Some players may find certain sections overly challenging or frustrating, and the lack of combat can be polarizing for those who prefer more action-oriented horror experiences. However, these elements are intentional choices that contribute to the game's unique identity.\n\nIn conclusion, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a landmark horror game that will leave a lasting impact on anyone brave enough to venture into its dark depths. With its immersive atmosphere, innovative gameplay mechanics, and captivating storytelling, it remains a testament to the power of psychological horror in gaming. If you have a taste for fear and enjoy being pushed to the limits of your sanity, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an unforgettable experience that will haunt your dreams long after you've turned off the lights.", "timestamp_created": 1684624542, "timestamp_updated": 1684624542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62661057710647583", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138647433": {"recommendationid": "138647433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012822789", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 785, "last_played": 1675523043}, "language": "english", "review": "classic, nice to achivement hunt and replay", "timestamp_created": 1684623752, "timestamp_updated": 1684623752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50354611873626709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138618691": {"recommendationid": "138618691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193414593", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1667891714}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.

The graphics and lighting still hold up, while the soundtrack immerses you in its atmosphere, and the mystery of the story/lore pulls you deeper on your dark descent to confront to truth.\n\nWould you like to know what's the greatest aspect of this game? Custom stories. Frictional had the foresight to include mod support, which provides the game with loads of replayability. There are thousands of mods you can download for this game, from custom stories and total conversion mods to lighting and graphical enhancements. And the greatest thing is THEY ARE STILL MAKING MODS TO THIS DAY.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say (depends on how you look at it), is that the monsters don't stay in the area when they appear. They typically appear after finding a key item (like a key), and growl to alert you to their presence. The soundtrack also switches from the environment appropriate ambient track, to the enemy patrol track. The dread is ruined if you're warned a monster is nearby. The gameplay loop here is hiding or staying away from them until they time out and disappear. I don't know why designed like this, as it takes away the challenge of completing an objective while a monster stalks the hallways.", "timestamp_created": 1684429996, "timestamp_updated": 1684430108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629807710647583008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138421458": {"recommendationid": "138421458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143759826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11010, "last_played": 1569612011}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played the game for longer than i should've and have gotten nowhere but 10/10 recommend from your 1 achievement earning host", "timestamp_created": 1684301954, "timestamp_updated": 1684301954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138419021": {"recommendationid": "138419021", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983180562", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 781, "last_played": 1682734068}, "language": "english", "review": "SCORE: 7/10 - GOOD\nIf Edgar Allan Poe authored a computer game, it would assuredly be similar to this.

I actually remember reading about Penumbra series back in 2000s in Igromania magazine but I still never tried them. So, Amnesia: The Dark Descent was a first game of a new franchise from Frictional Games when they finished Penumbra trilogy. But those both series are very different, even that they both created by the same people.

The game features dynamic sound effects and ambient music that change based on the player's actions and the state of Daniel's mental health, which can affect their ability to perceive reality accurately.\n\nThe game's storyline is also a major component of its appeal. As players uncover more about Daniel's past, they will encounter haunting memories and disturbing revelations that add depth to the game's horror elements.\n\nOverall, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a masterfully crafted horror game that offers an intense and terrifying experience for players.

The strongest memory I have of this game was being stuck at the very last click of the game for over 30 minutes until I was almost crying. I clicked the object multiple times but apparently I was supposed to know to continue hold/push instead of clicking to interact. To try to quantify this I would say my biggest gripes with this game is no map, no help system, no clear objectives and interactable objects aren't easily discernible. Unless someone has a vast knowledge and deep understanding of puzzle mechanics this game can be very difficult. I would say if you don't want a challenge keep a walkthrough handy or have someone hang who knows the game well and can direct you if you get stuck. \n\nThe story seemed cool but I started getting extremely confused about which collectibles were from/involving which characters (pronouns without names contributed heavily to this). Especially down in the dungeon underbelly I stopped being entirely clear if there was one or multiple characters to what I previously thought was one storyline/sub-plot. Eventually it devolved to the point I was just in a haze of non-understanding and stopped retaining any lore or story development. By the time big main plot stuff started coming full circle the last hour or so of the game I simply had no idea what was going on. \n\nAlso I want to note that I didn't think the sanity mechanic functioned properly. It almost seemed to me that the mechanic came and went- or in general didn't function to make the game scarier or motivate me to progress. It seemed a few times i got stuck places due to the visuals and couldn't progress in the game. \n\nThat all being said, I understand why this game is a classic. It had a lot to offer: from environment/atmosphere to mechanics & puzzles, the enemy models and AIs.  Even the story seemed cool even though I had NO idea what was happening.  Although for me this will never be a favorite and honestly I had a LOT of negative shit to say about it during my playthrough and even today- I think anyone who enjoys horror should play it because there will be something to value. I would even go so far as to say that a playthrough of this could widen the skillset of a casual to moderate player.

As he explores the castle and unravels the story of its previous occupants, he discovers that he is being pursued by a shadowy figure known as \"The Gatherer,\" and that his only hope of escape is to delve deeper into the castle's dark secrets.\n\nOne of the game's biggest strengths is its atmosphere. The castle is beautifully rendered, with intricate details and an oppressive sense of dread that permeates every corner. The sound design is equally impressive, with a haunting score that ramps up the tension to unbearable levels.\n\nThe gameplay is centered around exploration and puzzle-solving, but it's the game's use of psychological horror that truly sets it apart. The player is constantly on edge, never quite sure what's around the next corner or whether they're being stalked by an unseen foe. The game's sanity system adds an extra layer of terror, as the player's vision becomes distorted and their movements sluggish as their sanity deteriorates.\n\nOverall, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a masterpiece of horror game design. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to brave its depths, it offers an unforgettable and deeply unsettling experience. If you're a fan of horror games, or just looking for a truly immersive and terrifying gaming experience, this game is an absolute must-play.\n\nPros:\n\n1.Atmospheric horror: The game has a creepy and eerie atmosphere that keeps the player on edge throughout the game.\n\n2.Immersive gameplay: The game makes use of immersive techniques such as first-person view, realistic sound effects, and interactive environments, making the gameplay more engaging.\n\n3.Engaging storyline: The game's storyline is intriguing, and it keeps the player engaged throughout the game.\n\n4.Challenging puzzles: The game includes several challenging puzzles that require the player to think creatively to solve them.\n\n\nCons:\n\n1.Lack of combat: The game lacks traditional combat mechanics, which may be disappointing for players who enjoy action-packed gameplay.\n\n2.Repetitive gameplay: The game's mechanics can become repetitive after a while, and some players may find the game tedious.\n\n3.Limited character development: The game's protagonist is not well-developed, and some players may find it hard to empathize with Daniel.\n\n4.Motion sickness: The game's first-person view and the use of motion blur may cause motion sickness in some players.", "timestamp_created": 1680438967, "timestamp_updated": 1680439056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502703249454498291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135913948": {"recommendationid": "135913948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424378315", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 752, "last_played": 1680388458}, "language": "english", "review": "xdlsd", "timestamp_created": 1680388465, "timestamp_updated": 1680388465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135829687": {"recommendationid": "135829687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316991014", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1681087700}, "language": "english", "review": "Oil very good\n", "timestamp_created": 1680297273, "timestamp_updated": 1680297273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135829185": {"recommendationid": "135829185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158649470", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1485, "last_played": 1682851076}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Barrels", "timestamp_created": 1680296705, "timestamp_updated": 1680296705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135827591": {"recommendationid": "135827591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243210388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 673, "last_played": 1679968018}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Para ser un juego viejo es muy bueno, tiene 3 finales. no es ni de lejos el mejor juego que he jugado pero si esta chevere para pasar un rato", "timestamp_created": 1680294984, "timestamp_updated": 1680294984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135815982": {"recommendationid": "135815982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072094217", "num_games_owned": 662, "num_reviews": 579, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1680284525}, "language": "english", "review": "Whoever made this game needs to stop making games.

Level design, sound effects, voice acting just perfect and when you start playing you really feel the world around you. Even this game almost has no AI still it makes you look over your shoulder all the time and keep you nervous.\n\nStorytelling in horror games is hard and very few of them can be able to achieve this without ruining the horror element in the game. Normally you want to run endlessly to just to finish the game but in this game I wanted to follow the story more by finding all the things I can read in the game. \n\nInteraction with objects is a lot of fun and game allows you to get creative which is makes this game unique. All of the things done manually like opening the doors, closets and I think this is the best way to do for this kind of games. Because when chase happens this gives the feeling of being chased a lot more.\n\nSanity system is thought well but unfortunately poorly executed. I wish they could make us die or at least got lost the control of the character for some time. In hard mode yes when it reaches zero player dies but this shouldn't be tied to difficulty I think. Because what's the point of using lights to illuminate the area then? You can easily go in the dark without seeing any negative effect.\n\nAnd another thing I loved about this game of course puzzles. They're forcing you to think then act instead of finding a solution by brute forcing.

This game is a staple of horror games. It completely shaped and changed the horror genre in how these types of games were developed and presented. This game excels in its own horrors, that of the players own fear. It messes with your anxiety and fear of the unknown as you progress throughout the story of the game. It teases you with encountering the monsters in small bits and then throws them at you later when you least expect it. This mechanic within itself fills this game with an unsettling and bone chilling atmosphere. Add this with the games interesting story and simple, yet effective mechanics and puzzles, and this game really is a wonderful experience. Whats even more impressive is how the engine and graphics of this game still look pretty good, considering it came out in 2010.What really takes this game further is the absolutely amazing and talented mod community the game has cultivated in its 12 plus year of existence. The custom stories and mods elevate this game into higher levels more enjoyable then even the base game.

I say \"NO!\" because, quite frankly, it became unplayable. Every step I took onward from that little sewer-butcher room was agony. I could not stop thinking about the lack of attention, or perhaps even worse- intentional lack of attention in favour of saving money by not modeling a left hand for the servant.\n\nWhat is this left-hand erasure? I'm nearly confident enough to say it was a hate-crime against left-handed people. Think about how many other hands in the game have no left counterpart. I shiver at the thought.\n\nI pray for you if you think of buying, let alone playing, this game after hearing of these horrors.", "timestamp_created": 1679198469, "timestamp_updated": 1679198469, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429658412933349609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134903881": {"recommendationid": "134903881", "author": {"steamid": "76561199009830997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1679018206}, "language": "english", "review": "yeah", "timestamp_created": 1679160948, "timestamp_updated": 1679160948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134848768": {"recommendationid": "134848768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045101581", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1679104316}, "language": "english", "review": "fuck off, actually fuck off with this bullshit game design.

This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my skin and world and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well. This game reminded me that there is fun in everything, and I brought many happy memories to me and my son.", "timestamp_created": 1678109744, "timestamp_updated": 1678109744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461538463830947876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134179267": {"recommendationid": "134179267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052486330", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1668465256}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple, fun and pleasant to look at.\n", "timestamp_created": 1678103629, "timestamp_updated": 1678103629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134165298": {"recommendationid": "134165298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035251961", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 81, "last_played": 1367099469}, "language": "english", "review": "I love nightmares.", "timestamp_created": 1678075968, "timestamp_updated": 1678075968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134161286": {"recommendationid": "134161286", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014373700", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1678068594}, "language": "english", "review": "Really strong horror game with some shitty puzzles near the end.

It felt like what I would imagine a Resident Evil game to be in first person without any combat at all.\n\nYour placed in a terrifying environment with an equally scary atmosphere. The music and sound effects are superb. I screamed \"holy sh#^\" in fear at one point, and I never get scared, and I never cuss.\n\nDying doesn't really have any consequence, which is actually nice, because a lot of horror games that force you to redo a lot of stuff takes away the horror and just makes it annoying instead.\n\nYou will mostly be solving puzzles which are clever and thought provoking, but not frustrating, though I did have to look up  a walkthrough a few times. They are very satisfying to figure out in any case. \n\nMy only complaints are its annoying when the frequent story bits interrupt gameplay. There aren't cut scenes or anything, but your vision gets a bit cloudy, making the dark areas even more dark, and you walk slower as voices from the past speak about something or another. You can still move around and continue what you are doing, you just won't be able to see as well or move as fast. I get the devs were trying to get you to focus on the story at these moments, but it was more annoying than anything. Though it hardly was at all and truly is barely worth mentioning at all, but i did, so...yeah...\n\nThe other complaint is you have this insanity level, and when you get full on crazy, your vision becomes incredibly blurred and you walk around all dizzy like. This is obviously a punishment, since you are supposed to light up rooms and such to keep yourself from going crazy, but sometimes it's unavoidable. I don't have an issue with the mechanic itself, but man does it make me sick during those parts. \n\nThese complaints really didn't ruin anything for me at all, they were just about the only things I disliked.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, \nas it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

I always hear people using TDD as a staple to compare other horror games to; as if it's a flawless masterpiece and the quality standard by which we should judge all other games in the genre. I wish they would take the time to remind themselves how the game actually feels to play now that it's over a decade old.\n\nA:TDD is good. It's got tight controls, well put together ambience and atmosphere, stunning audio design, interesting and well delivered story, and a memorably identity of it's own in a genre quite over-saturated with low quality indie titles. The only real problem with it is, well, it's not particularly scary anymore. To the game's credit, this is almost entirely due to the gradual desensitisation of audiences to it's design elements, rather than any problems in the design itself.\n\nBasically TDD was the game that created a lot of the moulds horror games have been using for the past decade, and as a result, what was once a fresh and unique experience has retroactively become just another by-the-numbers chasey hidey puzzle solving horror game. You have to give Frictional credit for creating, or at the very least popularising this style of horror game, but that credit won't help the game be scary again. It's a bittersweet irony that the game's immense success as a fresh new bone-chilling horror experience destined to revitalise it's genre is the very thing that's led to it being so predictable and sort of silly for modern horror audiences.\n\nI still think it's great, of course. If you're not someone who plays horror games regularly and therefore aren't so versed in the usual genre clich\u00e9s, maybe it'll still hold up for you in the spook department. For me though, I play horror games semi-regularly, and the only real sustainable factor in TDD nowadays is the story, which is worth it on it's own for sure, but the horror elements are too formulaic by 2023+ standards for it to fray any nerves.\n\nAs with any genre-defining game, you have to try to look at it from the perspective of it's time. Over the past 12+ years there have been thousands of games taking direct inspiration from it's influence. Impressive as it's legacy is, it has the inevitable consequence of wearing the unique elements of the original down as time goes on, and the end result is that TDD sadly feels quite generic when looked at from a modern perspective. I do wish more people made a habit of regularly replaying games like this, because it's hard to move in the horror sphere without seeing comparisons to older titles that, while effective horror experiences at the time, have since lost most, if not all of their edge with the eventual maturation of audiences.\n\nIt's a good game, marred by it's own influenced successors and their wider effects on the genre and it's audiences. Still worth playing because it's a piece of horror history, just don't be surprised if you end up having spontaneous shovel duels with the monsters for fun when you're meant to be running away.", "timestamp_created": 1675727796, "timestamp_updated": 1698547760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675896763801574707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132337363": {"recommendationid": "132337363", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987564255", "num_games_owned": 1290, "num_reviews": 417, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 666, "last_played": 1605901413}, "language": "english", "review": "powerful statement", "timestamp_created": 1675716573, "timestamp_updated": 1675716573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571136057376861572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132327005": {"recommendationid": "132327005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106868360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1686735243}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tensi\u00f3n constante, buenos acertijos, genial ambientaci\u00f3n.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The necessity of running, hiding, and relying on their stupidity makes hiding suspensful.\n\n   + Sanity and other limited resources rush the player forward faster than they would like, while also making doing so a daunting task that raises suspension to enhance the fear factor.\n\n   + Impressive story with lovecraft and other horror influences I wasn't expecting. The story, characters, and setting intertwine with the mechanics beautifully to create a strong sense of immersion, and drive in a sense of helplessness.\n\n   + Puzzles are the main limiter that forces player exploration in times when they would really rather not, and work well with the sanity mechanic to feel satisfying to complete. Generally enjoyable, if also a factor in why the game isn't nearly as good on replay.\n\n   + Game cranks up the driving \"fear of the unknown\" with several silly tactics, including relying and feeding into player assumptions that are totally false, mechanics that discourage really learning, and flat-out lying.\n\n\n   ~ As mentioned, the 'lying' the game does enhances the fear on the first playthrough, but eventual learning makes it a limiting factor for replayability, and can feel like being made somewhat of a fool for causing your own misfortune.\n\n   ~ Very short game, combined with other factors, means you will have a fun first go through, but replayability is almost non-existent. I would mark this as a negative, but the fact of the studio's size, issues I've heard of that occured during development, and the \"short but sweet\" package idea make it a more middling fact. Despite the short length of the first playthrough, this game still had a strong impact.\n\n   ~ Some game breaking bugs exist, but due to constant saves, and a forgiving factor due to the issues mentioned above, they occured for me but were never a negative highlight (more like a footnote). Just be wary they can occur, especially if you take actions too fast during puzzles.\n\n\n   - I marked 'non-replayability' as a mid factor, but certain are highlighted negatively. Previously, cinematic segments of flashbacks that drip-fed you story information were great and helped to establish it, but on replay they become slow crawls where it feels like ages to get through.\n\n   - Again, I've marked many issues as mid factors due circumstantially, as they never became noticeably negative in my heart. Big however here though, as the hard mode takes every condolence I had and rips it apart. This mode has several aspects that greatly lessened my experience: limited saves due to limited resources means it can feel like the game isn't willing to recognize your knowledge of itself, the lack of constant saves means that gamebreaking bugs are a true nightmare to encouner rather than a footnote, and the tediousness of many aspects of the game become all too apparent by the time you play this mode (especially if you die at certain points and lose a great amount of time replaying bits).\n\n\nAs far as time per dollar go, don't expect a whole lot of value. In terms of that first playthrough, however, it will stick with you and is part of the reason it's a historical landmark in horror gaming. It's influence is palpable and is worth experiencing, and I could never 'not recommend' this game. Though, you might want to look to it's successors if you're not a fan of this style of late 2000's / early 2010's horror. \n\n\n----------------------------\n\n[JUSTINE]\n\n   + Going from The Dark Descent -> Justine grants back some of that fear of the unknown due to the new nature of it, and offers a quick fright for a short moment.\n\n   + Despite my issues with the story, the tactic of unraveling it works much the same here, albeit to a lesser extent. The enemies are given a new angle of interest within this new setting.\n\n\n   - Despite the new fear of unknown reintroduced, it fades quickly as not much new is actually done in terms of what The Dark Descent built its fear on. Does not remain scary for very long at all, even accounting for its length.\n\n   - Although the main factor in the cause is due to Justine's size and scope, the story is pretty dreadful, especially in comparison to its base. Although fitting a story as quality as The Dark Descent's into Justine would be a daunting task, the general writing present here amounts to not much more than another horror story about a mentally ill person that's sooo crazy. Boring, overdone, and simply too easy, even for its time.\n\n   - Justine is based around the idea of a psychiatric evaluation and the results of it based on certain trials the player goes through, but the end result of the eval is the same every time. Very much a missed opportunity, as well given the thematics of The Dark Descent.\n\n   - The trials themselves are essentially obtuse, especially in comparison to The Dark Descent's puzzles (vague guestimations both in how you go about completing them and whether you actaully succeeded, unsatisfying).\n\n\nAs it comes with the base game, you're not looking for time/dollar value here, but time/enjoyment. Not horrible to play the first way through, like The Dark Descent, but it's replay value is even lower, possibly below the floor. You're better off playing any of the other dedicated Amnesia titles than this even once, let alone multiple times. Not an entirely un-worth playing if you really want to, however.\n\n\n( full review on both at: https://dolor-in-circulos.neocities.org/ReviewPages/Amnesia_2010_Hub )", "timestamp_created": 1673338330, "timestamp_updated": 1677965432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130552693": {"recommendationid": "130552693", "author": {"steamid": "76561199421336773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 405, "last_played": 1673341451}, "language": "english", "review": "6 HOURS IN, NEED NEW UNDIES. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1673334034, "timestamp_updated": 1673334034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130548351": {"recommendationid": "130548351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198849824922", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1674262638}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es un re juego me lo complete cuando lo tenia trucho, es entretenido y tiene unos puzles re picados y curiosos, si no entendes los puzles buscate en yt algun gameplay como yo. y la historia ni hablar, tiene un re lore que nunca entendi y una historia que tampoco entend\u00ed por que me saltee los dialogos, En fin, muy buen juego y super recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1673327483, "timestamp_updated": 1673327483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130546814": {"recommendationid": "130546814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198861199480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 760, "last_played": 1673322965}, "language": "english", "review": "Creepy.

A classic that is juuust beginning to show the technical and financial constraints of the team at that time, especially compared to their newer games.\n\n[h2]Scary[/h2]\nIt is scary. It is moody and engrosing, it is at times creepy, at times lovecraftian, at times cruel and messed-up, and the atmosphere is impeccable. I'll elaborate a bit more in later parts of this review.\nIt is, in fact, [b][i]very[/i][/b] scary. So if you're feeling it's a bit too much for you, but want to carry on regardless, here's a bit of spoilery info to help: [spoiler]in most cases, enemies spawn with a distinct sound and despawn after searching; when the tense music stops, you're completely safe.[/spoiler]\nSo, it's scary, yes, but to what end? And the answer is: eh...\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\nIt is serviceable+. It is more or less coherent, it is almost not cringe ([spoiler]with the exception of certain real-world 16th century alchemists[/spoiler]), and the internal logic is well-maintained. The heavy lifting is mostly done by the atmosphere anyway. The story elevates the game from being a spooky castle-themed park, but it is neither emotionally nor intellectually rewarding. \nThere are three endings that you can choose at the very end: the Ridiculous, the Almost-Satisfying and the Stupid.\nI think the greatest strength of horror games is in their ability to tell unique stories - and this story is, frankly, not worth the horror experience. It doesn't ruin the game, as I've said, it's serviceable - but you don't play The Dark Descent for the story. There are games where you carry on through the dark hallways and unspeakable horrors for the sake of the story, but not this one - here the dark hallways and unspeakable horrors are the point, not the means.\n\n[h2]Atmosphere[/h2]\nIncredible. The sound design is amazing - footsteps, distant real or imagined screams, creaking floorboards, the surreal howling of [spoiler]the Shadow[/spoiler]. Each area is unique and [i]feels[/i] real. The locations are quite diverse too, from comforting and almost cozy, to dark, dirty and claustrophobic, to alien in scope and in their cruel architecture.\nYes, there are rough edges in other aspects of this game, but not here - the atmosphere is simply perfect.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nNot amazing, not terrible - but the developers did far better in their later games. The gameplay involves mostly navigating areas, fetching stuff for puzzles and avoiding monsters. The latter is *boring*. \nThe monsters are stupid as heck and due to some peculiarities of their implementation (remember that spoilery info at the beginning of the review?) most encounters are more of an annoyance than a challenge or a puzzle. Furthermore, due to the technical limitations and financial constraints the devs could neither hide the monsters in shadows well enough, nor implement the concepts in a more sophisticated way. So they are more like wax dolls then [...], and their design feels somewhat superficial, if still scary. Their concepts are incredible, but their implementation doesn't realize their potential fully. This applies to the (not much of a spoiler, it appers very early) [spoiler]Shadow too, a great concept that shines better in the scattered notes than in the actual gameplay.[/spoiler]\nOverall, the game balances between terror and calm, between creepy and gory, unknown and explicit - and the developers haven't yet mastered this balancing act. This applies to the story and to the monsters too, without getting into spoilers. They still manage this delicate balance a lot better than many, many horror games - but there are also games that do it better, including the next Amnesia games and SOMA from the same devs.\n\nThe sanity mechanic is fun, but also it's better implemented in later games. And although it clearly tries to do so, it doesn't solve the problem of monsters being unimpressive up close.\n\nThe puzzles are fun. They don't require too much from your scared brain, but also pose a nice enough challenge. A big part of the puzzle is fetching stuff from the opposite sides of the map - which can be either \"fun\" (by horror standards) or annoying, depending on the current level and its inhabitants.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nI can only recommend this game on discount and if you're completely aware of what you're getting into. If you are only getting into horror games, that's not the best place to start. If you are interested in the Amnesia series, Rebirth has a far better and more dramatic story, more fun gameplay, a bit less scary (in my opinion, for the better), prettier and more coherently designed - thanks to a higher budget and more experience of the team at Frictional. \nBefore I played this game, I was sad. Now I'm slightly annoyed, so that's an improvement. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends, but I will give it a thumbs-up out of respect for the devs and the influence this game had on the horror genre. And if you've played the other Frictional games and are in for a moody scary ride, go grab it.", "timestamp_created": 1672328880, "timestamp_updated": 1672329510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129609293": {"recommendationid": "129609293", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095317284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1690954724}, "language": "spanish", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1672325803, "timestamp_updated": 1672325803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129603243": {"recommendationid": "129603243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198862623614", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1674226641}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome", "timestamp_created": 1672320512, "timestamp_updated": 1672320570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129600919": {"recommendationid": "129600919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195962713", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1672316750}, "language": "english", "review": "I genuinely want to finish this game, I do.

The graphics aren't that bad today either, although it's very clear that this is a twelve year old game. 30 minutes and I completely stopped looking at the graphics. The story of the game was revealing itself in a reading style, which annoyed me quite a bit at first, (probably because I'm spoiled from the modern games where developers serve the story with insane cutscenes all up my sleeve) but after about an hour in I accepted it and was always excited when I discovered a new page unraveling the story.\nThe pace of Amnesia was honestly slow. I found myself bored in some parts but freaking out as I was chased by a splashing SOUND of water haha. It is not always the smoothest experience, but it's never dull.\nIt truly has a good atmosphere, cool effects and great music!

While very clearly having aged graphically, it still looks great as it choose art style over graphical fidelity, which lead to a long lasting look for the game itself. Game play wise, it's all game play and story. There's no cut scenes and not much in way of hand-holding, which definitely add to the experience. The only issue with this is that there are definitely a series of puzzles which, unless you are incredibly meticulous in your attention to detail, you will likely overlook and have to resort to a guide or a quick google search. Other than that, the puzzles are fantastic. The audio is an eargasm. The gameplay is simple. And the game itself is short and sweet. As far as I know, there's multiple endings as well which definitely encourage multiple plays. Other than that, this is my first true horror game experience, as I'm not much of a horror person, and I frivolously enjoyed it.

Created by Frictional Games, this game drags you in from the get-go into a spine-chilling experience that doesn't let go. It's certainly not for the faint of heart.\n\nImagine waking up in a gothic castle called the Brennenburg Castle with no memory of who you are or how you got there. You become Daniel, the amnesiac protagonist, and embark on a dark storyline filled with dark secrets, terrifying creatures, and moral dilemmas. The story unfolds subtly and immersively, keeping you on the edge of your seat.\n\nWhat makes \"Amnesia: The Dark Descent\" unique is its focus on the player's vulnerability. You're not equipped with powerful weapons to face threats; you have to hide, run, and use your wits to survive! This lack of direct combat makes every encounter with lurking creatures extremely tense and frightening.\n\nThe dark, detailed graphics, along with eerie lighting, create an immersive atmosphere in the castle.

If you are a horror gamer, then this game is truly a must play, even if just for nostalgia purposes.

These white-knuckle feelings make the puzzles just feel a bit more challenging and rushed and the world all that more intimidating (in a good way). Combined with the Insanity system in the game (be sure to avoid the darkness and staring at the denizens of the dark) Amnesia does a fantastic job at keep the gamer on their toes, keeping an eye on their matches and peaking around each corner.\n\nFinal thoughts, Amnesia delivers a very dark and grisly story line with obviously dated, but still nicely (in a horror sense) done visuals. The real compelling draw for Amnesia is the amazing atmospheric horror elements, art direction, ambiance, and the brilliant use of the insanity system making the gamer truly feel pressured and rushed making any \"loot goblin\" and explorer sweat as they try to explore each corner of the mansion.

Now, ca 10 years later, I thought I should give it another try and I must say it was fun, although I didn't really need a second pair of underwear this time.\n\nThe game has a nice atmosphere and the story still works well. I enjoyed the overall Lovecraftian feel of the story. Sadly I must add that I might have been ruined over the years by playing too many horror games to still feel scared while playing Amnesia. Some of the scenes are just too familiar from other games (which were most likely inspired by Amnesia) and the enemies aren't that frightening after a while of playing as they all behave the same. The concept of sanity is a great idea and it adds a lot to the whole atmosphere. In terms of puzzles, they are relatively straightforward and never too hard to hinder you in any way. I was actually quite surprised how quickly the game was over as I repeatedly felt like I had missed some item but was still able to get to the next chapter. Nevertheless this game really is worth the time and also from a technical point of view works well. I would definitely would recommend it if you're somewhat new to horror games or if you want to dive into a real classic. \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1668621636, "timestamp_updated": 1668621636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125559237": {"recommendationid": "125559237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086672031", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1668664278}, "language": "english", "review": "Good atmosphere, good voice work, ok puzzles.

It has a great atmosphere and environments, even if it mostly plays out in a big castle. The level design is great, both in how the levels are organized and their layout.\nSound design is great, which is critical for horror games. The graphics may be a bit outdated, but they\u2019re still good overall. The story is good, and will keep you engaged until the game\u2019s conclusion, which takes some hours to beat.\nEnemy encounters are scary but fair. The puzzles can be a bit annoying, but they aren\u2019t hard. It has a nice difficulty, not being too easy or too hard. You need to find and manage some resources, encouraging exploration.\nIt\u2019s just a well thought and designed game from beginning to end, although some elements aren\u2019t as good when looked back in retrospect. But don\u2019t forget the game was released way back in 2010!\nThe game also includes achievements, including beating it on hard mode, which requires proper planning and patience, and playing Justine, a short expansion. Justine is a short game with a different story, that you must beat in one sitting, and can\u2019t die.\nThe game also includes Remember, which are 5 short, written stories in a PDF file, and officially supports mods with custom stories that you can download and play as well.\nHowever, given its age, it\u2019s a bit expensive, but definitely grab it on sale and play it if you haven\u2019t already.", "timestamp_created": 1668337699, "timestamp_updated": 1668337699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125397436": {"recommendationid": "125397436", "author": {"steamid": "76561199336634711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1668725270}, "language": "english", "review": "dark thriller", "timestamp_created": 1668326447, "timestamp_updated": 1668326447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125387687": {"recommendationid": "125387687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063104183", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1668352739}, "language": "spanish", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1668309168, "timestamp_updated": 1668309168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125375168": {"recommendationid": "125375168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202753720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1668395470}, "language": "english", "review": "pee", "timestamp_created": 1668289418, "timestamp_updated": 1668289418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125372886": {"recommendationid": "125372886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050740571", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 973, "last_played": 1604435606}, "language": "english", "review": "What's left to be said?

[/h1]\n\n\"Amnesia: The Dark Descent\" takes you down a road to horrors worse than death, and while you shuffle through the corridors of the old, decrepit manor of Bennenburg, you'll find yourself losing more than your sanity. \n\nIn this amazing start to an amazing series, you take on the role of Daniel... an amnesiac who wakes up in castle Bennenburg with one sole purpose; recover his memory and escape that horrid, 14th century place with his mind intact. He soon figures he can telepathically communicate with a person called Alexander... who he'll soon realize, is not even human. \n\nGraphically, you can't expect much from a game made back in the 2000s; however, for its purpose, it delivers, horrifically so! The gameplay entails that you are completely defenseless against the Gatherers, Alexander's monstruous servants that roam the halls of the manor... and your only two weapons are the shadows, and your feet. You get two \"health meters\", one is your actual health and one is your sanity. Let me explain how these function: If you get slapped by a Gatherer, you lose health... Normally two slaps would end you, but sometimes you can escape after just that one first, really hurtful slap lol. Of course, by that point you'll have had a jumpscare and a heart attack, but after escaping make sure you hide in the shadows where the gatherer cannot see you with his cross-eyed dumb face. The insanity meter decreases when you look at horrid things; looking for a long period of time at a pile of eviscerated bodies, for example, will take quite the toll on your insanity! Looking at the Gatherers is itself quite scary. When you lose all of your health, you die, but when you lose all of your insanity, you will lay in the floor and all nearby Gatherers WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE... You can still escape them though! Get it?\n\nThe game also comes with a great, albeit quite short DLC called Justine that recounts the horrible deeds some Victorian Feminazi did to her suitors... but that's another story altogether. Furthermore, the game appearently comes with a book set in the Amnesia universe, written by Mikael Hedberg... I printed it out and started reading it every day at 2 in the morning... Man, I gotta say, it's the best DLC one could ever have to a horror game! Now let's talk about why this game gets a [b]7/10[/b] in my book. The puzzles are too easy to figure out... Now hold on, hold on! I can already see a ton of fans adding me to tell me how BS that is, but it's true! I figured out the most difficult puzzle in the entire game (making Agrippa's potion) simply by looking at Daniel's notes, and nothing else. That's still not enough for a score of 7? Try the game's CRASHING everytime you alt-tab... The game crashed like a million times while I was playing it, worse yet it did when I hadn't saved in ten minutes of gameplay.\n\nI recommend all horror fans to play this game as the occasional jumpscares will keep you on your toes. Also if you like being chased in videogames, this is for you. I mean, there is nothing better in the entire world... than being chased by a couple of demonic figures, with their jaws falling off...

The game features a protagonist named Daniel exploring a dark and foreboding castle called Brennenburg, while trying to maintain his sanity by avoiding monsters and unsettling events.\n \n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]About[/th]\n        [th]Description[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udcbeGraphics[/td]\n        [td]The graphics are still good and hold up well. The atmosphere is absolutely terrifying and done perfectly. You truly feel like you are stuck in this cold, dark castle alone. The visuals are dark, and have a classic medieval feel to it (well you are in a castle). The monster design is pretty spooky although it\u2019s not the scariest thing I've seen in a horror game, but it does a good job on setting fear into you which is a big plus for me. One huge complaint is the motion blue. It\u2019s so bad in this game. It triggers when you are in fear and it gives me motion sickness. Luckily you can turn this off in the settings.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfaeGameplay[/td]\n        [td]The gameplay is pretty simple here. You have to conserve your light source and find oil and tinder to light up parts of the castle. The puzzles are actually pretty clever and can be challenging at times which is great to see. You also have amazing environmental storytelling in this game, being able to hear what happened in certain rooms can be somewhat also visually telling if you imagine the scenario. You do have a sanity meter as well, so if you have a weird motion blur or any other visual/audio cues (or you can check your meter), then you are vulnerable to the monster as you are more likely to be found.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udcdcStory[/td]\n        [td]This is a story about Daniel and not having any memory of why he is there. Through the story you will find more about yourself and some scary twists through the game. It\u2019s actually a really good story, just make sure to read the journals and documents because that\u2019s how you will learn more about the plot (which may turn off some people, but I enjoyed it). This was actually a pretty good story, not the best but it\u2019s a great one that feels pretty unique.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd5bPlaytime[/td]\n        [td]This game took me about 13 hours to complete. You also have an extra expansion called \u201cJustine\u201d in the game for free which adds like an hour with some replayability to it.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfa7Sound[/td]\n        [td]The ambient sounds can be really scary. From distant screaming and unheard of noises in the distance can make you really paranoid. The monster in the \u201cJustine\u201d DLC sounds really terrifying. I did not like the soundtrack in this game, because it's pretty repetitive and can get annoying, taking you out of the experience.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u2757Bugs\u2757[/td]\n        [td]One annoying bug is the odd frame drops you may see in this game. If you Alt+Tab and join back it can lag your game. Even sometimes reading a document can cause this or an event trigger. It doesn\u2019t last long (thankfully) so it\u2019s not game breaking. The other weird bug is when the monster kills you and you load back a save, the monster disappears which feels like an exploit or could just be a rare bug (I did have this twice on my playthrough).[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd05Performance[/td]\n        [td]The game runs pretty well, the only problem is the annoying bug I mentioned above. Besides that issue. This is an older game so it should run fine on your system if you have the required specs for the game. It\u2019s pretty well optimized (besides the bug of course).[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u2714\ufe0fPro\u2019s[/td]\n        [td][list]\n[*]Incredible atmosphere\n[*]Terrifying monsters\n[*]Intriguing story\n[*]Bone chilling ambiance\n[*]Multiple Endings\n[*]Creepy location (A Castle)\n[*]Clever puzzles\n[*]Spooky visuals\n[*]Environmental storytelling\n[/list]\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u274cCon\u2019s[/td]\n        [td][list]\n[*]Weird frame drops (possible bug)\n[*]Ambient soundtrack is repetitive and gets old fast\n[*]Horrible motion blur settings (can cause motion sickness)\n[*]Physics Based interactions can cause some odd mouse maneuvers\n[*]Bug where if you die on a chase sequence, the monster disappears and is not chasing you\n[/list]\n[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfc6Rating[/td]\n        [td]8/10\nThis game is worth full price.

The story was really interesting and pretty unique in my opinion. Amnesia: The Dark Descent really went above my expectations and delivered something truly special for me as a horror fan. The puzzles were pretty annoying and some were clever and good.

El jugador asume que el \u00fanico modo de perdurar en un ambiente hostil y terror\u00edfico es con la ayuda de las armas, y de aqu\u00ed en adelante todo se reduce a cuan grande es el arma que desbloqueas. En un tiempo en el que el survival horror es cada vez m\u00e1s como una pel\u00edcula de acci\u00f3n, Amnesia: The Dark Descent vuelve a las ra\u00edces del concepto llev\u00e1ndonos al horror psicol\u00f3gico de un protagonista vulnerable, sin opci\u00f3n de pelear, siendo su rol el de una presa que debe escapar para ganar todo el tiempo posible. Este principio de jugabilidad se combina con un ambiente sombr\u00edo y desolado, transitando entre castillos del siglo XIX, misteriosas criptas del norte de \u00c1frica, sistemas de ca\u00f1er\u00edas, morgues, prisiones y sangrientos lugares de culto, mezclando ficci\u00f3n con realidad en una narrativa casi literaria. El gameplay es de reglas simples, pero su dificultad viene en parte de la continua tensi\u00f3n de enemigos que persiguen, lo que es especialmente frustrante en dificultades altas, pero al final logra entregar lo que promete.\n\nLos ambientes son variados, pero envueltos en una sensaci\u00f3n de claustrofobia en la cual la oscuridad ambiental es el factor principal. La mayor\u00eda de los lugares no pueden ser bien explorados sin una l\u00e1mpara de gas, y los sonidos de los alrededores, cargados de cortinas musicales inquietantes, pueden ser tanto una fuente de orientaci\u00f3n como de ansiedad. Uno de los puntos fuertes de Amnesia TDD es el gran nivel de interacci\u00f3n con m\u00faltiples objetos, algunos cuidadosamente dise\u00f1ados y llenos de simbolismos hist\u00f3ricos o aspectos que contribuyen a la trama. Los modelos de los enemigos son grotescos, dise\u00f1ados no para una apreciaci\u00f3n detallada, sino que para una repulsi\u00f3n que haga mantenerse alejado. Durante la mayor parte del juego, la transici\u00f3n entre paisajes es fluida y puede cautivar a los jugadores m\u00e1s curiosos por varias horas.\n\nHay visiones encontradas sobre la trama. Algunos pueden pensar que falla en mantener el inter\u00e9s del jugador dado lo confusa que es, mientras otros piensan que aunque es buena no logra intensidad. Para m\u00ed, la historia se entrega tan bien como podr\u00eda esperarlo de un juego de horror de un jugador. Lleno de puzles, misterios y revelaciones repentinas, la historia tiene una narrativa no lineal pensada para ser reconstruida pieza por pieza a partir de dispersas notas escritas por el protagonista con asombrosa narrativa y sentimiento. Se siente como leer p\u00e1ginas de un libro escrito por un individuo aproblemado, lleno de miedos, arrepentimientos y deseos de venganza que lo ponen al borde de la locura. M\u00e1s a\u00fan, dentro de los archivos del juego se pueden encontrar fascinantes historias cortas que contribuyen considerablemente a una comprensi\u00f3n m\u00e1s amplia de la trama y que pueden resultar de inter\u00e9s por m\u00faltiples horas.\n\nLa jugabilidad es el aspecto m\u00e1s distintivo de Amnesia TDD y, en general, de la mayor\u00eda de los t\u00edtulos de Frictional Games. Un protagonista indefenso es lanzado a un mundo de horrores sin armas y con iluminaci\u00f3n limitada, debiendo navegar cuidadosamente evitando peligrosos enemigos que act\u00faan como incansables depredadores. Es as\u00ed de simple. Sin embargo, hay una mec\u00e1nica con directo impacto en la supervivencia y que se relaciona a la psicolog\u00eda del protagonista como narrador de su historia: la cordura. Mientras m\u00e1s baja la cordura, m\u00e1s distorsionado es el entorno, m\u00e1s asustado est\u00e1 el protagonista y m\u00e1s probabilidad hay de ser encontrado y asesinado por los enemigos. Mantener la cordura requiere estar malabare\u00e1ndose entre estar cerca de \u00e1reas con luz, mantenerse alejado de los enemigos y resolver puzles desafiantes, pero no demasiado dif\u00edciles. Si bien es innovadora e interesante en dificultades casuales, la cordura puede volverse f\u00e1cilmente una mec\u00e1nica frustrante en modo dif\u00edcil, considerando que cuando baja a cero tu personaje est\u00e1 muerto y debes volver a partir de un punto quiz\u00e1s muy atr\u00e1s en el tiempo. Otro aspecto mejorable del juego son las interacciones con obst\u00e1culos y movimiento del jugador que a veces se siente inc\u00f3modo, llevando a peque\u00f1os y torpes errores que la mayor\u00eda de las veces son fatales. Esto junto con la imperiosa necesidad de juntar yesqueros en modo dif\u00edcil pueden hacer sentir el juego como una rutina, ser artificialmente dif\u00edcil y molesto, y casi imposible de jugar sin una gu\u00eda (lo que por supuesto le quita toda la inmersi\u00f3n y el desaf\u00edo). Sin embargo, debe rescatarse el potencial de rejugabilidad a trav\u00e9s del DLC Justine (que tiene una corta pero interesante historia) y las historias personalizadas que abren un mundo de posibilidades fabricadas por el jugador que son amigables para desarrollar al igual que en grandes t\u00edtulos como Half-Life.\n\nAmnesia TDD definitivamente no es un juego para todos, dado lo terror\u00edfico que puede ser o lo aburrido que puede ser percibido si se aguantan los elementos de horror. Sin embargo, pienso que le da un nuevo aire al cada vez m\u00e1s trillado g\u00e9nero del survival horror con ambiente evocativos, narrativa ejemplar y jugabilidad desafiante.\n", "timestamp_created": 1667105914, "timestamp_updated": 1667105914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124632582": {"recommendationid": "124632582", "author": {"steamid": "76561199196348843", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 518, "last_played": 1692506164}, "language": "english", "review": "I only played it because I wanted to be like @Bromonger", "timestamp_created": 1667100899, "timestamp_updated": 1667100899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124631806": {"recommendationid": "124631806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321598567", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1667064932}, "language": "english", "review": "not bad. pretty scary", "timestamp_created": 1667099795, "timestamp_updated": 1667099795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124626895": {"recommendationid": "124626895", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992604921", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1698371364}, "language": "english", "review": "Good.", "timestamp_created": 1667092412, "timestamp_updated": 1667092412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124622640": {"recommendationid": "124622640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251700722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 950, "last_played": 1667090435}, "language": "english", "review": "Heart-Pounding Horror Adventure with Intricate Puzzles and a Mysterious Underlying Lore. 10/10 played again...and again... xD", "timestamp_created": 1667085770, "timestamp_updated": 1667085770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124619886": {"recommendationid": "124619886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201163850", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1667081801}, "language": "english", "review": "not even scary (i shat myself)", "timestamp_created": 1667081911, "timestamp_updated": 1667081911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124611253": {"recommendationid": "124611253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110571930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2615, "last_played": 1667106986}, "language": "english", "review": "Great pacing, Great story, still holds up after many years.", "timestamp_created": 1667072335, "timestamp_updated": 1667072335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124607718": {"recommendationid": "124607718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144770869", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6380, "last_played": 1685217586}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic.

Manage them better.\nYou knew an enemy was nearby but you ran carelessly around the corner without even leaning to check? Take your time to hear enemies & maybe crouch more often.\n& balancing is not an easy thing to do in games, especially in Horror.\nSome Indie Horror games can be absolute bull$&@! where it\u2019s too crushingly difficult to the point of an unfair advantage like having an intentional chase sequence, but you are barely given any room to hide.\nBut some Horror games can be too easy where you can run past enemies like they\u2019re a sack of bricks, or you are given so much health to the point of fearing damage is gone.\nSeeing this so perfectly accomplished in Amnesia genuinely impressed me & depressed me for the fact so many games with good potential get this wrong.\n- The story has a perfect balance between story & gameplay.\nThe story goes seamlessly with the gameplay, not always removing you from progress in an obnoxious fashion, but instead working together through a mix of intriguing & easily comprehensible notes, and occasional visual storytelling through disturbing implications shown in the environments\n- The story itself.\nThe story had me roped in from the very beginning, from when the protagonist Daniel stumbles out, seeming very shaken & disturbed, but without memory.\nAnd of course up til you start piecing together why he is here through all the notes & environmental implications he finds.\nEven though you don\u2019t even I guess properly see other NPC characters throughout the whole game, the voices alone that you hear through the memories & seeing the notes written by others exudes so much personality you can easily grasp.\nAlexander maybe one of the greatest Horror villains perhaps in just Horror fiction in general, into the grand sphere of both Horror games, films, & novels.\nHe is somehow both charismatic, hatable, disturbed, disturbingly confident, & disturbingly trustworthy-sounding all at once through how he talks & the way he words things.\nOverall, it is a very very disturbing but fascinating structurally solid story with an unmatched pace.\n- The gameplay.\nI used to not be a big fan of Walking Sim or rather Horror games where you are unable to defend yourself, I always gave out unfair judgement of how it would be boring being unable to fight back or be too unfair.\nBut this game not only proved me wrong, but actually made me even more interested in Defenseless Horror games.\nFunny enough, Amnesia was actually once planned in development to include a Bow & Arrow and even a Flintlock Pistol at some point, while that sounds fun on paper.\nAmnesia ultimately is a better game without the ability to defend yourself.\nIt truly immerses you into the feeling of utter terror being unable to defend yourself when all you can do is run & hide, & while that in itself sounds like a repetitious concept, Amnesia does it very well where it cuts back on the commonly boring aspect of waiting around until an enemy goes away, in turn for having the enemy walk away quicker than it usually would.\n& the thing is, this in canon makes sense, as terrifying as The Gatherers are in Amnesia, they are not exactly intelligent creatures, & that makes sense, they\u2019re mangled up hideous abominations that were likely man-made & imperfect cause of that, they have the psychology of an infant where if an infant no longer sees a person who is hiding, they believe they don\u2019t exist.\n& while that makes them sound like pushovers, believe it or not, it doesn\u2019t.\nThese enemies are still terrifying & can DESTROY you if you are not careful around them, they maybe limited psychologically, but you are also limited to their claustrophobic environment, so in a way, you are leveled on their playing field.\nThis is kind of random, but I also really enjoy the way the game controls, it really brings a fun degree of interactivity to drag your mouse to interact with certain contraptions without coming off as gimmicky.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like:\n- \u2026.\n\nHonestly, I was never frustrated with this game, I didn\u2019t have a moment where I called bullshit on a death, I didn\u2019t have a moment where I found a glaring plot hole in the story, & I never crashed or glitched once.\nI will admit, a couple of the puzzles & objectives could be a tiny bit cryptic, but honestly, that is moreso my fault because I kinda suck at puzzles.\nSo I won\u2019t count it against the game.\n\nWith that, I\u2019d give this game a \ud83d\udc4d+\nEven if you aren\u2019t a Horror game nut like I am, I still believe you should give this game a try.\n\nTL;DR\nIT\u2019S A REALLY WELL BALANCED INTENSE SURVIVAL HORROR EXPERIENCE WITH A HIGHLY-DISTURBING BUT ENGAGING PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR MYSTERY STORY, MANY REALLY HEART ATTACK-INDUCING SCARY MOMENTS & MANY #&$!UP STORY MOMENTS.\nSERIOUSLY IF YOUR KID

It took me a whole year for this...but hey, at least I didn't completely abandon it?\n\nAnyways, Amnesia doesn't require any introduction, it was a pioneer among Horror Walking Simulators. Back in the day - it was one of the creepiest shlt you'd ever encounter. And to be fair - it still holds up. Atmosphere and overall...Immersiveness - are Top Notch. It just makes you feel that you're indeed in that Damned Castle. YouTubers of different caliberes and IQs made this game extremely popular, so its no surprise that this game is still relevant and also - gave birth to a lot of titles throughout the years...\n\nBut enough story.\n\n[h1]Actual Content[/h1]\n\nYou wake up in a long hallway, cant remember a thing, do not understand what the hell is going on...and neither is your character - Daniel. All you know - that the place is not cozy at all, kinda spooky and you need to get out of here. The problem is, your character is a wuss - scared of everything,  AND I MEAN - EVERYTHING. So it makes things tougher for the player. Also, there's a certain entity that wants you Dead - so there's that.\n\nLight up everything, look for \"batteries\" for your Lantern, hide/run from monsters, deduce puzzles and make your way to the very depths of the castle - to choose one of three endings.\n\nAll of this is accompanied with Well-Aged visuals, immersive audio and music, and an okay-ish plot.\n\n[h1]A little of something-something More...[/h1]\n\nThere's also DLC - Justine (which is kinda tough to even launch actually), which I have never played before. And to be fair, it sucked. It promised a lot at the start - but in the end - be prepared for a run with No Saves, Instant Crash if you died, and a kinda stupid plot twist. If that DLC were standalone - I'd give it a Negative for sure. Although Portal Reference was nice.\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\nHard Mode was added, basically - its Ultra-Nighmare mode from DOOM2016 but in Amnesia, resources are scarce, monsters one-shot you, and if you die - back to the start. Also, if your Sanity Meter is gone - you die also. And the only way to save - is to waste 4 \"batteries\". Welp. \n\nTruly a maso...I mean Fan Experience Only.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nCult Horror at its best, fun to replay from time to time, also mods and new features are nice.

Every flashback and storypoint always had me on board waiting to find out what's next, and why you are trying to do what you are trying to do. Next, the gameplay is f*cking awesome. I love the lamp mechanic, the sanity, inventory, and tinderboxes. Finally the atmosphere. I really liked it. A lot of the rooms you went into, you could hear footsteps above you or next to you and it really made me scared to have to enter that room next.

Even with its dated graphics, they still look really good.\n\nThe story may go over your head if you're always too scared while playing. But it's a really well developed story. Take your time, don't rush it.\n\nThe object mechanics are on point. You are able to grab most objects, rotate them and throw them giving a bigger sense of freedom.

sort of Gothic Lovecraftian nightmare where explaining even some of the most basic plot details is a massive spoiler, so I am just going to leave this comedic commentary on gameplay and aesthetics instead. \n\nBeware: humor lies ahead! Also, some minor early game story spoilers.\n\nDear Daniel: Have you ever wanted to do a hands-on study of the intersection between occultism, 19th century torture methods, and gothic architecture? No? Well too bad, Danny Boy, because you are waking up in Castle Brennenberg University with a terrible case of amnesia and being forcefully enrolled in our hippest new class, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, anyway. In your journey with this wondrous class you will do an in-depth exploration of the world's most architecturally unstable classic Gothic castle, along the way solving devious puzzles and desperately hiding and running away from shrek's uglier (and more violent) cousins, who have all the pleasantness and perceptiveness of a sack of worms. Oh, and the whole time you are being hunted by what can only be described as an especially relentless form of wall-crawling acne. In your travels you will find various notes left left by your pre-amnesiac in miraculously perfect order to tell the narrative of how you came to be in the most haunted corner of the Earth.  \n\nDuring your time in this class you will constantly find yourself losing your marbles, due to events including but not limited to: hearing mysterious tormented screams echoing throughout the castle, experiencing vague trauma flashbacks half the times you open a door, the wind blowing out your torch for 27th time, gawking at corpses, fondling instruments of torture for no good reason (seriously, what is wrong with you?), looking at the Shreks, hiding in the darkness so you don't look at the shreks, and, my personal favorite, hallucinations caused by how many marbles you have lost already. \n\nYour professor for this class will be Alexander, the Duke of Brennenberg, an expert in classic Gothic villainy with a voice to match (some say he studied under Count Dracula himself!). The Teaching Assistant for your class section will be a poorly cleaned iron maiden in the center of a poorly lit room, which you can decide to shove yourself in for no good reason (it's not going to further the plot or bring any sort of reward, but now that I have told that you can you are going to do it anyway because you can, you senseless dolt). For your final project in this class your pre-amnesiac self has chosen for you to take bloody vengeance against your professor, Alexender of Brennenberg, for reasons that are still a mystery for you. You will learn more about that from the notes your pre-amnesiac self littered around the castle, each of which raise far more questions than they do answers. \n\nSo, what are you waiting for, loser? Grab your textbook the conventions of Gothic and Lovecraftian narrative conventions, a disturbing quantity of laudanum to numb the constant state of pain you will be in, and faintly flickering lantern that keeps running out of oil and go descend into the depths of Castle Brennenberg. No seriously, get going, or else the demon acne is going to cause the building to fall in on itself with you in it. What are you waiting fo...

This game was very ahead of its time despite the fact that it had an extremely small developer team and was limited by what games were capable of at the time. Against all odds, this game made an insanely huge impact on the survival horror genre and set the framework for many other amazing games that would come out in later years. It's also very nostalgic for me as many youtubers I grew up watching started out playing games like Amnesia and other horror games. With that said I already had a rough idea of the story playing it myself now but it did not take away from the experience much. The story is still pretty solid and has an interesting way of slowly revealing Daniel's memories  by scattering his diary entries around various rooms in the Brennenburg Castle, which is by far one of the most iconic locations in video games. Many have tried to replicate the eerie medieval look in other horror games but it's never quite had the same impact as this game. Another thing worth mentioning about this game is its enemies, they're pretty intimidating and require mostly stealth gameplay to play around, but there's always that risk you could take of breaking into a sprint in attempts to reach a new area or safe spot before it catches you. I find this cat and mouse style gameplay very effective to this day. The gameplay mixed with the disturbing models (The Grunts being the most recognizable) create a very suspenseful experience. To sum up my thoughts I really love this game and think that anyone who's even remotely a fan of survival horror should check it out even if there's currently no remake or modernized versions.

In Amnesia, we get 2 sources of light, from candles and torches that you light with matches those however don't give too much of light, and our main source of light that you'll use thought the entirety of game Oil Lamp, that requires oil to fuel and oil is stored in our inventory where also all our necessary to progress the game items are.\n\n[h1][b][i][u] Story [/u][/i][/b][/h1]\nThe story of the game is one of the bigger positives, it's intriguing, scary and fueled with twists.

"review": "I've edited my original review as I feel this game is still worth playing through at least once, especially for the atmosphere, but it is drastically overrated. \n\nIt's telling when in the achievements section of the game, less than 10% of players actually beat it, but felt free to review it. This is not an overwhelmingly positive in my book man\n\nIt doesn't compare to the more modern suspense/horror games, and it doesn't even compare to the older ones (Fear 2005, Dead Space 2008, Silent Hill 1999...)\n\nThe game starts with a lingering intensity. Some of the puzzles can be really satisfying, and the layout of the castle itself is almost beautiful in some areas. The sanity meter is also a really unique idea! \n\nBut all of those pros fade after the first hour or two. Any semblance of intensity or atmosphere fades after you spend hours back tracking through the same areas running out of oil and tinder-boxes. Frustrating. \nIn the latter half of the game, the monsters are not scary at ALL. They are purely frustrating, and serve as an annoying roadblock to your objectives, nothing more or less. You really start wishing you could pick up a saw or something and just fight back but \"Huehue my sanity cough cough.\"\n\nThis final gripe is totally subjective, but I'll leave it here either way. (Spoilers) The torture rooms, dude. I did not need to know any of the shit they threw in there. Absolutely gratuitous. Adding a section where we show a demonstration of a woman getting her bones broken and subsequently raped (or suggested) is COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. Hearing screams of dying children in the final cut-scenes... it just made me want to turn the game off. I've played my fair share of horror games, but there's an important difference between real aesthetic experiences, and torture porn. Joseph Campbell described this kind of art (shock, visual) as pornography, and that's what it is.

I understand why this game has been loved by many people. \n\n[h1] Amnesia: The Dark Descent [/h1]\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent's story is an interesting one. The monsters are certainly creepy and they are made even more terrifying by the fact that you are unable to fight them. Your only choices are to run away or hide. Although, I should say [i] technically [/i] you can't fight them as you are able to stagger them for a brief second by throwing an object at them. The pacing is pretty good as the story doesn't feel rushed. The Dark Descent certainly presents an eerie tone quite early on.\n\nThis game is also interesting by the fact that you are able to pickup and interact with a good majority of objects in the game and it's mechanic for how you use/interact with said objects with your mouse or controller. For example, when the game makes you do the rotating motion with your mouse or analog stick to turn a valve. I like when games do that. Makes them feel more interactive.\n\nThe Dark Descent is made even more enjoyable because you can play custom stories that other people have made or you can even make your own. There are some decent custom stories out there. Unfortunately, the lack of Steam Workshop support does mean you have to go out and find them, but it's not too hard to find any. You can just google \"[b] Amnesia Custom Stories [/b]\" and you will most likely find a link to sites like [b] moddb [/b] where you can find custom stories or some other mods for the game. Overall, Amnesia: The Dark Descent was a fun and chilling experience.\n\n[h1] Amnesia: Justine [/h1]\nI also have played through Amnesia: Justine. It was definitely a fun extra little story to play through. I say little quite literally as Justine is quite short compared to the main game. Justine takes roughly around an hour to complete.

OK. Mediocre. Although this game was supposedly revolutionary (and extremely scary) when it was first released, it doesn\u2019t seem that amazing to me now. I found this to be a moderately creepy game with several weaknesses which sabotage its attempts at being truly terrifying. It is also irritating how this game has some of its content hidden instead of obviously displaying this content in its main menu.\n\nNotes:\nThis game\u2019s files include hidden content which is easy to overlook. This game includes a fairly short, playable story called Amnesia: Justine with additional Steam achievements and some short stories in a .pdf file. There is also developer content and concept sketches which can be unlocked in the game\u2019s files using a password obtained in 3 parts by looking at the bottom of the screen after each of the game\u2019s 3 endings.\n\nI found out about most of this content here (for safety\u2019s sake, don\u2019t click on ANY link inside steam, copy it into a browser instead):\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/57300/discussions/0/846957366831964138/?ctp=3\n\nI found out about the developer content and concept sketches here:\nhttps://amnesia.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Secret_file_(The_Dark_Descent)\n\n\nThis game reminds me of:\n\n+Kholat (during the parts where stuff is chasing you).\n+INFRA (due to the general complexity and type of puzzles involved and during those times when you are down in sewers near poisonous mushrooms; a possible reference to Amnesia).\n+Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers (This version of Shadowgate had a similar color palette (dark and dingy) but had more obtuse puzzles but doesn\u2019t get as dark or violent as Amnesia).\n-Agony: UNRATED (Agony, like Amnesia, has an unhealthy fascination with torture).\n\n\nWhat I thought about this game:\n\n+ Great sound effects which put you on edge.\n\n+ Unlike many other horror games, this one was not frustrating.\n\n+ Responsive controls which recognized an additional gaming mouse button (though the key configuration menu didn\u2019t know what to call it and so left the space blank when it was assigned).\n\n+ No major bugs.\n\n+ I don\u2019t want to give anything away but I love how the environment and your perceptions change a little bit when your character\u2019s sanity is low.\n\n+/- The plot is sort of creepy but not extremely because your main antagonist is, afterall, just a man (and this is not much of a spoiler because you know this from the beginning of the game). The game takes place in the early 19th century and, well, men can be killed pretty easily. His castle has stairs. Toss him down some and it will look to the doofus police investigators of the time that it was an accident. I bet stuff like this probably happened a LOT in those days. There\u2019s some supernatural stuff going on but, while it looks like a spreading mess, it doesn\u2019t really look creepy. It just looks like a mess some poor servant is going to have to clean up. It would\u2019ve been better (and less confusing) if the \u2018shadow\u2019 following you really looked like an impenetrable shadow which no amount of light could dispel.\n\n+/- Good puzzles which are not too obtuse but not overly easy either. Unfortunately there are some red-herring puzzle solutions here and there (like a room full of boxes which I could move but which I didn\u2019t need to) and there are times when it can be hard to know what the game wants you to do next.\n\n+/- Dark and dingy colors attempt to make the game creepy but also make it boring to look at in many places. The colors also often seemed calming and comfortable to me and so reduced my tension even when it was dark (but then I also tend to find darkness to be calming rather than creepy).\n\n+/- This game is fairly linear. You don\u2019t usually feel lost because there are too few options concerning where you can go. Any place you don\u2019t need to go or shouldn\u2019t go to soon are almost always blocked off. Sometimes you need to travel to the same area repeatedly (which is realistic). I never felt lost or scared of getting lost in a hostile environment and so I never felt out-of-control.\n\n+/- I liked the classic idea of exploring a creepy castle but there wasn\u2019t enough evidence of a (perhaps blighted) family life from an earlier time. The setting wasn\u2019t detailed enough to seem real but instead felt oddly generic.\n\n+/- The music is good for the game but not extremely interesting in itself. I wouldn\u2019t try to get a soundtrack of it.\n\n+/- Amnesia\u2019s voice acting is mediocre. The spoken dialogue reminds me of character-stereotypes in Disney movies. You can tell the game\u2019s main antagonist is evil just by hearing his voice. This caused the game to lose any sense of grittiness and thus real danger. It felt too silly instead.\n\n+/- Amnesia has 3 endings but they depend entirely on what you do at the very end so it is easy to simply reload your save file repeatedly and get all 3 of them. The game\u2019s plot causes none of the endings to be very satisfying because by the end of the game you [spoiler]find out your character is a total douche and probably doesn\u2019t deserve to continue living[/spoiler]\n\n-The game didn\u2019t usually make me feel very weak or powerless. I can run fairly fast without getting tired. I almost always managed to have enough tinderboxes (basically matches) to light up anything I needed. I could move and throw heavy boxes and books around with ease (and I often did so). \n\n-Making lots of noise usually failed to attract monsters to my area unless they were already nearby. The monsters instead showed up in certain, fairly predictable locations or after I had obtained a critical item here and there. My biggest scares occurred when monsters appeared in rooms I did not expect to find them in and this only happened twice. \n\n- Running away from monsters and going just one room away and hiding behind a corner in the darkness was so extremely effective the monsters seemed laughably stupid. When they did catch me, the death scenes were not very creepy. I play a lot of games so I\u2019m used to dying in them. The deaths in Unreal Tournament 1999 are more gruesome and scary. Surprise me with a more unusual (and yet not irritating) experience. I\u2019m honestly not sure what would work well. Maybe instead of dying my character should get increasingly disfigured and crippled somehow, thus resulting in a worse ending later in the game.\n\n-In the final scene you can see the main antagonist\u2019s [spoiler]little tiny penis[/spoiler]. If you have a sense of humor similar to mine this will probably strike you as being sort of distracting, like seeing [spoiler]Dr. Manhattan\u2019s penis in Watchmen[/spoiler]. I mean, what exactly are you going to be looking at during this scene? At the very least, the antagonist, [spoiler]while channeling loads of throbbing, occult power, should have sported a huge, erect dong[/spoiler] instead.

One hailed as a horror classic and an important milestone in the genre.  It\u2019s not for me to say whether it is or isn\u2019t as its influence can be seen very clearly in modern horror games such as Outlast and Alien: Isolation.  At least these are the closest in terms of spirit and gameplay.  Many other horror games would pop out just from the simple success of Amnesia such as Slender and SCP, horror games as a whole got a big boost.\n\nSee this game didn\u2019t just kick off the survival horror with no weapons game it restarted the entire genre.\n\nThis game really makes me realize just how old I am.  Spoiler alert but the game isn\u2019t too scary, like at all.  Which surprised me.  I\u2019ve had this game for the better part of 8 years now collecting dust in my steam catalog.  I had tried a few times to play it but always got too scared and uninstalled it.  I had built it up for years as being too scary, only finally touching it again due to the game drought only to end up running through most of it.\n\nThe biggest problem is that enemies, the things that are supposed to scare you, will just despawn.  Unlike games like Alien and Outlast that have a wandering baddy at all times to keep you on edge you can hide and eventually the monster will just exit the area.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even take that long, only around a minute of waiting and pop, he\u2019s gone, leaving you to run around until you figure out the puzzle or progress to the next area.  And as long as you keep your sanity up you won\u2019t have to deal with him again, which is fairly easy as I ended the game with around 40 tinderboxes and a consistent 9 oil canisters.\n\nThen there are the puzzles themselves which are frustrating to no end.  It seems like most people had an easy walk with them but I spend 90% of the game running around trying to figure out puzzles rather than being afraid.  The problem is some puzzles use items like a point and click while others use physics props.\n\nIn two different parts you need to clog a gear to stop a machine, with the first one you stick a pipe from your inventory into it while the other one you physically throw a rock into it (despite having another piece of broken pipe in your inventory).  Or how some bridges are lowered with a lever while others just have a rock thrown at them.  It jumps between these two different mechanics often enough, constantly throwing off your thought process.   It can be very confusing and frustrating but then again that may just be my own stupidity.\n\nThe real saving grace of the game is its story and atmosphere which are both top notch.\n\nAll this seems to point to a game that is somewhat middling.  Doing some things right and some wrong, sort of evening out into this middle ground.  I mean if you make a horror game that\u2019s not scary you must have messed something up.  But what does this have to do with my age?\n\nWell, for some reason I got it into my head that this game came out in 2004 when it actually came out in 2010.  Quite a bit more recent than I had expected which made me less lenient on it.  I mean surely there had been good horror games before it at this point, right?  They may have repopularized it but surely there had been standouts before it that could better claim the title of revitalizing the horror genre.\n\nYou had Dead Space and\u2026  Silent hill though that was the early 2000s.  F.E.A.R. doesn\u2019t really count, nor Bioshock or Condemned.  Looking through the list of horror games post Amnesia is shockingly low and what is there isn\u2019t exactly scary.  Silent Hill 2 comes the closest but apart from that there is next to nothing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Amnesia that was behind a trend or just getting a lot of credit because of the famous people who played it.  It was me who was behind.  I\u2019ve grown old and I sort of just assumed this was one of those older games from the mid 2004.  I thought  Pewd\u2019s had just dug it up and popularized it.\n\nIt might be a bit clunky at parts and when compared to other games that came out in 2010 it\u2019s certainly not the best looking.  But there really isn\u2019t much like it before and still not much after.  It was really unique and set the precedent for horror games to come.\n\nI believe art should be seen through a lens of the time.  A game like Half Life is a masterpiece but it can\u2019t stand up to a game like Red Dead 2.  It can\u2019t be said that it\u2019s a worse game or less of a game due to the limitation of the time.  That\u2019s why they can both stand together as great games despite one being a huge, well polished experience and the other being a linear first person shooter.\n\nThat\u2019s why, despite its shortcomings, it is well worth a playthrough and I recommend you check it out.\n\n7/10 - Amnesia is a game that was even a little dated for the time in terms of visuals and gameplay but its impact on the medium, its excellent storytelling, and next to none atmosphere makes it stand out as one of the better titles to come out of 2010.", "timestamp_created": 1659045810, "timestamp_updated": 1661491346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578813016414642334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119601837": {"recommendationid": "119601837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355677685", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1658890189}, "language": "english", "review": "this game makes me hella nervous", "timestamp_created": 1658957548, "timestamp_updated": 1658957548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119529005": {"recommendationid": "119529005", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995768697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1389051119}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1658864865, "timestamp_updated": 1658864865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119527331": {"recommendationid": "119527331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010864418", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1032, "last_played": 1658863066}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

ultimamente\nEn terminos de comunidad, su comunidad es rara pero no toxica, es muy buena, y crean historias personalizadas y se pueden crear mapas personalizados en s\u00ed, aunque es muy dificil de hacerlas, el juego es muy mecanico y facil de aprender\nSu historia es hermosa, cancion, etc, personajes queridos, personajes odiables\nEn terminos de miedo o sustos, miedo aveces da, pero son situaciones no el monstruo en si ya que crea un concepto de que no es el monstruo que te sigue sino un enviado por la sombra (perdon por el spoiler)\nEn conclusion el juego es una locura de bueno, tiene sus bugs y fallos porque es viejo pero es muy bueno\n\nGraficamente: 8/10\nJugabilidad: 9/10\nTerror/Miedo/Suspenso: 10/10\nTrama/Historia: 9/10\nArte/Musica: 9/10\nAmbientacion/Creatividad de desarrolladores al crear escenarios unicos y originales: 10/10\n\nRecomendad\u00edsimo si queres adentrarte recien a los juegos de terror, es un outlast viejo en pocas palabras\nGracias por leer!\nPor

Se despierta en un tenebroso castillo en Brenenburg a mediados del a\u00f1o 1839 y debe descubrir su pasado, el por que esta en ese sitio, y y por que perdio la memoria. Postdata: TODO SE VA A LA CHINGADA XD\n\n  El castillo es un lugar infame, donde en muy pocos sitios te sentiras comodo y seguro, cada rincon del castillo es tenebroso, con zonas brutalmente oscuras y toda clase de terrores que esperan hacerte papilla o destruir tu cordura... Para rematar tienes una lampara de aceite a modo de linterna, muy limitada, y solo podras iluminar algunas zonas con yesqueros encendiendo las antorchas de los pasillos.\n\n  Si crees que conoces el concepto de OSCURIDAD en un juego, TE EQUIVOCAS!! Cuando juegues esto quedaras profundamente traumado con la oscuridad, pues este juego tiene zonas en total Penumbra, donde la sola incertidumbre de no saber que te espera en densa oscuridad en la que no puedes ver ni tu propia mano, es brutal y muy perturbadora... Este juego lleva unos cuantos niveles arriba este concepto.\n\n  CONCLUSION: COMPRALO SIN PENSARLO!!! este juego sabe como perturbarte de manera psicologica, e incluso para mi que soy inmune a estos juegos de tanto jugar este genero, este juego me ha traumado profundamente y me ha hecho saltar de la silla en mas de una ocasion.... ES UNA EXPERIENCIA DE OTRO NIVEL!!!\n\nUN ABRAZO Y GRACIAS POR LEER\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1657089660, "timestamp_updated": 1657089660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1,

with horror as you venture on. it was the first time i had felt this in a game. though to say this game wasn't as scary as i thought to be. its not a made to be scared game. but do not get me wrong, it is still a very horrifying game, and i remember getting jumpscared at least 5 times, and there is a very creepy sense of watchfulness as you play which is what brings this game's atmosphere to life.in terms of scariness i would give it a 5/10. but 10/10 for its absolute atmosphere which it brings. i think its very important that a game has its own atmosphere when it comes to gaming. it really makes it set out amongst the other reaching games.\n\nnow lets talk about its art. honestly for an 12 year old game, the game is honestly so beautiful. it gives you the mindset to explore every part thoroughly, everything looks so well designed. definitely recommend to those who love to explore its design and paths as they play. 9/10 for its time of design, love it. the design of this game ended up giving me mixed emotions while playing. because there are so many areas that i try to explore but then there is the fear of something horrific happening if i explore those paths, but its always worth it to check. this is the love i have for its art design, it pushes me to explore fully before moving ahead knowing an untainted wretch of demonic thirst could apply to those areas if i seek.\n\nfor the story of this game i wasn't a big fan for its entirety. it was confusing and i got the just of it through half of the game, for whats really happening. i don't know if its because i didn't pay attention properly or if i was dumb. but there is some lore which i really got excited about and it was very well put. for its entirety though id give a 4/10 personally. if the ending had been better it would have been way higher but it just didn't feel worth it. this game is a challenging game. i'm a very good puzzle solver but there was like 3 times i had to look at a walkthrough because there was parts of the game where there were ridiculous types of things you had to do to continue moving and the game doesn't hint what you are actually trying to do, but i think i came across that situation 2 times, it did take the fun away. however the feelings you get when you accomplish something is worth it.\n\ndo i recommend this game? 100 percent honestly i loved this game, it is enjoyable, an horrifying experience and lovely art design especially for its time. man it doesn't even feel like it was long ago. this game was definitely ahead of a lot of games at its time, and even now it is. \n", "timestamp_created": 1656877105, "timestamp_updated": 1656877121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

The Dark Descent was by far my favorite. While I did love all of the games, I found The Dark Descent to be the creepiest. I think a big part is that you're experiencing everything for the first time. For example, the concept of \"the shadow\" that follows you through out the game was much creepier to me in this game than in any of the other games, as I got used to it. The older graphics also play a big part in the creepiness, in my opinion. \n\nMy only complaint about the game is that some of the puzzles, towards the end, seem impossible to figure out on your own or would at least take a very long time to and would be very frustrating. Mainly a puzzle involving 2 bridges and then the one right before the ending which involved a lot of back tracking. I ended up looking up a walk through to help me get through it.

granting up to 3 points in 3 categories, as well as a last, single point from my own self, depending on my experience with it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nAmnesia is a First Person walking simulator with horror elements, however, surprisingly, it does not acutally fall into the trap often associated with horror games \u2013 that being the cheap jumpscare \u2013 and instead presents the Player with a very real sensation of dread.\n\nThat is achieved by making the Player Character (PC) incapable of fighting back, relatively slow and also very fragile, whilst also placing said PC in an environment that features entities that will assault the PC, will chase after it and will do their best to kill it.\n\nIn addition to that, the Player is provided a few tools to make it through \u2013 those being means of illuminating the world, as darkness actively makes playing the game harder by taking away responsiveness from the controls and smudging the screen.\n\nOn top of that, there are a number of puzzles that will need to be solved, though they are all quite simple and rudimentary \u2013 which is more than enough when coupled with the constant threat of an attack.\n\nIncredibly, while this might appear very simple and barebones, it has been mixed masterfully by the evelopers and has led into the creation of a fantastic set of scrambled eggs.\n3/3\n\nPRESENTATION\n\nAmnesia, as mentioned, fills the Player with dread \u2013 and that is not only achieved via the powerlessness of the PC, it is also done through the implementation of visuals and sounds. The game features  a 3D environment that is shrowded in shadow, with there being very few sources of light, which creates safe spaces \u2013 those that are illuminated \u2013 and dangerous zones \u2013 those that are not.\n\nThe dark spots are filled with the unknown and with uncertainty, which is inherently frightening. Then, that is coupled with the spectacular ambience (and the pronounced lack of music in most situations) to start building upon the Player\u2019s fright and unease, generating tension and dread.\n\nBy the time an enemy shows up, there is no loud pang of a piano or a strumming of strings \u2013 there is a slow, winding up screeching sound (or perhaps musical track) that grows in intensity, and there is the monster that appears out of nowhere, unsettling by merit of its uncanny appearance. In fact, all characters that show up in the game have this uncanny appearance which only elevates the sensation of unease that the Player is forced to experience.\n\nAs a horror game that features close to no jump-scares, Amnesia winds up being impressively well presented, instilling a phenomenal amount of dread into the Player that translates into proper horror. Lastly, the voice acting is also very competent.\n3/3\n\nSTORY\n\nAmnesia gives the Player a story about redemption, but also a story about ancient beings that were present in the obscure periods of human history. It presents a mystery that does not get entirely unraveled by the end of the story \u2013 if anything, the mystery only grows more interesting as the conclusion of the tale told by this game is reached \u2013 yet, at the same time, the questions that the Player happens to have at the start of the game are, mostly, answered.\n\nSo Amnesia gives the Player some satisfaction while also tickling them in a most scintillating manner, whilst also featuring a plethora of approaches to presenting the story \u2013 be it via notes, be it via memories, be it via small tidbits that show up every now and then, be it via visual transformations of the environment and, lastly, via the PC\u2019s actions themselves.\n3/3\n\nLegendary Point\n\nDoes this game get the legendary point, so craved and wanted by all and none at the same time? Does this game, which I\u2019ve so far been gently caressing and kissing gingerly in an effort to convey just how good it is, get the point? I mean\u2026 yes. 1/1\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n10/10. Wow. Maybe I didn\u2019t plan on giving this game a 10 when I played it, but now that I\u2019ve had it wallowing in my brain soup, I suppose the rough diamond it was has ended up polished to perfection. This game is phenomenal, and I\u2019d urge anyone with a strong enough stomach and an inclination to play games to play it. If not play it, watch someone play it, at least so that they can experience the story.\n\n I place it in a frame, surrounded by lights. As though it were upon a king\u2019s head on the day of his coronation, I extend my hands towards it, a wordless prayer on my lips. An achievement, undoubtedly, one that I can not fathom. And a copy of it I proudly tuck away under my belt, to be displayed as a treasure unlike any other.\n--\nREAD THE FULL REVIEW (Steam has a word limit) HERE: https://gemsimov.com/game-reviews/f/amnesia-the-dark-descent---a-review", "timestamp_created": 1654242173, "timestamp_updated": 1697299928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116409469": {"recommendationid": "116409469", "author": {"steamid": "76561199240270804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1654283447}, "language": "english", "review": "cool game if only it had more to give i beat it pretty quick", "timestamp_created": 1654234288, "timestamp_updated": 1654234288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116400885": {"recommendationid": "116400885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198866696968", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1691750771}, "language": "english", "review": "i forgor \ud83d\udc80", "timestamp_created": 1654215737, "timestamp_updated": 1654215737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116360078": {"recommendationid": "116360078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046007860", "num_games_owned": 1026, "num_reviews": 452, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 569, "last_played": 1566712411}, "language": "english", "review": "The OG psychological horror game for PC - if you like horror games then it's a must have for your library.

The game that pioneered the \"Let's play\" genre and made personas like PewDiePie into some of the most popular people online. Other than that the game popularized the run-and-hide horror genre (I consider this an advanced walking simulator with elements of survival horror). While not the best Survival Horror has to offer this game is a great example of great ambience and sound design. Although the story isn't something amazing but it is interesting enough to get you to the end of the game. \nThe highlights are the voice acting and the ambience and sound effects. This is something most horror games fail at and yet it is the most important part. Because it gives the game a \"soul\". You feel connected and immersed in the game, that way you get scared the most. The monster designs are alright, the most famous design is of the Servant Grunt and I've never considered them scary, even in 2010 when the game came out they looked like a pigman of some sort and they are mostly funny to me. Overall the game is solid. You have just enough resources to go by and enemy bahavior is consistent. The sfx and voice acting + music is great but other than the chasing the game doesn't provide with much scares, especially in subsequent playtroughs where you know their spawn locations. The other downside is the sanity mechanic which I never like in games when implemented in this way. It is just an annoyance. The story is alright but I consider the expansion far superior to the original game. The game is not long, you can beat it legit in under 4 hours but the highlight is early on in the game so the later parts become repetitive and kind of dissapointing compared to the first half. \nThe expansion is perfect because it is quite short. in about 30min you can complete it and in that time everything that is great about the original is condensed here. The entirety of the game is tense and the story is even better im my opinion. Also it has the scariest chase sequence I've ever seen in any game.

The formula was simple; strip all power from the player and force them to hide from the monsters.

Although the foundation is simple, there is complexity in the mechanics that is best left for the player to discover.\n\nA true horror in the making without expectation of big climactic cutscenes and endings; Amnesia instead, relies on sound, providing a permanent unsettling rumble as if the castle itself was moaning and groaning.
