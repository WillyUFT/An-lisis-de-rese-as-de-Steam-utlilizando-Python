I didn't have too much of expectations, but I was blown out of the water. I think the character writing is strong and I like all the dads. There was not a single one. I thought was bad there was one. I thought was boring but all the others are fun and interesting in their own way.\n\nMy first pick was Brian and I wasn't love I loved his dad vibes. I loved his belly. I just digged his daughter and I enjoyed the Dead competition between us it was so fun.\n\nI enjoyed the vampire boy and his story it was fun and just a goofy around story but the character. I wish I could get to know better was Mary because she was my soulmate and I wanted to see her even if he hated me.\n\n\nThe next one was Craig and Robert and I enjoyed them both mostly because I like the dude energy he brought and Roger he was good. I like his tragic past and so forth but I was afraid to get a knife in my face all the time.\n\nThe next one I enjoyed was Joseph but mostly because of his creepy kids and feeling that I was dating at bastard and he was certainly a best at the secret ending with him is so fun and put him in a new light so I see that as it's the Canon thing now.\n\nMy only criticism of the game is that there's only three parts in the dating story which makes it kind of set because I want more time with the characters and three parts just feel kind of short but I get what they're trying to do and it is the to the bone of the best experience so I would recommend the game.", "timestamp_created": 1697999993, "timestamp_updated": 1697999993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148652551": {"recommendationid": "148652551", "author": {"steamid": "76561199106974771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1137, "last_played": 1664015472}, "language": "english", "review": "enough hot men to satiate my hunger for at least two months. 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1697957474, "timestamp_updated": 1697957474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148583792": {"recommendationid": "148583792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245486942", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1230, "last_played": 1591320209}, "language": "english", "review": "I swear I'm not gay I'm just really into dads", "timestamp_created": 1697868051, "timestamp_updated": 1697868051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148575963": {"recommendationid": "148575963", "author": {"steamid": "76561199177521774", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1698980326}, "language": "english", "review": "i like dilfs", "timestamp_created": 1697855286, "timestamp_updated": 1697855286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148413397": {"recommendationid": "148413397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410396206", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 977, "last_played": 1697580089}, "language": "english", "review": "when the crazy psychotic hot christian dilf bussy smells rancid", "timestamp_created": 1697589126, "timestamp_updated": 1697589205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703073084354400635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148005087": {"recommendationid": "148005087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803012078", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1697049506}, "language": "english", "review": "Romance hot dads who are emotionally vulnerable with you. 11/10.

You play as a customizable single dad who moves into a neighborhood full of other hot and dateable dads. Yep, you read that right! Your goal is to romance one of these charming fathers.\n\nDaddy had me hooked with its humor, emotional depth, and beautifully drawn characters. You and your daughter, Amanda, navigate through the ups and downs of life, and it's genuinely heartwarming to see the relationship between a dad and his daughter at the core of the game.\n\nSpeaking of diversity, the game does a good job with representation. There's a trans-dad, non-binary and trans-friendly character creation, and a range of body types to choose from, though I wish they'd offer even more variety.\n\nI appreciated that the game doesn't force characters to define their sexual orientation, and it treats queer relationships with respect, without making them the butt of a joke. The characters are well-fleshed out, and you'll find yourself emotionally invested in their stories.\n\nSure, there are some mini-games sprinkled in, but what really makes the game shine is the depth of the characters and their relationships. It's not just about hot dads dating; it's about being a dad and dealing with life's challenges. And let me tell you, some of the storylines can be bittersweet, which adds to the game's realism and emotional impact.\n\nNow this game isnt perfect. There are some minor grammar and punctiuation errors that could have been fixed with a little more proofreading. The grading system for dates can be a bit vague at times, and some mini-games are tough to master, but that's a minor gripe compared to the overall experience. I value attention to detail to a high degree so I will have to make these issues known.\n\nIn the end, Dream Daddy is a clever, good-hearted game that will make you laugh and genuinely care for its characters. It's a welcome addition to the dating sim genre, offering a refreshing perspective on queer relationships and fatherhood. So, if you're looking for a fun and diverse dating sim with a healthy dose of dad puns, this one's for you.", "timestamp_created": 1691263243, "timestamp_updated": 1691263243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143423696": {"recommendationid": "143423696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090929993", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 884, "last_played": 1691197208}, "language": "english", "review": "This game helped me touch parts of me I didn't know I had... emotionally", "timestamp_created": 1691197284, "timestamp_updated": 1691197284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143403258": {"recommendationid": "143403258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184064179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3966, "last_played": 1612813463}, "language": "english", "review": "gay little game i love it", "timestamp_created": 1691172027, "timestamp_updated": 1691172027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143239184": {"recommendationid": "143239184", "author": {"steamid": "76561199008909002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1690943389}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

You go on 3 'dates' and get to know them, then suddenly you and them magically 'love' each other and then the story just ends and you get one more or less actual dating dialogue to end the game run. That's just unpleasant and unsatisfying for something that's advertized as a dating sim. It's similar to saying SIMS ends after you made your Sim and moved into a house. Just nonsense to me. Or just half-butted writing.\n\nBTW; you cannot decide 'who' you play as. The avatar you play only has ONE personality, which is very very cringey and awkward. Keep that in mind.\n\nAdmittedly, the storytelling of the casual slice of life with your utterly cringey avatar, his daughter and the casual interactions with other people are really really lovely. And the art of the other dad's is really great and each person you can 'date' (which is sadly really just NOT dates but hanging out with a friend 3 times and then BAM suddenly 'love') has their own charm to them and their looks (as well as the children) are just amazing to look at. Both the character designs and personalities are very well done.\nYet, the character YOU play looks like he's from another game with lower quality AND a very sore-thumb looking style inbetween the high quality art...which makes me think it'd have been better to NOT have an avatar. The options you can pick are horribly limited and in some fields all but ONE option just looks right out awful.\nI really wish they would have made the avatar options in the same art quality as the ingame characters.\n\nEach dad has their own charm to them but...they all feel like an over-the-top caricature of a base idea someone had in mind. They absolutely went full throttle with the awkward and cringey aspect of many of them. It's just WAY too much. Which makes it really unpleasant to even try a playthrough in which you don't speed-skip all dialogue just to reach the ending(s) for each run. Which, undoubtedly, is bad for a game like this. And it's not just one of them, unfortunately.\n\n\nI really REALLY wanted to like this, since dating games that are focused on maleXmale are just impossible to find but I honestly was disappointed on all fronts except for the art of the fathers and the lovely story you watch unfold with the avatar and his darling daughter.\n\nI can't recommend this. It's not bad, but it's not good enough to recommend it to others either. If you go into it WITHOUT expecting a romance novel/dating sim but instead just a 'surprise! you're dating this friend now that you only met 3 times before!' kinda way of thinking, then you can have a blast (if the awkward people don't make you just run off).\n\n\n\nEDIT: I HAVE btw played through this already.

My experience with it hasn't been very bad, but definitely could be better! As a bonus issue I can also say I'm not very happy with how female characters are sidelined for the sake of men. I can kind of understand why, but you cant convince me it couldn't been done better. Don't get me wrong, not saying \"let me date women in this game or else!!!!\", because this isn't a place for that, but the writing definitely doesn't do them justice.

I am a single father to my son, who is now 13. My son recently started Hunie Pop and in less than a week, he had already played for over 600 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this cool game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on the character creation.

And the fact that you get to bring your own dad skills to the table is just the icing on the cake. I found myself bragging about my carpentry skills and knowledge of obscure films just to impress my dream dad.\n\nAnd then there's the mini-games. Who can forget the infamous \"Dad-Off,\" where you have to out-dad your date in a series of challenges? I never thought I'd find myself frantically grilling burgers or changing a tire in a video game, but here we are.\n\nOverall, Dream Daddy is a hilarious, heartwarming, and genuinely fun game that I would recommend to anyone who loves a good dating sim with a twist.

I have a few good and bad points to tell about this game, to be fair I'm including both good and bad points and why I ultimately do not recommend this game.\n\nGood Points:\n\n1. Great Art. Honestly one of the strong points of the game.\n\n2. Great memorable characters. I have nothing bad to say about the characters. They are all great, especially Amanda. Love the kid. Love the interactions between dad and Kid\n\n3. Lots of good dad puns. As advertised. It's very nice to read such light-hearted narrative.\n\nBad Points:\n\n1. Too short. Each Love interest is restricted to 3 Dates that are way too short in my opinion, thus the development feel very shallow. 3 Short Dates (not even FULL dates, it's partially play dates between the kids). And you start dating. I have played Dating Sim with more depth and way more romance development than any of the route in this game.\n\n2. This game has the Protagonist and his love interests who are all adult men in their 40's at least, yet this game feels like it's aiming to be played by Teenagers, what with the sanitized vibes all throughout the game play. It also punishes you when you have a one night stand with 1 of the Dads, which is to me feels like a gross stereotyping? They're full grown adults with kids and yet a 1 night stand is enough for them to think you're not worth it as a love interest, it's weird and disjointed. Almost close minded. Sex = Bad. Despite them being again, ADULTS with kids.\n\n3. It tries its hardest to be gay and to appeal to queer audience, but it doesn't live up to its hype. It's highly overrated, content wise. The \"idea\" of it is far more appealing than the execution. \n\nI honestly do not feel like playing more than 3 routes knowing the rest of the dads' route will be short and ultimately unsatisfying due to the lack of depth in the romance development.", "timestamp_created": 1672225844, "timestamp_updated": 1672225844, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866068005561828613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129483296": {"recommendationid": "129483296", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067969343", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 544, "last_played": 1690471582}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't laughed this hard with a game in a long time. 11/10 would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1672197230, "timestamp_updated": 1672197230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129465568": {"recommendationid": "129465568", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126480578", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1676126773}, "language": "english", "review": "i love hot dilfs", "timestamp_created": 1672179735, "timestamp_updated": 1672179735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617927968502044678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129405087": {"recommendationid": "129405087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274541017", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1188, "last_played": 1672203348}, "language": "english", "review": "I especially recommend this game if you get it on sale.

I certainly don't recommend this game full price, but on a sale, go for it.\n\nFirst off, the writing's not great. It's terrible, actually. I despise almost all of the dialogue and how all of the characters are presented, and because of that I had little emotional attachment to most of them (except Craig, Damien and Robert). The day-by-day scenes are very scattered and often times straight up ignored / didn't acknowledge past choices in scenes, for example:\n- My character ate dinner at Robert's one night, learning he has a dog, before seeing him the next night not knowing he has a dog\n- My character spent a day with Damien learning about his hobbies and seeing his home, before coming into it another day and being walked around not familiar with his hobbies\n- My character has a one night stand with one character, showers when he gets home the next morning and then says in the following scene he'd wished he'd showered\nThis comes off as incredibly lazy and streamlines the entire experience down into linearity, making my choices feel redundant as they often didn't carry weight into future scenes.\n\nAlso I absolutely DESPISE the first ending I got with my daughter, where the game actively told me I was a bad parent because I was trying to talk to my daughter and understand why she was upset. Lesson learned - if your kid's upset, never talk to 'em, just let it fester. On the topic of daughters, Amanda is the most immature, annoying, whiny little brat of a kid, and I'm supposed to believe she's an actual 18 year old. Bull fucking shit. She's written as if she's much younger and it's obnoxious as hell.\n\nWho is this game even for? At times it deals with important themes of parenthood, sexuality and death with a surprising (but largely stunted) degree of depth, but also our main protagonist father-and-daughter couple lounge around all day talking about how much they love eating ice cream and eggs and pointing finger-guns at each other. There's such a bizarre tonal shift at times in the presentation and gameplay.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, there's very little, often being something banal and loosely related thrown in, feeling like more of an oversight and obligation rather than a part of the interactive worldbuilding. Lots of times there are missed opportunities for branching paths or smaller decisions, which is a shame because with a little bit more freedom there was more potential for storytelling. I'm fine with reading, I just wish the active parts felt intentional rather than tacked-on.\n\nMusic's annoying and dull, some scenes lack context and start off strangely, very unsubtle in being stitched together to incorporate player choice. The writing commits the devil-sin in that most characters have only one personality trait and are completely whittled down into a stereotype. Characters in some parts talk to each other about events from other days and storylines that I didn't partake in, which makes no sense. Saving the game is a mess because you can't easily keep track of what save you're loading into what time. Just feels pretty sloppily thrown together for the gimmick of \"dad dating sim\" without enough passion or effort poured into it to be unique in its premise or storytelling.\n\nAll that being said, I'm probably going to go back and talk to all the dads to see the rest of the minigames and story outcomes, so it's not all bad here. I don't think you shouldn't buy it but Steam doesn't offer a Neutral review. I was just expecting something more cohesive and open.

Dialogue and personalities are great, art is great! PLAY THIS DATING SIM IF YOU WANT MORE OF A RELATIONSHIP BUILDING FEEL OVER A \"this game is just porn\" FEEL\n\nI have very much been enjoying this game, so much so to the point of achievement hunting. The art throughout is excellently done and each of the Daddies have wonderfully unique personalities. While there are a couple small errors in sentence structure (and by a couple I literally only mean about 3 or 4), it does not distract from the great writing put into the game. There are sweet and tender moments between your dadsona and their daughter, as well as with the other dads. As you progress through the dates there are some saucy lines with implied activities afterwards as things fade to black. Great replay-ability as you have eight Daddies to choose from as well as a secret or two to search for if you're willing to look.\n\nIf I have any criticisms it's just over some minor touches that might have been nice but don't really impact gameplay that much. Such as: more continuity in the events that happen on or between dates. Something simple like a change of dialogue between runs if you've had an interaction with a dad already, or a gift that you're given being seen in your home somewhere. It would also have been really nice to be able to play through, or get an image from the more saucy parts of the game as a bonus image in the gallery for some of the dads; but its kept really classy-like and you can do your own sleuthing for that somewhere else online.", "timestamp_created": 1662431067, "timestamp_updated": 1662431067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121781834": {"recommendationid": "121781834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208400536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1662378126}, "language": "english", "review": "Trans Goth Dad is best Dad", "timestamp_created": 1662378341, "timestamp_updated": 1662378341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670200467109680176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121718438": {"recommendationid": "121718438", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060711708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 397, "last_played": 1680569728}, "language": "english", "review": "i love these characters and the parts of their stories that reveal through other characters play through's.

You're pretty much getting what you expected: no more, no less. \n\nOne of the repeating flaws that I believe this game has is its ability to make the dates have substance to them, letting the player become more attached to their chosen dad and thus making it FEEL like a dating sim in the first place. While each dad definitely intrigued me with their fun, unique personalities and good looks, I had some trouble believing that my protagonist and my chosen dad had actually progressed our relationship by the end of each date. \n\nFortunately, one of this game's major strengths is its characters, which made me come back to play the game again and again (having me go through every dad's path too, admittedly). While I do believe the dates are lacking, each character's interesting and funny quirks allow the experience to still be an enjoyable one. The cast is also full of diversity as well, which is always a plus. \n\nOverall, I'd say if you're looking for a fun dating sim, go ahead and get this game. While it's not perfect, it is worth it, coming from someone who went back and got 89% of the achievements (besides the Brian mini-game ones... damn you Brian!). When talking games about hot, middle-aged guys, this is the best one on the market.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1657501619, "timestamp_updated": 1657501619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118549851": {"recommendationid": "118549851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344059994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 833, "last_played": 1678769869}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is bomb asf", "timestamp_created": 1657425302, "timestamp_updated": 1657425302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118549572": {"recommendationid": "118549572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151121894", "num_games_owned": 1467, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1649596233}, "language": "english", "review": "You're a dad, I'm a dad, everyone's a dad's dad!\n\nIt's cute, colorful, charming, and pretty well written.

But I did really like the Game Grumps. I bought this game the year it came out as a joke to see what the game was about and to support the Game Grumps at the time. With me now being an Achievement Junkie, my itches had to be scratched. I 100% all the Achievements in this game and I can not tell if I am proud of my feat, or should be rethinking a lot of things in my life. Personally, I do not entirely feel shame. Again, I bought this back when I was a dumb teenage boy not knowing the slightest thing about what being gay was. Now that I am older and played through the game one more time, I am confused. I can not tell if this game by the same people that made Video Game Entertainment on YouTube was making this game super serious, or making this satire. I still question the reasons as to why I revisited the game and 100%'d it. Part of me said it was easy, another part says this will be a permanent accomplishment that will be plastered on my account. I am not making this any easier on myself writing this review. But besides the feeling of withdrawal of 100%ing a Dating Sim where you date virtual Dads, I do not think this game is entirely bad. I mean heck, I personally thought the story and characters are very compelling. For a Dating Sim, it definitely checks all of the boxes of what makes a Dating Sim. My only problem is that I do not like reading. I am more of a shooter kind of guy.

I was able to reunite with my college buddy Craig, and I'm happy now (together with a small nursery of kids LOL). What can I say.. I am a sentimental human.\nBack to reality: the game is great! I've never played a simulator game quite as such, so it was an experience. The plot of the game was engaging, and the characters very diverse. You can get lost in all these choices and decisions. LIBRA PEOPLE BEWARE, haha!\nThe only downside to this game (for me at least) is that you cannot pass the third date with more than one dad at a time.

After seeing it on sale for a really good price recently after so long, I thought I'd give it a go myself and explore all it had to offer.  I can safely say that it's still a brilliant game.\n\nAddressing the technical and aesthetic stuff first, Dream Daddy is a really well made game.  The art style really suits the casual nature of the story, the GUI is attractive with nice little touches like the moving backgrounds in the text box, and the transition screens are fun and colourful.  I also love that this isn't just a straight up choices visual novel - there are mini games scattered throughout, most of which are pretty funny, and a couple of which actually offer a challenge.  The music is decent - nothing spectacular, but then this isn't an emotional epic, so you don't exactly expect that anyway.\n\nStory and gameplay wise, Dream Daddy is hilarious.  It's got all the dating sim quirks but it does it in a way that feels a little outside of the norm.  The humour is constant and really funny, but it also manages to throw in some more serious moments when the time's right that actually feel genuine too.  It's a laugh fest with heart.  There are plenty of dateable dads, each with eventful dates to go on, with a points and ranking system depending on how much you charm them.  Aside from the actual storylines, there are also some hidden achievements to find, most of which are pretty funny.  Did you know you can die in multiple ways in this game?  Or that there's a secret horror ending that you can only achieve by doing certain things and essentially naming your customisable dad a code name?  Neither did I until I got into it.  What a wild ride.\n\nOverall, it's a great experience.  The routes aren't that long, so you can make good progress and get a lot done in a short amount of time.  This isn't a game that will tug your heartstrings and get you crying, but it's also not just complete comedy - you get a nice balance of silliness and legit life stuff.  Oh, and plenty of dad jokes.\n\nI only have two qualms with this game, and they both relate to technical functions: firstly, this game does NOT have an auto mode, and I hate that.  Constant clicking/hitting keys really bothers my wrists and shoulders, and not having an auto mode is basically a deal breaker for me.  I didn't realise before I bought it that it didn't have one, as it's pretty much a given in most VNs.  I got through it in the end, but I didn't appreciate not being able to rest my poor hands.  The second issue is that in most VNs, the skip button usually skips through all previously read text, to save you time when you're replaying for different endings/achievements, and will stop skipping automatically when new dialogue is reached.  Dream Daddy does NOT do this, and will skip literally everything, even stuff you haven't ever seen before, and I checked the options, but there's no setting to change this.  Learnt that the hard way.  Neither of these things are gamekillers if you know about them and can get used to them, particularly getting a knack for when to stop skipping so you don't miss new content.  Not amazing though.\n\nNevertheless, qualms aside, Dream Daddy is still a great game, hilarious, charming, and surprisingly high quality for what is essentially a comedy game and in a way, almost a parody of dating sims.  Grab a copy for yourself, limber up your hands for clicking, get your best dad jokes lined up and get ready to laugh, smile, kiss some hot single dads, and then laugh some more.  Just, whatever you do...\n\n...don't go with Jimmy Buffett.

It is a fun, wholesome game with a lot of personality and a wonderfully creative, inspired, and inclusive perspective. \n\nI'm not really a \"dating sim\" type of gamer usually, but I watched JackSepticEye play this for a few minutes and was in love as soon as I noticed they had character creation choices that included trans dads. There is also a hilarious/awful dad pun about Godspeed You! Black Emperor (a hipster rock band for those of you who don't listen to obscure vinyls) in the first 10 minutes. \n\nI'm gonna talk about the character creation first - I am transmasc, and I have never seen a fully-developed game that was made professionally and came with trans body options included. There are also a variety of skintones, hair textures, and facial features, which is rare as well. I know some people don't care about this (I'm not that person who thinks every single video game needs a trans playable character), but having the option to have a trans PC is like when the barista gives you whipped cream for free and tells you they like your hair - it is a pleasant surprise that immediately makes your day so much better. Generally speaking this game is great on inclusivity - the characters are whole people, not stereotypes, and a variety of humans are represented in wholesome and compassionate ways.\n\nNext let's talk about the gameplay and plot - This game really nails it. It's easy to play and you pick up the pace, tone, and style of the game very quickly. It has great writing and you feel like you have a lot of options, but all those options are still very detailed. The game is fairly nonlinear for a dating sim, and it's a lot of fun to learn about each of the characters, explore your neighborhood, and spot all the dad puns at your own pace. You can freely save so you never feel like you're gonna get f*cked if you make a bad choice or struggle at a minigame. \n\nSpeaking of the minigames - they are just right - challenging enough that you don't get bored, but not so hard that it obstructs gameplay for the casual gamer. Overall the experience of playing this is fun, pleasant, and pretty chill. I actually went back and played them from the main menu for a bit because they're fun in their own right, and the related achievements are at the right level so they feel challenging, but not impossible. \n\nThe game has many different endings and a lot of replay value, and you genuinely want to get to know all the available dads. I played it until I got every ending. Not because I am a completionist, but because I really wanted to learn about all the characters, and I was sad when I beat the game - the characters feel like a group of friends and you want to keep going back to hang out with them again and again.\n\nSpeaking of awesome characters and trans stuff, there is a trans dad you can date, and he's wonderful because despite him being trans, they still made him a detailed, fully fleshed out character that has interests, hobbies, etc beyond being trans. I loved this because, too often, a piece of media will have a trans character and the extent of the character development you get is \"HEY GUYS DID YOU KNOW THIS CHARACTER IS TRANS AND DOES TRANS STUFF AND SEE WE GAVE YOU YOUR TRANS CHARACTER SO SHUT UP NEVER MIND HES AN OFFENSIVE STEREOTYPE HE'S TRANSY TRANS TRANS TRANS AND THAT'S ALL YOU GET!!\" before dying tragically for no goddamn reason. \nDream Daddy is the opposite of this - the character's transness is not covered up, but it's also not his whole personality. It's just a thing you can learn about him if you spend enough time together, and it's not presented in a \"I have a DARK SECRET\" type way. It's treated as a normal thing (which being trans is). So again, this game really does inclusivity the right way.\n\nThe art and music in this game are superb. The animation style is creative and cohesive without being overbearing, the color palette is soothing and pleasing to look at, and the soundtrack enhances the story and gameplay without overwhelming it or taking you out of the game. It's truly a joy to play if you're a creative.\n\nThis game also has a ton of personality that shines through in the easter eggs and tiny details and references- Honestly, the many art and music and literature references alone show you how much care was put into the game - they're not there to make you feel like you're not cool enough to catch a reference - you can tell the creators are just huge dorks and nerd out about things they like. I especially loved the fact that they featured PUP - it's wholesome when creatives hype each other's stuff. (if you like pop punk, go check PUP's stuff out). They put a lot of personality into the game and you can tell the general vibe was \"hey guys, wouldn't it be cute and stupid if we had the character get in a pun-off with the other dads about grilling?\" - they just did stuff because they thought it would be fun.\n\nOverall this game is just very joyful and wholesome (except for the hidden nightmare ending lol) and it's easily worth a few playthroughs. It is a wonderful experience every time, and I can't recommend it enough - it has so much personality and you will genuinely miss it when you finish it. I also have to reiterate, if you're the kind of person who rarely sees yourself represented in games, this game will really make you feel seen. It's easily one of my favorite casual games ever.", "timestamp_created": 1644922279, "timestamp_updated": 1644922279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572649598121643066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110258844": {"recommendationid": "110258844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359296900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1467, "last_played": 1690999042}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this dilf dating game", "timestamp_created": 1644881361, "timestamp_updated": 1644973005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110257535": {"recommendationid": "110257535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330183255", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1645939724}, "language": "english", "review": "MAT SUPREMACY ANY DAY", "timestamp_created": 1644879562, "timestamp_updated": 1644879562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110238938": {"recommendationid": "110238938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198962238240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 259, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1644804123}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll be honest, I did not expect to relate to this game as much as I did.

When I first found this game, I had just started coming out as Transgender, so, like any other vampire obsessed gay boy, I flocked to Damien. His story was the one that always left the biggest impact on me. He conquered his own fear, was able to be more comfortable to be himself and just looked incredible in the whole game! \n\nThis game always makes me smile and is incredible with its story as it deals with the struggles that parents in real-life experience as well as the story-line with Amanda and how I felt just like her with the fear of going away to Uni, drama in friend groups and being able to rely on my Dad in times of need. \n\nI am not good at articulating my words in this regard, but I am super passionate about this game and will always recommend it to anyone who is interested in playing it. It's so much more than just a dating sim. \n\nThank you Dream Daddy for always lifting my spirits and showing me it's okay to be me. <3", "timestamp_created": 1644368152, "timestamp_updated": 1644368152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109766283": {"recommendationid": "109766283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835529830", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1032, "last_played": 1645155259}, "language": "english", "review": "i love dads", "timestamp_created": 1644300437, "timestamp_updated": 1644300437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109696779": {"recommendationid": "109696779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408238569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1553, "last_played": 1692770508}, "language": "english", "review": "brian is a dilf", "timestamp_created": 1644211062, "timestamp_updated": 1644211062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632716059684753418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109692401": {"recommendationid": "109692401", "author": {"steamid": "76561199192405515", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1659744217}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me parece un juego muy entretenido :)", "timestamp_created": 1644204523, "timestamp_updated": 1644204523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109620844": {"recommendationid": "109620844", "author": {"steamid": "76561199217027378", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1646853914}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game, I'd recommend it to people wanting a kind of interactive, entertaining but not out there experience.\nIt's pretty basic in a lot of aspects. \nMini games are fun though and keep you engaged. \nThe dad creation could be better.", "timestamp_created": 1644129084, "timestamp_updated": 1644129084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109620311": {"recommendationid": "109620311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198439121324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1987, "last_played": 1644133362}, "language": "english", "review": "The characters are great and there is a lot of depth to each of them.

All these things.\n\nDon't buy this game, it's got enough sales already.  Please buy Coming Out On Top instead. \n\nPros:\n* Daughter relationship is the best one.  \n* Each Dad has a full and interesting personality\n* Artwork is great\n* Trans identity - You can choose if the PC is Trans, canonically.\n* Best Dads - Hugo, Robert, and Damien\n\nCons:\n* Dadsona creator is AWFUL, horrible, ugly, cartoonish.  Drastically clashes with art style of the rest of the game.\n* Sexuality is never mentioned or acknowledged by characters of the game.\nThis game goes so far to \"normalize\" queerness that it *erases* it completely. There is no queer identity or representation of queer experiences.  I don't expect this game to retread all the common queer tropes (trauma, coming out, etc).  I do expect a game about queer Dads to include at least some normal queer experiences.  \n* Trans identity - \nThe creator option to make your player trans is only indicated by the word \"binder\".  Lots of people don't know what this means, so it's value as representation is extremely limited. \nA player choosing a binder, does not effect any other part of the game, making the choice meaningless.  It's never mentioned.\nDamien's mention of \"binder\" in buried/hidden in a response to an optional dialogue choice is wholly insufficient to be counted as representation.  His story doesn't have to go into the whole coming out or transition, but it should reference his identity in a more concrete accepting way.  \nDamien's own \"coming out\" as not 100% goth in Date 3, also reeks of bad writing or trans erasure.  Most trans men who have fully transitioned already understand the concepts Damien goes through during this not-goth coming out, and would not talk about it in such dramatic terms.\n* Structure of stories breaks in many places badly, especially with random text message activities\n  Example: If you get the text about Damien's butterfly package before Date 1, Damien explains to you about his hobby a second time.\n* Brian's path is very irritating up until Date 3.  He was the last Dad I wanted to date because he was so rude and jarring.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1643866999, "timestamp_updated": 1643866999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416666656732559204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109362271": {"recommendationid": "109362271", "author": {"steamid": "76561199227945685", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1645760336}, "language": "english", "review": "Got Daddy issues but therapy's too expensive?

It's great as an introduction to dating sims-- no pressing deadlines, you're able to explore multiple routes at once, you don't go half-insane collecting CGs... They did their job really well, and I very much appreciate the love that obviously went into this game. Amanda made me feel like a dad-- like a GOOD dad-- and it was strangely soothing. Maybe I'm getting a little deep here. Oops.\n\nAll the characters are well-written, and any typos are very minimal (which is somewhat inevitable in text-based games, so I appreciate that they were few and far between). I do wish there were more CGs available, and potentially other endings to get? Like a \"true neutral\" ending or something would have been cute where it's just...wholesome dads raising their kids together and all that.\n\nUnless there's something very specific about a character that you don't like (i.e. you don't like dudes who wear leather jackets or teachers or something), then chances are, you'll have a hard time ranking the romance options. Their routes are equal in depth and length, unlike some more traditional dating sims, and most of the endings leave off on a fairly positive, if not outright blindingly optimistic, note. I'm currently unable to rank them because they're all so varied and were enjoyable for different reasons, most of which relating to being wholesome. This is a WHOLESOME game. [spoiler]I kind of wish it was less wholesome...Sprinkle in a little more NSFW content... :eyes:[/spoiler]\n\nIf you're looking for only the purest and most wholesome routes that are sweet from beginning to end, go with Craig, Hugo, Damien, or Mat. Brian is still wholesome-- there are just minigames in his that will drive completionists a little insane. (Mini golf... It haunts me...) I'll spoiler everything about the remaining two routes below, though it won't contain actual game spoilers, more of just...general content spoilers for anyone who may be worried about specific things.\n\n[spoiler]Robert's route is actually pretty wholesome, all things considered. The ending just isn't as pure and simple and sweet as some of the others, but it's still a GOOD ending and ends very positively. I like his kid.\n\nJoseph's route is a bit more tricky. As you'll learn in the prologue, he is married, unlike the rest of the bachelors who have all lost their partners (or maybe never had one to begin with, in some folks' cases, though it's not touched on much to keep the game pretty light). This is a major factor in his ending, which...is still positive, in a sense, but it's not a fairytale ending, and leaves me with more questions than answers, as per some traditional otome game standards.[/spoiler]\n\nUltimately, I deeply enjoyed this game. I wish there was more to it!! DLC or even just a sequel would have been lovely. I wish there hadn't been backlash online from people who aren't familiar with traditional dating sim tropes over the secret hidden ending that wasn't even included in the original game (it was found by dataminers in an old build from the game files). They did end up patching it in later by popular demand among the game's fans, which I can respect, even if the strange, non-canon, vaguely freaky endings aren't usually my style. Like...look at Monster Prom. You can end the world in a playthrough if you do it right. (It's a pretty recent and obvious example, but if you delve into the genre more, you're sure to find similarities in other games.)

The diversity shown is outstanding and this game is definitely worth every penny. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1642288522, "timestamp_updated": 1642288522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108080796": {"recommendationid": "108080796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213763199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1454, "last_played": 1642275989}, "language": "english", "review": "Where can I find these dads irl?", "timestamp_created": 1642276082, "timestamp_updated": 1642276082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108080605": {"recommendationid": "108080605", "author": {"steamid": "76561199160568005", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1686458853}, "language": "english", "review": "I decided to try this game out after seeing a playthrough a couple years ago, my dating sim experience begins and ends with DDLC, so I didn't really know what to expect.

So, I loaded this game up, streamed it through Discord and played along with a bunch of friends! \n\nThe artstyle and character designs are pretty good, decent character creator also allows you to make the dad of your dreams (which in my case was a burly, forty-something single retired grizzled police officer with a scar and bushy moustache.) Now that dad (i.e. you) can go forth and romantically pursue a plethora of other dads in the neighbourhood through a series of hilariously written dates! (You can choose to be all sensitive and romantic, but option is yours, daddy-o!)\n\nI'd say the other date-able dads are pretty well written and well designed, so you're sure to find a dad that tickles your fancy in this game. Also ever-present is your relationship with your soon-to-be graduating daughter. The emotional father-daughter subplot is a heartwarming and wholesome aside in the game's progression, right when you need a break from all the lusty dad chats you're having.\n\nAlso like I mentioned, this game is GOLDEN if you can play it with friends/SO/family members/pets watching or picking the conversation options for you!\n\n[b]Arbitrary Number rating:[/b] 2 dads > 1 dad", "timestamp_created": 1640849672, "timestamp_updated": 1640856543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106882778": {"recommendationid": "106882778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817331860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1660021159}, "language": "english", "review": "yes.\n", "timestamp_created": 1640843620, "timestamp_updated": 1640843620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106882626": {"recommendationid": "106882626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258367529", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1468, "last_played": 1526352372}, "language": "english", "review": "Craig will always have my heart bro.", "timestamp_created": 1640843424, "timestamp_updated": 1640843424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106876986": {"recommendationid": "106876986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405590681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1640745933}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game, i love mats route", "timestamp_created": 1640836127, "timestamp_updated": 1640836127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106875574": {"recommendationid": "106875574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186868029", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1592, "last_played": 1564195762}, "language": "english", "review": "this is one of my favorite games of all time, if I could shout from the rooftops I would but instead I can only review on steam... 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1640834481, "timestamp_updated": 1640834481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106872973": {"recommendationid": "106872973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198858465780", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1641091756}, "language": "english", "review": "I am adoring this game!

These are just two technical issues. \n\nThe first is that there's actually no controller support. That would be okay if it didn't list controller support on the store page. This will likely be a non issue for many, but due to my joint pain it hurts to use a keyboard and mouse. It certainly had a negative impact for me.\n\nThe second is that despite there being multiple outcomes, the dialogue doesn't always match up with the outcomes. Several times my character mentioned things that never happened, but apparently would have if I'd made the ideal choices. That leaves the game feeling very unfinished, especially if you like getting into the story of it.\n\nNow ultimately this is just a pretty lighthearted game with some laughs about dads and romance.

Sometimes questions don't need answers. I'll let you in on what you're in for.\n\nAbsolute dad/chad bods: The ultimate dad bod gauntlet. You lookin for a cuddly teddy bear? Or a chisled clean shaven man believed to be sent from god himself. If the looks and attention to detail doesn't hook you in, they've got personalities too, and that's a whole new story.\n\nGameplay: It's a dad dating simulator, there are sets of dialogue and interaction options that are limited, but present different outcomes. Unfortunately that seems to be its drawback. It's simple gameplay, but can get repetitive. Always use the save system, as each choice matters which could negatively or positively provoke a reaction from a character. Though the problem will resolve when you reload the save and select a different option, other then that nothing too tedious.\n\nArt style: It's simple, easy on the eyes, and relaxing. There are tons of new background scenes I haven't gotten to yet that could raise my appraisal even higher. The character's art style is also off the charts, each have their own tone, set pieces, and charm. \n\nDialogue: You won't hear an actual narrator, or separate lines, it's more groan.mp3, grunt.mp3 and giggle.mp3. At the end of a date, the character can say a line of dialogue. It's a subtitle heavy game and you're gonna just have to put those reading glasses on.\n\nCustomisation: You get to create your own preferred dad bod. 3 main choices, muscular, fat/chubby or skinny. Classic options like face details, outfits, and glasses. *NOTE* [Outfits come in sets, as in Jeans and white shirt or literal macho man randy savage. Oh and keep in mind once you create a character, you cannot change what they look like, it is set and final.]\n\nTarget audience: It's a click and go simulator, with set dialogue options and interactions. Whether you're looking for a funny, charming game, or looking for something completely different from what you've been playing, highly recommended. Probably one of the rarest games I'll find that I enjoy.\n\nPrice: I would say the price is worth it, I've gotten through 2 out of 7 dads with 7 hours chalked up. It also supports the work done by a small studio with talented artists, development team and voice actors. \n\nOpinion: So, it was a friday night, I decide to look on Youtube and binge old content from famous creators, see that they did a series on this game, and decided to take a look. Watched one episode and was already hooked, I don't even play these types of games, closest art style to these is Hades. Not squad, Hunt showdown, Escape From Tarkov. This game was it's own separate piece and I think that's what drew me in, something new, something that could be actually entertaining rather then grinding hours and hours on. A sense of enjoyment, and that's what I've gotten from this game, it's out of my comfort zone, but maybe that's a good thing. So I'd say if you're looking for something new, something charming, funny, cringy, awkward or a well written story, this is your chance to take a dive.

I dislike it when dating sims boils down to viewing guides online because you need to get very specific (and vague) answers correct in order to get a good ending. It takes away from the experience. I also feel like the mechanic of the 3 dates feels a little bit unnatural at times, and made me wish there were more variables involved. The ending also left a lot to be desired. I wish there was more of a conclusion to the dating experience. Maybe getting married? Have our kids hang out? Something more, i dunno. \n\nLastly, I feel like the dialogue in this game becomes A LOT dated after just a few years of being released. Playing this in 2021, a lot of the jokes and references fall flat due to irrelevancy. It's quirky, sure.

I watch Arin and Dan in various stuff from their YouTube channels all the time. I can see a lot of their type of humor in this game \u2013 not to give them all the credit though, as this story was written by Leighton and Vernon.\nI actually didn\u2019t play this for the longest time because I\u2019m not fond of children and I thought the child characters would be more present in the game. While the children of the all the dad characters play an important part in the story, it does focus on the dads a lot more, so I had an inaccurate impression before. Furthermore, the protagonist\u2019s child is 18 years old, so she\u2019s more agreeable than, say, a 5-year-old would be. \nThe story really is just about a single father and his daughter moving to a new neighborhood that coincidentally has a bunch of other single dads in it. While the children pop up in the story often, there\u2019s usually some convenient reason for the protagonist and a romanceable character to get alone time. \n\n[u]Info[/u]\n    \u2022 There are mini-games, but they don\u2019t heavily affect the outcome of a romance route, so it\u2019s quite possible to do poorly on one and still get the character\u2019s ending.\n    \u2022 There are achievements related to mini-games, but all the mini-games are available on the main menu once they\u2019ve been unlocked so you don\u2019t have to replay the story again to have another attempt at the achievement.\n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    \u2022 Build-A-Dad options and (deceased) partner options allow trans inclusivity and queer partnering. The daughter can be biologically related to the protagonist or adopted.\n    \u2022 The dads have a decent amount of racial/ethnic diversity.\n    \u2022 Cute, touching, and/or sweet romantic moments.\n    \u2022 Probably one of the funniest visual novels I\u2019ve ever played. \n    \u2022 Excellent writing and good character development. \n    \u2022 Great artwork.\n    \u2022 CG gallery.\n    \u2022 Joseph\u2019s route is [i]educational[/i] for those who might not have had the life experience of [spoiler]getting close to a married person and developing feelings for them[/spoiler]. Moral of the story is: Don\u2019t fall for it. \n    \u2022 The secret joke ending is absurd (in an amusing way) and I\u2019m glad they allowed that in the game.  \n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    \u2022 I wish the voice acting was more than just noises and one word here and there. I feel like it would\u2019ve been a lot funnier too.\n    \u2022 There are a bunch of auto-save spots, but only one manual save spot. \n    \u2022 Too few CGs.\n    \u2022 The mini-golf mini-game is ridiculous. You only get one try per hole and the shot indicator goes way too fast. It takes a copious amount of attempts and luck to get the corresponding achievement.\n    \u2022 A few typos here and there. Notably, the word \u201cbeer\u201d was always capitalized, even though a proper noun wasn\u2019t attached to it. \n\nOf course, I recommend this game!

I was definitely one of those \"come for the daddy concept [unintentional dirty joke], stay for the actual plot and characters\" (and I will disclaim that I do like Game Grumps, even before buying this game). Like what the hell? This game has NO RIGHT having such nice representation, writing, characters, and art. I think there is literally a story for every trope - old friend (college instead of childhood in this case), the \"bad boy\", cheating on your spouse. Every plot and every dad is compelling and interesting, and I genuinely like all of them, plus the recurring characters within the story lines (and some aren't limited to one dad's story!).\n\nHonestly, I can't really think of any cons off the top of my head (well, some of the mini-games were kind of rough but you don't need to actually succeed on those so it's fine). Part of me wants a sequel but part of me thinks it's perfect as is. I think the game has its own scope to focus on the characters, so the outside world is kind of ignored, but I don't think this is a bad thing. I think it's actually really refreshing having a game with lots of POC and LGBTQ+ representation without making it a big deal, like having deep coming outs or talking about social justice issues in society. We're just people too and we want happy fluffy stuff too, and this game definitely delivers.", "timestamp_created": 1618758514, "timestamp_updated": 1619610745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90433954": {"recommendationid": "90433954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283253641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 530, "last_played": 1620095427}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely delightful.

There are a few brutal mini-game achievements in the game that make you want to stab your eye out, but they are not impossible. Pick this game up if you love visual novels, dad jokes, and just having a good time. \n \nYou are the new dad on the block with your daughter, Amanda and your goal is to make new friends. You have many different dads to befriend and your choices determine whether the people around you want to stay, leave, or become something more with many puns along the way. All the dads have their own unique personality that all the dates are unique to them and don\u2019t blend over to the other dates. Personally, this game made me laugh and smile a lot with all the charm that the Game Grumps crew brought to Dream Daddy. My favorite dad has to be Hugo with his sweet manchego and Pablo Escobrawl Genuine Wreastleboy shirt.   \n\nWith all positives, come negatives. I wish I could give this game a 10 on both ratings and move forward, however there is one brutal achievement, Yo Ho Ho Ho. Yo Ho Ho Ho is a mini-game where you play a minigolf and must get a perfect hole-in-one in every single hole. Sounds easy until you realize that if you fail you must start from the beginning or at least the 10th hole. This is an uphill battle and took me several hours before I had unlocked it. When I first unlocked the achievement only 0.3% of people had it and now it went up to 0.5% which is not much of a difference.  \n\nIf you want another game to turn your day, week, year better then GRAB THIS GAME, I highly recommend it. If you are still on the fence about the game, there is a free version on the App Store and Google Play Store on smart phones that gives you 3 free dates. You can test out a few routes or try and see how hard the two achievement mini games are in Brian\u2019s route and choose from there. After that you have to pay for more dates or the full game, which is an option for those who don\u2019t want the game on their account for the achievements or other reason you don\u2019t want it showing on there.", "timestamp_created": 1605242019, "timestamp_updated": 1605242019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79121383": {"recommendationid": "79121383", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101177748", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1613343114}, "language": "english", "review": "nice and gay", "timestamp_created": 1605130757, "timestamp_updated": 1605130757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.771030724048614502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79116846": {"recommendationid": "79116846", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091148352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1685199426}, "language": "english", "review": "MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE THIS GAME", "timestamp_created": 1605123942, "timestamp_updated": 1605123942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79112562": {"recommendationid": "79112562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201587250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5771, "last_played": 1605144499}, "language": "english", "review": "excellent for making you feel happier with yourself. anti-depressant, 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1605118049, "timestamp_updated": 1605118049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726324081420898438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79105931": {"recommendationid": "79105931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122128964", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 783, "last_played": 1605109225}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Art\u00edsticamente est\u00e1 bastante bien, ilustraciones de calidad con variedad de escenarios.

I recommend waiting and getting it on sale.\n\nMost of the minigames really felt forced in and that they have no real reason to be included. Suffering from being a completionist I spend more time playing minigolf that I would like to admit.\n\nThe game is highly character driven, and as a player you can't really affect the events or have a say on what happens. Only the ending will change based on how many \"right answers\" you gave to the characters on their 3 dates. Saving and loading your game will easily get you to have enough right answers to pass the dates with great points.\n\nDamien, Joseph and Robert were definitely our favorite daddies, and playing through the rest just felt like a chore.

It's funny and cute, and a game I tend to recommend to my fellow LGBTQ+ friends. Tbh I have no idea how I didn't review it before. I guess I was waiting to play all the routes so I could talk about all the game, but then I didn't... and forgot. The reason is pretty simple: I was so not interested in some of the dads! It's something that is bound to happen in dating sims, but WHY THE HELL IS BRIAN SO ANNOYING? It's to mimic competitive and annoying dads... But god I wish there was a route where he would travel far away and never come back. But he's existence is little and a minor part of the game (or so I tend to think).\n\nMoving on. I love the relationship between the dad and the daughter, I absolutely LOVE the dad builder, I love the intense one-night-stands (lolol) and I really like the game overall. If I have something to complain about is that some of the happy endings aren't all that happy at all! I mean, saying \"Yeah, I'll work it out there and then I'll come back to you eventually\" does not make me happy! What is this? One of those anime cheap endings with a 3 year timeskip?! You can't try to be realistic now, come on! \n\nBut yeah, there are tons of achievements you can get, YOU CAN ACTUALLY DIE and your daughter can either love you or hate you depending on how you act. Tons of minigames and activities to do, and a fair share of mysteries and secret routes. Dream daddy is a game we all needed but didn't know. I'm sad I didn't write this review right after playing it (because then my mind would be fresh ;;). \n\nAlso: Craig is okay (everyone screaming that he is best dad just have a thing to the \"BRO...\" WHICH I DO TOO), but the true best dads are DAMIEN and ROBERT. With a big cherry on top for Damien because he's the true best dad.

As someone who played this game solely for a laugh and maybe an interesting story, there was nothing here for me. The majority of the romance options in this game have shallow and mundane stories. The two options that have a little more going on are incredibly underdeveloped so their melodrama feels hollow. You have no options whatsoever to determine your player character's personality. His personality is locked on \"awkward dork\" plus whatever the current romance option needs him to be. All of that is ignoring the abomination that is the character creation system which offers nothing be ugly and ridiculous options for every part of the player character's body. This wouldn't be so bad if this game didn't have far more mundane and melodramatic scenes than humorous ones.\n\nIgnoring the personal drama of the characters, there is very little fun or enjoyable dialogue in this game. This game spends so much of its time making bad dad jokes and pop culture references that they forget to have any actual funny writing. The cherry on top of all of this is a small collection of terrible minigames with awful controls which your success at is directly tied to how much your romance options like you.\n\nThe only truly positive about this game is your player character's daughter. She is by far the closest this game gets at portraying an actual human being with a personality, motivation and a progression arc. Her dialogue feels natural and like an actual young teen without coming across as annoying. The art is okay too, but nothing amazing.

If you can look past certain aspects, such as graphical glitches, and certain annoying mechanics, you can truly have a legendary experience. While it offers other platforms such as ass O and cock, by far ball is the best experience you can have. It has the potential for months of devoted gameplay. You can play hard and fast, or casual and slow. Customizable single player allows for an experience that caters to your gamestyle. Multiple maps, DLC, and mods + multiplayer, allows for a virtually endless experience. I truly recommend this game, but you will need to beware of certain glitches.

I randomly ran across Red Embrace 1 which thrusted me into this world in the first place.  My review is based upon Coming Out On Top because in my eyes, it's the game most comparable.  \n\nFirst off, I wish I had dug through reviews a bit more.  I JUST had a conversation about my issues with the game and then found a review from 2017 with basically the same criticisms.  Meh.  Donated $15 to the cause I guess.\n\nNot everything was negative.  The backstory and general storyline is quite touching and authentic (my biggest necessity when it comes to these).  I know several like the fantasy world brought into LGBTQ games, and occasionally I do too but when I'm investing money, I go after my top preferences.  This story is honest while having some general humor which does not \"jump the shark\" in my eyes.  Each character is fully realized, different, and inclusive to many different groups and identities (potentially even yours depending on what you choose).  I'm a fan of the art and details; it's very 1990's point-and-click style honestly (without the ability to point and click -ha).  The mini games add a new dimension to what graphic novel love stories can provide in a game - this seems to be a regular thing showing up in games.  \n\nThe downsides:  In the back of my head  I knew (yet forgot) that this game doesn't feature explicit content.  After I purchased and entered the game I had to deal with my own disappointment this wasn't going to go as far as I wanted these romances to go.  I enjoy the build up of tension and having that \"gratifying\" release.  Unfortunately, this game blands it out too low. You'll acknowledge going to a character's home and know it's implied the relationship is going to go further (under whatever circumstance that may be).  Then, you are instantly met with a black screen and typically relocated to your home for the next day to begin.   I get it; if I wanted a smut story, I could go off and find one.  But I think the story really lacks that serious undertone of capturing the \"reader\" and making them feel those butterfly moments of the \"will he/won't he\" moments.  This is even more watered down by the profile analysis which indicates how much you've advanced on each character before you get into inevitably earn the date which seals the relationship. Think of it as a gold star on a test - only this time the gold stars are heart ratings.  To me, it really interrupts the linear focus of the storyline and makes it more like an XP goal.  For some I'm sure this is part is more enjoyable.\n\nFor games which have recently heightened the difficulty on choosing options which determine your final routes, this is probably the most elementary.  When picking answer choices in conversations/actions, most are inconsequential and lead you to essentially the same outcome.  Typical responses range from serious/confident to humor/insecure which typically end up to the same conclusion without story variation other than an initial character response for who you are interacting with.  \n\nWhen I said I complimented the characters' storylines and realization, this was both true and misleading.  What made it also a criticism was just the intricate level they were wanting to tell you about each character.  It was beautifully done and made me actually feel like I was back on MySpace again lol.  The unfortunate piece is the fact the game's structure is a dating profile.  #1 issue: You are forced into hobby/personality choices which are cliche and mostly irrelevant, and #2 issue:  in regards to the characters you can choose to date, most don't follow the same questions asked of you in their profile let alone represent the same forced almost satirical answers given to you.  It makes your character seem very shallow and parodized while your dates have depth (although all their profile answers are cliched into their respective character traits/personalities/hobbies). \n\nIt was mentioned in someone else's which should have been a warning to me: The character simulator... ugh.  To almost quote the review I looked at, you come off very cartoonish and comical when compared to the beautiful drawing/concepts of your dates.  Experimenting with the features don't help much.  It's hard to take the game more serious than its surface when it looks like Charlie Brown is trying to date a graphic artist's character concept. \n\nOverall - if simplistic character interaction and bright campy schemes are your thing, you may find this game enjoyable. I still do applaud the character concepts and storylines - they are truly some of the best I've seen for an RPG for an LBGTQ focus.  But I personally am regretting the decision some.", "timestamp_created": 1583124213, "timestamp_updated": 1583124213, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490429222583770752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64359771": {"recommendationid": "64359771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081329001", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 14154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5434, "last_played": 1663505175}, "language": "english", "review": "wanted this game for so long\nasked my cousin to gift it on my birthday and he pulled through\nits almost gonna be 3 years since this game was released and i still love damien bloodmarch\n\noverall,\ngood game and good dads\ni dont like joseph though", "timestamp_created": 1583073325, "timestamp_updated": 1583073325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64353499": {"recommendationid": "64353499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286976300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 1925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1925, "last_played": 1582488970}, "language": "english", "review": "I will start this review by saying that I am biased.

It does lack some of the more traditional dating sim tropes like many unlockable cg's and 'romantic' dates but this didn't bother me.

I've played a lot, a LOOOT of VNs, more than my fair share, and this one is really excellent. The writing is strong, especially the dialogue (where VNs often struggle), and the characters are all likable in different ways. The music is great, and the art is striking and well-composed. The character builder is a nice touch, and inclusive in a way that was unexpected. Mostly, though, what kept popping up in my head was \"I wish more games did this\" or \"I can't believe I don't see this more often\", usually in regards to the way characters interacted and handled each other. Oh, and the minigames were really fun without being intrusive or twee.\n\nCriticisms: It feels very short, especially if you just pursue the character you most desire (common practice in VNs). The voice acting is mostly well-done, but occasionally a noise will come in at an odd time, and the sound quality for Hugo's lines seems off. The game's world can feel too perfect at times, which can break immersion. I also sometimes felt like the PC was behaving in ways that I didn't think made sense, or saying things that were against what I was trying to build. Some moments felt like they needed more time to develop and explore, which made the pacing occasionally shaky. On a more minor note, I do wish there were more than one heavyset romance option, rather than different hues of \"athletic\".\n\nOverall, I recommend this pretty strongly, even to those who don't necessarily play Visual Novels all that often, or who might think the genre is too cutesy or \"airport romance novel\"-esque.

Every single route of this game I've loved, I haven't disliked any of the dads despite them being so different and they all bring different assets to the table (I can't tell you what cause that will spoil the game)\nI love the dialogue, the choices, the relationship you have with amanda (your daughter) and with all the dads. \nYou can choose if you're bi, pan or whatever or if you're gay, you can be cis or trans and theres a canon trans character in the game. The best part is, try and figure out which one cause its not a big deal at all in the game.\n\nI think the best part is that you have a feeling going in to date all this guys. I did. I adored Robert and Craig and wasn't a big fan of Brian and Joseph. After I played them though I had way different opinions! You don't get the usual stereotypes and many of their and their childrens actions is understandable and something you'll feel an emotional connection to once you've played the routes but not before. i thought a lot of their kids were rather annoying and just a bummer, but once I had played their routes I felt for them in every epilogue when I saw them and had gone with a different dad.\n\nMy favourite? Hugo Vegas and his son by far, a really heartwarming route with surprises but most importantly I had low expectations for him. Brian and Roberts were also routes i greatly enjoyed. But how could i forget Damien? Joseph..Matt... Actually I think Craig was the one that failed me the most after having actually played it.\nPersonally I am a fan of NSFW work and the game is great, 10/10 without it, but I would have liked, as in some other games, the option to have it available. Not necesarilly through pictures and choices but just a bit more narative or choice to ingage. \n\nAlso the choices pull just the right amount of weight. This is not a game about who you'll end up with, that is entierly on who you want to romance and is a straightforward choice. But if you succeed. I tried, a little to many times with Robert and it's really intresting that there is a red thread on how to act through all the dads. \nFor example (hints of spoilers ahead)\nRobert is not only looking for sex (god damn it dad who said i should sleep with him on the first night) and enjoys silent and lack of bullshit\nWant Brian? Dont try to be sexy, make dumb dad jokes instead!\nMatt? Don't pressure him, he needs his own pace.\n\nThe mini games are also a good addition to the game that keeps you ingage and alert, and are sometimes tricky if you want the achievments. The artstyle is right up my alley, soundtrack is good and subtle. colours happy and bright and the writing goofy and heartwarming.\nIts not that deep and doesn't have any more special prompt. Even though I like deep games I greatly enjoy the lack of prompt apart from the character stories, it doesnt need more prompt! Dating is hard enough on its own, and you're a dad too!\nThis is probably one of my top games of all time. 10/10\n\n(sorry for the spelling, I only have native spellcheck on my computer)", "timestamp_created": 1576941682, "timestamp_updated": 1576941682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60221962": {"recommendationid": "60221962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306829459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1576911239}, "language": "english", "review": "It's nice seeing more representation of LGBTQ+ in gaming. Also helps that this game is so enchantranizing to play. Seriously, lost track of time. Wasn't until my dog was whining (he's scared of the dark) that I realized that it was 1230 am. I would suggest starting this in the morning so you don't accidentally stay up till the unforgivable hours of the night playing this game such as myself. (If you couldn't tell I went with Damien for my first play through, & my only play through as of now).\nAnother thing I've noticed is that I do actually want to play this more than once, something I've noticed I typically don't experience with other dating simulators like this.\nThe design of this game in general is very pleasing to the eye no matter where you are at in the game, from characters to mini-games, even the music & sound effects. \nThe voice actors did an excellent job with their roles, you can feel the emotion even though their parts often come in short whiffs, it truly brings the characters to life more than they already are.\nThe dialogue feels real, genuine, & natural, the situations you face feel like something that could actually happen in real life. From awkward moments of not knowing what to do or say to the romantic, sweet gestures of kindness from the characters lines.\nThe backgrounds don't feel like they were hashed out together in a jiffy. As if they were just as important as the characters themselves. Everything was of equal importance in this game when it comes to quality.\nFinally, let's talk about the characters themselves. Like I said, everything is of high quality when it comes to this game & the characters are no exception.
