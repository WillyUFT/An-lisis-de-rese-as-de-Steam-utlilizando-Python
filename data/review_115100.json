However, as it was Halloween recently, I decided to give it another go and was very glad I did.  I ended up playing through the main game and the Grubbins on Ice expansion, which is included in the Steam release.\n\nIt's a perfect game to play at this time of the year, with its Halloween theme and Autumn colour palette.  It's an extremely well-crafted, but simple, RPG that I really enjoyed playing through.  I'd definitely recommend using a controller.\n\nThe combat can become a little monotonous, but the trick is to use different costumes and battle cards, which spice things up a bit.  In fact, you will definitely need to adjust your strategy here for the boss fights after losing, picking costumes and battle cards that give you the best chance of surviving the battle and defeating your foe.", "timestamp_created": 1699554653, "timestamp_updated": 1699554653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149748798": {"recommendationid": "149748798", "author": {"steamid": "76561199200439425", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 510, "last_played": 1699433754}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1699433844, "timestamp_updated": 1699433844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149686292": {"recommendationid": "149686292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009966841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 305, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1700431995}, "language": "english", "review": "Roses are Red\nViolets are Blue\nI played this game in Halloween\nAnd fuck you", "timestamp_created": 1699328423, "timestamp_updated": 1699328460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149622110": {"recommendationid": "149622110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392624491", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1699232304}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow Very cool!

Super simple gameplay complemented by its smart and witty Psychonaut-esque dialogue. At its detriment, the gameplay cycle might become repetitive as for its story: nothing that'd win you over.\n\nGameplay (1.25/2): Gameplay felt repetitive, which is something I wasn't particularly bothered by. The first half of the game I found myself enjoying the new gameplay mechanics as they slowly built themselves into newer areas. But then after I understood the gameplay loop and knew what to expect. Its a serviceable pokemon-like.\n\nStory (1.5/2): Its like Mario trying to get Princess Peach but built by guilt and candy. Simple, classic. Not really my tea, but it serves the Halloween spirit well.\n\nWriting (1.75/2): The best way to describe the writing is quirky, fun, and funn-y. Its no surprise the developers of Psychonauts serve a similar level of quality here.\n\nVisuals (2/2): For a game that's 12 years old, no other is spookier.\n\nAudio (1/2): Charming simple music that often repeats itself, same goes for its SFX.

I had enough fun to peak my curiosity to try the second game, but if it is exactly the same as this game, I probably won't get too far through it, so I'm hoping for a more fresh experience on the next one, otherwise it'll be shelved permanently. \n\nVerdict: give it a go if the price is reasonable, but don't expect to be blown away, just expect a simple side-track from the countless better games you will have on steam. I definitely wouldn't recommend this game if you want to be challenged, as this game is ridiculously easy.", "timestamp_created": 1687618692, "timestamp_updated": 1687618692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140599841": {"recommendationid": "140599841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091784708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2175, "last_played": 1667608659}, "language": "english", "review": "quite literally the best game i have ever played", "timestamp_created": 1687589861, "timestamp_updated": 1687589861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612903177738189697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140465091": {"recommendationid": "140465091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142522142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1687823092}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my all time favorite games.

After picking one of them to be \"in charge\" (be a playable character), other sibling gets kidnapped by a monster, forcing you to save them and get home before curfew!\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nCostume Quest is a small sized RPG where you and your party explore, complete quests and participate in turn based combat! Goal is to save your sibling by completing main quests across different locations to further progress in the story.\n\nBecause it's a Halloween themed title, it features elements fitting into said celebration. Throughout the game you collect loads of candy from combat, exploration or trick-and-treating, with these sweet treats exchanged for battle stamps that grant you new abilities or improve certain aspects of your characters.\n\nMain aspect of the game lies within costumes. Used by your party members, they feature special powers helpful during exploration and offer different abilities for combat. While some are story related, you can collect more of them by exploring areas to gather costume parts, and with proper schematics you will unlock new shiny outfits in no time.\n\nDuring exploration you can complete side quests or engage in combat against monsters.\nHere costumes your characters are wearing become giant versions of themselfs, coming with different statistics.\nCombat is turn based, your party performs actions you choose, then your opponents.\nIt's pretty simple, you can select and attack certain enemy, block to receive less damage, or use a special move if you can as it requires few turns to load.\nActions are connected to quick time events where hitting a button or combination at a right time deals biggest damage possible or lets you receive less from enemies.\nAt the end of the fight (if you won) you collect experience points and candy.\nLeveling up system is very basic as collecting enough xp to earn a level up simply upgrades your health and damage you deal.\n\n[b]Playtime and replayability[/b]\nCompleting everything game had to offer in one playthrough took me 5 hours!\nThis is more of a \"one and done\" snack, unless you want to complete some side quests or achievements you missed, no real reason to replay it in my book.\n\n[b]Pros and cons[/b]\nEnjoyable turn based combat is easy to figure out and with costumes having a role in how it plays out, there is a nice layer of strategy surrounded in picking them and battle stamps to find your winning method. Simple RPG mechanics including progression system, okay variety of side quests and basic storyline will keep your interest for those few hours you spend with a title. Plus whole Halloween theme with good visual style has certain charm surrounding it. \n\nOn a bit more \"eh\" side, game could use a bit more polish. Controls in certain moments during exploration are clunky, and combat animations get quickly repetitive as each costume has only one of these per attack.\nAdditionally game takes a moment to fill up your party so if you, like me, go for side stuff before moving into main bits, you might have a frustrating time dealing with number disadvantage during combat. Fortunately once your party is full, odds become equal! \n\nUltimately it's a good and short yet nothing spectacular title. It does what it should and nothing more.\n\n[b]Final words and conclusion[/b]\nPC version automatically comes with \"Grubbins on Ice\" DLC which continues the story of our little heroes after events from main game, so be sure to check it out!\n\nCostume Quest doesn't excel in any area but its turn based combat, exploration and story provide decent entertainement for evening or two.\n\nFeel free to check out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/] my curator page [/url] for more reviews!", "timestamp_created": 1685814021, "timestamp_updated": 1685814364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715468227863311768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139343004": {"recommendationid": "139343004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986006261", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1685277949}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty simple yet has decent depth in terms of mechanics, the core loop of the combat is repetitive but there is enough variety in terms of costumes that it dosent get boring.

Everyone looked so cute in it, but my favorite part was seeing how badass they were in the fighting scenes. I even laughed sometimes because I completely forgot how crazy and cool kids' imaginations can be. Using different costumes (each having special attacks) made the otherwise repetitive battle system (click a button to fight/parry) more interesting, too!\n\n(-) Nothing significantly negative to spoil my joy, but the active quest journal could've been more specific.

It has some nice rpg elements that arent difficult at all, also only ever was sprinting everywhere because you move slow. Would only recommend to play on a steam deck and just picking it up here and there. Was easy to follow the story even with all the pauses I had when playing on the steam deck. I would rate the game in the following categories. At the end of the rating is my steam deck settings since i played on the steam deck.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b] Engagement-2.5/5[/b] The combat is exceptionally simple so was mostly sprinting from one location to the other. I was also playing on a steam deck for 90% of the game, When I played the Grubbins on Ice story quickly rushed it on pc since it was getting pretty repetitive of a game.\n\n[b]World-2.5/5[/b] The art style still holds up even for a game released back in 2010. The cartoon style of the game reminds me of like a nintendo game of the past. The few different areas you can explore are nice and different from each other so its nice to explore the whole map areas.\n\n[b]Game play-2/5[/b] The game is simplistic in its combat only having attack and special attack, or if you equip a stamp a stamp attack. Even if you lose in a fight because of RNG you can just immediately attempt the fight again. Great for the younger players who are starting to play video games. Also there is costumes that decide how your characters fight Ill be honest its not hard of a game so you can use any set of costumes. I recommend using the robot all the time for sprinting.\n\n[b]Story-3.5/5[/b] The story is nice and short but not to the point where it feels like they are missing out, but it does only have a few key plot points to follow. Easy to remember the story when picking it back up from a break so a plus if you want to play it in short bursts.\n\n[b]Sound-3/5[/b] The music was pretty good but got repetitive since I think there is only one sound track for each zone, and 1 track for the combat counter for each zone. I also played in short bursts of 10 mins each, so cant be sure. Only noticed it because of playing on pc for a little bit.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]C+[/h1] [u]Overall-13.5/25[/u] Tl/dr Easy to play repetitive rpg game that had me use steam inputs to auto sprint.

What it lacks in depth or strategy, it makes up for with charm and atmosphere. I recommend playing this around Halloween, or if you\u2019re new to the genre or gaming in general.\n\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u] A review here on Steam described Costume Quest as \u201cbaby\u2019s first RPG,\u201d and I think that\u2019s an apt summary.  The gameplay is basic and straight forward. You explore little neighborhoods searching for candy by trick-or-treating at houses or smashing objects around the environment. Every house must be visited to progress the story. It\u2019s a linear story, so  there are no branching storylines, and no decisions to make in conversations.\n\nThe candy can be used to purchase Battle Stamps, which are equipped to your characters to add an ability or effect in battle. One stamp can be assigned per party member.\n\nOf course, Costume Quest is all about the costumes. Costumes must be crafted by finding the materials needed around the world. Most costumes will give you an ability you can use while exploring the world, allowing you to reach new destinations that would otherwise be blocked. Each costume will also give you  a different ability in battle. I thought the costumes were handled well given how simple the game is.\n\nSpeaking of battles, the turn-based system is very simple. On your turn, you can either attack with your basic attack, use your special if you\u2019ve charged your meter, or flee the encopunter. You charge your meter every three turns. If you have a battle stamp ability, you can use that too. The limited combat options give you very little room to experiment or strategize. It\u2019s just very straightforward. I actually lost a couple of battles, so there\u2019s \u201csome\" skill involved, but it\u2019s minimal. (Basically, you just need to make sure you're succeeding on the quicktime events.) And if you lose, you spawn right before the battle, so it\u2019s no big deal.\n\nThe one thing about combat that makes it feel more engaging is the quicktime events. Every attack (and defense) you make requires a quicktime event to maximize its effectiveness. These are not combo heavy events. You either have to time a button press at a certain point, or react fast enough to press a button in a limited time window. While I felt this feature dramatically helped the gameplay feel more interesting, I actually think this could be frustrating for a new or younger gamer because the windows are pretty small. And if you\u2019re not familiar with gaming button layouts, there isn\u2019t enough time to look down and check what button you need to click. Obviously for any experienced gamer this isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nCharacter stats are minimal: Health and Attack Power. That\u2019s it. No dodging, defense, critical chance, etc. It\u2019s very simple. Characters heal to full health after each encounter.\n\nThere is also a mini game about bobbing for apples. You simply eat enough ripe apples before the timer ends. If you complete all three tiers you\u2019ll get a card to add to your collection. Cards are collected throughout the game. I don\u2019t believe they impact the game at all. They\u2019re just collectibles.\n\nThe game takes around 5 hours to complete. Outside of going back to gather collectibles you missed, there's not really any reply value. There is also an included DLC called Grubbins on Ice, which is probably 2+ hours of extra game and story.\n\nOverall the gameplay is basic and simple. It\u2019s at a level a new or younger gamer would find appropriate (assuming they know their way around a controller for the quick time events).\n\n\n[u]User Interface:[/u] The UI is artistically consistent with the rest of the game with its hand-drawn aesthetic. The text uses a hand-drawn font, and action prompts are colorful and squiggly. The inventory menu is presented as a notebook, so the whole game looks like it was designed by a kid (in a good way).\n\nThe speech bubbles auto-continue conversations. I found the speed of the text to be fine, but it would have been nice to have an option to slow them down in case you wanted to read a little slower.\n\nThe key bindings are also remappable, which is good.\n\n[u]Atmosphere:[/u] Let\u2019s face it, this is probably why you want to play the game, and it\u2019s why I recommend it. When have you ever seen a game literally about trick-or-treating? It\u2019s a cute, wholesome experience of Halloween that celebrates this fun holiday of childhood. The whole game is presented from a kid\u2019s point of view. From the hand-drawn artstyle, to the conversations, to the battles.\n\nThe premise is: Your sibling is stolen by a candy-stealing goblin, and in order to advance your rescue mission quest, you need to collect candy by trick-or-treating to unlock the goblin gates and fight an evil witch...because if you come home without your sibling, you\u2019ll be grounded by your parents. This totally sounds like a story some little kids would come up with! All of these monster encounters take place right in the middle of civilization, and none of the adults believe you when you tell them these monsters are out and about. The casual dismissal of the adults is the kind of humor and thematic consistency that plays throughout the game.\n\nThe battles are also pretty cute. Depending on your costume, when you enter battle you will transform into an epic version of that costume. When you\u2019re a kid and you dress up for Halloween, part of the fun is make-believing that you really are this awesome robot, or you really are a powerful knight. The translation of this young mindset to a video game works really well here, and reminds me of the fun times I had growing up with Halloween!\n\nThe music is very Cartoony. I believe there is a term in music composition called \u201cMickey Mousing\u201d -- when you write music very on-the-nose to line up with hits and beats in the cartoon. The soundtrack has that kind of vibe. There is a foreboding jolting character with a light-hearted instrumentation. And the battle music has kind of a huffing-and-puffing fast pace to it. I guess it all sounds like a B-Horror film. It\u2019s nothing memorable, and on its own I would find it annoying. But it works well with the game.\n\n[u]Conclusion:[/u] Costume Quest is able to pull off a worthwhile experience despite its simple gameplay because of its strong atmospheric foundation. It\u2019s commitment to presenting Halloween from that of a kid whose having fun going on an epic quest to get candy succeeds throughout its design. This is not a complicated game to play. A younger player may find this appropriate, and older gamers could find this boring. But I think if you go into it knowing what to expect, you\u2019ll enjoy your time being a kid again, trick-or-treating on Halloween.

Now, while I could just set my comp's date to that and cheeze the cheevo, I wanna see if I'll be able to remember to play the game on the actual day. (Edit: 12/25/2022, 12:12AM; Not even sleep deprivation could make me forget this game! Got the hundo legit!) So, having gotten all the other cheevos already, here's my review:\nArt: For a game that was published in 2010, the art has aged really well. I mean it. Lots of games made more recently have aged so much worse, and I'm pretty sure it's because of this game's art style. So, the art's good.\nWriting: Great! Mostly comedy, with some nice family moments (no spoilers, ya gotta play it for yourself).\nAudio/Music: Music is a bit on the sparse side, but the ambient sounds of a night of trick-or-treating does add to the atmosphere. Audio balance and audio effects are good enough.\nGameplay: Simplistic, not exactly challenging, but still rewarding when you figure things out on your own. Yes the game drops hints to its puzzles and puzzle fights, but it's still not truly holding your hand. The game itself is a bit short, but honestly it's a bit of a relief to play a short RPG since most RPGs tend to run long.\nEnding: I've decided to start adding this as a ranking parameter because I'm really tired of games with lousy endings. Bad endings make a game worse, even though they have nothing to do with much of any of a game except the writing and maybe the art. And honestly, I've played way too many games with really terribly done endings. That said, this game has a good ending in my opinion. Well done.\n\nIn conclusion: I do recommend playing this game. Yes it was made for kids in 2010, but it's good clean fun that can enjoyed by anyone of any age.\n\nSide note: played this today to fulfill a promise. When I got this game, I told myself I'd reserve it for when I was having a terrible Halloween week and needed that week improved. And, well, here I am now. My Halloweek has been improved!

I love to be engaged mechanically with this hobby, but that doesn't detract from the possibility of finding compelling experiences that are more atmosphere than action. Take Costume Quest, for example. It's hardly got any depth for an rpg. It's very brief - comprised of three short main areas. There's nothing epic or serious in tone about it. It comes off as more of a \"baby's first rpg\" in terms of overall weight, but it has such a wonderful sense of charm. What could - to most Americans anyway - be more relatable than being a kid going in search of candy on Halloween? (although that convention seems to be waning along with many others, for better or worse) And that backdrop, with the sense of mystery and foreboding intrinsic to the holiday, along with the excitement of becoming another character for the evening, is the perfect setting for an imaginative adventure that has the potential to reconnect you with the spirit of your own youth. Giving the various collectible costumes powers and personalities of their own is an excellent idea that I found to be really playful and intuitive. The combat itself, while dreadfully simple and offering very little challenge, was nonetheless enjoyable because I was so absorbed by this light-hearted tale of being a kid on adventure on my most favorite of holidays. While Costume Quest may lack substance, much like the vacuous treats associated with the holiday, it was similarly sweet and delicious while it lasted. 4/5", "timestamp_created": 1649355560,

Each costume has a regular attack and a special attack that might do extra damage, heal party members or provide protection. Battle badges can be swapped in and out to provide extra advantages. You explore, collect and fight your way through several areas of your town in search of your sibling.\n\nThe gameplay is uncomplicated, and not too challenging - there's no game overs, if your group loses a battle, you can simply try again.

Originally released in 2010 on 7th generation consoles, it made its way to PC about a year later, with the Grubbins on Ice DLC included.\n\nThe game itself was born out of an \u201cAmnesia Fortnight\u201d; a session within Double Fine Productions that focused on quickly creating prototypes and potential game ideas. I recently spent a week at my job doing something similar, which was a ton of fun. It\u2019s an opportunity to forget about the unchanging day-to-day work, and focus on simply being creative without restrictions. The final product here is extremely reminiscent of such a brainstorming session: imaginative and filled with energy, but also occasionally missing some details that aren\u2019t entirely thought out.\n\nDespite it\u2019s immediate charm, I was a little unimpressed with the technical fidelity of Costume Quest. No, a game like this isn\u2019t meant to be a graphical showcase, but there could have been some nicer details and textures throughout. The art style itself is great; the characters themselves look good, and most objects in the environment are well modelled. Being a game that takes place on Halloween, the locales of a suburb and mall make sense, but many sections in each hub area simply feel barren, especially with a lack of strong ambient music. Even the additional area in the DLC offers a very flat and colourless atmosphere, which isn\u2019t fun to play through. And while this is a slow, turn-based game that doesn\u2019t require an ultra-high framerate, the 30 FPS cap is annoying.\n\nIt can be easy to overlook these visual faults however, because the game endlessly oozes charm. Every other NPC you talk to will share some cheeky dialogue or pop culture reference which made me chuckle. Even some of the victory animations after combat encounters are hilarious. Honestly, I\u2019d say this game masterfully delivers consistent comedy. It\u2019s like bam, funny quip, bam, funny costume, etc, but not in an overbearing way. Rather, a way that leaves a smile on the players face and keeps them feeling cozy throughout. Despite the simple and childish appearance, I was invested in Wren and Reynold\u2019s story, and was always eager to find out where their ridiculous adventure was headed next.\n\nBesides running around and completing a random assortment of quests, the main gameplay loop involves engaging enemies in turn-based combat. It\u2019s a pretty mindless and easy system, which suits this game in my opinion. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of turn-based combat to begin with, and unless it\u2019s something like Pok\u00e9mon where there are all these unique types and memorable monsters, I don\u2019t want a slow combat system to get in the way of story and exploration. Admittedly, the combat could have been improved with a little more complexity, just to offer some more interactivity for the player. After about an hour or two into the game, I immediately went into autopilot mode at the start of every combat encounter. I also thought equipping different costumes was a bit of a chore. I wanted to use all of them in combat, but speeding around in the robot costume was easiest; as is forgetting to change it before encountering an enemy.\n\nI give Costume Quest a 7.0/10. Despite a few flaws, it\u2019s a good game and a cute, unique experience. I definitely recommend picking up during any Steam sale where it regularly gets discounted for a couple bucks, and I highly recommend adding this anyone\u2019s yearly Halloween media consumption.", "timestamp_created": 1641652261, "timestamp_updated": 1641652261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107479616": {"recommendationid": "107479616", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992660110", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1752, "last_played": 1641507248}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo, sin duda para el precio que tiene, son una horas de diversion muy buenas.", "timestamp_created": 1641507361, "timestamp_updated": 1641507361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107462716": {"recommendationid": "107462716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142696784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1641491357}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1641491459, "timestamp_updated": 1665435982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486486494541168213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107198512": {"recommendationid": "107198512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352736321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1698520014}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really fun game with great replayability.

During battle scenes, you will transform into whatever your cardbox/tinfoil/rags costume depicts and have basic moves as well as special ones for each costume to defeat your opponents (some are standard support characters, healing and buffing party members, other rely on attacking either through leeching life out of enemies or delivering high-powered blows).\nOn the negative side, I would say that its main flaw is that combat can get a bit repetitive after awhile and you have to force yourself to switch costumes regularly in order to find diversity instead of sticking with the awesome combination that the initial costumes can provide and mostly carry you throughout the game... there isn't much depth in the progression and leveling up of the characters but then again this game isn't meant to be a \"true\" RPG. \nEven with the Winter/Christmas DLC, reaching 100% completion (finding every secret and costume) didn't take me more than 8hrs, but, at the low price it goes for, that aspect is hardly a fault.", "timestamp_created": 1640547405, "timestamp_updated": 1640547405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703801453113555908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106544755": {"recommendationid": "106544755", "author": {"steamid": "76561199211846531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1571, "last_played": 1634266974}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most charming games I've ever played and for that I have to give it high marks.

Costume Quest is truly a joy to play from beginning to end, DLC included. Getting 100% is quite easy and will mostly be awarded unnoticed as long as you play it in the right season. The play time is right for the price and in general the knows when to cut you off. \n\nI loved the story and think that is the main focus here. The is fun gameplay and other great things to the game but its narrative first. I wont spoil anything but its your classic, quirky and funny writing you expect with double fine and it is linear.  The base game ends just fine on its own and the included DLC leads into the second title. The story leads you on nicely meshing in the right level of gameplay for this style.\n\nI want to touch on difficulty and gameplay as well. It is not a hard game but thats okay. Its plenty engaging and the different costumes plus stickers make building your team enjoyable! Young audiences should be able to beat the game with little struggle and due to the clean nature of the game it would be a great game to show young family. The different traversal skills make exploration worthwhile too!\n\nFinally the art and music. The soundtrack is perfectly fitting and puts you in the mood. I wouldn't say its anything id listen to out of game but its great to enhance the gameplay. Also the graphics hold up great in my opinion! I would be happy with the art style even if it came out very recently. The transformations, effects, and environments all look amazing!\n\n[b]In conclusion:[/b] If your looking for a fun seasonal story there is no better game!

I recently lived in a country where Halloween is not widely observed, and when locals asked about it\u2019s appeal, everything I would name can be found in Costume Quest. \n\nRegarding gameplay, this is a very simple turn-based RPG in which you and the neighborhood kids adventure through town to rescue your twin sibling from candy-swiping monsters. This is a fantastic introduction to the genre if the player is young or just inexperienced with RPGs (like I was during my first playthrough). Your party member\u2019s stats are clearly spelled out as a combination of their costume and one stamp, and battles tend to favor the player through little things like always letting you go first, allowing you to make attacks of opportunity but not the enemy, and generous save and checkpoints. Outside of battle, you\u2019ll explore 3 areas (plus 1 with the \u201cGrubbins on Ice\u201d postgame) with side-quest staples like fetch quests, item trading, and exploration using costume abilities. \n\nThe only knock I can really give this game is that if you have anything beyond beginner experience with RPGs, then you may find Costume Quest far too easy. It isn\u2019t hard to pick out the best party build, which means many of your costumes will be used once for an achievement before you switch back to a team that steamrolls through encounters. On the other hand, it\u2019s hard to fault something made with children in mind for being too simple: the real appeal for adults will be the nostalgia, art direction, and the Double Fine brand of goofy humor. \n\nI\u2019d place Costume Quest as a kind of light-hearted and charming Halloween work that can be enjoyed every year when the season rolls around, just like watching \u201cIt\u2019s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\u201d or \u201cThe Nightmare Before Christmas\u201d.

The first time I played it was on console, and eventually I got it on steam. I recently revisited this title and had nothing but fun. This game is one of those rare gems that actually is for everyone. Whether you're young or old, most of us usually love Halloween for one reason or another. This story capitalizes on that, and leans into the concept of \"what if we really became what our costumes are?\".  A single player experience that lasts at least 6-8 hours of gameplay, where you trick or treat, save the world, and learn the meaning of friendship and family.

For all its wit and whimsy, as an RPG, it\u2019s just not all that fun.\n\tPredictably, Costume Quest\u2019s gameplay is broken up into its overworld exploration and its combat. Moving through the overworld is agreeable enough for the most part. You\u2019ll talk to the endearing denizens and take on basic side-quests. But it becomes clear repetition is quite prevalent. Three main locales comprise the main adventure, and you\u2019ll go through the same tasks \u2013 find trading cards for characters, bob for apples, knock on doors for candy, and repeat. Some areas require use of your costumes\u2019 particular skills, such as using the knight costume\u2019s shield to protect yourself from falling debris. It\u2019s all basic stuff, but inoffensive and acceptable had Costume Quest managed to engage more in its combat.\n\tBut therein lies the real problem. Costume Quest\u2019s combat is dreary within a few bouts and brain-dead soon after. You can get away with wailing on foes with high attack costumes from the very first fight all the way through to the credits. Once I cemented my strategy \u2013 and to call it a strategy is generous \u2013 it carried me all the way, save for exchanging one piece of equipment for the final boss because of its immunity to a status effect. The combat never evolves or challenges, and it makes for a tedious quest. Costume Quest\u2019s fatal flaw is not its repetitive gameplay loop, even with its brevity \u2013 rather, it\u2019s a failure to find a compelling hook for said loop.\n\tAt least the presentation fares better. While it\u2019s disappointing there\u2019s only one battle theme, the soundtrack is whimsical and pleasant, with a strong balance of silliness and wonder to capture the spirit of a child\u2019s Halloween quest. The art style and character design is unmistakably Double Fine, and that\u2019s just dandy. The colorful environments, chunky models, and cel-shading make Costume Quest stand out, though you may want to bring the brightness up a few notches in the options menu. When you stop at a house for trick-or-treating, that house\u2019s lights go out, making  it easier to keep track of where you\u2019ve been, which is all the better since I still got a tad turned around, as the environments can blend together.\n\tThe writing stands out for its wit, with humor akin to a Peanuts skit. I always looked forward to a new area primarily for what the locals would have to say. The world and characters are immediately appealing, though I wish the protagonists were allowed more development.\n\tThe Grubbins on Ice expansion is pretty much more of the same, with a large but linear setting which still falls prey to a repetitive loop. Pretty much any of my critiques and praises for the main quest could be echoed here.\n\tCostume Quest could be so much more, but it\u2019s simply not fun to play. Double Fine has a cozy world here accompanied by clever writing, but this isn\u2019t a quest worth taking.", "timestamp_created": 1628348337, "timestamp_updated": 1628348337, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495764285326004028", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97023594": {"recommendationid": "97023594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198818719875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1213, "last_played": 1628311290}, "language": "english", "review": "gaming", "timestamp_created": 1628221691, "timestamp_updated": 1628668429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461323410272598267", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97003813": {"recommendationid": "97003813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341447360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1628252500}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego muy divertido, los di\u00e1logos tienen mucha tira c\u00f3mica.

With trick-or-treating, costumes, apple bobbing, sweets and monsters. It's so good that, close to Oct 31st 2020, I posted this game on social media and suggested parents buy this for their kids as a substitute as trick-or-treating was banned due to the pandemic.\n \nThe plot (no spoilers here) is that it's Halloween you are a child going out trick-or-treating. Until you notice all the sweets are being stolen by real monsters. Your sibling, who is dressed as a candy corn, is mistaken for a real one and \"stolen\" as well. You then embark on a quest to track them to their lair, save your sibling and the sweets.\n\nThe gameplay is split wandering through various environments and combating monsters.\nIn one there are main quests, side quests, mini games, some puzzle solving and new costumes to collect. You also need to collect sweets from houses and there's a chance you'll either be confronted by a candy-giving adult or a monster you need to combat, it's trick-or-treating with a bit of role reversal.\nIn combat, you transform into a real version of the costume you are wearing and engage in turn based combat with your enemy. \nAt first I didn't think I would like combat that was slow paced and required no more effort then choosing an action and pressing a key once. But the game made it more interesting, on top of selecting your attack you need to press a key at the right time to make it more effective, the key is randomly selected each time and different attacks have different uses of keys. Also, you can block enemy attacks which also involve timing and random keys. All this means that even though it's turn based it keeps you on your toes. I also loved seeing the fighter versions of these costumes, your in for a surprise when you deploy the fries mascot costume.\n\nThere are also \"Creepy Treats\" cards to collect. Supposedly they are like baseball cards for various fictional sweets. They don't do anything and some might complain they are just there to lure completionists. But I liked the crazy sweet ideas they came up with. But also, if you collect them all you unlock an overpowered costume.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses you can find yourself really overpowered and unless you are fighting a boss, which happens rarely, it's no challenge for you. In fact, with the right costumes and upgrades, most of the fighting is little challenge at all. But then again it is for kids.\n\nAlso, the plot is really straight forward. It turns out there there is no master plan, just monsters stealing sweets.

The costumes themselves are pretty well designed, and hunting down all of the components needed to piece together some of the stranger outfits is rewarding when you see them come to life in combat.\n\nBeyond selecting which moves to dish out, there's a simple quick-time element where attacks and blocks are boosted by tapping the corresponding key with precise timing. While it's not a very complex system, there's just enough depth to keep enemy encounters interesting. \nSome costumes are offensive powerhouses, while others play supportive roles in combat similar to a Job system seen in some Final Fantasy titles. Each suit's special ability charges with every round, letting you unleash special attacks ranging from a missile barrage to the most Star-spangled Healing move i've ever seen in a game (when you see it you'll know). As great as the costumes are on their own, picking up collectible battle stamps also lets you boost each character's power with different buffs, again putting an appropriate spin on the concept to suit the tone & setting. \n\nThis version includes the Grubbins on Ice DLC which is a welcome piece of additional content.

The game is sweet, funny, and in that way that only Double Fine games tend to be, utterly, utterly charming. Its simplistic magic will be lost on many gamers, but if you grew up with an SNES controller in your hand and a JRPG (particularly EarthBound) illuminating your bedroom or livingroom, Costume Quest will put a mile-wide grin of pure, childhood elation on your face. One could argue validly that that is not reason enough to say it's the best game of the year, but my reasons are enigmatic even to me sometimes. All I know is that I don't always value the things that are necessarily the best.

Once I started it and was thoroughly confused, I realized I never played the DLC epilogue for Costume Quest so I figured I better finish that up first. \n\nI also figured I might as well talk about how much I like Costume Quest! It's a short, simple, fun little Halloween adventure perfect for a break between all the spooky games I torture myself with every October. It's super cute. The characters are super likable. The concept of hiding random encounters in houses to trick-or-treat is really funny to me. And the ridiculous kaiju-sized turn based battles have some spectacularly silly animations and attacks.\n\nThere's not a lot of depth to the battle system; instead of keeping you engaged with varied abilities and tactics, Costume Quest relies more on simple back and forth Paper Mario style action-commands and one slowly charging special move. I can see why someone would find it a bit too slight, but I thought the battles moved at a good clip and the mixing and matching costumes and battle stamps gave me enough of a basic tactical bent for my JRPG addled brain.\n\nIt probably goes without saying but the writing is really good. Double Fine games almost always have really good writing so I've come to expect it, but it's not like really good writing just magically appears in the game so kudos on the writing team once again. It's unfortunate though that the game's dialogue text auto-advances; it'd be fine if the adventure was voiced, but it's (understandably) not. It didn't overly impact me, but that's definitely an accessibility concern for slower readers.\n\nStill, Costume Quest is definitely a cheap and wonderful little treat, perfect for October. Now to speed through the sequel before I run out of spooky month.\n\nPlaytime corner: I have no idea why Steam thinks I spent 110 hours on Costume Quest.

That is until you run into some alie- er, I mean, Repugians, who are hell bent on taking all the candy in your neighborhood, including your sibling who\u2019s dressed as a candy corn. It\u2019s time to team up with some new friends to save your sibling and Halloween in Costume Quest.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1][i]Nice Halloween story, with an added cool use for costumes.[/i]\n\nAs noted in the intro, the story is centered around Halloween, with two siblings getting ready to go Trick-or-Treating, until you run into some weird creatures that kindaps one of the siblings and steals candies from the neighborhood. In general, it\u2019s a simple story to understand, has plenty of humor on the way and puts a nice reminder on what a fun night of Halloween should be. Having kids enjoying Trick or Treating in costumes with their friends and parents/guardians.\n\nA bonus plus that should be noted is the use of costumes in this game. Not only is there a nice variety, but each can help you explore your surroundings, be used to help you in battles against the enemy, and they each have their different strengths and special moves that provides a nice flash for those looking for an added flare.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1][i]Battles can be potentially unfavored in the beginning.[/i]\n\nThe battle system is fairly simple to get used to and the enemies that you fight provide a good challenge\u2026 as you progress through the game, that is.\n\nEarly on, the enemies fight at almost the same strength as your team. While this does indeed give a good challenge, a false move or bad team combination can cost you a battle very easily. This makes the beginning of the game feel more difficult than necessary. Once you get past the first section, the difficulty starts to lighten up and the rest of the game becomes easier to manage.\n\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1][i]Certain areas aren\u2019t oriented properly.[/i]\n\nCostume Quest doesn\u2019t have any camera movement. As a result, the camera is fixed in an isometric position. For the most part, the camera angle is setup well, with the only exceptions being in situations where you go to the back areas, such as behind a house or in a wooded area. In those areas, there\u2019s a lot of obstruction and the trees aren\u2019t transparent enough for you to get a good view of such areas, thus making it difficult to find hidden goodies.\n\n\nWhile the beginning of the game might be tough to get around, Costume Quest does deliver the rest of the way through it\u2019s story and gameplay. With \u201cyou-know-what\u201d going on around the world, why not enjoy a little Halloween adventure from your living room? Pick this game up and enjoy the ride.\n\n[h1]Developers (Headquarters)[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Double Fine Productions\t(San Francisco, CA)\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1602480769, "timestamp_updated": 1612032797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608541786670684814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77432777": {"recommendationid": "77432777", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962913059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1382, "last_played": 1667374332}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun Halloween game.

It\u2019s a cute idea that has a unique charm with the art style, animations and music.\nBeing an RPG, there are main and side quests to do, \u201crandom\u201d battles (the enemies have fixed locations), a leveling system and lots of stuff to collect, giving you more costumes and abilities. It\u2019s designed in a way that it\u2019s not grindy at all, and by just going for 100% completion, which is not hard at all, you\u2019ll reach max level and have enough candies, the game currency, to buy all abilities. It\u2019s really a treat (pun intended) going for 100% completion, the game almost feels designed to be played that way, although you can just do the main story and be fine, since combat is easy. It\u2019s basically a turn-based system with some timing-based attacks and limited special abilities. But this simplicity works well enough.\nIt\u2019s also short, around 8-10 hours even with the included DLC, that acts as an epilogue extra chapter for the main game, and starts by default with the base game max progression, allowing you to further level up and collect even more stuff.

The player controls the playable child in various areas, with more areas available with equipment upgrades.  Battles are the traditional turn-based system.  As opposed to \"classes,\" the player selects costumes for the three party members.  Each costume acts as a class.  The game is very relaxed and is quite suitable for novice gamers.\n\nThose who want a gentle, cute video game experience will find a lot to enjoy with [i]Costume Quest[/i].  It is relatible, simple to play, and has several moments of quirky humor.  \n\nUsing the cut-and-paste RPG system is an acceptable form of game development, but the developers need to bring something unique - a soul - to that system.  Coming from the mind of Tim Schafer, much is to be expected about the spirit and humor of the game.  Simply put, [i]Costume Quest[/i] doesn't have the Tim Schafer spirit.

I'm a huge Double Fine fan, so many of their games have details that go beyond the game you are playing so that's what enticed me to give this game a shot when it went on sale. I'm happy I got it at a discount bc I wouldn't feel right about paying full price for this one. \nThe game has the typical ambiance of a Double Fine game and the artwork is incredible with the score being a bit of a call back to a few of their previous games (inside one store you can hear the camp theme from Psychonauts). The story to the game is alright enough, you have to rescue your twin who was kidnapped by 'monsters' but the issue I have does no lie with the story but with the game play. It becomes incredibly repetitive to go through the motions of a monster encounter since you only have a set amount of moves you can do before you have to wait for your opponent to strike. This isn't my first turn based game but it does lack in comparison to others I have played, it just feels like their are not alot of options so this results in me dreading encounters with the enemy which is sort of a let down. \nI still find myself playing this game even though I can't binge play like I would be able to with The Cave, it is still a fun play that entices me to return just to reach the end and see how they close out the story.

[/h1]\n\nYou know, what\u2019s awesome? Halloween! You know what sucks? It sucks that I live in a country where \u201cHalloween\u201d isn\u2019t really celebrated (I mean we have this thing where kids go around and sing songs for candy but it\u2019s not NEARLY as fun as Halloween). \n\nSo what exactly is Halloween? Well, if you ask my dad, he will say how it\u2019s a stupid American celebration where they celebrate how they burned witches. While that technically may be true, one only needs to play this game to get the true spirit of Halloween. \n\nThe whole point of this holiday is to put on a costume and (if you are a child) go from door to door and beg for candy, and IT\u2019S AWESOME. Even though I\u2019ve never experienced Halloween myself, I absolutely adore this holiday. I look forward to seeing all the cool costumes people wear, how they decorate their houses, all the scary movies they show, it\u2019s overall just a really great day.\n\n[h1] Cute, colorful, short and made by Tim Schafer [/h1]\n\nCostume Quest isn\u2019t a great game only because it\u2019s based on Halloween. It\u2019s a great game because it\u2019s fun, innocent, creative, colorful and, most importantly, short enough that you can beat it in about one sitting (okay, maybe 2-3 tops). \n\nActually, I was going to cheat my way through this review and base it mainly on everything I remembered about this game, but as I started writing I realized that I had forgotten a lot about it (Last time I played it was back in 2015). I did, however, vividly remember that I had an absolute blast playing through it and even getting all Steam Achievements.  Well, I am happy to say that it took me very little time to remember why I loved this game so much back in 2015.\n\nDid I mention this was made and published by Double Fine productions? Did I mention I also love their games except for a few lousy ones *cough* Brutal Legend *cough* https://store.steampowered.com/app/225260/Brutal_Legend/.\n\n[h1] Trick or treat your way to victory [/h1]\n\nAnyway, Costume Quest is an isometric turn based RPG where you play as a kid that goes around trick or treating. After you select between a brother and a sister, you set out in your cute little costume to go trick or treating. Little do you realize that monsters have invaded your town and they are after the most precious resource of them all: CANDY. Not just that but because your sibling dressed like a giant piece of candy corn, they kidnap him/her as well, so now, not only do you have to go around trick or treating, you have to save your sibling and defeat the monsters. Yeah, it\u2019s safe to say that this is absolutely adorable, for me at least. What can I say? I\u2019m just a sucker for such childish plots.\n\nTthe game consists of a couple of levels. Each level has a set number of quests you have to do. While I don\u2019t wanna waste time talking about how cute all the quests are, the one quest you will have on each level is: Trick or Treating. You will go up to the front door of a house, knock on the door and yell: \u201cTrick or Treat\u201d. Either an adult will open and give you candy OR a monster will open a door and attack you.\n\n[h1] A stylish turn based battle system that's so simple even a child could play it [/h1]\n\nSo now we come to our turn based RPG battles and as much as I want to praise this system, it\u2019s extremely basic. Basic enough that even little kids can get it, which is actually a good thing. Your party consist of 3 characters (You and two more kids that trick or treat with you) and you normally fight up to 3 monsters. So, what can kids do against monsters? Why, use the powers of their costumes of course! Are you dressed like a robot? BAM! You turn into Optimus Prime! Wearing a knight\u2019s armor! BAM! You are a knight the size of a building! Each costume has its own attacks and special abilities and the best part is you can swap them and create new ones as you progress through the game. Each costume also has a special ability that you can use while trick or treating. The battles themselves are just selecting a target and pressing the attack button where you can also do a quick-time-event to attack harder and reduce damage. Yeah, as fun as I might make this sound great, it\u2019s extremely basic, which again, is probably a good thing. \n\n[h1] You might want to use a controller... [/h1]\n\nThe game features cartoony graphics and child-friendly spooky tunes which perfectly set the tone for a Halloween themed game. There is no voice acting and the dialogue boxes sometimes move a bit fast and you don\u2019t get to press a button to advance them, which is weird, so you better get ready to read fast as well. The controls work OK on the keyboard + mouse but I highly recommend you use a controller only because it will make those pesky quick-time-events easier.\n\n[h1] Short but sweet [/h1]\n\nLike I mentioned, the best part about this game is it\u2019s length. Just like Halloween, it\u2019s over before you know it, which, again, is great, for me at least. Look, don\u2019t get me wrong, I love RPGS, they are fantastic. However, whenever I hear the word \u201cRPG\u201d, you know what I think? 100+ hours of gameplay. How awesome is it, that you can beat this RPG in about 5 hours (8 if you do all the extra stuff). For a 30 year old dad who barely has time to play video games anymore, this is absolutely mouth-watering.\n\n[h1] A super fun game [/h1]\n\nJust like all the sweet candy a kid can get in a single Halloween night, Costume Quest is a very sweet game.

Complete sidequests to unlock new costume pieces, collect trading cards, and play hide and seek while beating up trolls and bird-men and tracking down the big bad. The turn-based combat is very easily grasped, as there isn't a lot of depth - there are basic attacks that are dealt by quicktime event (which will still do damage even if you fail), and a special attack or buff  unique to each costume that can be unleashed every few turns. Aside from maybe the late-game bosses, I don't think anyone is likely to have much difficulty in combat. A lot of the fun comes from trying out each costume as you unlock them to see which you like best (and there certainly are a lot of costumes to unlock).\n\nThe sidequests are fairly basic, mostly being completed automatically as a result of following the story, which involves moving from one area to another (your neighbourhood, the local shopping plaza, a showground, etc.) and battling all the monsters there to scare them into moving to the next location til you reach the boss. No crazy twists or anything, it's just a charming and sometimes silly little story about a bunch of kids saving Halloween.\n\n[i]Costume Quest[/i] is not a long game - it took me about 6.5 hours to finish - but I'd say that's a point in it's favour. It's a charming experience, but not very deep, and I think would grow repetitive before long.

The achievements are attainable in a single play through (minus the one where you have to play the game on Christmas day).  The quick time events are very forgiving (to someone who played this while sick and has snail reflexes anyway, that was appreciated).  The plot is entertaining.  You have a surprising degree of control over combat style between the different costumes and battle stickers (skills).  You can use a controller for all in game play and navigation.\n\nCons: Quick time events are the main combat strategy, so if you hate those, you will not enjoy this.  Two of the costume ingredients are very tricky to find without looking up a walk through.  One of the cave puzzles in \"Grubbins on Ice\", is less than intuitive and starts to get frustrating, but since that is in the expansion game and not the main game, I would just look up a walk through at that part.  A mouse is required to navigate the menu, but once you are in game you can use a controller exclusively.\n\nOverall impression: I really enjoyed this game.

The 1st one is that it has no voice, I think this was going to add a very deep flavor to the game not to mention that some of the dialog change fast so you may miss a chunk of it. The 2nd one is avoidable but still using Shift much in battle create problem with Windows which could had been avoided if they choose a different key, still its fixable from options so its half a problem I just thought that the developers could had thought of this, which I guess was done either in a hurry to publish the game or they focused on console and didn't bothered for the PC version much.

One of my favorite games ever! I'm going to go on detail and tell you why! I bought this game and I even bought it for a lot of friends as well because of how much I love it \u2764\ufe0f\n\n1 - First, ignore people that say game is short, repetitive because that's not true!\n\n2 - If you spend enough time in every single area you may find a lot of candy, secrets and finish off even side quests. This work actually means the game is longer, not to mention that you can play the expansion Grubbins on Ice but you can still win the game by skipping and missing a lot of secret costumes, so that's why I said is actually a fair game.\nHere's the full gameplay of the expansion: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/500128368\n\n3 - You can go trick-or-treating! There isn't any cute game out there that you can do this which makes it so unique!\n\n4 - Change costumes and keep discovering new materials for new ones! Their ultimate transformations in battle are astonishing! Great art and fun concepts. \n\n5 - Bad guys turn into Good guys! Who would have thought? Plot is great and surprising! Even the witch boss helps you in the end lol. It's great! \n\n6 - Glowing Pumpkins everywhere and shiny candy even on trash bins lol scavenge and farm because candy is the main currency of game which you can trade for Battle Stamps! They give you an edge in battle, CONSTANTLY changing playstyle which MAKES this game NOT REPETITIVE, a true gamer knows how to play a game strategically. \n\n7 - BOSSES! YEAH you get to defeat a lot of bosses and moving up to new areas! They are very well done! \n\n8 - Play as a girl or boy, it's upto you and the game gives you the choice to make at the beginning. Yup :).\n\n9 - Latest News! They got a Cartoon Series now on Amazon Video yay also, there's the sequel, Costume Quest 2!!\n\n10 - Are you still reading this?

It really brings you into the mind of a 6 year old.\n\nThe Story is about little kids on Halloween, You are twins and you can pick if you want to play the brother or the sister, You need to collect candy in your robot costume while your sibling tags along in a candy costume, this soon turns into a Search and rescue mission when a candy stealing monster thinks your sibling is a real piece of candy.\n\nCandy allows you to buy stuff, Like Stamps which give you stat boosts or other perks in combat, Some stamps can only be obtained by trading other stamps for it, But most of them are for sale at several NPCs, You gain candy by winning battles, Vandalizing property or just pick it up from the ground, Ofcourse you also gain candy by trick or treating, If a good guy opens up you get candy, If a monster opens the door you get into a battle directly.\n\nCostumes do not only change your appearance, They give you special abilities while roaming like rocket skates, Lighting, Shielding, etc. In battles you transform into a real life version of your costume, Each costume has a basic attack and a charged attack which plays a little video when you use it. Some costumes have a third ability for healing or other special abilities. \n\nThe game is very short, it will probably last you around 5 - 10 hours for full completion, But it is very astethicly pleasing and a rewarding experience, It is also very funny maybe a bit dark, But funny nonetheless.\n\nThe battle system is turn based, You use 1 ability or attack with each member of your party every turn. It is not really a challenge, But it still is pretty fun, Getting the right outfits, the right level and the right stamps can be vital to winning certain battles. \n\nThe sidequests are fun, but they repeat themselfes each area, There is no realy challenge, And you will probably complete them without any effort by doing the main quests, This is something the game could have done better, More sidequests, Once you complete the main story there is not much more to do.\n\nOverall the game is amazing, It is an absolute must have, it is a great experience, I have to give it an 9 out of 10, The game is perfect in so many ways, I just wish it had more replay value and more quests.\n\nFollow my Curator Page: \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35216846/\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Steam Cloud Save[/td]\n\t[td]Working fine[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Controller Support[/td]\n\t[td]Yes, Xbox One Bluetooth Working[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Achievements[/td]\n\t[td]Easy, Only 1 date bound achievement[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]FPS on Ultra[/td]\n\t[td]Locked to 60[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Launch Command[/td]\n\t[td]gamemoderun %command%[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Issues[/td]\n\t[td]None[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]OS[/td]\n\t[td]Arch Linux[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Kernel[/td]\n\t[td]5.2.14[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]DE[/td]\n\t[td]Gnome 3.32.2[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]CPU[/td]\n\t[td]Intel I7-6800K @ 4.20Ghz[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]GPU[/td]\n\t[td]Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 (Nvidia 435.21 Drivers)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1568426566, "timestamp_updated": 1568426566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808366477489471436", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55088442": {"recommendationid": "55088442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062006486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1568377987}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Game is cute and fun.

So of course, when I heard of Costume Quest, I went bananas and HAD to have it. I was not disappointed. I adore this game. The characters are well designed, the battles are entertaining thanks to the fun mechanic of battle stamps giving you a wide variety of moves, The boss (though a bit simple) has an interesting backstory that mirrors our protagonists, and the environment is PHENOMENAL. Double Fine really nailed the  overall look and feel of Halloween perfectly. I am now resigned to play this game every Halloween. (Play on Christmas if you're really into it, and nab a certain achievement.) Double Fine Studios always gives you your money's worth. If I had to choose a negative, I  would say that the story could be a little longer and more developed, but the Grubbins on Ice DLC does kind of scratch that itch. It was definitely enjoyable (and free!) Also CQ 2 acknowledges this, and is therefore longer, with an even more developed story. Consider this an extremely positive endorsement for the games sequel.

And I'm usually a miser, exspecially when it comes to games that I've played and beaten. Isn't it weird when people say \"exspecially\"? Or what about \"prolly\" instead of probably? Odd. I think my least favorite is \"nucular\". Seriously.\n\nBut I loved the simplicity of this game. Some collectables, some questing. Yet I never felt like I was tired of it, like with a lot of much much longer RPGs out there. After 100 hours, some games just feel tedious, and this game never felt tedious. The whole Halloween theme was nice also, even considering I've never been a huge Halloween person. I was raised to be afraid of demons by staunchly evangelical Christians, and so it goes. Needless to say, I don't ascribe to that line of thinking now as an adult. Nothing against those who do, but it hardly kept me from enjoying this game, that's all I'm saying.\n\nAnyway, for a refreshing take on the RPG genre, for a game that's now, what, 9 years old or something, this is good stuff.

No carece de alg\u00fan que otro defecto, pero en general la experiencia ha sido tremendamente satisfactoria.\n\nEn el juego tomamos el rol de un ni\u00f1o, o una ni\u00f1a, los cuales son hermanos gemelos y acaban de llegar a la ciudad. Es la noche de Halloween y est\u00e1n disfrazados y preparados para salir a pedir caramelos por las distintas casas del barrio.\n\nSin embargo, nuestro gemelo ser\u00e1 secuestrado por un monstruo en la primera casa que visitamos y ah\u00ed dar\u00e1 comienzo toda la aventura.\n\nCostume Quest es un juego realmente original y muy entra\u00f1able. Todo en el juego est\u00e1 excelentemente representado y ambientado, recordando en cierto modo a las pel\u00edculas de aventuras de los a\u00f1os 80 que se basaban en esa fiesta.\n\nLos ni\u00f1os paseando por el barrio disfrazados, esas casas t\u00edpicas de barrio de clase media americano, esa m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica de Halloween que hemos escuchado miles de veces\u2026 todo est\u00e1 ah\u00ed, muy bien representado y con un gran sentido del humor, adem\u00e1s.\n\nEl sistema de juego es b\u00e1sicamente un JRPG de toda la vida al estilo cl\u00e1sico, pero algo m\u00e1s simplificado. Como tal iremos encontr\u00e1ndonos con enemigos en el mapa de exploraci\u00f3n y al atacarlos, o al acercarnos demasiado a ellos, se pasar\u00e1 a una pantalla de combate donde podremos utilizar un ataque b\u00e1sico y uno especial llegado el momento.\n\nEl sistema funciona realmente bien, a\u00fan en su simpleza, pero s\u00ed es cierto que se puede volver algo repetitivo a medio plazo, algo a lo que no ayuda que sea tremendamente f\u00e1cil toda la aventura.\n\nLa gracia del juego est\u00e1 en explorar los diferentes lugares por donde nos llevar\u00e1 nuestro periplo mientras buscamos a nuestro gemelo, llevamos a cabo misiones secundarias, coleccionamos cartas y compramos potenciadores que nos dar\u00e1n determinadas ventajas en combate.\n\nY mientras hacemos esto, iremos buscando diferentes piezas para crear m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s disfraces, a cada cual m\u00e1s original y divertido.\n\nEsto de los disfraces es realmente importante, ya que los necesitaremos para poder seguir avanzando en la aventura y adem\u00e1s nos servir\u00e1n para variar en algo los enfrentamientos en combate, ya que cada uno de ellos tiene habilidades \u00fanicas.\n\nComo he comentado, su punto m\u00e1s criticable es que es un juego realmente f\u00e1cil.

It's also by that company that has a quirky sort of aesthetic and releases games that have that sense of child wonderment that you'd see on a cartoon show. In a way, Costume Quest is [b]THE[/b] Double Fine game.\n\nCostume Quest is a game about kids going trick or treating to collect candy, finding and wearing different costumes, and getting different abilities in battle as a result of said costumes. The story is that you and your sibling go out on Halloween night, only for one of them to wind up kidnapped by monsters due to their giant candy costume (monsters like candy). What results is you making friends with two children and chasing the monsters down via RPG battle mechanics. \n\nThe venture is split into two realms: the world exploration and the RPG battles. The world exploration entails trick or treating at every home on the map in order to open a demon gateway that continues the story. When trick or treating at any home there is a delay in the door opening n anticipation of who is going to open the door. If it's a human, you get candy which can be used to buy battle stamps (which enhance battle abilities); if it's a monster you get a battle instead. Beyond trick or treating every house, you can walk around the map and talk to people roaming about. This comprises the sidequests.\n\nThe problem with the sidequests is that there are only around 4 of them, and they repeat on every map. There's always some kid that wants a specific stamp that you will get through a quest; 6 kids hiding that you have to find; a guy that wants you to participate in his bobbing for apples minigame. You will always get some manner of costumes on every map which have a battle ability and a world exploration ability.\n\n...or rather, they always have a battle ability and only sometimes have a world exploration ability. It's a completely missed opportunity. Some abilities are only used once to get past 1 area. Others are so quest specific that they are absolutely useless outside of them. The majority of costumes don't even have world exploration abilities, which means that this segment of the game is even drier than you'd think. \n\nThe battle system is even worse. At first I was excited as it takes Paper Mario queues whereby you press specific keys to increase attack power or to block and take reduced damage during either attack or defense animations. The problem is that literally your only options during any sort of encounter are to attack or run away. Every turn the only option is to attack, with your costumes special ability activating every 3 turns. Every battle lasted 6 turns or less. There is no variety in your attacks; the mech costume will always be a bar that fills where you press Y or X or A or B when it reaches a specific point. The statue is always circle the left stick. It never changes. It plays itself. Battles are agonizing after an hour. Utter waste of time.\n\nCostume Quest has all the pieces. If there was something more to trick or treating; if the battle mechanics were VASTLY expanded; if the world exploration had more than 3 quests on repeat, we would have SOMETHING. Anyone that begins this game will love it in the first hour. The world is charming and the parts seem promising. I know I loved it. The novelty of the idea-the unique premise, it has so much potential. \n\nAccording to the developers this game only had a years worth of development time, with the team focusing on the bare essentials to get the game out. If this game lasted 1 hour it would be an easy recommendation. Luckily it lasts less than 5 hours, but that's an insult to the quality itself. Which leads me to a downvote. If a game lasting longer than half a workday is a plus then there is something fundamentally wrong with the package. This game can easily be recommended over its uniqueness. The writing is on point. The look and feel land it. \n\nIt's just so damn empty and devoid of anything past bare, bare, [i]bare[/i] essentials. But that's the story of Double Fine nowadays. \"Good ideas, great premise and unique cartoon feel; woefully unfinished ideas\". We're talking about a developer that released a half finished game. Literally. I'm only upset because this game could be real good. It was an easy \"above average\" and recommendation for me. But playing the DLC and seeing the [i]same. exact. fu***ng. sh*t.[/i] completely turned this around to an almost 1/10 for me. I understand it had a short development time, but I also understand that the sequel is almost completely the same and has a ton of reused assets. They didn't even [b]bother[/b] to enhance the base they had. It's almost insulting. Almost, if I didn't expect it.", "timestamp_created": 1559871080, "timestamp_updated": 1559873134, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57351231575012207", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51030741": {"recommendationid": "51030741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051443870", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1608894827}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who fondly remembers playing a ton of Super Mario RPG, this brings back that nostalgia along with an impressive design that has me wanting to live in this world.

Despite its short length, this would have been a top pick on my list, but the combat feels very janky, almost a game of heads or tails of \"Will I win or will I get messed up?\"\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's always cool to see my costumes come to life yet fighting felt more like it almost didn't matter whether I blocked or not with how high damage was. I mean, it did help a lot, the problem is did I want to die or die faster? If you miss, you're almost guaranteed to be 2 shot. Successfully block and, assuming the AI doesn't focus fire down one kid, you're still looking at three or four rounds. Sometimes not even getting your special move off.\n\nQuests are super repetitive, often having you do the same few tasks over and over though I am not the target audience for this. I can see picking this up for my kids and letting them enjoy a short game before bed or keep them occupied for a bit. The game is very forgiving in a lot of ways and gives really good hints that don't outright tell you \"Go do this,\" just enough to make me, the most oblivious person on Steam, realize what I should be doing.\n\nBeyond all of that, I just adore the entire theme of it.

It would of been more exciting if players could equip more then one stamp per character, to actually allow some thorough customization. The combat is relatively balanced but not incredibly difficult, so there's less reason to use support costumes and support based stamps since it's easier to just focus on dealing more damage. The only real frustrating thing in the game is that a select few fights require you to have certain abilities to avoid taking massive damage, so if you don't have those abilities equipped you just take massive damage.\n\nIt does start to get tiring towards the end, as the combat and collecting gameplay is the only thing the game offers. It would of been much more interesting as a whole if there were at least some puzzles or platforming to help offset the large amount of combat in the game. The use of costume abilities to traverse certain parts of the world map is a relatively stock way to artificially vary the gameplay, and it mostly just ends up being annoying. Put on a certain costume so you can get past a certain obstacle, no gameplay involved it's just a random chore. And the robot costume ability gives the player so much mobility for quickly traversing the map that players might as well spend all their time playing as a robot otherwise they have to walk everywhere so slowly. Or play as the robot to get around quickly and switch to the costume you actually like when you're about to go in combat, which is just annoying as well.\n\nThe story is alright, there's some humorous writing here and there to keep the dialogue fun.

Your opponents are either tough/low damage fighters, glass cannons, or healers, with slightly different appearances based on what world you're in. You get a little customization on your end with what costumes you load, but some costumes are definitely better than others, and some of their features are badly integrated into the game (there's one costume that can hide a character, but you need to wait three turns to use it and it only lasts one turn, so it's really not worth your time, except for precisely one boss fight, which you wouldn't know until you're in the boss fight, where the game telegraphs who's going to get hit by a super attack).  In the end, you just to the same things over and over again to beat the opponents, and there are very few \"interesting\" fights.\n\nThe game is strongest with its side-quests, like the costume contest, or delving into the patriotic costume conspiracy, or rescuing rebellious grubbins.  If the game had been a quirky point-and-click adventure (what Double Fine excels at), I think I would have rated it higher; the gameplay feels more like padding on what makes the game fun.\n\nIt is not worth $10 bucks.  After watching the cartoon (which was fun!) I picked up both for $5, and that felt like a decent price.  I don't feel ripped off and, like I said, I had fun, but unless you're really into this sort of game, I would skip it. There are better \"cute/weird JRPG\" knock-offs.

You are a new kid in town on Halloween night and some supernatural events lead to your sibling being taken by monsters. In your quest to save them (and get some candy) you team up with other trick or treaters and battle these monsters in turn based combat. The various costumes you find grant you different abilities in and out of battle. Every traditional turn based RPG element is in this game, but in more of a surface level implementation than some intricate network of systems. The combat becomes repetitive due to its simplicity, although acquiring a new costume does spice things up every once and awhile. You can acquire items that give you perks in battle and there are trading card collectibles (that don't serve any other purpose than to collect them all, and a few quests require you to trade certain cards to NPCs).

Happily binged it in one sitting. Super cute character designs, awesome combat animations (totally rad Statue of Liberty costume healing ability, by the way; from an American), the lighting in the game cast everything with this sort of enchanting glow and really made me nostalgic for childhood Halloween. Props to whoever did the artwork for the Creepy Treat cards, because collecting those was obsessively fun; you should make a real set as a gift collection! Maybe for an anniversary of the game sometime, or for Halloween one year? Hint hint?! PLEASE?!\nDefinitely worth every penny that I paid. New favorite.\n\nMy only critique was that the Grubbins on Ice maps (map?) were....not so good. They felt very plain and a teensy bit confusing, and they just weren't visually appealing over all. They felt a bit empty, too. All of the maps throughout the rest of the main game were awesome because they gave this sort of nostalgic feel; running around the home neighborhood as a kid on Halloween night, seeing all the decorations up in the mall (which is already a fascinating place when you're a kid, holidays aside), and then the country village with the carnival - country village felt spooky and was a great top off, and the carnival is fun no matter what time of year you go! Point is, those levels were all super colorful and varied and interesting, and held nostalgic value besides that; Repugnia's village areas and caves all kind of looked the same and the colors were a bit bland in comparison. I still enjoyed playing that map despite those things, though, because all of the other game elements were just super fun.

It's a relatively simple turn based RPG based around Halloween, and in particular, a small set of kids who are going out trick or treating. Powers granted are based on the costume they wear, which are unlocked by collecting the different elements as you go through the game, with most costumes giving a different power. On top of the costumes unique power, you can also collect battle stamps, which act as another add on to gain another ability, such as stronger critical damage, healing, DOT's or AOE to your attack.\n\nIt is the combination of the battle stamps and costumes that give the game it's flexibility, as certain combinations are required if you are to get past a couple of the bosses in the game. Unfortunately, if you do head in to a battle with the wrong combination, you are forced to either lose, or run away , but the game is forgiving enough to plonk you right back to just before you entered the battle, so no harm done.\n\nThe game is full of character, and also has it's fair share of genuine chuckle moments, and also has it's own unique graphical style that helps add to the theme of the story. \n\nWith plenty of side quests involved in the main story, plus the Grubbins on Ice DLC added for free, there is easily 7-8 hours of gameplay if you want to enjoy the full experience, which I highly recommend, and at just \u00a37.00, it really can't be grumbled at.\n\nThe only real flaw in the game is in it's technical chops. Unfortunately, the game is largely running at 30fps, but there are a few moments, particularly if you are moving fast with the rocket boots, for the game to drop a few of those frames below 30, and causing it to look at little juddery, but nothing so bad as to break the game.\n\nBest for: Trickers and Treaters alike!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1543711998, "timestamp_updated": 1543711998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47228276": {"recommendationid": "47228276", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998466535", "num_games_owned": 1764, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 572, "last_played": 1543656600}, "language": "english", "review": "It's simple: RPG that have sense.

This is a turn based RPG taking place in three Halloween-esque locations (and a fourth location as free DLC). The costume you start out with and the many costumes you can find throughout the game become personas you take on when you wear them. It doesn't matter who in your party wears the costume, they simply turn into the real thing of that costume when you enter battle, giving them different abilities. There are \"timed\" hits for regular attacks, and each costume has a unique special attack that charges up after three turns. For example, the robot costume gets a missile barrage attack that hits all enemies, while the knight gets a highly defensive shield he or she can place on another ally. You also get stamps which you can equip one to each party member to give them something extra like poison damage or a stun attack to paralyze an enemy. There are lots of treasure chest-like objects around filled with candy or specific costume materials. \nWhen you go trick or treating to people's houses, the people their will either be home and give you candy (currency) or a monster will be there who will start a fight with you (which gets you candy and experience points). The story is that monsters are secretly invading your world, and of course no one believes you, so you must rescue your sister by yourself with the help new friends you make along the way. Some costumes also have out-of-battle abilities which help you traverse the environment or solve puzzles. There are a good number of side quests and mini games to play as well for extra candy to buy stamps and costume pieces to gain new forms and abilities.\n\n[h1]What I like:[/h1]\n+ The premise of the game and environments are pretty cool and original. \n+ The party system with the costumes is a cool idea that allows you to customize your party's appearance and abilities.\n+ I think the different environments are creative and fit the Halloween theme very well (neighborhood, mall, and fair grounds).\n+ The extra DLC included for free takes place after the main game, in winter. This mode has it's own separate save files.\n+ The inclusion of \"timed hits\" keeps the player engaged in turn-based battles to better attack and defend.\n+ Great sense of humor for nerds.\n\n[h1]What I don't like:[/h1]\n- The game is so easy most of the way that you won't need to change off your starting costumes or form specific parties to meet certain challenges. I only made plans for the final boss.\n- There a lot of auto moving dialog boxes. There's no voice overs, so I see no reason to take away my ability to progress the dialog when I'm finished reading it. I realized during the game that there is a cutscene pause button (weirdly X on xbox controller), so that was a compromise for my not-fast-enough reading speed.\n- The mouse on PC is picked up automatically, so it will be center screen and highlight that option first on any menu until you start your file or move it.\n\n[h1]Recommendation:[/h1]\nThe main game length is about 6 hours long and the DLC will add another 2 hours. The game is fairly easy, but has a good sense of humor and fun locations to explore.\n\nStill not sure?

Much of the fun in the experience comes from the commitment to the theme and cute writing, and calling it some simple Halloween fun is accurate in another way. The battle system can have a bit of strategy to it, but its a bit too basic for how often you engage with it. It accommodates this well at times by making the player about as strong as their opponents, but it can\u2019t completely escape how some of the fights boil down to executing a basic attack repeatedly and then a super attack. There\u2019s more to do than just battles though, and the extra touches of trick-or-treating, bobbing for apples, and other little diversions mean it never stops being delightful.\n\nWhen it comes to capturing that childhood joy of the Halloween holiday, Costume Quest does an excellent job. It\u2019s a light-hearted and silly story designed to make you smile. It comes up a bit short in the combat design though, mainly because it only really has the minimal strategic considerations to give it depth, and those considerations don\u2019t tend to deviate until something new like a boss is added to the picture. The battles aren\u2019t pushovers because they are balanced appropriately, but your considerations during them are a bit too straightforward, even if you do decided to wear the stamps that give you the one extra attack. If every costume was just given one extra attack with a special ability, there could have been much more variety to the experience, but Costume Quest certainly has enough going for it to tap into the fun of the Halloween season.\n\nCostume Quest takes the fun activities that kids love from the Halloween season and ties them to game mechanics that players of any age can enjoy. Even if you\u2019re too old to trick-or-treat, maybe you can find some of the cheer children still find in it by playing a game that ties it to gameplay and cute storytelling that appeals to all ages.", "timestamp_created": 1540913221, "timestamp_updated": 1540913221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45476799": {"recommendationid": "45476799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170641595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1540702131}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything about this game is fantastic.

I get tired of fanatasy themed RPGs, so this was a certainly unique game. Instead of armor and swords, you need to find costume patterns and the three materials that make each halloween costume. When worn, it transforms your main characters into powerful warrior versions of the costumes to fight the goblins that stole your sibling. And because these are halloween costumes, your main characters will sometimes end up wearing non-conventional outfits that RPG characters don't normally wear - like an order of fries for example, lol! Combat is turn based but I like that to inflict the maximum damage, you have to time the correct key presses. But if you miss, that's okay - you'll just inflict a normal amount of damage. So it's playable for everyone, including those who aren't that coordinated. Also each costume has it's own specific powers so it's fun to wear different ones for combat and keeps combat from getting dry and boring. \n\nI normally take my time with games, but this was so much fun that I finished both stories relatively quickly. The stories are both linear so not much replay, but it is such a fun and unique RPG that I know I'll pick this up to play again some time later.

There are a comparitve handlful of negative reviews that all have valid points, some of which I'll address here, but the the short version is none of these negatives were enough to ruin the game to me.\n\nThe most common complaints are that the quests are repetative, the combat is bland, and the game is easy.  I beat this game in just over 10 hrs, and that was with me messing around in some of the levels, getting every acheivement, and trying out different costume combos for fun.  This is not a difficult game.\nHowever, I wasn't playing this game becuase it was difficult.  I wasn't looking to be challenged by two children on a halloween game.  This was supposed to be light hearted and fun, and it very much was.\nThe combat is bland, with only two attacks per costume and no variation.  There are items you can get than change pieces of the combat, but again I wasn't playing this game thinking it was dark souls.  I was playing a cute game with a the focus on the story.  Games do not have to be combat driven to be enjoyable.\nThe quests are repetative.  Each one involves finding a specific card, \"trick or treating,\" or some other minor story mechanic.  Quests in most games are repetative, they're often gofer quests or kill this person or that etc.  Yes the quests are similar, but I didn't mind doing them.\n\nNone of these will stopped me from buying this game, none of them stopped me from buying the second.

I love the concept of kids gaining imaginative super powers based on costumes. You can swap costumes as you find/make more so there is a pretty good variety of party combinations you can make. You will eventually have a party of three which is good.\n\nAt first, the game seems easy like it is impossible to lose, but the challenge does start to ramp up a little later on where you will want to take in consideration your party composition and timing when to use support abilities.  The graphics on the world is what you see for a majority of the screenshots, it's a cutsey style. But within combat, there's a brief sailormoon-esque transition sequence and you're transported into a comic-book style graphics for the combat and all the costumes suddenly look really amazing and cool! The starting robot costume is a great one to introduce the game.\n\nThere are collectibles to gather and most quests advance the story in someway or are easy to do along the way. For the halloween aspect - aside from the costimes - there is candy as currency, great jokes, and trick or treating which is a gamble -- is it a friendly encounter or time for a battle?\n\nGame is about 5 hours in length to complete, it's short and sweet.\nSome memorablie lines of dialog:\n\"I got the MANIFEST DESTINY\" \"You should see a doctor about that\"\n\"Uh oh did that girl say she knows algebra?\"\n\nHere is a list to breakdown my thoughts on the game:\nPros:\n- Great theme for a game (Halloween)\n- Very imaginative characters/costumes which are swappble\n- Great atmosphere\n- Great humor\n- Combat requires interaction similar to paper mario (i.e. press a button at right time to reduce/increase damage)\n\nNeutral:\n- Short, although I like that.\n- Combat is pretty simple other than the paper-marioesqe interaction and doesn't really require too much thought outside of a few priority targets and some battles later on for support use\n- You can choose your protagonist (Boy or girl twin)\n\nCons:\n- Felt a bit lost at times on the map, especially in the beginning. There are times you have to keep talking to a NPC to progress but it's confusing since already talked to them , didn't realize their dialog changes after some more prompting.\n", "timestamp_created": 1530505099, "timestamp_updated": 1530505099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669078171253204346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43208041": {"recommendationid": "43208041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066006537", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1498000067}, "language": "english", "review": "This game would be a perfect way to introduce a friend to the RPGs!\n\nI had no clue what Double Fine Productions was until I played Costume Quest.

There's a decent amount of exploration, though it's not excessive. \n\nCombat is fairly simplistic and would normally be repetitive if it wasn't for the fact that the developers took a page from the Paper Mario series.  Most regular attacks tell you to push one of the XABY buttons and it's random each time, forcing you to pay attention, which is surprisingly effective at staving off boredom.  You might have some trouble with timing  regular attacks and blocks if you're used to Nintendo controllers, but that's more Microsoft's fault than the game's.  The difficulty is fair for the most part.  I only had trouble in 2 areas.  The second section gave me some issues because I accidentally refrained from exploring more and picking up an extra party member.  As for the last 2 boss fights, a little sorting around of costumes and stamps is all that's needed.\n\nThe game itself isn't very long, but that's a good thing since nothing present really wears out its welcome.\n\nIn closing, I'd like to mention that candy corn has less sugar than raisins. :3", "timestamp_created": 1524074649, "timestamp_updated": 1524074649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41527154": {"recommendationid": "41527154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119652767", "num_games_owned": 1982, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1514266091}, "language": "english", "review": "my characters sister was kidnapped by pepe\nhttps://youtu.be/sxPUU0HfOA4", "timestamp_created": 1523903781, "timestamp_updated": 1523903781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41509970": {"recommendationid": "41509970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026720069", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 625, "last_played": 1452704995}, "language": "english", "review": "This was fun.

If that sounds awful to you, skip Costume Quest.[/h1]\n\nI want to like this game. I'm a fan of Doublefine's content. I love indie games, I love this game's aesthetic, and I played through both the base game and the DLC to the end. However, there's one glaring issue with the game that make me give it a thumbsdown:\n\n\n\n[b][u]Costume Quest's new game plus feature doesn't work on Mac and Linux, years after release, and I had to resort to a community fix to make the new game plus feature work. That means the game doesn't actually work on Mac and Linux, and is falsely advertised.[/u][/b]\n\n\n\nCostume Quest comes with DLC, \"Grubbins on Ice\", for \"free\" on Steam. I wouldn't call it \"free\" because you have to buy Costume Quest to access Grubbins on Ice. Therefore, it's just part of the game, and it should be usable content on Mac and Linux, given that Costume Quest is advertised as playable on Mac and Linux.\n\nGrubbins on Ice utilizes a \"new game plus\" feature. For those unfamiliar, it means that you're supposed to be able to carry over items/stats/etc. from one game to another (either a new run of the same game, or a new run of a sequel) (example: Mass Effect series lets you carry characters over from Mass Effect to Mass Effect 2 to Mass Effect 3, I think).\n\nHowever, on Mac and Linux, Grubbins on Ice does not properly start a \"new game plus\". Why? It looks for the wrong save file on your computer. Grubbins on Ice looks for \"cq_dlc_save_0\" but Costume Quest never generates that file, so you have to go into your files, copy your saved game, rename it \"cq_dlc_save_0\", start a new game in Grubbins on Ice, and the game finally works. (credit to kittenm4ster on the Steam forums for figuring this out, and MestreLion for providing details on how to make this work on Mac).\n\nI was able to follow the instructions and fix this. However, look online, and you'll see that representatives from Doublefine promised that users that bought this game on Mac and Linux would have the issue patched. It's been years since they posted that promise, and it never happened. I played through the game in 2017 (it'd been sitting in my library for years, I think I got it in a Humble Bundle?) and the issue still hadn't been fixed, something that is probably super easy for Doublefine to fix given that the game is looking for the wrong file name, and that's the only issue.\n\n\n\nDoes this make the game unplayable? No. But, for 90% of the games I play, I don't have issues where I have to go muddle with my computer's files, and I don't have to look up esoteric game mechanics on the Internet to find out why a game that's advertised as so easy it's child-friendly isn't working as it should.\n\n\nThe game is charming, with cute graphics, although, the Grubbins on Ice DLC had various visual glitches for me. I don't know if this is due to the fact I had to follow outside instructions to force the DLC to load my old game to start the new game plus, whether it's a Mac specific issue (which is still the responsibility of the developer to account for), or what, but it was annoying. Namely, characters flickered, and there were issues with party AI, in that often times, the other characters in my party were lagging behind the main character, getting stuck in weird ways, etc.\n\nIs this my last Doublefine game? No. I'm probably going to play Stacking after this. But I'm definitely annoyed with their poor customer service.\n\nI'd say this is appropriate for ages 10+, because some of the animations may be too scary for younger children, and there's a stark difference between the overworld and battle art style.

It's already cheap but if it's on sale, you need this.\n\nThis game is relatively short, took me 7.3 hours on my first playthrough to beat the main story and dlc, every quest. I also did some side things but not enough for it to be a 100% run\n\nThis game brought the kid back out of me, It reminded me of the games I used to play with my Dad as a kid and I love it.\nThe only words I can use to describe this game is pleasant and wholesome.\n\nThe artstyle is really unique. There is no voice acting, but I kinda like that. The lack of voice acting made it feel like a old point and click game, but instead it\u2019s a keyboard controlled game entirely. It has turn based combat with quick time events. At first it was really cool and fun but towards the end of the game I was avoiding combat because it got stale and I knew I was going to win everytime.

I originally owned a copy back on PS3 when it was first launched.  I was more than happy to pay for it again here on Steam (my new preferred platform for gaming).  The PC version includes the extra Grubbins on Ice content for free that was originally sold as DLC on consoles. The game is a fun, short and sweet RPG title that takes place on Halloween night where you play as a kid and his friends who have to \"trick-or-treat\" houses in order to earn enough candy to save your sibling who was stolen by goblin like villains. The combat system revolves around the type of Halloween costume you wear.  For example... When you wear the Robot costume into battle it will give you a critical strike move where the robot costume fires a missile barrage at your opponent(s) in a slick animation cut scene. There are lots of costumes to find throughout the game that you can wear into battle. Each will give you a different attribute when fighting. In addition, there are a bunch of side quests to complete as well. It may seem like a lot to do but the entire game goes by very quickly and can be completed in a couple of sittings which is why I tend to play it (or the sequel) just about every year.

The cartoony visual art style just adds to the Halloween feel and has aged pretty well for a almost 7 year old game. The game is pretty easy and simplified with a battle system that kinda reminds me of a Mario RPG, as in you press some buttons or move a stick to make the moves stronger or take less damage when defending. The writing is pretty funny and adorable but the plot is pretty simple, not that it's a bad thing. The main game can also be beaten in just a day, it took me about 9 hours to complete it. It also comes with a mini adventure that happens after the main story that only takes about 2 hours. I recommend playing that after the main story because you keep all your items/costumes from the main game.\n\n I only have a few issues with the game but nothing too terrible. Your character's movement is a bit stiff when outside of battle, kinda like tank controls but better. Like I said before dialog is really charming but the text auto scrolls pretty fast sometimes and it wasn't until I tried skipping a cutscene that I found out that you could pause it by pressing X/Square (if you're using a controller). Now my biggest issue with the game is the menus, at least with a controller. It's kinda annoying to move around the settings menu to change things. Instead of just pressing up/down to get to the next setting you have to press left/right, pressing up or down will for example raise or lower volume or what ever it is you're currently on.\n\n Those are really my only issues with the game other than it being pretty easy, but even that isn't that bad seeing as it feels like it would make a good game to introduce someone younger into the RPG genre. For whatever reason this game makes me nostolgic even though I've only found out about it and it's sequal last year. This is definitely a game you'll want to play on October/Halloween, maybe with someone younger as well to share a fun memory with. The game is pretty easy to 100% as well if you're into that, the only achievement I have yet to get is the one where you have to play it on Christmas. The game is relatively cheap at only $10 and I say it's a must play if you want to play a Halloween game that isn't about the spooks.

It's not the sort of game to end up on a game of the year list, and it's not the sort of game you show off to all your friends. Unlike most games i play, there isn't any super unique or innovative mechanic that really makes the game stand out from other rpg's, but it does enough to be above average.\n\nThe story is that on Holloween night you are a boy/girl who goes trick or treating with your brother/sister until he/she is kidnapped by monsters. Goblins not only want to eat your family member, but they want ALL OF THE CANDY. However you can stand up to them, thanks to the powers given to you by your Holloween costumes! Your goal is to go on an adventure meeting new kids and going all around town in order to chase down the monsters and save your sibling!\n\nThe actual combat is the classic turn based combat formula. You take to the field using the power of whatever costume your wearing to tear down those ruthless baddies! This time it has been has been given a twist, badges and quick time events! This reminded me a lot of Paper Mario TTYD (like my #1 game of all time), but the quick time events are less precise than paper marios and if you don't use more than the basic moveset it becomes extremely repetetive. This is where badges come in to add variety to your game, except the badges are mostly uninteresting stat boosts that do very little to change up how you play (unlike Paper Mario where the badges completely defined your playstyle). I found the combat engaging enough to hold my interest throughout the game; it falls into the same pitfall most turn based combat does where all your abilities feeling too similar and achieve the same goal. Combat is not Costume Quest's strong suit.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is fantastic. There's this childrens bedtime story vibe to the whole game that i found really fitting because the entire story feels like a kid playing pretend. From the costumes giving you powers to the adults not seeing monsters, the game has this make-believe quality where you half think the whole game is a facade but you're caught up in sillyness of it all so you don't care. \n\nWhat i enjoyed most in the game was just exploring the world. Throughout the multiple zones you have a costumes and candy (and monsters) to discover through exploration and use of your super powers. The game makes good use of the Holloween setting. Every zone has houses to trick or treat at, and each house can either give you a candy giving adult or an evil monster who will want to fight. If you pick this game up pay attention to the dialog and talk to as many NPC's as you can because it'll give you a good chuckle.

The twins are hyped to go out and trick-or-treat but a monster ends mistaking one of the siblings as a large piece of candy and kidnaps the child. With the help of a cat(?) who may or may not have given your character special powers through his/her costume, your character goes off on a quest to save his/her sibling with friends he/she makes on the way, and maybe, in the process of doing so, end up saving Halloween.\n\nCostume Quest's story is fairly adequate but it is bolstered by stellar writing filled to the brim with traditional Double Fine humour. Expect to chuckle often while playing this game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nCostume Quest is a turn based RPG lite. It's very simplistic in execution, and gets the job done. Do not expect huge skill trees or deep mechanics - there are none in this game. You can do additional damage or reduce damage taken by doing QTEs with very generous timings, and you have 'Battle Stamps' that give you passive bonuses like dealing additional damage. Your characters are also healed automatically after every battle. There are no random encounters in this game (aside from the monsters that you encounter while trick-or-treating). Costume Quest has boss battles that are quite fun indeed.\n\nOutside of combat, you play in fixed camera hub worlds, trick-or-treating at various houses or bashing various environmental objects to get candy. You can use candy to buy new Battle Stamps to make your character even stronger, however, each character is only allowed to equip one Battle Stamp at a time. After you trick-or-treat all the houses in a given hub, you are allowed to pass through the Monster Gate that blocks your progress to the next hub and this repeats several times till you reach the end of the game.\n\nEach costume your characters wear provide them with various powers in battle. The Statue of Liberty costume plays a traditional healer role while the Space Warrior is a pure melee character. Some of your costumes also have environmental effects - the main character can use the Shield ability to block falling debris while wearing the Knight Costume, while the Robot costume can allow you to quickly Boost yourself so that you can dash around through the environment. You'll need your costumes to not only fight, but also make it through the various obstacles you encounter in each hub, all the while collecting candy and Creepy Treat cards, doing quests, and finding various pieces of costumes that will help you in your adventure.\n\nThis is a very easy game, and one should expect a playthrough to be between 4-6 hours. The additional DLC chapter, Grubbins on Ice, is another hour or two of gameplay.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nCostume Quest has a very charming art style and is definitely easy on the eyes. The small scenes that precede battes where your character transforms into a giant sized, realized version of the costume he/she is wearing is really good and well animated. \n\nHowever, the game doesn't run all that well technically. It's sufficient but a game like this shouldn't be having difficulties running at a solid 30 or 60 FPS. There are bits of slowdown, most noticeably in the scene where you are trick-or-treating. This is not a big deal in battles, fortunately.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nOn the aural front, Costume Quest is not a winner. None of the music in this game is memorable or even good.  I can't comment on the voice acting in this game because it has none. Sound effects do their job.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nCostume Quest is a must-play, fun game that is perfectly paced - just before the signs of repetition even kick in, the game ends. Clever writing and tons of heart make this game perfect for every age. If you see this game on sale, be sure to snap it up. My only regret is I didn't play this game on Halloween. Oh well.\n\n[h1]Note to Prospective Buyers[/h1]\n\nThe game was an ~600 MB download on Steam. \n\nCostume Quest works on Windows 10. Word of caution : DO NOT ALT+TAB OUT OF THIS GAME; Alt+Tab will result in a crash, almost always.\n\nCostume Quest has Steam Trading Cards.\n\nPRO TIP : You can skip the short scene that plays when you get into a battle by pressing Shift.\n\n[h1]Note to Achievement Hunters[/h1]\n\nThis game is very easy to 100%, and you can do so in a single playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1504762236, "timestamp_updated": 1511434347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562486946582794189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34787936": {"recommendationid": "34787936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027324894", "num_games_owned": 960, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1509423816}, "language": "english", "review": "It just a fun and simples RPG that will make you feel bether playing.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, the story is cute.

The story is about average, it's what it needs to be to push the game along. Exploration is fun and is somewhat rewarding. Combat is terrible and essentially a quicktime event simulator. Each costume has only one attack and one charged attack which builds up every three turns. So combat is basically choose target, attack, press the right button, enemy attacks, press the right button, repeat repeat repeat. The quicktime event for attacking and defending doesn't feel rewarding, it feels mandatory. If you miss any of the quicktime events it's basically a major loss for the team.\n\nOne thing about this game that sparked an idea is the False RPG. This game has exp and levels, but it's meaningless.  Most enemies are unskippable and you don't select new skills with new levels. This is a lot like an action game where you just pick up new weapons or items over time. You didn't earn those weapons or items by killing enemies, you just got them because it was time to. Take Final Fantasy X-2 as a comparison, three women with different outfits that do different skills, as you level you choose different skills to unlock, different grids for outfits that allow for super outfits. It's a much more fleshed out system that isn't the exact same the next time you play it.\n\nPros: Great idea for a game. Exploration is fun.\n\nCons: Lack of imagination for combat. Combat is repetitive and boring. Levels are nearly meaningless.\n\nDo you get one Hour of gameplay per $6 paid?: At current price of $9.99 you'll need to play 1 and 1/2 hour\n\nEase of 100%: Very easy.

The game also has some pretty good dialouge for some of the interactions.\n\nThe Gameplay is something you don't see every so often in other turn-based RPGs (again, it's simple and unique). Since it's a halloween game, the game has a clever mechanic when you go trick or treating in a door, you have a 50% to get a battle (Trick) or someone who gives you an amount of candy (Treat). Instead of getting different party members like in most RPGs, you collect Costume Pieces in which you need to complete the set to get the full costume. Each costume gives you different abillities for battle or exploration, you can switch costumes for the 3 characters in the game which basically switches their roles. There's also Battle Stamps that you can buy with candy which enhances your characters with special atributes. The battles are basically what you get in other RPGs; you have Attack, Super, Special Abilites if you have specific Battle Stamps, and Run Away. The combat system is similar to those in Mario RPG games but much easier, where you can do a specific command to do more damage than your normal attack or to lower your damage taken. After battles, you gain XP, Candy to buy more Battle Stamps and sometimes Creepy Treats Cards.\n\nWhile the game is great, it also has it's downsides. Game is locked at 30 FPS and there is no available way to disable that, combat can be a bit repetitive, some parts are really dark and can't see really anything (even though some of those parts you need the Space Suit), there's only one Minigame: The Apple Bobbing one, Candy can only be used for Battle Stamps,\nthe maximum level is 10 (Main Game) and 14 (Grubbins on Ice Expansion), and the game is a bit short as i beat the game 100% in just 7 Hours (5 in Main Game, 2 in Grubbins on Ice Expansion) with no Replay Value.\n\nEven though it has it's problems, i have to say that with it's nice-looking artstyle, good story and unique gameplay mechanics, this game is a must-buy for RPG fans that want something fresh and simple, and if you're new to RPGs, pick up this game, it's short but it's still a great game to enjoy.\n\n[h1] 7/10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1499557243, "timestamp_updated": 1499557243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33282524": {"recommendationid": "33282524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036844151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2412, "last_played": 1326787200}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm usually not a fan of all of those main-streamed RPGs.

You play as either Wren or Reynold, a young kid who needs to rescue their kidnapped sibling and stop the invading monsters from stealing all the Halloween candy.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe visuals are rather cute and adorable. Unfortunately the game has a lot of technical problems. First of all, the game has an extremely annoying 30 FPS lock that doesn't even work properly and that makes all the animations look choppy.\n\nFurthermore, the game does not properly support 16:10 resolutions and some of the UI elements will appear partially outside the screen.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe game has a decent enough sound track and the sound effects are pretty good too. There's no voice acting.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay in Costume Quest is pretty dreadful. The exploration aspects are passable but rather repetitive. You wander around the maps, looking for houses to trick and treat and simple quests to complete.\n\nIt is the combat, however, that is truly terrible. This is probably the worst RPG combat I have ever seen. It's the traditional turn-based JRPG combat with all the depth and choice removed. And to add insult to injury, every single action will require you to complete a tedious QTE. To make matters even worse, the encounters are extremely repetitive and even the bosses are generally quite simple.\n\nThe ability to change your Halloween costume (and unlock different special powers) is a nice touch, but not nearly enough to make up for the otherwise weak gameplay.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nThe game is quite easy and only a couple of the bosses provide any real challenge.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nThe controls are passable on a gamepad but by no means great. The constant QTEs in combat are extremely tedious and the fixed camera can be a major pain while exploring.\n\n[h1]Story and Writing[/h1]\nThe story is rather silly and childish. This wouldn't really be an issue by itself, but unfortunately the quality of the writing is quite low, especially for a Double Fine game.\n\n[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]\nOverall the game was reasonably bug free. However, the quest for recovering your stolen costumes appeared quite glitchy and it took quite a few attempts to complete.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nI found Costume Quest a pretty bad game overall and it is easily my least favorite Double Fine game so far. The cute visuals are nowhere near enough to make up for the utterly dreadful and repetitive gameplay.

I think its the best looking Double Fine game to date, with its very refined cell-shaded graphical style, but I think it's just too easy, and too short. Perhaps that's what this game is not [i]about[/i], as it seems that the festive atmosphere and the charm the world inherits from what Double Fine games are known for.\n\nMy problem is that it's a short game that feels long, in a bad way. Of the 7 hours I spent playing this game (including the DLC), I felt like I was watching the same 3 battles play over again and again, without any feeling of commitment since the battles are so easy and simple. Each character has one  basic attack and a special attack that is usable in the 3 turn. But by the time I can use it, I most likely don't even need to use it, since one basic attack is enough to be succesful. You do get the option to add another action, like stunning or poisoning, but I found those not necessary, even after using them. In fact, I used the buffs that would increase attack power and the ability to counterattack so the fights are over within 2 or 3 turns.\n\nAnother small quirck, that some other reviewers also mentioned, is the fast-crolling, automated dialogues (though, mostly just in cutscenes). The is no voice-acting, but only texts. The problem that you can easily miss parts of the text when you're destracted at all. I don't read fast or slow, but I was still somewhat annoyed with this text speed.\n\nDespite the lack of difficulty and the monotonous combat, I still enjoyed the game for the look and character. Try it out when you feel like taking a break a night or two from the stress you might endure from your regular life.\n\nEdit: during a sale you can get this game (including the DLC) for a mere 1 buck.

While I still have not played all of Double Fine's games yet, this particular game is near the top for me, and also one of my favorite games in general for recent years.\n\nThere is a lot of heart in the design and story of Costume Quest, which is a wonderfully funny kids' adventure. You begin the game on Halloween night for a brother and sister, which quickly evolves into a gigantic quest beyond any normal realm, as you must fight monsters that sweep in to take over the night.\n\nAs a whole, Costume Quest is indeed a quest. As you control a set of kids going on their adventure throughout the game, you will do a variety of things from actual trick-or-treating to exploration for hidden items to performing role-playing battles. The game is indeed an RPG with main and side quests, special equipment and power-up items, along with general collectibles. Most fitting to the game is that candy is your currency.\n\nEach new area that you enter, you generally must trick-or-treat at a set number of houses or doorways. When doing so, you will literally get a trick or a treat. The treat is simply candy, as expected. The trick, however, is a fight with the monsters that are the main enemies of the game. When battles launch up, your characters have mini-cutscenes where they turn into the beings that they are wearing as costumes, e.g., a robot will suddenly stand up very tall and be prepared to fight.\n\nThe style of the battles are turn-based, though you only have three options - normal attack, special power, and Battle Stamp power. When you perform normal attacks, each costume has a different style of \"timing\" that you can use to perform extra damage if you hit the right buttons in the proper manner. Special powers cannot be used until enough energy (essentially MP) is accrued, which will generally happen after a few turns in battle. Battle Stamps are part of the equipment of the game, where each character can wear a single stamp to add extra strength or a new capability. Some of the Battle Stamps just affect stats, like increasing attack power. Others will give an ability for that third battle option, such as stunning enemies temporarily.\n\nAs can be seen both in and out of battle, the game has a very interesting, 3D cartoon art style showcasing the environment and characters. As already mentioned above, the battles have mini-cutscenes related to the costumes, and there are also special effects for the power attacks or for certain bosses that you fight along the way. Altogether, everything truly screams Halloween. Even the costumes that you are wearing will allow you to perform different capabilities in the \"real\" world, as you will need to switch between them to access certain areas or complete side quests on the map.\n\nThe story itself is also very well-done, having both a cheesy style but also a mapped-out purpose. As you continue through the game, you will learn more information about the beings that you are fighting against and what their end goal is. Take note that once you finish the game, the story is not done. The game has a free \"Grubbins on Ice\" DLC which continues from the end of the game. And even further, there is a Costume Quest 2 which continues from the endpoint of that DLC.\n\nI highly recommend this game to just about any person. The adventure of the children is filled with fun, charm, humor, and a number of other qualities, combined into a very enjoyable game.", "timestamp_created": 1484507835, "timestamp_updated": 1484608108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563182532787322998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29280104": {"recommendationid": "29280104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026486730", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 423, "last_played": 1399929887}, "language": "english", "review": "This game puts the C U T E in costume.

This holds especially true for us adults, who don't get much to do on Halloween, unless we have kids of our own or we go to a bar or club.  Starting off, I'd say what supports this Halloween vibe so well is the inclusion of so many Halloween activities.  There's a bobbing for apples mini-game, collectible spooky cards you collect and trade for, using simple household items to build costumes, community events such as a costume contest, dealing with a random bully/jerk, and of course going Trick-or-Treating. I don't think they left anything out, unless you're a house egger and TP'er!  Throw in an unconventional bad guy who wants to steal mountains of candy for himself (ever hear of Wal-Mart, Jack?), and you have the basis for a kid-friendly and festive, turn-based RPG.  \n\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1] \n\u2022\tThe different costumes you assemble provide different mechanics and features in battle.  Over time, you'll discover personal favorites, based on whether you prefer hitting the right button fast enough as it flashes on-screen, or timing your attack as the cursor slides over the bar.  Admittedly, some seem more powerful and useful than others, such as the vampire.  \n\u2022\tI thought it was fun going to random doors, not knowing if you would receive a treat, in the form of gobs of candy (was never like that when I was a kid), or a trick, in the form of a fight.  It's a clever variation on having random battles.  \n\u2022\tYou get to pick between being the boy or girl, without one or the other being eye candy. *pun intended*  Seriously, it's kind of annoying when one or the other is hot, as if that should be a decisive factor.  Just let me be sexist!\n\u2022\tBattles are fairly straightforward and simple, though all the costume choices and their respective special abilities is something you'll have to factor in as you set up your equipment. \n\u2022\tConsidering you're just going trick-or-treating on Halloween, the gameplay is reasonably long, at around eight hours.  \n\u2022\tThe game has fun, witty dialogue, motivating players to explore and talk with NPCs.\n\u2022\tEnemies don't respawn, so there's no grinding for levels in the game.  \n\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1] \n\u2022\tNavigating the map can be annoying, but it makes more sense over time.  Having the robot roller skates on to zip around at turbo speed helps with this and is a nice touch, since most RPGs have you plod around at a constant, slow pace.  However, you have to play as the robot to use them.  \n\u2022\tSome fights were hard to get through, since I'd need to avoid making any mistakes (especially when fighting three baddies at once).  If they beat just one of my characters, I couldn't win the fight at all.  \n\u2022\tThe game takes place at night, for obvious reasons, which can make it hard to see clearly.  \n\u2022\tThe 3D graphics are alright, but they're not particularly compelling.  \n\u2022\tI can't decide whether I find the story to be corny or creative.  \n\n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] \nOverall, I would recommend this game.  After you beat it, there's little reason to come back for a second playthrough, but I was charmed and had fun throughout my time playing it.  I did hit a few snags earlier on in the game, getting lost and mixed up trying to find secrets and items while navigating the neighborhood.  There were also some basic battles that required everything to go just right, or else the enemies would wipe out one of my characters and create an unwinnable fight.  I definitely think the game needed some better balancing in that regard.  However, once I got past those nuances and flaws, which I'm glad I persisted through, the rest of the game was a pleasant treat, instead of a dirty trick.", "timestamp_created": 1484331792, "timestamp_updated": 1607223870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649303853511810303", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29189250": {"recommendationid": "29189250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104361263", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 574, "last_played": 1419508371}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game if you can get it on sale and get it knowing there's virtually no replay value.

This fun game had you teaming up with newfound friends to rescue your sister and save Halloween from candy-hunting monsters. The game feels like it was made for a younger audience, but certainly enjoyable by the young at heart.\n\n[b]The graphics[/b] were really nicely done. It was appropriately cartoony, which fit the game quite well. All the animations and movements felt really smooth. Each level of the game was set in a unique setting which the art represented well.\n\n[b]Story[/b] isn't the main focus of the game, but it is there. It's quite cute, fun and appropriate. There are certainly a couple of nods and winks in there and there's some enjoyable dialogue too.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] was simplistic, requiring you to complete a number of quests on each level, all revolving around collecting candy, battle cards (which would give characters a boost in combat) and collectable trading cards. While each level was in a different setting, the gameplay felt a little too much like a copy of the level before it and that made it a tad boring. There were some unique activities on each level, I feel that more variety from level to level would have made it feel more fresh.\n\n[b]Combat[/b] was very simplistic. Depending on which character's turn it was, it would either require a timed button press of one of four keys, a single button press or a mashing of one or more keys. Every third attack by a character had the options of choosing a special attack. Defence used a similar mechanic. I believe the simplicity of the combat can be attributed to a combination of the younger target audience as well as a relic of it being a console port. A Paper-Scissors-Rock style strength/weakness system would modify the damage given/received. The problem with this simplified approach is that after a while, it becomes rather repetitive. Given the number of battles you'll need to complete the game, the repetitive combat simply becomes boring and I found I was wanting to avoid combat rather than chasing enemies for extra candy and experience. This is compounded by the inability to skip special attack animations. While each animation isn't that long, you'll be seeing a lot of them, and if you're like me, you'll just want to skip it and move on.\n\n[b]Achievements[/b] for this game at quite simple to collect. If you examine them prior to playing, you should be able to pick them all up bar one in a single playthrough. That bar one is \"Tisn't the Season\", which can only be acquired on Christmas Day.\n\n[b]Polish.[/b] Costume Quest is really quite polished. I saw no bugs, screen artefacts, characters getting stuck, or the like. If I want to be really picky, the only thing I could bring attention to is that there are some minor signs that this is a port, combat mechanism for instance, but I don't think it would have been practice to have done anything about them.\n\n[b]Conclusion.[/b] Overall, Costume Quest is a beautiful fun game. If you like a casual, light-hearted adventure and can tolerate a little repetitiveness, you'll find enjoyment here.", "timestamp_created": 1481115451, "timestamp_updated": 1481115451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.63326108455657959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28232286": {"recommendationid": "28232286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303708892", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 673, "last_played": 1481073438}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game as it was made by the same group that helped with the Day of The Tentacle Reboot. Whether you should buy it or not kind of depends on what you're after. If you're wanting a mature in-depth game with vast arrays of landscapes, character development and difficulty this is NOT the game for you. This game is more of a kooky sweet family-friendly game to pass time with.\n\nI'm a bit of a completionist and so I found this a fun simple game for completing the cute quests and unlocking the different outfits- it's not particularly difficult/complex but it can keep you engaged for a good 5-15 hours. I'd recommend it for when it's on sale at about $5-$10 as a cute game to whittle some time away with- but it's not something I'd want to pay $15+ for (as there are other more in-depth engaging titles for around that price instead).\n\nPeople have complained that it involves childish jokes; however, to me it was no more childish than some of the original Dragon Quest games and so if you can put up with some of those jokes you can easily put up  with (or even appreciate) these ones.\n\nI found the premises of the game (go door knocking at houses, fight monsters, collect candy, unlock outfits to progress further through), unique enough. It is somewhat repetitive, however I feel that they've balanced this by making the game a short one with three parts taking place in three different areas. To me the game length is perfect - you wouldn't want it to be much longer as you'd get bored of the lack of variety but it has enough different elements to keep you entertained for the length of the game. I'm someone who really likes playing side-quests and mini-games so I appreciated the card collecting, bobbing for apples, finding the hidden children quests, etc they had. And I appreciated playing Grubbins on Ice as whilst you could see it was made off of the same kind of gameplay ideas it was different enough to keep my interest.\n\nI thought the battle graphics were endearingly sweet- although it does involve turn based combat and unskippable animations which may frustrate some players. So- if family friendly games aren't your thing I'd recommend skipping this game. If you're after something short, sweet, unique and like mini-games then this might be the game for you.\n\nBut if you're really not sure if it's your kind of game maybe watch a bit of a playthrough or a few cut scenes on the community board. I did like this game, I would recommend it, but I'm also wanting to write this review so that those who wouldn't find it appealing can be more likely to leave it alone and not come here complaining about having 'wasted their money on a kids game'.", "timestamp_created": 1481096588, "timestamp_updated": 1481096588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28176559": {"recommendationid": "28176559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339884852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 883, "last_played": 1480827295}, "language": "english", "review": "PROS\n-This is a fun retro-style RPG that does not eat up all your time to finish. \n-Whimsical and full of interesting content.\n-Collecting fun items makes.\n-Interesting costumes that give you diverse superpowers.\n-Hilarious.\n-Eyeball Costume from \"Grubbins on Ice.\"\n-This game is like a mix of Pokemon on Gameboy and Stick of Truth lite.\n-I purchased the game in a bundle with Costume Quest 2 and Grubbins on Ice for $5 on Halloween. \n-Timed defense is nice in battle mode.

The dialogue is clever and captures a certain whimsy that most other games either don't attempt, or do attempt but overdo it to the point of poor taste.\n\n-The costumes and other collectibles are hidden, but not buried behind tons of filler. you can collect nearly everything without any backtracking.\n\n-On a simillar note, the game doesn't require grinding to become a powerful player. You can play right through and have a great time with it.\n\nNeutral:\n-The game is short and linear.

Some of the costume transformations were hilarious, others just epic.

Overall, this is a pretty laid back, easy game and definitely hit the spot for the type of game I want to play around October. I bought the Costume Quest 1 & 2 bundle on sale for about $4.

Throw in fun - if simple - game mechanics, good humor, endearing characters and a plot out of a saturday morning cartoon: it's a really good package, and as something I can replay every year, it's more-than worth the TEN dollar asking price.\n\nAt its core it's a super simple turn-based RPG, but even its RPG mechanics have fun mechanics much like those from the original Paper Mario. You can fare better in battle with timed button presses to increase damage and defense. There are battle stamps that work like the badges from Paper Mario, which give each character a boost or a special command. It's really not that deep, but the fights are just difficult enough to require some kind of strategy. Not because they're complex or anything, but because the enemies will simply overpower you with force if you don't have a battle stamp equipped and aren't successful with the timed button presses.\n\nFor example - the Statue of Liberty costume has a special attack (which charge up through using regular attacks) that heals the party a small amount. It's a very small amount, but it can make or break a fight. The game is good about pitting you against enemies that are just a little bit tougher than your party, so you can't just breeze through them. There are also no random battles: all enemies appear on the screen, unless you meet them through trick-or-treating, and they don't regenerate - so there is a set number of battles per zone. This works well with the mechanics, as there are set items and experience you earn from the enemies you fight. That means you really must fight every enemy in the zone to get the full amount of experience, candy (currency) and items afforded to you. \n\nYou move between transitional dungeons and hub zones, where you have to trick-or-treat at houses or stores to progress through the story. You won't be able to do that all right away, though - you'll need to do random quests for kids around the zones, collect candy, bob for apples, trade stuff, and find parts to make new costumes which grant you new field abilities, so you can progress further. The zones are really detailed and oozing with character - they're fun to run around and don't usually outstay their welcome. My only gripes are without a map, it can be hard to find that one last house you need to trick-or-treat at to progress the story, or that one last enemy you need to fight. Also some of the dungeons drag on a little bit - but as I write below, if you're finding the game to drag, you probably just need to take a break.\n\nThe plot is simple - your sister is kidnapped and you have to find her. There are goblins running around, but the adults think they're just kids in costumes. The goblins want candy for some reason, there's a main villain witch, etc. etc. It's really cute, and serviced by some great humor. The game is almost south-parkian in the way that the kids have gotten over their heads in a very real situation to which the adults are totally oblivious. It makes it funnier when the adults names are all literally \"grown up\". \n\nCostume Quest is a game to play in small spurts, as otherwise the mechanics will begin to get repetitive and you'll lose sight of the charm and atmosphere that makes the game so enjoyable. When I say repetitive, I mean the combat and actual field exploration can, yes, get really samey. It's best to play maybe half a zone at once and then take a break. You really owe it to this game and yourself to enjoy every minute of it, and that can't happen if you're just going through the motions. \n\nCostume Quest is a gem. It captures the feel of Halloween perfectly and if you're in the right mood, it can make you feel like a kid again. Like you really are out trick-or-treating with some friends, in a world of make-believe. Buy this, play it (during halloween), and then play the Grubbins on Ice DLC (that comes with it) during Christmas. \n\nI haven't actually played the Grubbins on Ice DLC yet, but I've heard great things about it.

Quiz\u00e1 la mayor\u00eda del tiempo el juego en s\u00ed parece demasiado orientado hacia los peque\u00f1os de la casa (y no lo digo yo, lo dice la propia descripci\u00f3n del juego), pero lo cierto es que hay muchos comentarios que me cuesta creer que pudieran entender, e incluso est\u00e1 clasificado para +10.\n\nMe gusta por ejemplo el hecho de la simplicidad que ya he comentado. Las misiones no son complicadas, la mayor\u00eda de las veces se basan en encontrar cosas determinadas por su peque\u00f1o mapa o ayudar a alguien, los peque\u00f1os puzles son de simple l\u00f3gica y es muy dif\u00edcil quedarse atascado.

Some may dabble into the horrific imagery, the classic monsters, the eldritch horrors or the psychological drama of fear. All of these qualities are what many would consider as connotations of Halloween.\n\nHalloween for me, however, has never been about the scares. While I may sound to be admiring the commercialism itself, I've always been reminded of Trick-or-Treating, Halloween cartoons/specials, and of the creativity/love for the holiday, especially the costumes. These are the qualities adults and kids alike treat themselves to every year.\n\nThese sentiments are why I find myself revisiting Costume Quest as a tradition. It provides a light-hearted, four to six hour adventure (with the DLC and all the extra quests) that captures the qualities I enjoy the most. Its shortened length and kid-like spectacle perfectly shows the forgotten fondness we have for the holiday of fears.\n\n[h1]Something \"Wicked\" This Way Comes[/h1]\n\nCQ itself has nothing unique that hasn't been seen in TV specials, movies or games. Its set-up is that you play as the brother/sister of a family, and you must rescue your sibling from the clutches of an evil witch bent on taking over Halloween with all the candy. (Also possibly not to get grounded). \n\nHowever, what the plot lacks in originality, the game's humor and execution provide something that shows its charm for being derivative of all the things kids and adults love about Halloween. \n\nIf you grew up in the '90s like myself, then you probably are familiar with the trick-or-treat game from Cartoon Network. You walked around an small map with magical costumes, collecting candy from doors and obstacles in a time-limit for high-scores. \n\nCostume Quest shares the basic idea of a magical realism setting where the costumes themselves provide supernatural powers for kids. Instead of a competitive, high-score game, CQ is a traditional JRPG game with Paper Mario-like mechanics and various HUB maps to explore.\n\nCompared to the Cartoon Network game, the maps are much larger along with providing mini-games and alternative quests for hidden rewards. Outside of combat, every costume provides an ability that varies in its utility. The quests are basic fetch or talk quests, and the level-design is a linear set of checkboxes given some player freedom to wander off. You won't be breaking the game's order of events or getting late-game costumes early.\n\nWhen in combat, the kids transform themselves into a larger-than-life representation of their costume in what can be thought of as a Power Rangers mech fight. Enemies' designs are dramatized as well to make the combat more visually interesting than watching a blue-box robot fighting demons in bath-robes. That visual alone is how the fighting mechanics should be thought of: Absurd and simple.  \n\nLike Paper Mario, the turn-based battles are broken up by quick-time-events that add/lower the damage you deal. The player's team and the enemy's take turns trading hits, and while you are on the defensive you can block attacks to lessen the blow. Some costumes have unique abilities like the Knight's Shield (defense buff), the Robot's Missle Barrage and the Lady Libery's Anthem (healing skill). \n\nTo say that the combat system is basic would be stating the obvious. There are eleven costumes in the main game, and three new ones in the DLC. Each costume has its one-tailored playstyle and set of skills, separated by one of three costume types like rock-paper-and-scissors, and they each provide enough lasting appeal to keep the game from getting too stale with a limited roster. The game knows its combat isn't its greatest suit, so the variety and short length go a long way to keep the monotonous gameplay as low as possible.\n\n[h1]There's Only 364 Days Til' Next Halloween[/h1]\n\nAs far as the game's other problems, if the game's charm doesn't sell you on it right away, then the gameplay, in and out of combat, won't sell you on the rest of the experience. \n\nThe writing isn't Double Fine's best as it relies a lot on tropes, especially the protagonist and his/her companions, but the subversions from the player's character towards not carrying about the plot helps mitigate that issue. (Kind of like how Doomguy doesn't care about the plot in his recent game.) This is something the DLC as well as CQ2 fail to grasp as the plot relies on characters explaining the techno babble of wormholes. Neither one captures the same charm as the original. \n\nWhile Costume Quest is certainly not one of Double Fine's greatest successes it is an experience I would easily recommend to others. Usually I would have something more profound to say to end a review but CQ is simply a decent game.  It's nothing innovative in its gameplay, story or even its basic idea, but the way everything comes together nicely makes me longing for next Halloween to replay it again.", "timestamp_created": 1478040019, "timestamp_updated": 1499042051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593480348587036133", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26342928": {"recommendationid": "26342928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025573915", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 1495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 587, "last_played": 1670380127}, "language": "english", "review": "A short, but very enjoyable game that is perfect to play around the Halloween season.", "timestamp_created": 1477945816, "timestamp_updated": 1477945816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502131044864654541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26335893": {"recommendationid": "26335893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101854126", "num_games_owned": 722, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 517, "last_played": 1477907453}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Costume Quest[/h1]\n\nCostume Quest is a great halloween game!!\nIts a cute RPG game with a great story and the game is going to scream HALLOWEEN! at you, its hard to close the game because you just need to do one more quest.\nYou look like a normal kid with a normal costume, but then you get into battle you get that fantasy battle many children feel when you put on your costume, you become the costume.\nThe game contains lot of candy, costumes, quest, monsters, pumpkins, battle stamps, abilities, mini games and FUN!\nI got it for 0.99\u20ac and it just make you forget about time.\nI gonna play this game every halloween from now on, thats for sure! \n\n[h1]10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1477920175, "timestamp_updated": 1479927013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52782750129699707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26327637": {"recommendationid": "26327637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066969681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 321, "last_played": 1477875934}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming game.

Or even deeper.\n\nIt is a one-player RPG game involving two twin siblings getting separated by candy-greedy monsters from Repugia and two friends of theirs. So one sibling gets kidnapped and the other three children (including you as the twin brother or sister) set off for the rescue while fighting monsters, bosses and having fun by collecting Halloween stuff (costumes, candy, candy cards, battle stamps) and solving quests that get in your way.\n\nThe gameplay: Most of the time you will walk around places like your hometown or the town's mall and search for items and quests. All of these help you progress in the story and getting stronger. One quest you must complete a couple of times in order to progress is to knock on every available door to ask for treats. Either you just get them or have to battle a monster (that has occupied this house). \nSo the other part of the game are the battles. The children use their costumes they've achieved (pumpkin, black cat, vampire, statue of liberty, etc...) and their special powers to fight the different monsters. And because it's an RPG you wait for your characters' turns and choose the actions they're suppoused to do now while the monsters get their turns, too. You can loose battles but never die. You just would have to try again. Every win is rewarded with experience points, candy and other items.\nDuring all this you have your note book with you in which you have an overlook of your status, quests (and their status), costumes (with description), candy cards and a variety of battle stamps which can be used for battle by your characters.\n\nI found \"Costume Quest\" very playable, the controls are easy to learn (and they're changeable if you really can't operate with them). I played with the keyboard and it worked just fine. It's a fun RPG with a good mixture of exploring, collecting and fighting. It's also easy to play, so also RPG beginners shouldn't have trouble to finish this game sooner or later.\n\nThe cartoonish 2.5/3D graphics are mostly sweet and lovely designed, that goes especially for the settings you go to.  They're colourful but not rainbow puking bright, they mostly match the Halloween season. When it goes to the characters, I find the children, their battle characters and the monsters were designed okay. I can't say that about the adult characters who either look like obese puppets, lifeless big-nosed humans or stick figures with grotesque heads and faces. They don't only look strange but also quite lifeless. I wished that a bit more effort would have went into their designs. But to the game's credit: the adults play a very minor role compared to the children.\n\nThe sound is so-so: I enjoyed the musical score very much. But the sound? It completely containts sound effects (which are fine), no voices (outside the occesional grunts of monster characters and human background mumbling in more crowded places). This means that the dialogues are all text bubbles and there are even no simple sounds expressed by the characters, wether a \"Gasp!\" or \"Huh?\" or \"Ouch\" or something. I find this negative since at least a bit of voice acting brings extra life to these characters but here, everybody is totally quiet. \n\nWhat about extras? There are achievements, trading cards, one minigame about apple bobbing and there is also an additional chapter included called \"Grubbins on Ice\" that goes on right after the story of the main game. I can't say it's that exciting or so much fun, you practically do the same things and collect new costumes but without Halloween going on. Still, it's worth for a bit of fun and the achievements.\n\nSo, can I recommend \"Costume Quest\"? Yes, absolutely. It's a sweet, fun game all around Halloween and the fantasy of children celebrating it. If you can't stand Halloween or just don't care about it, then I guess this shouldn't stop you from trying but you might have less joy with that game.\nAnd if you're into RPGs or starting this, you definitely should check it out.", "timestamp_created": 1477676264, "timestamp_updated": 1477676264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26252449": {"recommendationid": "26252449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024619791", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1482624609}, "language": "english", "review": "A perfect, if short, halloween game, and even then the length isn't something to complain about.", "timestamp_created": 1477607971, "timestamp_updated": 1477607971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26238725": {"recommendationid": "26238725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006830013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1443478303}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first and best game to ever truly capture the spirit of why Halloween is the treasured holiday that it is.

The characters aren't that memorable and while story is original enough, it's very straight forward. I would say I do like the monsters and how they're just guys doing they're job. This is very true when we get to the expansion where we get to explore the monster to overthrow a dictator.\n\nGameplay:\nThe main objective is to trick or treat at every house to open the door to the boss. Along the way you play hide and seek, bopping for apples, trading cards, collecting costumes and fighting monsters. You costumes are the most important tool as most of them have abilities to travel the area like the robot  gives you a boosts to cross ramps or the knight shield lets you get past falling debris. Unfortunately, most of them are situation and may only need to be used once outside of combat.\n\nBeing an RPG, you'll be fighting a good portion of the game and in some houses, they will ambush you. You fight using your costumes that are all cool to play, each of them having a special power that takes 3 turns to charge and these can really help if you use it at the right time. I mean, there's no point in using a health move when you have full health. Also, you can buy stamps that can either raise a stat or give you a move like throwing toilet paper to stun enemies. \n\nHowever, if there's one problem with the game which could be serious is that it's repetitive. That first line in gameplay is not a few things you can do, that's every area. Even the battles can get boring after a while and you'll have to fight every one of them just to make sure you're strong enough for the boss. And there's only four enemies(melee, range, black mage and white mage), even if there's different monster types, it's still the same four guys.\n\nPresentation:\nNothing to say about the music except I really like the battle them. I barely noticed it sometimes. Personally I really like the simple but cute art and the battle models are badass but there was a bit of lag when I played it. But I have to complain again for the expansion because the sound quality for the cut scenes sounded muffled.\n\nVerdict:\nWhile it is repetitive, I think it's a decent game and good to introduce children to the genre. Plus it gave us a pretty good sequel.\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1476391835, "timestamp_updated": 1476391835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26007176": {"recommendationid": "26007176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048869084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1483751158}, "language": "english", "review": "The treatment of the characters is what really made this game for me.

Now replaying on Steam for the second time the game still holds up very well.  In my opinion it is a very light hearted RPG, simple and short enough to relax with.  The story is short and cute but has enough to pull you in.  You start by picking one of the twins to play as your main character the other u did'nt pick is part of the story as a NPC.  What caught me to the game was the battle system.  The whole game is about Halloween and how different Costumes you obtain through the game will allow you to transform into whatever the costume is about ( Robot Costume allows you to trun into a giant robot that shoots a rocket fist and bombs).  As i said earlier the game is light hearted no complex battle system here which means you dont have weapons or armors no list of magic spells or skills...Each costume can attack and has one special move (which can only be used after two turns).  When attacking each costume has a different button or prompt that needs to be push within seconds in order to get a critical hit...same goes for when a monster attacks your characters you must push a button in time to reduce the damage.

While the battles in the game tend to become tiresome at some point, the game is short enough (both stories) to not become overbearing. The game doesn't try to be more than it is, and is definitely worth the playthrough. Recommendation is to get it on sale as it's been bundled several times. However, if you're in a position to pay full price, please do as the devs deserve it. \n\nRating: 9/10 - Details below\n\nStory: In my opinion the story was absolutely fantastic. Humor was there and though I'm not a twin, I do have a younger sister and I appreciated the sibling rivalry though I'm ancient these days. Though the main idea is to rescue someone, and though that's not very original in stories these days, it was a well told story that kept me very entertained. Further, it allowed me to revisit the child inside me and remember that power of imagination and what can be accomplished and believed in. \n\nGraphics: Though I'm not a huge fan of cel style animation, I was extremely pleased with this medium with this game. Too many details would have ruined the power of the children's imagination and the softer non-detailed aspect of cel animation felt like it lent power to the story rather than taking away from it. \n\nControls: Simple and easy. No issues there. - NOTE: I used an Xbox One controller.\n\nSounds & Music: All basically well done. I didn't play with other music and felt like it complimented the game rather well.\n\nGameplay: One tiny issue was that the battles started to feel like they were more of jumping through hoops than accomplishing anything worthwhile. However, this probably has more to do with my lack of patience for grinding/leveling in games in general as I get older. Honestly, the game didn't drag at all really, and without the unknown of what knocking on the door would do, the game would lose part of the \"Trick\" aspect so essential to Halloween. Only real complaint is that I couldn't advance the text faster during dialogue and was forced to sit and wait though I'd completed reading the sentence. Nor could I pause the dialogue if something came up. \n\nFinal Notes: Forcing me to read at one speed as I read fast, is something that definitely will annoy me. That being said, it's a very solid game that is worth the time and energy if you enjoy Halloween, sibling rivalry and the imagination of children.

Set in a Halloween setting, this game brings forth both RPG elements and strategy, while not making the game too hard. This game isn't too long, but it isn't too short either, with the game duration being around 5-6 hours for the main story. The goal of the game is to rescue your sister from the clutches of an evil witch, and stop monsters from taking all the town's candy by trick-or-treating door to door. Along your way, you'll pick up allies and use many costumes with different abilities in and out of battle to progress through your journey. Completing side quests not only help you, but everyone else as well as you strive to finish your journey. Watch as your Halloween costumes come to life in Costume Quest.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\n[*]Over 14 different Halloween costumes to try on with different roles, abilities, and special moves. Some costumes help you in situations outside of combat.\n[*]Very simple and straight forward turn-base, RPG battle system, that often provides strategy at times.\n[*]Many Battle Stamps to collect that give you an advantage in battle (healing after every turn, additional damage, counterattack, poison, etc.)\n[*]Great, cartoony graphics and atomospheric music that helps set the environment of the game\n[*]Although they serve no real purpose besides unlocking achievements, you can collect trading cards from winning battles and trading with NPCs.\n[*]Occasional mini games that are not only fun, but are great when you want to take a break from fighting or finishing quests.\n[*]Additional story to play after the main that's equally as enjoyable as the last.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n[*]Dodging and attacking quick time controls often don't respond, but it's not a huge issue. \n\nAt only $10 and an average playtime of around 5-10 hours, this game is all-around great to pick up, and can be enjoyed at any time, not just Halloween.

Y aunque tiene parte de esto, la verdad es que una buena idea casi se va al traste por culpa de ser bastante repetitivo.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=721980110\n\nSi, porque a pesar de durar algo m\u00e1s de 5 horas, casi 8 si le sumamos el DLC, al poco tiempo se acaba haciendo repetitivo. Y mucha culpa de ello la tienen los combates. Pese al tema estrat\u00e9gico que aportan los trajes con los que podemos vestir a los personajes, los cuales aportan diferentes stats, y de poder equipar unos sellos, que vamos comprando o consiguiendo durante la aventura, y que aportan habilidades pasivas, todo queda en nada cuando llevamos unos cuantos combates. Y es que dentro de ellos, todo se reduce a atacar y cumplir un QTE, para que el ataque sea m\u00e1s efectivo, y a un ataque especial cada vez dos/tres turnos. Simplemente eso, no tiene m\u00e1s. Entrar en combate, ataque, ataque, ataque especial, ataque... y asi hasta acabar con el enemigo.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=721984269\n\nPero la cuesti\u00f3n de esta repetici\u00f3n no se queda solo en las batallas. El juego base nos ofrece tres mundos (cuatro si a\u00f1adimos el DLC), en vista isom\u00e9trica, en el que vamos cumpliendo misiones.

There's no real reason to use any of the other costumes because none of them have as good stats or as good special ability as an all area hitting massive nuke with follow up DoT damage, a powerful shield capable of turning hits into 1 or 2 damage, or the only heal in the game that doesn't require the target to be dead first to revive them. The combat system is incredibly repetitive, although active due to needing to do timed button presses. Ultimately, though, literally every fight becomes attack -> attack -> special -> repeat. Battle Stamps, the game's only equipment, don't alleviate this issue at all - some of the stamps offer side abilities that Stun or Slow enemies, but you're still doing the same attack/attack/spell trio the entire game.\n\nI'm giving the game a positive recommendation because the repetitive and dull combat system ultimately wasn't enough to dissuade me from completing the (relatively short: 4-6 hours) game. It's still fun running around, collecting candy, and trick or treating, and seeing what the costumes look like in fights.

Hay que rescatarlo/a con lo que contaremos con nuestros amigos. Para hacerlo veremos que nuestros disfraces se tornan reales y tienen poderes que se pueden usar contra los raptores de nuestro hermano/a. Asi empieza este juego de rol por turnos pero con QTEs o interacci\u00f3n en cada ataque (salvo alguna habilidad concreta) del tipo darle a la barra de espacio varias veces o a otras teclas.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente rezuma indie y est\u00e1 muy bien. La banda sonora est\u00e1 bien tambi\u00e9n pero a un nivel inferior (me dio la impresi\u00f3n de que algunos temas son un poco infantiles para Halloween), La historia tiene sentido y es interesante, aparte de que no todo es lo que parece...\u00a1ah! y en espa\u00f1ol (sin voces). Las b\u00fasquedas secundarias (como disfraces extra) se reducen a conseguir las cosas y darselas a quien te pidi\u00f3 o reunir las piezas. \n\nLa subida de nivel significa subir m\u00e1s vida y poco m\u00e1s. No hay posibilidades de desarrollar a tus personajes m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de equiparlos con unos cromos con habilidades (activas o pasivas) del tipo ataque paralizante o una subida de la vida. Los personajes son 3 y los disfraces ascienden a 12 (4 por cabeza m\u00e1s o menos) que pueden ser usados por todos. Cada disfraz tiene su aspecto y sus habilidades, tanto en batalla como por el campo (p.e. el ninja en batalla puede camuflarse o camuflar a alguien para que el siguiente ataque que le lancen falle. En el campo el ninja puede hacerse invisible con lo que pasas lentamente cerca de tus enemigos para que no pillen si no te interesa o si te interesa dar un golpe por la espalda).\n\nLa expansi\u00f3n nos ofrece m\u00e1s de lo mismo pero en un mundo diferente y con diferentes enemigos. En total el juego me ha llevado unas 12 horas, dir\u00eda que un balance de 10 la historia y 2 la expansi\u00f3n m\u00e1s o menos.\n\nEs una propuesta interesante en un g\u00e9nero que quieren relegar la olvido, y bastante elaborada la verdad. Si quieres algo diferente, este es tu juego.\n\nPROS\n- El sistema de combate est\u00e1 bien, asi como los diferentes disfraces que se pueden usar.\n- El ambiente de Halloween est\u00e1 muy elaborado.\n\nCONTRAS\n- En ocasiones parece un juego infantil.\n- Pod\u00eda haber m\u00e1s variedad en las misiones secundarias. Solo hay encontrar cosas y hace de recadero.\n\nPUNTUACI\u00d3N: 8.5 (casi 9) El juego est\u00e1 bien aunque la atm\u00f3sfera pinta m\u00e1s bien para ni\u00f1os. Es un juego de rol diferente que si te engancha lo llegar\u00e1s a terminar.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1464814416, "timestamp_updated": 1464814416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549180328845977783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23321089": {"recommendationid": "23321089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097605915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1019, "last_played": 1463963646}, "language": "english", "review": "7.5/10\n\nPros\n- Just oozes style and charm, with a great Halloween theme\n- Very polished finished product\n- Enjoyable timing-based combat (think Paper Mario)\n- A large number of playable \u201ccharacters\u201d (13 combat costumes + 1 noncombat)\n- Funny at times\n- Includes the DLC episode for free\n\nCons\n- Not a lot of variety in the locations or enemies (3 main story levels + 1 DLC level)\n- Fairly short for an RPG (about 8 hours to finish)\n- Simplified RPG combat leads to very few options and a lot of repetition\n- The story isn\u2019t exactly gripping\n- Very linear\n\nI actually really enjoyed this game.  It\u2019s a very simple and short turn-based RPG that hit a lot of the right notes.  It just has a certain charm to it that is hard to describe. The combat contains a timing-based component where if you perform the correct action at the right time, your attacks will do more damage or you will take less damage on defense.  This helps keep you engaged in all of the battles.  Thankfully this component was included, because otherwise you have very few options in combat (attack, use a special if it is charged, or use a battle stamp which gives a combat ability).  In terms of battle stamps, these are reusable and basically replace items in the game, and can either confer an ability in combat (e.g. stun a single enemy) or a passive ability (e.g. more health).  The other source of variety in combat is the inclusion of 13 different combat costumes, each of which have their own abilities and play style (single target DPS, AoE, defense, healer, etc.).  That being said, even with these additions the combat can still drag at times.  Fighting a limited variety of enemies in the same environment over and over can become tedious.  Overall most battles are quite easy, but a few boss battles require strategy when selecting which battle stamps and costumes to use.

Worrell I bring you these words of advice.. \"Pretty soon the kids won't have to worry about eating their Brussel sprouts because the Brussel sprouts will be eating them.\"\n\nExchange the word Brussel sprouts with candy corn and you'll understand the game of Costume quest, a cute Halloween themed adventure game from the wonderful team at Double Fine entertainment.  The same group responsible for such classics as Psychonauts and Brutal Legend [b](Jack Black playing a rock and roll roadie.... YES PLEASE)[/b]  In this game you play as Reynold and Wren a pair of twins who have recently moved to a new neighborhood, it's Halloween night and they are planning on going trick or treating.   After selecting which sibling you want to control, either Wren, the 10 minute older sister or Reynold the 10 pound heavier member of the dynamite duo, you are shipped off into the world.  The selected sibling gets a Robot custom, the other gets dressed as a piece of Candy Corn..  Social norms be damned if you pick the female character..  who says females aren't into Robots :-D  certainly not me.\n\n[b]  (It was here where the first bit of disbelief struck me, the parents allowed their twin children to leave the house unaccompanied to go trick or treating in a new neighborhood.  These are two children who appear to be 8 - 9 years old, wandering the streets of a new neighborhood on Halloween night which is a night when child predators are normally tremendously on the prowl looking for victims.  Furthermore, after the sibling you didn't pick gets literally kidnapped, instead of running home, or screaming for help  or literally anything we've been teaching children to do for the last 30 years, they decide to go on a crazy adventure to find the sister to avoid punishment.  Just a quick note, a police officer is literally a twenty or thirty feet away away from the abduction site...)  soap box off[/b]\n\nAfter trick or treating at the first house, the pair try a second, only this time the candy corn gets abducted by a candy stealing grubbin monster...  OH MY!!!..   So off we go on an adventure to rescue our sister/brother from the clutches of a nasty candy stealing evil corporation, I'm talking a really dirty nasty organization we haven't seen in video games since Umbrella corporation..   Along the way to rescue your sibling you meet new friends, discover a sinister plot to steal candy, and defeat some monsters making for an amazing Halloween adventure which can be enjoyed at any time of year.\n\n[h1] The Story [/h1]\n\nI pretty much described the story above, siblings, candy, stealing, adventure.  The story takes place in three locations, Auburn Pines, which is the starting neighborhood, Autumn Haven Mall (easy enough it's a Mall), and Fall Valley carnival, each area offers up the chance to explore, trick or treat, bob for candy apples, defeat monsters and oh yeah... get that sweet, sweet candy baby.. nuff said!!!\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe first aspect the gamer is introduced to is trick or treating, which is just as it sounds, you go up to a house, knock on the door and wait for a trick (battle) or a trick (candy)  It's as simplistic as that.  Knocking on doors isn't the only way to collect candy, numerous interactive objects in the environment such as mailboxes, trashcans, shrubs, etc etc etc, can be pounded on by your candy pail in an attempt to wriggle loose a few extra pieces of candy, also numerous areas have candy thrown about on the ground... [b] I personally wouldn't pick up candy off the ground and eat it, but hey whatever floats my characters boat[/b].  The game features three types of collectibles, the first is Costumes, you start with the Robot costume, and soon after acquire a knight outfit, others you can collect are the statue of liberty, a unicorn, french fries and many more.  Many of the costumes have two special benefits, the first being an extra ability you can use while out of combat, like the Robot which can travel faster, or the Knight, that can shield from falling items.  The second ability is a special battle ability, whether it's rockets, a shield of protection or a powerful group heal.  \n\nThe second type of collectible in the game are battle cards, these cards can be used to further enhance your character, give them additional HP, defense, a stun, etc etc etc, you can buy the cards from Sadie using the candy you collect during your adventure.  With each new area, additional cards are added for you to buy, the new cards offer upgrades over the older cards.  These are very useful in helping to gain the advantage in your battles to come.  The final collectibles are called treat cards, these resemble trading cards, they really serve no purpose, outside of being necessary to complete a few quest and unlocking a costume for collecting all of them.   You gain treat cards by defeating enemies and completing quest.\n\n[h1]The Combat [/h1]\n\nThe combat in Costume Quest is rather unique, upon starting the battle your given one option to select basic attack [b](unless you have a battle card which gives you a secondary option like a stun)[/b]  after selecting that option you're taken into a quick time event.  If you succeed in the quicktime event your character does extra damage, if you fail, your character does quite a bit less damage.  During the enemy phase of combat, when an enemy attacks one of your characters, you're given another quick time event, if you are successful you defend some of the damage and minimize the damage you receive, if you fail the quick time event the enemy a significant amount of extra damage.\n\nSpecial ability's   -  those special abilities each costume has I mentioned above are useful here, after three combat turns each of your character unlocks their costumes special ability, this can be anything from from protection, heals, massive damage to a single or all enemies.  It's a good idea to mix and match your party to ensure you have all your bases covered in terms of combat, defense and healing.  A good defense is a good offense makes sense in this case.  It's especially important to include some type of healing for your party, as no healing exist outside of special ability or battle cards.  \n\nThe combat sounds simplistic and it is, but the quick time events keep the gamer engaged and on their seat with each successive battle, letting your guard down can and probably will result in you suffering a defeat.\n\n[h1] Pro's [/h1]\nGood story,\ninteresting characters\nunique combat system\nvery fun to play\neasy to 100% if you're into achievements\ncontroller support\n\n[h1] Con's [/h1]\nCan be a bit too easy with the right combination of costumes/battle cards\nSlightly repetitive enemies\noccasionally controls can glitch out\n\n\n[h1] Recommendation [/h1]\n\nI'd highly recommend this game, on paper it looks rather simplistic, it seems to have many strikes against it from a gamer's perspective prior to even installing it, but trust me on this one, once you start playing and get into the story you'll be thoroughly entertained as I was.  A fun game to play and enjoy, once you start to play you'll want to keep playing until you finish the the story.  It can be a bit difficult to get into, especially when you realize you'll be playing with children as characters, but that's part of the charm, a person of any age can kick back and enjoy the thrills and exciting of going trick or treating once again.. [b] (without having your neighbors call you a cheapskate bastard for trying to collect candy from them)[/b]  I'd really suggest taking the plunge, buying the game, collecting the candy and saving Halloween for children and adults all across the world..", "timestamp_created": 1459939149, "timestamp_updated": 1459939158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681360602378845215", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22265108": {"recommendationid": "22265108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064783185", "num_games_owned": 840, "num_reviews": 267, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1459927961}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy divertido.

The actual gameplay reminds me of a simplified Chrono Trigger or similar Japanese RPG where you travel the map with semi random encounters and fight by taking turns exchanging attacks with the enemy.\n\nI called it a children\u2019s RPG, by which I mean not only is the story about a group of kids (even the main bad guy is a child) but the story would be considered PG if it were a movie. You control a group of kids teamed up on Halloween to stop monsters from stealing all the candy, using the power of your Halloween costumes. In the main world you look like a bunch of kids in homemade costumes, but when you encounter enemies and enter battle, you become whatever you\u2019re dressed as. For example some of the costumes are robot, jack o\u2019 lantern, or unicorn. Outside of battle you\u2019re free to change your team\u2019s costumes to whatever you have unlocked, and some costumes have some sort of real world effect (for example the robot allows you to run fast).\n\nWhen your team is in battle, the options are extremely limited. You can either run away, attack, or use a special move. The special move is unlocked every few combat rounds and usually it\u2019s something like a big attack or a healing spell for your team. An added combat mechanic is the ability to boost your attack or weaken the enemy attack by doing an easy quicktime event. For example every time you attack you press the correct button in time and your attack does 10% more damage, or you press it at the right time during the enemy attack and only take 90% normal damage.\n\nPros:\n+Decent cutesy, fun story for kids. Nothing a parent would have to worry about.\n+Very simplified gameplay, with some element of skill in boosting attacks or finding hidden items in the world.\n+The DLC Grubbins on Ice is included and adds a few hours more gameplay.\n\nCons:\n-Kind of a childish game, but you knew what you were getting into.\n\nOverall the game is a nice diversion that you can finish in a few days. I only played it at first because when Steam was releasing their trading cards, this was the one of the first games I owned with cards and I figured I\u2019d give it a try while waiting for cards to drop.

You're out trick or treating, and your brother/sister gets kidnapped!  It turns out that there is a plot by real monsters to steal all the candy in the world, and only you and your friends can stop them.\n\nYour costumes have different abilities to use while you're walking around town.  One has a flashlight so you can cross dark areas.  One has a helmet so you can cross areas with dripping water or debris.  One lets you roller skate and jump off ramps.  Another lets you into a secret club in your neighborhood.\n\nThe costumes become REAL during combat, and each has a different fighting style.  So if you're dressed as the Statue of Liberty, you can use a healing spell to restore HP to the whole group, or you can hit the enemy with your torch to set them on fire.  If you are the robot, you can rocket-punch a single enemy or use your missiles to attack all the enemies.  And the other costumes have additional things going for them.  As you play more of the game, you will find parts of new costumes.  Only if you find all the parts can you make the costume.  \n\nIn addition to changing costumes, you can also buy badges that give additional abilities.  One lets you add a little poison to your attacks.  Another adds a bigger poison with splash damage to nearby enemies.  Another boosts your HP so you live longer.  Another boosts your damage, but only if you make a critical hit.  You make a critical hit by getting good timing when you push the button displayed on screen.  Critical hits are very easy, I think I only ever missed two.  The first was because I didn't know how to do it yet, the second was because I sneezed and it messed up my timing.\n\nThis game is not particularly difficult.  It is also not very big or long.  Still, it is fun for a little while.  It also has an expansion pack (standalone) where the kids visit the monster world at Christmas time and help the monsters overthrow a dictator.

Small games like this for me are far more exciting and interesting to play because they can be so random.\n\nCostume Quest is clearly a Halloween themed game where you play as a child whose brother/sister has been taken captive by monsters (Grubbins) that think he/she is a giant piece of candy. Progressing through the game, there are 3 or 4 main quest areas/neighborhoods that you 'Trick or Treat' for candy and do various quests such as trading collectible Creepy Treat Cards with other kids, bobbing for apples and finding 6 children that are hiding to get a reward.\n\nThere are of course Costumes that you find materials for and use to fight your enemies, you can buy Battle Stamps or receive them after winning a fight which improve your damage, hp, attack power or chance to dodge etc. Each costume has its own unique ability and attack moves which really adds a little strategy as to which costumes your characters wear to a fight.\n\nAll in all, i really have enjoyed playing through this game! It has a very South Park: Stick of Truth feel to it, in the sense that you are playing as children, exploring the neighborhood, fighting other children in turn based fights, finding collectibles, doing certain quests to unlock access to new areas, having boss fights and so on.

Double Fine Producitons once again hits the nail again with their cleverly designed and well thought out game\n\nCostume Quest is an adventure game where you play a brother and sister who go out during Halloween to do trick or treating but they find out that there are monsters known as Grubbins who are stealing all the candy, you have to stop them!\n\nAcross the game's worlds you have to go and knock doors to ask for candy. Sometimes you will get regular human beings who give you candy, sometimes its the nasty Grubbins which it will send you into an RPG button prompt combat system. The combat system is sort of fun but can get very repetitive and boring\n\nThis game, the same with Stacking, is meant for people unlike me who are known as completionists. Completionists will have a ball playing Costume Quest and leveling up. The game's graphics are really cute and well designed, the music is nothing special but it is good nevertheless\n\nCostume Quest is very repetitive. Expect to enter the boring combat system multiple times and doing the same thing which is trick or treating can get boring and repetitive too. The game's difficulty is good but the game experiences a huge difficulty spike at the end, so much so, that many people I know who have played the game cannot beat the boss battle. I had a hell of a job trying to defeat the boss battle, but the game forces you to level up by completing other side missions and entering more of the boring combat system, which for me, I don't like... the game is okay at first but it can be impossible to finish if you are not leveled up properly\n\nCostume Quest also offers an additional story through a free DLC known as Grubbins on Ice, I tried playing the DLC story, but sadly, I just gave up when the offered the same things as the original game...\n\nDon't get me wrong, Costume Quest is a wonderful game to play, however, with the game's repetitiveness, boring combat system and huge difficulty spike can put some people off, but overall it is a nice RPG adventure game to play\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1453223888, "timestamp_updated": 1453223999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446262478828430176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20606144": {"recommendationid": "20606144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996096136", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 759, "last_played": 1453083577}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game.\nI don't even know where I got it.

There was no originality. Why could we not see three different mini games?\n\nThe variety of monsters was also very lack luster, they introduce new species that have only about 4 or 5 varieties each for a total of under 20. Plus all most of them do is just attack you, no special moves, no variables, just one attack. I get that it was supposed to be simplistic, but it was just too much so for my taste.\n\nThe supposedly clever humor also fell flat in my opinion, the writing was not NEARLY as good as what I am accustomed to from this studio. I loved brutal legend and I loved Iron brigade not only because the games were fun, but they were hilarious as well.

Given I'm also a fan of costuming and Halloween, this was pretty much an instant sell.

Soon after the twin you didn't select is kidnapped by monsters for dressing like a delicious-looking candy corn, you meet up with other trick-or-treaters your age that match your level of imagination and your desire to get your sibling back.\n\nCostume Quest feels like an RPG stripped down to its essentials, with timing-centric, turn-based combat and set amounts of spawns in most areas. This, along with the enemies' leveling along with you, eliminates the need for experience grinding. Wiping out everything is still necessary for 100% completion and makes getting costume upgrades and some secrets easier, but you can get by if you stick to story-necessary encounters.\n\nThe game itself feels a bit small, area-wise, but there are plenty of tasks in each section to keep your party busy and searching for hidden items and secret costumes. A great balance is struck between backtracking through each section and forward progression, so it rarely, if ever, feels like a slog.\n\nThe variety of costumes is also nice, especially their in-combat forms. Due to the children's imaginations, whatever costume they're wearing transforms into a majestic, towering version of its mundane representation, all featuring beautiful animations and unique, often hilarious special attacks. As touched on before, combat is straightforward, with timed button presses coming into play on top of the base mechanics to lessen incoming damage and stack combos with your own attacks.\n\nAll in all, Costume Quest is relatively short, super sweet, and great for any time of year. Just remember that a couple of achievements (for the game and for the Grubbins On Ice DLC) are time-associated, so be ready to fire the game back up when more seasonably appropriate.

This is the dream of every little kid (and grown ups) that ever played make-believe. \n\nPlot : really straight-forward. Team up with the neighborhood kids to save your sibling. A classic good vs evil in a comedic way. Grubbin on Ice is like a mini-sequel or a spin-off and it's highly recommended to play it AFTER the main CQ.\n\nGameplay : I highly recommend using a controller. I can't imagine the battle sequences using a keyboard and mouse, but if you're comfortable with them then maybe it'll work for you. The walking around was a bit tiresome, but worth it.\n\nQuests : all the quests are really well-thought, and a good way to grind, though [spoiler]you can't get past level 10 for the main CQ and not past level 14 for GOI[/spoiler]. \n\nPuzzles : it's not as frustrating, as long as you're EXTREMELY thorough in searching and walking around.\n\nGraphic : I love the character designs, the monsters, the battle sequences.. The backgorunds are pretty smooth. I didn't enjoy the dark areas, but I generally don't like dark areas in game anyway so I guess it's a matter of preference.\n\nSound : it's fun and adds up to the atmosphere of going on an adventure.\n\nCharacters : I really like how all the characters have names, even the NPCs (though not the monsters). The enemies are not EVIL evil, and as lovable as the protagonists.\n\nI give this as 10/10.

Now it is your job to go door to door trick or treating, complete quests, and fight monsters. It\u2019s pretty much a standard RPG with a halloween theme painted on it. The story isn\u2019t bad and it follows Double Fine\u2019s formula well (kid looking game with often adult adventures that is eccentric). There are some dark elements to the game which come out really well and the whole game has a theme of child wonder to it. You fight as real transformers, unicorns, and vampires while facing daemons.

The main point is to go around to all of the stores/houses and trick or treat. Different areas are blocked out until you can unlock certain areas. This is mostly done through monster fights.

You can have up to 3 characters each of which has a regular move and a special ability with a long cool down. Additionally, you have different patches you can apply which are absolutely necessary to stand a chance.

It didn\u2019t vary in between those two numbers but rather certain scenes and areas were stuck at 30. The game isn\u2019t aiming to be realistic so the graphics are cartoony.\n\nOverall, the game was OK.

This game is a superb JRPG with great level designs which sometimes want you to get a walkthrough (I had to use a walkthrough about 3-4 times). The story is a bit short but if you did all side quests (like me), you would at least have about 6-7 hours put in this. If you didnt do all side quests, you would have approximately 2-4 hours put in this. \n\nThe game is beautiful for a halloween-themed game. Coffins are chests, you can trick-or-treat houses for candy or enemy encounters, battle stamps which improve your character in fights and several comedic speeches for all ages. I absolutely adore this game. \n\nJust like in every RPG game, there is a leveling up system. In order to level up, you defeat enemies (just like every RPG). It does take quite a while to level up in this game but that made me want to farm enemies and destroy bosses. \n\nEvery game (excluding racing games) contain bosses (I think). These bosses were rather time consuming but if you had the right costumes for your team, it would be a piece of cake. I did find one boss in the game rather annoying but dont want to spoil it. I would say something about the boss, but just wait till you fight her. \n\nThere are costumes you find from side quests or just main quests. These costumes play a big part of the game not just because its the games title, but you actually get different move sets aswell. The costumes I found made the final boss a 1 try victory for me. The game can be a bit easy if you get guides on where the costumes are located and its pieces. \n\nThere is another playable DLC you get automatically if you purchase this game on steam, called Grubbins on Ice. It's not extremely long, its about 1/3 of the games length. I did enjoy it though because it gave me three costumes, several battle stamps and a nice adventure. I would prefer playing this after the base game because everthing from your first save in Costume Quest, gets sent over into the DLC. It's pretty helpful. It is recommended to do that because enemies are about lvl 13 and your cap is lvl 10 (in the base game). \n\nThis game is a master piece literally. I love it so much and for the price I got it for (99 cents in the 2015 holiday sale) it was worth it. If you see this game going for about $5 or less, purchase it immediately.

[/i] [/b]\n\nCostume Quest is a fun, youthful, and humorous adventure that utilizes overworld exploration, puzzle solving, and a simple turn-based combat system. I would recomend it to children, people looking for a not-scary halloween game, and anyone who would like to nostagically relearn some of the magic of halloween.\n\nThis game does a lot of things well and a few things not so well.\n\n[h1] Good Stuff: [/h1]\n\n[b] Concept [/b] - I love the sheer idea of this game. A group of kids must use their costumes that ACTUALLY TRANSFORM THE WEARERS to fight monsters, save a sibling, and collect tons of candy along the way. It sounds like all of my childhood halloween fantasies at once.\n\n[b] Story [/b] - Less predicatable than one might image. It has just enough twists to keep it interesting, but manages to keep it simple enough for a younger person to enjoy it.\n\n[b] Characters [/b] - Likeable child characters are comparable to black republicans nowadays: maybe there's one or two here and there, but overall they're pretty rare. The children in this game are highly likeable and funny, which is a metaphorical breath of fresh air.\n\n[b] Humour [/b] - My inner 10 year old got a real kick out of this game. The jokes are silly and childish, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh quite a bit during my playthrough. I wish more games could imbue such a good sense of humour into their games.\n\n[h1] Stuff That Was Ok: [/h1]\n\n[b] Music [/b] - It wasn't exactly a synphonic masterpiece, but it does add to the immersion. My only qualm is that the battle music can get a bit repettitive.\n\n[b] World/Map [/b] - Again, it wasn't mind blowing or pioneering or anything like that. Each area is pretty different, which does well to break up any monotony. Some environmental objects (specifically, ramps) can feel really clunky, but all-in-all it doesn't affect the enjoyment of the game.\n\n[h1] Stuff I Wish Was Different: [/h1]\n\n[b] Character Progression [/b] - I believe that the Devs wanted to create a simple RPG that was less about combat and leveling up and more about the story. They absolutely succeeded, so props to them. I do wish that there would have been a slightly more in-depth character upgrade system, but that's just me.\n\n[b] Combat [/b] - Like I said above, the game isn't really combat or skill focused. The combat is simple and easy to learn, which is good. The problem with simple combat is that it can get very, very repetitive. I was actually somewhat sad when the thought \"ugh, do I really have to fight these guys?\" came to mind, because to me it meant that the combat had gotten boring. It's worth noting that I was admittedly about 3/4 of the way through before that happened.\n\n[b] Lighting [/b] - My last minor complaint is the lighting in the game. For the majority of the game, the Devs did a great job of keeping the overall lighting pretty low, but bright enough to see where you were going and to find the things you needed to find. However, the [spoiler] first part of the 2nd act and the upper two floors of the mall area [/spoiler] are just too dark. There is a brightness option in the menu, but amping up the brightness seems almost to be cheating, since part of the game's charm is the comic-spookiness of low lighting. That's really my only complaint on the world design.\n\n\n\n[h1] Final Summation: [/h1] [b] I really did enjoy this game. It was a fun way to spend a few hours, and it made me think back to my childhood dreams about being the costume I wore on halloween. Would recommend.

As the name implies, the game is about costumes. You and your sibbling start out Trick or Treating when these monsters kidnap one of you mistaking you for candy. You must go on a quest to recover your sibbling before the night is over. \n\nThe game works on two levels. The first is the main view (or town) where you solve simple puzzles and go door to door Trick or Treating. When you meat a monster you go to the battle level.\n\nIn the town you are in a cheaply made costume that looks like a kid made it. The streets have other kids walking around in various costumes and adults that have quests that need completing in order to pass by. Once you have visited all the houses, you are allowed to go to the next part of town.\n\nIn the battle section, your characters transform into whatever costume you had on. Each costume has normal attacks, special attacks, stat benefits, and/or a special ability outside combat.\n\nThe graphics for this game are in no way realistic. It was designed to look cartoonish. Not saying that the graphics are bad. On the contrary, for the style they went with, they look awesome. The backgrounds are highly detailed, the characters look smooth, the costumes really look like they were pieced together with cardboard and various things around the house.\n\nThe combat is probably the only place I would have any complaints with. When you begin, you can only do a normal attack unless you have a \u201cbattle stamp\u201d that allows a secondary attack. On your third turn you will be allowed a special move. You can use it then or save it for later. The problem is that you have to wait 3 turns to use it again. Additionally, when you go to do your normal attack you have to press the corect sequence or yo will do about 1/2 to 3/4 damage. This is also tru with defending. If you fail to hit the proper button on time you will receive full damage. \u201cBattle Stamps\u201d will help with the combat but are limited to 1 per character. This is all there is to the fights. Granted there is a bit of strategy involved with the combat, this is very limiting.    \n\nAll in all, this was a very fun game and the DLC was also fun.

The graphics are cute and the premise is great but it really didn't live up to expectations.\n\nFor starters, I had hoped a game from Double Fine would not rely on repetition quite so much to bulk out an already short game. The main story has only four enemy types, repeated with three different skins, at least two of the costumes are identical in attacks and powers and each of the levels has exactly the same set of quests - bob for apples, find the hide and seekers, unlock a door by collecting something.\n\nThat would have been fine if it was as fun to play the game as it was to follow the short story but there is virtually no challenge.

The objective of the game is to go to each area, collect candy as well as costumes (hence the name costume quest) and fight any monsters that cross your path.\n\nThe game style is turn based combat with each costume giving you a different ability, and different quicktime event-like buttons to press to do more damage. The one little problem I have with the game is the fact that the (spoiler alert) French Fry and Vampire costume quicktime event/button press can prompt you to mash the shift key. On Windows, this is a little bit of a nuisance, as the game will minimize and ask if you want to turn sticky keys on. It isn't that big of a deal however, due to the fact that it's a turn based game.\n\nThe game is not too much of a challenge if you can find the right combinations of costumes and battle stamps with which to fight the enemies. One can easily finish all of the quests simply by playing the game and not going too far out of the way to complete objectives.\n\nThe characters are lovable (even the grubbins), the style is pretty cool, and the story, while not too exciting, is fun.\n\nI would reccomend trying it out.", "timestamp_created": 1447003598, "timestamp_updated": 1447003598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18936294": {"recommendationid": "18936294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025393549", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 825, "last_played": 1509530445}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple turn based RPG that has barely any depth, except there is a charm to the game that keeps you playing.", "timestamp_created": 1446921735, "timestamp_updated": 1446921735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18935193": {"recommendationid": "18935193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037157024", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1450488244}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute, hilarious game.

There was something fun about \"being\" something else for a night. Also, the pails full of candy. Double Fine does a wonderful job portraying the things I loved about Halloween as a kid while also giving me things to appreciate as an adult.\n\nThe art direction is top notch. There is a very consistant design aesthetic that carries through the entire game, one that would look right at home as part of a Halloween cartoon special. The character design eschews realism for expressiveness - not quite to the completely distended extremes of Psychonauts, but still not aiming for \"realism\". The main characters are kind of chibi, which is great because it allows for a remarkable expressiveness. Par for the course in a Double Fine title, the dialogue (all written, no voice acting) is really sharp and loaded with humor both obvious and subtle. The background music tends to be fairly repetitive, but it's atmospheric and compliments the visual design. Shades of Danny Elfman, which is a *perfect* choice for Halloween.\n\nThe game itself is a turn-based RPG but with active, timing based offense and defense boosts. It's very similar to Super Mario RPG (which, if it didn't innovate that style definitely codified it) in how it plays out. Actually, of any game to compare the gameplay to, I'd compare it to Hothead's Penny Arcade Adventures. It's funny, Ron Gilbert came over from Hothead just a month before the game was released - he didn't actually have any direct impact on the game, but given Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert's long-term association, I can't but help think he cribbed from his friend's design. Which is fine because it worked then and it worked in this game. Add in a dash of Earthbound, in being able to engage with enemies on screen before the turn-based battle begins, and you've got a tried-and-true formula.\n\nThe costume transformations are fun and the special powers associated with the costumes are anywhere from \"useful\" to \"hilarious\", in the case of the Lady Liberty costume. One thing the game could be dinged on is a lack of variance in combat. There's only one special power per costume, and a handful of optional \"third powers\" that can be added. In actual practice, a lot of combat could be completed by just attacking, waiting for the special attack to power up, unleash the attack and if anything is still standing repeat the process. The combat is thankfully fast-paced for a turned-based RPG, but it can get somewhat repetitive.\n\nI could harp on a few other things. The game is short - even if you explore and find everything, expect 5-6 hours at most if you're able to win most battles (and you probably will). Of course, as an adult with a job, short isn't a crime for me, but those who hear RPG and expect 99 hours of playtime will be sorely disappointed. The story is simple, which fits a game about a bunch of kids on Halloween night turning into their costumes and saving their sibling and their candy stashes, but there could have been a little bit more meat on the story's bones. Characterization was strong and it goes a long way, but the world of Costume Quest is charming enough that I felt like I was missing something to not get more. The environmental \"puzzles\" are barely a challenge and the solutions are nearly flat out stated by some NPCs who might as well add \"GET IT?\" to their obvious, pun-based solutions. Then again, it's a great entry level title for children. For adults, you'll probably find the puzzles and their solutions too, too easy.\n\nBut those are quibbles. Costume Quest is one of the most charming games I've played. It's got a great atmosphere and  great idea for a game that ends before the shtick gets old. The game also, I might add, is fairly diverse in its characterization and does not limit costumes amongs the PCs by gender. Yes, Double Fine, I noticed, and it's an awesome thing to see game designers implement.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to people tired of gray-and-gritty, guns-and-guts gaming. The game will make you smile. It's no challenge at all, if that's how you want to measure \"worth\" in a game, but the wit of the game and the clever concept will make the game worth the price of admission in my opinion.

The first level already brims with nostalgia of days gone by (for me anyway) of walking the neighborhood at night and going door to door with a pale for the candy. \n\nYou may wonder what the gameplay is like - well, first off the story is not serious, it's a light-hearted romp that'll make you smile for all ages. \n\nThe overall story begins as your brother or sister (depending on who you choose to play as) gets kidnapped by strange monsters who love candy, and you are going to rescue them. \n\nThe gameplay itself mostly is you going door to door in various places, and sometimes you get an adult with candy (which is like a currency in the game), or it could be a monster, which whom you have to fight.\n\nThe fighting is done like a turn-based RPG, and you can get little things to help you out, called Battle Stamps. Each stamp has a unique ability you can use, each of your character gets one stamp per person, but you can switch them out if you don't care for it.\n\nThere's no real dying in the game, you lose a battle, and you can just try again. \n\nThe settings are really fun, like a neighborhood with various decorations, or a mall etc. The humor is really good, and adults and children will enjoy it, it's really a game for the family. Sadly, there's no co-op but it's fun on its own.\n\nThere's also the DLC \"Grubbins on Ice\" included which adds 1-2 hours more. The core game isn't TOO long even getting everything, maybe 4-5 hours?

It's, in one word, candy. I like candy.\n\nI highly recommend using a controller with this game. Keyboard controls felt pretty odd.\n\nAchievement Hint: [spoiler]The game doesn't know the date. It asks your machine for the date.[/spoiler]\n\n+ Creepy Treats (collectibles) design\n+ Non-irritating but forgettable music\n+ Back To The Future discovery sound\n+ Costumes with exploration effects in addition to battle effects\n+ Costume battle action design\n0 no map\n0 Mostly inconsequential Battle Stamps (buffs)\n0 Level caps\n- Incorrect Battle Stamp descriptions\n- Pretty linear\n- Almost consistently no challenge\n- No description on save slots when loading\n- After the main game we see the credits headlined \"Grubbins on Ice\"\n\nTechnically the game is about quasi-isometric exploration with battle intermezzi.\nThe battles are similar to those associated with RPG-Maker games or for example Final Fantasy 7 but instead of action meters there is simply a battle order. Without fail, first your up to three character attack, then the up to three enemies - repeat until defeat.\n\nAlthough this may sound dry, the game is surprisingly fun. I played the game for maybe 11 hours, got stuck twice for a total of about 90 Minutes (misunderstood game mechanics in the beginning + final boss in the add-on) and it was entertaining enough to feel like around 4 hours.\nThis is mostly due to a number of good design decision. For me, the game wasn't so much about the main storyline but more about your party of characters speaking with each other, other inhabitants of the area and enemies, and it was about the battles. For some reason those things made me think, I'd like to play this in a Spongebob Squarepants world, at one point.\n\nIn order of relevance the advancements in the game are: gaining companions, completing new costumes and getting Battle Stamps. Ultimately progress in the game requires the player to win fights (actually you go trick-or-treating but half the time that results in fights) but there are a number of obstacles that require you to explore beforehand.\n\n*Companions*\nCompanions come with a new costume and provide an extra action per round in battle.\n\n*Costumes*\nYou get costumes with characters or you are given a blueprint which sort of tells you, by way of a somewhat indiscriminate outline, which three components/materials you need to complete the costume. Components are unique and can be found in more or less hidden treasure chests, given to you by inhabitants of the world, and maybe, I don't quite remember, be part of battle spoils. Once a costume is complete, it can be assigned to any of your characters.\nHalf of the costumes come with an Exploration Ability, i.e. an ability that can and (with the exception of one  costume in the add-on) must be used in the exploration part of the game. The most important ability is the Boost that you get with your very first costume. The Boost allows your party to speed across the area and is essential to the pacing of the game. At one point or another, the player is likely to miss something plus there is a little back and forth in the game anyway. Without the Boost ability that could have easily turned into a chore - very good design decision.\nAll of the costumes but one have a Combat Ability, i.e. a special that needs two battle rounds to load and can be executed instead of a normal attack.\nApart from having an effect on game-play the costumes just look cool. Even if there wasn't an achievement connected to that I'd still recommend to take every costume into battle at least once. I simply like the progression of the costumes from the materials you have to collect over the (not really) crappy \"not quite there\" or \"Dad did the best he could\" design of the costume as the characters are wearing it in exploration mode to the awesome \"this is how the kids see it\" (or maybe \"this is what adult think how the kids see it\") design in battle, character design and attacks.\n\n*Buffs*\nBattle Stamps are buffs that can be assigned to your party's characters, one each. Buffs include boosts to health, defence, dodging, counter-attacks, the over-powerful stun and the underwhelming auto-revive - usually buffs are passive. I basically stuck to the same buffs throughout the game, occasionally upgrading when a better version of the buff turned up.\nUnfortunately, some of the buffs have misleading descriptions, most irritatingly the auto-revive is supposed to revive a character after one round. While this is technically correct a more apt description would explain, the character is revived after two rounds (one round after one round, see?). I only ever tried the buff when I had trouble with the final boss in the add-on and having a character inactive for two rounds is just unacceptable in that fight.\n\n*Collectibles*\nThe Creepy Treats are mostly just nice-to-have. You collect them mainly as battle spoils and sometimes trade them with inhabitants. I guess they are mostly original ideas, e.g. Licorice Cables, Chocolate Hamburgers, Coconuts & Bolts, Misfortune Cookies.\n\n*Battles*\nAs said before, each round in battle has your character(s) act first, then the up to three enemies. Usually, rounds go on until one side is defeated. In theory, there is an option to run away but I haven't tried it yet.\nEach round each character chooses one of standard attack, the costume's Combat Ability (if ready) or the Battle Stamp buff (if active). Standard attacks have QTEs connected to them. There is a number of different QTEs, i.e. hitting a specific, dynamic button in time, hitting a specific, dynamic button on time, moving the left analogue stick around, and repeatedly pressing a specific, dynamic button. The type of QTE is dependent on the costume. If you pass the QTE, the character deals 50% more damage.\nCombat Abilities need two rounds to load so they can be used every third round. They are usually a tactical option and it's not always useful to use them right away. For some reason, attack buffs do not affect Combat Abilities. This may even make the standard attack a preferable option overall.\nSome Battle Stamp active buffs can be executed instead of a standard attack. Of those the most powerful are likely the different stun abilities which can take a single enemy out of the fight for up to two rounds. Except for bosses, the later game can be played without ever getting hit by an enemy. This is very powerful since even a \"failed\" enemy attack can take as much as 25% of a characters live away.\nSome Combat Abilities can prevent almost all damage to characters.\nEnemies mostly do standard attacks which lead to a defensive QTE which, on success, prevents half of the damage to the character. Magically inclined enemies can heal, buff attack or defence of one of the enemies.\nBattles are pretty short and easy but fun, largely because of the costumes. \n\n*Game Experience*\nA few more words on the game. One of the rather negative aspects about the game is its linearity. Bring me this and that or you cannot go on, fight those guys or you cannot go on, complete a costume or you cannot go on. But this is well compensated by the entertainment factor.\nEven though of limited use, I'd have liked a map to come with each area. This was sort of addressed in the add-on where you gain the ability to zoom out a bit with a costume.\nThe game was a bit on the easy side.\nWhen loading/continuing a previous savestate the game doesn't tell you anything about the progress made. The game simply lists \"Slot 1\", \"Slot 2\" and \"Slot 3\". There isn't even an indication whether the slot actually contains any saved progress. This is a minor ugliness.\n\nI had a lot of fun with Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice and highly recommend the game.

It's devoid of pretty much any interesting game system. The slim turn-based combat system present is similar to the Final Fantasy games, but you'll get more depth out of Final Fantasy games or 99% of their copycats. All of the combat uses Quick Time Events as well, which gets old after the second or third combat encounter. Game balance is simple and a little skewed. The game can be difficult (but hardly) when you only have two party members, and its trivially easy once you have three.\n\nThe overworld is linear. There's a tiny bit of exploration to be had, but not much. There are roughly four quests in the entire game, each repeated several times for each phase of the game: find a card off a monster (combat encounters), bob for apples (simple mini-game), trick or treat houses (random combat encounters), and find six hiding kids (semi-hidden on overworld).\n\nThe game crashed a few times, and since there is no manual save feature at any time, I lost 15-20 minutes of progress each time. The game plays the same every time.\n\nThere are costumes to get, which are your battle suits or \"classes\". Variation here is only relevant in the costume's \"special ability\" but the game is so easy that once you have three party members, battle strategy matters little.\n\nGraphics meh, sound meh, witty dialogue is OK but not astounding. No voice acting.\n\nI don't recommend this game. You can find much better games in all of its genres for cheaper.  If you insist on wanting it, it's worth $2-3 on a sale perhaps.

They aren't always easy. There is also a two layered strategic system of costume specific special abilities and 'battle stamp' special abilities that can be used with any costume. There are quite a lot of ways to build effective combinations, and in some difficult battles, you will have to adapt your strategy to the circumstances to succeed.\n\nDownsides? Well, the camera angle is fixed and with levels so sprawling and complex, it can be easy to miss things hidden behind the foreground that are mandatory for story progression and to have to search for them.\nSome of the puzzle solving is quite silly, and the player characters' unprompted hints to solve them can be annoying as often as they are helpful.\nIf a baddie wandering on the overworld map initiates combat with you and you lose, you get spat back out in exactly the same place, and the baddie will immediately initiate combat again, giving you no time to switch up your strategy before being launched into exactly the same battle; that can be a bit frustrating.\nAnd finally, the lack of complexity can mean that the simple mechanics get a little bit dull even over the short playtime.\n\nSo its JRPG lite, but I recommend it for the charm alone. This game has actually made me question my disillusionment with the corporatization of Hallowe'en by showing me the cuter costumes and candy in a more wholesome and fun light.

The pace spirals beautifully until you're facing off against giant monsters in a twisted maze, firing rockets.\n\nOne of this game's seeling points is its fantastic humour; like Psychonauts it puts you in the position of a child and throws referential and meta humour at you, barrelling on whether you get the jokes or not.

The game takes you on a journey of the imagination as some children\u2019s quest for candy on one Halloween night quickly turns into something much more.  Ultimately, this game is just very well done and has a \u201csoul\u201d that should easily appeal to a vast audience.\n\nThe level design is charming and exploring the maps is fun.  The whole concept of \u201ctrick-or-treating\u201d being a fundamental part of the gameplay is brilliantly done.  The story is basically one giant trope, but the way it is told is delightful.  The characters are likeable and the humor is clean but entertaining.  Even the style in which you warp into old-school, turn-based battles is executed well and synergizes perfectly with the atmosphere of the game.  This game is a quintessential example of how several good things can work together to create something great.    \n\nAs I alluded to, one of the most charming aspects of [b]Costume Quest[/b] is the way \u201ctrick-or-treating\u201d in the game world is a central part of progressing the game.  You knock on doors and are either given candy (treat) or have to fight a battle (trick).  This leads to another splendidly charming feature of the game, which I also alluded to earlier: the battle warp-ins.  Depending on what costumes your characters are wearing, they change from little kids into various gallant warriors with nothing but the power of their imagination.  From there, the battles play out in the old-school, turn-based RPG style that was prevalent in the 90s.\n\nAside from that, you may also want to explore the levels, find secret areas, meet characters, and do side-quests and mini-games to gather more candy and collect the trading cards.  There is plenty to do!\n\n[b]Costume Quest[/b] is a charming little game that makes for quite an enjoyable experience.  As I said, I feel it can appeal to a wide audience.  I would posit: if it sounds like the [i]type[/i] of game you [i]may[/i] enjoy, it will probably be a [i]specific[/i] game you [i]do[/i] enjoy\u2026 if you decide to get it.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1433211733, "timestamp_updated": 1449516014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809315621852874756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16110695": {"recommendationid": "16110695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993404696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 696, "last_played": 1634621126}, "language": "english", "review": "Started this game as a distraction, ended up spending 11 hours playing and beating the game and got most of the way through the dlc.

You play the role of a child who is obsessed with halloween, and spends the night going around the neighborhood trick or treating to get his candy. At the beginning of the game, your twin sister is kidnapped and you embark on your journey to rescue her. Along the way you make friends with other trick or treaters who join your party. \n\nWhile you are walking around the world, you are able to pick up extra candy, talk to the residents of the town and start battles with the bad guys. The combat system in Costume Quest is turn based, each of your characters will have their own costume which all have different powers. The combat is also primarily quick time events, which is normally not something I am a fan of, but it works quite well here. \n\nThe graphics are nothing special, but they do look pleasing and the cartoon style is something which fits the story and setting nicely. Sadly the audio in Costume Quest lets it down, there isn't any voice acting, and very little sound effects when you are walking around the world.\n\nThe game is set across four different levels, each of them has their own theme and style, with lots of different items and hidden locations to find in each of the levels, they feel plumped out and interesting to explore. I didn't find there to be any difficulty, you can complete the game without being beaten once, so maybe a New Game+ mode would of fixed that. I'm not sure why Steam has counted me having sixteen hours, as the game took me about five hours to complete along with the majority of all the side missions and achievements. \n\nI only really ran into one technical issue, and that was frame rate, the Steam in game counter shows it running at 30 fps while walking around the world, while in the combat phases, this jumps up to 60 fps. I noticed some screen tearing with v-sync off, but this also may be an issue with my rig (I don't think it is considering the specs I run), but it was nothing major. \n\nI can recommend Costume Quest, because I had a really good time playing, and it has a different take on the party based games, and for the full price of \u00a36,99, you can't go wrong with the amount of content that is included. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

You play as Wren or Reynold, fraternal twins locked into a system in which happiness is always kept at arm's length. Your twin, the object of your worldly fulfillment, is taken from you, and you are forced to incorporate yourself into the capitalist consumer machine in order to free them from bondage - i.e. willfully enslaving yourself even deeper in order to cast off perceived oppression. \n\nThe erstwhile heroes are indoctrinated into consumerism through perceived need. Costumes and battle stamps are tools by which they can defeat their perceived oppressors, and candy and creepy treats are the currency by which they can obtain them. The creepy treats only award a special costume upon completing a full set, forcing the consumer-hero to seek out other members of their in-group to trade with and developing a reliance upon victimizing the out-group in order to obtain more. The same is true for candy, but on a much larger scale: widescale destruction and abuse of natural resources is encouraged, and upon reentering a zone the supply magically replenishes itself. Candy is ultimately spent on battle stamps, an entirely extraneous commodity that the game can be won without, but is marketed as invaluable and a means by which to constantly sink the children's personal supply of wealth.\n\nThe true capitalist hero of this story is Sadie, a brave young entrepeneur with a monopoly on the battle stamps market who is happy to aid the heroes in their fight against the villainous 'monsters.' She allows her customers to develop a dependence upon her product before beginning to dramatically ramp up the price to obtain newer and better versions of the same - designed obselescence at its finest. By the end of the game the player is lucky if they have several hundred pieces of candy in their bucket, while Sadie sits on thousands that the player spent to constantly upgrade their battle stamps. The 'monsters' of the game are cast as villains bent on hoarding all the world's candy for themselves, when in reality they are collecting it in order to save their own lives. Sadie, on the other hand, is motivated purely by profit - lying, expanding, and price-gouging to drive it ever higher.\n\nThe harsh reality is that this game is designed to indoctrinate the player into heedlessly reaping the world's resources and victimizing their competition in the name of achieving fulfillment. They are taught to at the same time fear and trust the two heads of the capitalist serpent, sybomically mirrored by the twin heads of the Doublefine logo: the Repugians, who are the face of foreign investments, and Sadie, the friendly face who is always there to help. \n\n10/10 illuminati confirmed.", "timestamp_created": 1431054597, "timestamp_updated": 1431054770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15717764": {"recommendationid": "15717764", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980177272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 633, "last_played": 1400635296}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, what a great game.  \nIt's a sleeper hit, in that it hits you under the chin like a sock puppet over a mailed fist.

You use different kids halloween costumes to have different powers and they change form between the overworld and the battles, both of which look great, almost cell shaded and comic like in places. \n\nThe story is similarly charming and cartoon-like with a lot of effort put into appealing to the child in you and the nostalgia that part of you holds. I won't give out details but needles to say it is certainly interesting and although it doesn't take you to many 'new' places it will probably give you a fair few chuckles while playing it. \n\nHowever gameplay wise is were problems start to happen. It has solid enough combat, basically lifted directly from super mario RPG, with an extra damage/extra defence mechanic which has you playing very brief mini-games with each hit. Although the combat is solid it is also a little same-y, you'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over again but as you constantly get new costumes and abilites it doesn't really get boring. \n\nA big plus that helps remove some of the repetative nature of the game is a lack of grinding. Although you have to fight a certain number of fights in each area (sort of) you don't usually find yourself grinding to gain XP as you will rarley find yourself outstripped by enemies...until the ending. \n\nOkay so I'm not going to give the ending away or anything but between the last normal enemies you fight, groups of 3 level 10 enemes, and the final boss there is a 10 level difference. Meaning that although you can blitz through most of the game up until this point (completeing all quests is seriously not even a chore if you keep your eyes peeled) you will have to go back to previous areas to grind up at least 5 levels before you are even remotely ready to take on the final fight. This isn't helped by the final boss' ability to clone itself into 3, although that is the least of the issues. \n\nOne final annoying point is that the ability to hold a button to go fast in the overworld is tied to a specific costume which means your main character has to wear it the entire game if you want to be able to move with any decent amount of speed, a very poor decision. \n\nOverall not a bad game, a little short and a huuuuuge difficulty/grin wall right at the very end but it has a lot of charm and if you can get past the issues you will find a great little experience. Worth picking up for such a low price and sure to be someones nostalgic memory in the future. \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1430340842, "timestamp_updated": 1430340842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15582344": {"recommendationid": "15582344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079605049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1418906206}, "language": "english", "review": "While the graphics and atmosphere are invitive, the game is very repetetive.

[b] I MUST [/b] say that this game is [h1] AMAZING! [/h1] This game brought out my inner childhood of pretending that I was a Jedi or a ninja on halloween and you guys put all of it in a game! One of the best games I've ever played! Thank you Double Fine!\n[u] Summary [/u]\nCostume quest is a cute animated game that is a turn-based RPG Halloween game! Your goal, to save your (brother or sister, your choice) from the evil candy stealing Grubbins! You may free-roam around the (actually) large 3 areas that the game provides you to search for your sibling, collect battle stamps, trading cards, costumes, [i]Trick or Treat[/i] (A MUST :)), battle Grubbins, and find new friends! There is all sort of neat little things that the creators put in for you to find for yourself! The dialog is absolutely a belly-rumbler and the controls are crisp and easy to use! At the end of [u] Costume Quest [/u] the creators decided to throw in the DLC Grubbins on Ice which adds on to the orignal quest and is also quite entertaing as well! If you are a teen or an adult, this game will surely touch your childhood in one way or another!\n[u] The good! [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Controls are on point for this game, even with a controller!\n[*] The graphics are very cute and clean! This game his it's own style on graphics and runs very well on [b] ANY [/b] Computer.\n[*] Gameplay and storyline gets right into action immediantly and never declines in action during the whole game!\n[*] Although the game does not come with voices, the dialog is quite funny!\n[*] Very good setting! Music helps improve the mood and the atmosphere. No doubt makes up for the lack of in-game voice-overs.\n[*] A rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive!\n[*] Achievements are real easy to achieve if you finish the story carefully.\n[*] A [b] TOTAL [/b] bang for your buck!\n[/list]\n[u] The Bad! [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Although dialog is good, in-game voices would help\n[*] A short campaign and DLC will only put you at about 20 hours to 100% completion.\n[*] Familar battles may get a bit annoying, but no too much.\n[/list]\n[u] The [strike] Ugly [/strike] AMAZING[/u]\n[list]\n[*] A rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive!\n[/list]\n[u] The Verdict [/u]\nOverall this game is amazingly entertaining and fun to play for all ages! While the game may have a few minor flaws, like no voices and it's length, it makes up with no doubt with good graphics, sounds, entertaining storyline, neat details, and epic quest! It's a must have in your steam library!

This game reminded me A LOT of South Park Stick of Truth to the point that I actually wondered if the South Park team had used Costume Quest as an influence when they created their game. That being said, obviously the actual story and dialogue is very different to Stick of Truth. For one, the kids aren't swearing constantly, for two nobody is getting anything shoved up the rear region and for three there is no [b]spoken[/b] dialogue. I was really on the fence about there being no voice actors in this game. What I enjoy about Double Fine Production games is that their characters are really likeable and they take the time to show you a little bit about everyone in your world, even the guy that you see for one second will have a funny line and a nice costume. Here I felt that was not necessarily absent but not as prevelent when compared to other Double Fine games like Psychonauts. I wanted to hear the kids voices especially in cut scenes where the dialogue is bouncing between 5 different people. It just would have made it easier to follow. Obviously it's not like you're constantly reading, this isn't a visual novel, it's just something that I would change. The characters are still likable and the story keeps you motivated to continue to the end.\n\nWhat I liked the most about this game is that it's funny! It's fun! It's lighthearted! The art style is great. The world is detailed and immersive. The turn-based fighting avoids becoming repetitive because every now and then you get a new costume and a new set of awesome moves that come with it. Everytime I got a new costume I would call my boyfriend over so we could watch it's ultimate ability and high 5 afterwards because 90% of the time it was FREAKIN AWESOME! Heck I even took one of the ultimates and put in on 9GAG because it rocked my world.\n\nhttp://9gag.com/gag/aLPeW75\n\nWhat's more, you get Grubbins on Ice which is about an extra 1 - 2 hours of gameplay after you've completed Costume Quest. It's equally as fun and provides a great ending leaving you wanting to purchase Costume Quest 2 so you can see what happens. To complete both Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice should take 7 - 10 hours depending on how into unlocking achievements you are. It's also the type of game that you can play again after a year or two. Oh and also, if anyone from Double Fine reads this: Thanks for adding the Psychonauts music in the Camping Store at the Mall.

You follow the protagonists as they have to fight a menacing threat on Halloween and their costumes will help them. I will give a short explanation concerning several aspects of the game.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is pretty solid, though it can get repetitive after a while. Each costume brings with it a certain power or ability that can be used to get past certain obstacles (Such as entering a location, passing an object and more). This means that every new costume you unlock will be used, one way or the other, to acquire new adventures, enemies, candy and secrets.\n\nThe combat is turn based, but it works. The idea behind it is simple. You have to press the attack button (E for keyboard) and then time the same button again at the right moment (A small bar appears) to gain an effective attack.  After you have attacked, the enemies will attack your group. Defense works the same. The enemy goes into slow-motion, you get a chance to press the right button to defend yourself. Succeed and you get less damage, fail and you get more damage. On the third turn of the battle you unlock your costume's special abilities. And last, but not least, you can augment your costumes to enhance your performance in battle or cause status effects to your enemies by battle stamps, which you can purchase. Candy is the currency in the game.\n\nStory:\nThe story is simple, but fun. As I wrote at the beginning of this review, it's pretty much a child's fantasy turned into a game. You have to fight monsters, your Halloween costumes give you super powers and you get to save the world. There's not really much to tell in this part.\n\nSound:\nSame as with the story, the music is simple, but it works. It's not the type of soundtrack that starts to get annoying after a while and it does give you the proper atmosphere for the game.\n\nStyle:\nThe game has a very colourful appearance and you'll see this in-game as well. From the small houses in the comfy neighbourhood to the big, shiny, blasting super costumes, everything just screams fantasy. \n\nTotal:\nIf you're looking for a fun game and you don't mind a bit of repetitive combat, a simple story with a rich fantasy style attached and you can miss a few bucks/ euros, then go ahead, you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you're looking for a game with engaging gameplay, a rich story, a good challenge, this game won't be for you.\n\nPersonal:\nI recommend it, I liked it, finally got around to finish it shortly before writing this review.

It is a relaxing change of pace in the gaming world littered with FPS's. Don't let that fool you though ! This is a game which will involve you for the short 6-7 hours it lasts and the boss battles though easier than average will require rudimentary strategy. In all an enjoyable game with leaves you smiling ! I mean, with Glowing Unicorns, Ghost Pirates and even Ninjithsu Scarecrows, there is little chance of going wrong :) \n\nWhat's to Like ? \n                 \n1. Good story, involving for both young and old.\n2. Great variety of content for a short game, lots of items and quests.\n3. Relaxing style of open world game play, with exciting battles.\n4. Achievement Hunters will get 100 % easily.\n5. Addon \"Grubbins on Ice\" DLC included by default ( Around 1/3 the length of the original game)\n6. Great cartoonish graphics reminiscent of old games such as XIII.\n7. EXCELLENT PORT RUNS SUPERBLY WITHOUT GLITCHES.\n\nWhat's not that exciting ?\n\n1. A little more length of the game would have been nice.\n2. While the number of quests are nice , it would have been nice to have achievements for some more of them too.\n3. Although I think that a lack of map is no way detrimental for this particular game, some gamers might think otherwise.\n\nWhat's to hate ?\n\nNothing :) No major flaws.\n\n\nCostume Quest will bring out old memories in you, even if you live in a region where Halloween is not that big of a festival/event. All those childhood fantasies of wearing a make-do costume and pretending to be a bigger robot/ninja/whatever-you-liked is what forms the premise of this game. Evil monsters are here with a sinister plan to rob the world of all its candy!! Your sister, who dressed up as a candy for Halloween is abducted by them too. Hence starts your quest to rescue her. You get many costumes along the way, which turn into their big sized fantasy counterparts when you are in battle mode. Some of the fun ones include a burning fire attack Scarecrow, a Pirate that can summon ghost ships and even a glowing Unicorn to heal! You also meet friends along the way to help you in the quests, eventually increasing to a party of 3. \n\nThough this game is short, but it does not feel so as it has adequate amount of quests and in game story to keep you attracted for a lazy weekend of playing. There is the main story to follow, the add on DLC, trading cards (in game not steam) to be collected and even battle stamps to be bought with all that candy you collect ! Last but not the least. it rewards you as well with not that difficult to get achievements.\n\nThe game is open world, with a linear flow, yet is not pushy at all. Humour is present and its of the pleasant kind, not the very obvious or cheesy just-for-kids type. So full marks there too. Battle system is turn based with a system of quick key presses to get the most optimum attack once u have selected your options. Battles are easy for the most part. Later bosses require a little strategy, which while keeping you sufficiently involved in the story, are easy enough not to deter the calm flow of the game. \n\nIn all, a recommended buy.

It is all told through the use of \"speech bubbles\" around key characters. \n\nThe game is pretty reminiscent of JRPGs, but without any specific classes or skills, just leveling and different constumes with different abilities. When playing the game, you're penned in to one of a few key areas. These areas are pretty large though, so there's always a fair amount to explore, such as finding hidden coffins [rather than chests], and quests to complete. When you encounter a monster, you'll be thrown into a fight scene very similar to those used in JRPGs. \n\nI've played this game with a controller and with keyboard/mouse. Given my experiences, and the fact that this was originally for consoles, I would definitely recommend using a controller to play it. However, keyboard/mouse also works well.\n\nThe 3d model graphics are very cartooney, but very good as this fits well with the concept of using speech bubbles when characters are talking. They give a very nice impression of the \"feel\" of halloween. The design of the kids is also very good, although there could have been more diversity in the adult characters. It would have been nice if the camera wasn't locked in to a specific angle, however.\n\nThe soundtrack to this game is simple and not very overbearing when you're in the environment, which us good, but the music during cutscenes can get a bit repetitive. There is a distinct lack of voice acting, and I did feel that the game was a bit let down by this lack, but this didn't detract too much from my enjoyment. You may be in trouble if you can't read speech bubbles.\n\nThis game includes both CQ and it's DLC \"grubbins on ice\". GOI is much of the same high quality, but set in winter.\n\nCQ is a very good game, if quite short. It's not extremely challenging, but it has a very good story and art style.

It takes place during Halloween and you are either a twin sister or a twin brother who has to save your sibling from evil trolls.\n\nUnfortunately, when you start the game you can instantly tell that it's made for console. I gave it two minutes of wobbly movement using my arrow keys until I gave up and plugged in the Xbox-controller. You can also tell from the gameplay that this is a definite console game. One part of the game is basically to smash as many objects as possible and to solve easy quests to collect candy, the currency used in game. (And, for me, that becomes hopelessly monotonous.)\n\nThe other part is to fight enemies, which is done with a classic turn-based fighting system. There's quick-time events here and you have to be fast on your xyab-buttons to get bonuses when you fight. (Something that also enhances the feeling of this being a console game.)\n\nIn the end I can summarize the experience with saying that the graphics and the story gives some charm to the game, but that the gameplay becomes repetative. On the other hand, with an Xbox-controller, it would work great as some casual entertainment on a sickday or when you're a little hung over.\n\nCostume Quest will also be great if you can't get enough of collecting stuff in games.

Well, this game is kinda like that, only instead of playing as a plumber in a world made out of paper, you play a child during Halloween with an overactive imagination.. Or, is it in his/her mind? I suppose that is a mystery for yourself to solve.\n\nCostume Quest is a charming, yet sadly short, turn-based RPG with an amusing story about two siblings who used to bicker with each other on a daily basis.. Until one of  them gets kidnapped, leading the other on a quest to get their sibling back, and in the process making new friends as well as learning to get along with the sibling they once disliked. \n\nAs I said, the game is kinda like Paper Mario, where there are no random battles, and combat is based on timing button presses to get the highest damage as well as reduce incoming damage. What makes it different is the game's main gimmic: Costumes.\n\nThere is a decent selection of outfits one can aquire throughout the game, some earned during the story, others by completing optional quests. Depending on the costume you and your friends wear, it'll affect how fights play out. The costume YOU wear is also important, because some outfits have abilities that'll allow you to progress or make your game easier (Such as lighting up dark paths or sneaking around in plain sight).\n\nOf course, this game isn't just about costumes, but also trick or treating. In each chapter, you will be required to do some trick or treating in order to unlock gates. This is a rather amusing system, because behind each door lies a, of course, a trick or treat. If it is a treat, you get some free candy, which can be used to buy upgrades and abilites that can allow you to customise your style of play beyond just what costume you prefer to main. However, if you stumble across a trick, you get tossed into a simple battle. Anyone who played Paper Mario probably has a good idea how these battles work for the most part. They are quite fun, but after awhile it does get repetitive due to the simple combat system. Doesn't mean it is boring, though, because some battles really are quite engaging (and in a few cases, really hard unless you make use of a certain outfit or stamp).\n\nAt first, combat is challenging and thrilling, but as you progress in the game, it does start to get a bit anti-climatic (At least, until near the end), where you are able to effortlessly mow down anyone who crosses your path. Doesn't help that the highest you can level is up to 10, which brings up another sad thing about this game: It is short....\n\nAt first, the game will seem quite epic, your expectations probably being that it'll be a decently sized venture.. But then you reach level 10, and discover that you cannot level any further.. it is at that point that you discover that the end is near, and when I discovered this, I was a bit disappointed... I had gotten so invested that I was sad my adventure was almost over. At least the game ended with a bang, and I liked that, but it left me wanting more. Thankfully, there is a bonus adventure for those willing to brave it that are not totally satisfied.\n\nIs this game worth checking out? I'd say so.

For those who don\u2019t know, Tim Schafer is the mastermind behind critically acclaimed (but not necessarily financially successful) games such as Psychonauts, Grim Fandango, Full Throttle and more recently, Broken Age. In many ways, I feel that Tim Schafer is the Tim Burton of video games. Whilst not all of his games (or in Burton\u2019s case, movies) are necessarily fantastic, all of them share a common, whimsical and imaginative style with a quirky sense of humour. Therefore, going in, I had big expectations going into this game. Needless to say, given the big red thumbs down above this review, these expectations weren\u2019t quite met.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nThe game takes place on Halloween, where you (the character that you pick) and your sister/brother (the character that you didn\u2019t pick) go out trick-or-treating, only to have your sibling kidnapped by strange monsters. You effectively spend the rest of the game in an attempt to rescue said sibling. There are three major locations to explore, including your initial suburb, a mall and \u2026 another suburb with a fair. Simple, straightforward, and not a whole lot more to say than that. \n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nAs previously stated, Costume Quest is largely a turn-based RPG. Unlike many other turn-based RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, battles are not random encounters. Instead, they are generally triggered by either knocking on doors (\u201ctrick or treating\u201d) or walking into a wandering enemy. A large majority of the enemies that you face in the game are [i]compulsory[/i], as you are required to \u201ctrick or treat\u201d every house in each area in order to move to the next area.\n\nThe \u201cclass system\u201d in the game is determined by the costume that each character is wearing. Each costume has a normal attack (which to my knowledge is the same regardless of which costume you use) and a special attack, which you can use every 3 turns, which each have their own unique abilities. This usually consists of extra damage, healing, armour or some negative effect on the enemy (such as stun). You initially begin with one character with the Robot suit. As you progress through the game, you unlock more characters (maximum of 3) and costumes (of which there are many). Unfortunately, despite the large number of costumes, many of the characters play very similarly and largely fall into 3 major classes \u2013 a fighter that deals damage, a healer and a character that provides buffs. This is exacerbated by the fact that, apart from one single boss fight (in which you are constantly reminded to use a particular sort of character), you can more or less run through the entire game without changing your costumes at all. \n\nThe battles themselves play out similarly to most turn-based RPGs, with the notable addition of timing-based button prompts, which will be familiar to people that have played Paper Mario or The Mario and Luigi RPG series on handheld Nintendo systems. The prompts for each attack depend on the costume that each character is using, and successfully completing these will lead to additional damage (when on offence) or reduced damage (on defence). These prompts include things such as pressing a button immediately, pressing it at a certain time, twirling your left stick around or mashing a button repeatedly. Although these do add [i]some[/i] depth to the battle system, in the sense that you can\u2019t entirely fall asleep at the wheel and just mash A repeatedly, it still remains far too shallow and far too easy. I am practically an old man when it comes to gaming, and even with my old-man reflexes, I managed to hit approximately 99% of the prompts without any trouble. \n\nWinning the battles awards you with which is used to level up (which increases HP and strength) and candy, which is the currency in the game used to purchase stamps, which can be equipped to your characters to give bonuses, such as increased damage/defence, splash damage and so on. Once you\u2019ve reached the level cap and/or have purchased all of the stamps (both of which I did prior to finishing the game), there\u2019s no longer any purpose to the battles, making the already cumbersome and tedious battles just that much worse. \n\nThe rest of the game is padded with tedious fetch-quests, hidden-object finding and an awfully unoriginal and unimaginative mini-game. Worst of all, you are required to do these same activities each time you move to a new area. Most (but not all) of the costumes that you unlock have a secondary ability that can be used outside of the battle. The Robot suit, for example, has rollerblades which allow you to travel faster (which is generally why you\u2019ll spend most of your time in this suit) and travel up ramps, leading you to so-called \u201chidden areas\u201d. The other costumes have abilities that are, for the most part, used once in a particular part of the game (most of which is [i]right after[/i] you obtain the costume) and then never necessary again. As a result, most of these abilities seem really tacked-on, which is a real shame as I feel like they could have done so much more with it.\n\n[h1]Presentation:[/h1]\nFirst things first \u2013 I loved the cartoony art style used for this game. I really have no complaints about the graphics. The characters are cute and the setting is undeniably Halloween. Remember - nothing screams Halloween more than Jack-O-Lanterns and candy, and be warned \u2013 there are Jack-O-Lanterns and candy [i]everywhere[/i] in this game. The sound and music are, for lack of a better word, appropriately Halloweeney. One thing that they absolutely nailed is the animations used for the battle transitions, in which the cardboard boxes and cheap trousers used to create the children\u2019s costumes are transformed into visually-impressive life-like versions. This will hit all the right spots for anyone that\u2019s worn an awful costume in their younger years and imagined looking so much cooler. With that said, having these animations play out every single time you enter a battle wears out very quickly, which is exacerbated by the fact that there\u2019s no way to skip them.\n\nAnother major gripe that I had was the complete lack of a map/mini-map. This, coupled with the fact that most of the sub-areas in the game look more or less identical, resulted in me walking around in circles looking for the last house to trick-or-treat, or the last hidden child. \n\nBy far the biggest hook for this game is the classic Tim Schafer-esque humour and dialogue that we\u2019ve come to expect from Double-Fine. Whilst not every line will necessarily make you laugh out loud, it\u2019s hard not to at least smirk. At the very least, you\u2019ll appreciate the effort that Double Fine has gone through to give each and every character a unique line of dialogue. It should be noted that the game lacks any voice acting, instead opting to go with on-screen text. On one hand, it\u2019s a shame, given how awesome the voice acting has been in some of DF\u2019s earlier (i.e. Psychonauts) or later (i.e. Broken Age) has been. On the other hand, bad voice acting could have destroyed the delivery of the quirky, humorous one-liners. \n\n[h1]Overall verdict:[/h1]\nOverall, the game was largely disappointing. It\u2019s a shame, really, because the quirky presentation and humour really highlighted everything I love about Tim Schafer\u2019s games \u2013 it was more everything else that let the game down, most notably the repetitive and shallow gameplay. I can honestly say that during the 8 or so hours that I spent finishing the game (including the DLC), I can\u2019t think of many moments that I actually enjoyed myself.  Therefore, with a heavy heart, I can\u2019t recommend this game to anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1415779459, "timestamp_updated": 1418698012, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566452443599700928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12894165": {"recommendationid": "12894165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031488969", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1415832994}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game, great to play on Halloween.

You play as one of two suburbanite siblings (brother or sister) on a quest to save the other from monsters on Halloween, but the only way to do that is by trick or treating, getting candy, and crafting more costumes, naturally. From start to finish, this game does a great job in recreating the wonder and excitement of Halloween that we all remember from when we were little. You're not in costume as a robot, you ARE a robot. Each costume transforms the character into what the costume represents when you enter combat, a brilliant idea that makes you feel like your imagination is making it happen, as it did as kids. Each costume gives you different stats, 1 special move in combat, and some also have special abilites on the world map that you need to use to progress in a puzzle like way, though I am disappointed that the different costumes look the same regardless of which party member is wearing them.\n\nThis game oozes personality with its fantastic writing and entertaining characters. It creates a fun world that is both whimsical and believable. For that, Double Fine deserves a lot of credit. The game consists of 3 zones (for the normal game and 1 additional zone for the expansion Grubbins on Ice) that are each varied, noticeably distinct and very well realized. You start in the most familiar of places and gradually move to the more fantastic. The further you progress gives a feeling of going deeper down the rabbit hole. It's an adventure that, once finished, leaves you glad you made the journey.\n\nThis game is not perfect though. As with most turn based RPGs, the combat can get repetitive, and the system is rather shallow. There are only 3 choices in combat, basic attack, special move, and stamp attack. The special move is only available every 3rd turn and the stamp attack only exists if you have an ability stamp equipped so most of the time you will be using basic attack and each costume only has one animation for each battle option. Though combat incorporating timed button presses to strike harder or deflect some of an attack aids in keeping the player focused. Those same presses lead to another complaint: the default keyboard mapping is a bit strange and even movement felt a bit clunky on the keyboard; once I switched to an XBox 360 controller, the controls felt great and much more natural.\n\nAnother minor complaint is that sometimes the text goes by too fast (automatically) and you may miss a line here or there, which can be disappointing as the writing is a big part of what makes the game so enjoyable, but that's just a nitpick.\n\nAlso I wish the game were a bit longer, I managed to 100% complete the game in around 7 and a half hours. I wouldn't say the length is a con, more that I enjoyed playing and hated for it to end.\n\nOverall: A great game with a great story, writing and atmosphere. It manages to accomplish exactly what it sets out to do. Could some things have been a bit better? Sure, but that can be said about most games out there.

Well sometimes it was a bit to tough for my taste but only because I misunderstood the battelstamps, you have to assign one for each character or they do absolutly nothing. So it is an easy and charming game with some twits and nice sets of ceneries. So in all if you look for a satisfying game that is just like a vacation from all the hard games around here, pick this one. Expecially if you search for something cute to play over Halloween.\n\nThe Negative Aspects:\nThe problem is that the controls feel stiff, and that is pretty rare for a PC game. It feels more fluent with a controller with analog sticks but it is ruined by the quick time events. While in the keymenu where you can rebind the keys they are labeled with 1, 2, 3 and 4 and so on (Also some keys are not bindable and just bindthemselve as they feel like) in the game they are indicated with xbox360 controller keys. Which makes this game impossible to play with a PlayStation controller or any other not xbox360 controller, (except maybe an SNES controller but no analogsticks so the stiff feeling is back). And you may think, it can't be that bad with the keyboard, well you have to precisly manouver trough seom ramps while speeding up.\n\nAlso I am very disapointed that there are no voice actors.

It has a wonderful sense of atmosphere that really does define Halloween for a young child.  The world is a bright, colorful, slighty scary place full of surprises.  In the game you have to explore the area for candy, solve a few puzzles, and battle a few monsters.   There is some rpg aspects in fact that you level the party,  you can buy power-ups with candy, and the choice of costumes. The idea of combat is great as your costumes come to life, each wih a special ability.  In reality, the battles tend to be a bit repetitive and button mashfasts.  Still, I always look forward to each new costume to see its animations in battle.\nOverall, I highly recommend this game just on charm alone.

But is it worth playing? In my opinion - unless the Halloween theme truly appeals to you, not really. Sadly.\n\nThe thing is, you'll master the game's turn-based combat mechanics in the first hour. After that, the only challenges will be the occasional boss battles. Every other battle will just be a chore of waiting for it to be over, because there pretty much is no way for you to lose or have to develop a certain strategy. And as fun as the different costumes animations are to watch (the attack animations, especially that of the eyeball costume, are absolutely the high point of the game), after a while it just feels boring; despite the combat being spiced up by mechanics like having to push the correct button at the right time to do the most damage.\n\nApart from that, there isn't much gameplay to be had here. There's a decent enough minigame (bobbing for apples), and in the DLC (freely included) there is a little maze puzzle, which is hardly challenging, but entertaining enough. The rest of the game? Walking around and exploring every nook and cranny of it's world. Which is a charming enough world. It's a shame, really. The whole concept of the game is just really cute, the designs and attack animations of the costumes are as previously mentioned absolutely wonderful, and the dialogue is at times pretty amusing.\n\nBut it just doesn't cut it. The game is boring and repetitive (it has 4 areas, and your tasks are the same every single time) and all the charm in the world doesn't make it interesting to play. There is promise there - the final boss fight had some challenge, and it took me a few tries to find the best strategy (which combination of costumes would be most useful to help me win) - but the fact the game doesn't ever really live up to that promise just makes it all the more disappointing.\n\nThe game will probably provide a good time for players who are not looking for a challenge, or players who just haven't had a whole lot of experience with turn-based RPGs yet; or simply young players. Everyone else? There's better stuff out there.\n\n[After a bunch of \"unhelpful\" ratings, I edited the review to hopefully sound a bit less opinionated and a bit more informative.]", "timestamp_created": 1413832046, "timestamp_updated": 1414931407, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573581218719482422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12581469": {"recommendationid": "12581469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068147092", "num_games_owned": 1899, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 348, "last_played": 1413734628}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me lo he pasado ya por tercera vez, me gusta mucho.

Worse, because there are only two costumes in the game with healing abilities, every battle had to be designed around the possibility that the player would be totally unable to heal. The end result is that every battle is exactly the same thing whether you're fighting a boss or a basic encounter. They tried to add a bit of variation with equippable Battle Stamps.

Not exactly action-packed, but still enjoyable and funny! Might be best for a parent who's looking for a fun game to play with their child, but that doesn't mean others should shy away from it if you're looking for a quick something to try.\n\nIf what you're looking for is a big, complex RPG, you're probably not going to be satisfied with Costume Quest. I believe I got the game in a bundle, but decided to try it today and give it a shot. The humour in the game is great, even if you're older. I think the targeted audience for the game is a bit in the younger ages, but it's still fun to burn through and play. I managed to beat the main part of the game in one day, but you can still squeeze out a couple more hours or so to go through the rest of the little niches and find the rest of the secrets. \n\nThe visuals of the game are nice; they get the job done and have a nice, simplistic design about them. The models for the NPCs and out-of-battle characters are a bit minimalistic, but the enviroments and battle models have a nice polish to them to make the world seem a bit more interesting. The music fits well with the themes and does a good job, but I'm not really one to write a lot about soundtracks, so I'll leave it at that. \n\nThe gameplay, as I said, is simple but has its charms. You have several characters and costumes, unlocked progressively through the game, with various battle stickers to make some interesting little setups. All of them look pretty great, especially some of the later ones, and have special abilities to use and help either knock out enemies or support your team. There's a few little minigames and game quests to break up the grind, so it doesn't always feel repetitive. \nUnfortunately, the game mechanics themselves are a bit plain. You can only do a basic attack until a few turns have passed and you've got your special charged. Other than that, unless you have a battle sticker with an additional move, you can't do anything. The attacks and defends are centered around little, and I mean little, quick-time events. You usually either have to quickly press/mash a button, move the control stick around, or wait a moment to time a press. It gets a bit stale rather quickly, but it's pretty short, so I didn't mind going through with it. I found that most battles were pretty much done in about 3-4 turns, with the exception of the last boss, when you finally had to use a bit more strategy with your setup. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend the game. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in its simple yet enjoyable experience.

There is definitely a sense of atmosphere that is set with the colors, lighting and art style. You'll wander through a neighborhood, a mall and a carnival. Everything is beautiful and charming with a slight spooky edge to some places, but its a charming spooky not a horrific kind. After you select a gender, you are quickly thrown into the story. Your sibling has been kidnapped by goblins that need candy and since the sibling is wearing a giant candy corn costume you understand how mistakes can be made.\n\nSpeaking of candy, you'll find it everywhere, because its the currency of the game. In the map there is an attack button to knock candy out of objects. You'll find candy after battles, in treasure coffins, completing quests and you'll trick-or-treat for it going door to door. Of course there's not always a stranger giving candy, sometimes it a goblin that results in a battle.\n\nIn battles, you're not just kids in costumes, you become giants. Your little cardboard robot costume turns into a towering robot, a french-fry costume becomes a mega fry crab, a statue of liberty costume becomes the statue of liberty! So its a little pretend, and thankfully the game lets you skip transformation animations to start each battle.\n\nThe combat is really simple and very well animated. First your entire team completes a turn, from the leader of the party to the last member. Then the enemies will each take a turn. You have a limited selection of what to do, attack or a special power every 3 turns. Different costumes have different basic attacks, each with its own way of getting a critical hit. Timing, to press a button or key at a specific moment, others have you wiggling the analog stick, others have you button mashing the same button or key. It keeps you watching the battles and make the long animations feel like less tedious to watch. The special skills range from damaging all enemies, healing all allies, majorly damaging one enemy, hiding an ally and other things depending which costume you're wearing.\n\nWhen the enemies attack, you'll be given a chance to lessen the attack with a quick button press. These button presses are different each time, which is nice, but I feel like even timed correctly, there's still a chance the block won't be successful. Some enemies really telegraph their attacks, such as jumping into the air with a strike. Enemies don't just attack, they'll cast heal, shield, strength and fire. Everything you've seen in RPGs before, but this is just simple.\n\nThe enemies don't have too much variety, goblins, big goblins and ravens, but each 'race' can have a 'class.' The graphics look great and they are in full 3D, its just there aren't that many of them. Each enemy has a level, which is good, but early on in the game enemies feel far too overpowered when you have a party of 2 characters. You'll never have a party more than 3, but neither will the enemy party.\n\nWhen you are on the map, you can see enemies march around, so there really aren't any random battles other than the trick-or-treat battles. You can even sneak up behind map enemies and attack them so when the battle begins, all enemies take a small amount of damage. Its a nice feature in what can be tedious, thoughtless battles. Every battle seems to play out the same no matter what enemy classes you face. You just need to time everything correctly and sit through your special ability animations.\n\nYou can also buy stamps that you can equip to each of your characters that will give them added benefits such as dodging, more HP, regenerating HP, counter attacks, higher attack damage, higher critical damage, a stun skill, the ability to poison a foe or damage all foes next to the target. These simple stamps do a lot to really personalize the game and I feel like you need the stamps to succeed in the game.\n\nWhen party members fall in battle, they're back after the battle. Everyone gets full health after every battle. In fact, when your party gets wiped out. You just respawn back on the map next to the enemy that killed you. There is no consequence for failure in the game and I feel the game is smoother because of it.\n\nEvery battle gives you experience points, but so does completing quests. Since the enemies are limited, so is the experience. So that's why I had to turn to stamps in order to win battles and even then a lot of battles seemed like only luck got me through the first two hours of battles. There is also a level cap on your party and you don't level up individual characters, but rather the entire party.\n\nOn the map you'll talk with NPCs and read their little text boxes. The town, mall, carnival and village feel alive. There are plenty of NPCs to give you quests, such as find this or do that. Other costumed kids want non usable items that you'll find from winning battles and some quests have you finding kids that are playing hide and seek. There is even a well done apple bobbing minigame where red apples count as one point to your score and green apples count as 3 points. Its a nice deviation from goblin slaying monotony.\n\nEvery costume doesn't just have its own special and basic attack, most of them have a practical use on maps. As a robot, you can speed around on your rocket skates to jump off ramps. These rocket skates are the game's run and its so much faster than just walking. The ninja costume can vanish, the fries costume baits people into following you, the knight has a shield to protect you from things overhead and other costumes help too. There is a big variety of costumes and you can find pieces to make new costumes. It adds to the game variety, even if I ended up using the robot for the skates and the statue of liberty for her healing power.\n\nIn all this is a 5 or 6 hour game that is easy to play and easy to finish after the first two hours. There is even DLC that keeps the game going in a different setting. If it wasn't for the cute charm and the extras like costumes and stamps, I'm not sure I could recommend it because of how dull and mindless the fights became.", "timestamp_created": 1411662896, "timestamp_updated": 1412101343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738276541233062744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12229452": {"recommendationid": "12229452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024894616", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 530, "last_played": 1403651618}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little romp.

I guess it's an anti cheat thing. Though I don't really see the point in cheating in a game so forgiving as this one.\n\nAnyway. The game has a very monster house feeling to it. Where you have your friend, later, friends, a little side humor and a lot of surprising events all wrapped in a properly ill lit scenery. The game doesn't even feel like an RPG until you get into your first battle. And it starts off very rock paper scissors until you get further in. And so far it is the only game I know that can potentially punish you for focusing on killing off the healer in an enemy party. \n\nYou traditionally go around collecting as much candy as you can from houses around as progression to find your sister, who has been abducted or something... I don't remember. It wasn't important. It's generic. There are other quests to do and things you can choose to find or not. But you do not have to do most of them to progress. Though if you're like me, you'll get lost in the darkness and end up getting everything done before you even find the last place to trick or treat. \n\nBattles... I feel like I played a game that was like this. But I don't remember it. Battles are more tactics based and there are No end all kill all invincible sets. A couple missed defense or sloppy offense will get you beat, and you'll be seconds from trying again. Because the game is forgiving, and instead of other rpgs that have you holding your head because you forgot to equip the accessory that would make your life a whole lot easier. You'll be right there able to try again and or challenge yourself with No penalty. \n\nCostumes have many roles in and outside of battle. Though honestly the run ability should have been either standard or at least something that could be swapped. I found myself sticking to the robot costume for it, as walking through the entire game seems like a chore, especially if you're lost. The roles inside of battle are diverse and almost always useful depending on whether you feel the need to attack or defend in battle. Other suits can also health or even revive. \n\nExploring was probably the most fun. Regardless of how often I've gotten lost finding the last windy road or silly mistake you overlooked is always gratifying and adds to how nice it is to have maps and areas you have to explore in its entirety to enjoy. \n\nBecause the levelling isn't all out of whack if you left other quests behind and need to do them battling isn't a chore of going through useless cinematics to clear peon battles. It stays fresh throughout and has a simple story that is deliciously visioned to make it worth playing again just to catch the quick humor or screenshot the sarcastic joke that had you hesitant the first time.\n\nThat being said, there is another story inside it that I hear is more expansive than the main one. So it is very well worth the time and effort.

The designs are cute and quirky and thw worlds are just open enough to make them fun to explore but not too open so that you get completely lost and turned around.\n\nSince all of the different costumes the characters can wear have different powers attached to them, the fighting never actually gets boring. There's different combinations of costumes you can use to find the ones you like best and none of the costumes are actually a bad choice. They're all really powerful and have their own benefits, even the ones that seem weakest will have awesome healing abilities that make them great in a boss fight.\n\nThere are some puzzles that you have to solve using your costumes but they're all pretty straightforward, if not explained outright. This is never really a hard game but I think that works for it. The battles are just challenging enough to keep you engaged but never hard enough to really destroy the whimsy of the game.\n\nThe only thing I really found annoying was having to back track in order to find certain things you need, especially in the mall level.
