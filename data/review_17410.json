Ditching the conventional first-person shooter formula, Mirror's Edge takes players on a breathtaking parkour journey through a beautifully designed cityscape.\n\nOne of the game's standout features is its striking minimalist art style. The clean, vibrant aesthetics create a visually appealing world that is both futuristic and immersive. The color palette is carefully chosen, making each environment pop with a sense of life and energy. It's a refreshing departure from the dark and gritty tones often found in other games, and it adds a sense of optimism to the overall experience.\n\nThe parkour mechanics in Mirror's Edge are nothing short of brilliant. The game's protagonist, Faith, moves with unparalleled grace and agility, allowing players to seamlessly navigate the urban landscape. The fluidity of movement is not only a joy to control but also a testament to the developers' commitment to delivering a unique and satisfying gameplay experience.\n\nThe level design deserves special mention. Each level is a meticulously crafted puzzle that challenges players to think on their feet and plan their movements strategically. The game encourages creativity in finding the best routes, rewarding players for mastering the art of traversal. The rooftop chases and daring leaps between buildings are heart-pounding moments that keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nMirror's Edge also boasts an atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game's pace and tone perfectly. The music intensifies during high-stakes moments, adding to the overall sense of urgency and excitement. The combination of visuals, gameplay, and music creates a holistic experience that draws players into its world and keeps them hooked from start to finish.\n\nIn addition to its stellar single-player campaign, Mirror's Edge offers a unique time trial mode that lets players compete for the fastest completion times on each level. This adds a layer of replayability, as mastering the intricacies of the parkour mechanics becomes a rewarding pursuit.\n\nMirror's Edge is more than just a game; it's a bold and innovative experiment that successfully breaks away from gaming conventions. It's a testament to the idea that games can be both visually striking and intellectually stimulating. If you're looking for a gaming experience that challenges your skills, captivates your senses, and leaves you wanting more, Mirror's Edge is an absolute must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1700772249, "timestamp_updated": 1700772818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151383728": {"recommendationid": "151383728", "author": {"steamid": "76561199202352068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 214, "playtime_at_review": 395, "last_played": 1700692768}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1700763065, "timestamp_updated": 1700763065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151382785": {"recommendationid": "151382785", "author": {"steamid": "76561199351850922", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1700762644}, "language": "english", "review": "first few levels are really annoying to deal with in my opinion, your right click just sometimes alt-tabs you out and they just throw enemies at you before you actually know how to do movement", "timestamp_created": 1700762793, "timestamp_updated": 1700762793, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151287220": {"recommendationid": "151287220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198429628077", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 167, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1700792141}, "language": "english", "review": "loved this game when it came out but was only able to play it on console im glad i got this for 2 bucks instead of 20 if you like parkour games this is a fun one to play", "timestamp_created": 1700735339, "timestamp_updated": 1700735339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151281820": {"recommendationid": "151281820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969807716", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 529, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1700730882}, "language": "english", "review": "Very much fun to play, 100% recommended", "timestamp_created": 1700733290, "timestamp_updated": 1700733290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151246048": {"recommendationid": "151246048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198918389888", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 204, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1700717828}, "language": "english", "review": "very buggy but hella good.

A once-in-a-lifetime coming together of the best that Dice can offer and the guts of EA to publiche something closer to art then your more run-of-the-mill action shooting whatevers, especialy in the golden age of franchises like CoD, Halo and GTA4.\n\nI've had this game close to heart from the very first time I got my hands on it, back in 2008. It's art, movement and world have left such a unique and extremly memorable mark on me and part of gameing as a whole, it's easy to see why it's still in the zeitgeist for so meny life long fans.\n\nWhile Mirror's Edge catalyst was alright, perhaps even quite good, it's predassesor has that extra bit of personality, character and pure vision that later games and potential spiritual successors just cannot recreate. It's specific team, the year of in wich it was made and the willingness of the AAA market and the gamers both to try something wholy new will most likely never come again.\n\nThere are fools who say games cannot be art. To them I say meny things. Undertale, Assassin's Creed 2, Journey, Deus Ex Human Revolutions, The Witcher 3 and... Mirror's Edge.\n\nNow I hear this game will be removed forever by the powers that be, damn them to hell, and so I'm here to tell you this: Please, buy this game and play it. Experience what me and many like me experienced all the way back in 2008 and play Dice's best game ever.

The shooting is just boring too whenever they force you into those sections, which is ironic considering this is from the same developers who made Battlefield. The only two positives I can reasonably give this game is that it ends quickly and the art direction is pretty great, still looks really good to this day in spite of the outdated graphics.

Nah here a gun kills an enemy in like 2 shots, but each gun only has like 6 bullets, and since you can't reload once a gun is out it's permanently useless and you gotta find a new one, so it becomes it's own gun of resource management, using your shots wisely, and learning when to just a drop a gun even if it isn't empty.

I felt inspired to learn Parkour when I first played it, and it's a decision that I never regretted. Learning Parkour reshaped the way that I look at the world and eventually even changed how I approached things in my day to day life. This game is special to me, and there really isn't anything else quite like it.\n\nFaith controls like how you would expect a person to feel, if you were controlling them with a M/KB. There's a distinct feeling of weight to controlling Faith and it's not anything that another game has managed to pull off, much less in first person. Faith feels fantastic to control though, and through learning her move set you can really get around the city with ease. And boy does it feel great to be able to easily pass obstacles that would otherwise stop a normal person. The combat in this game isn't always viewed very fondly and I honestly think that's fair despite enjoying it myself. The tutorial doesn't do the best job at teaching you how to fight and disarm opponents but just remember to watch out for when weapons flash red. That's the time to disarm. You can press left or right and space to sidestep too, you can use that to dodge.\n\nThe music is just great, Solar Fields did a great job on this sound track and the main theme Still Alive is a fantastic song. I've listened to the OST plenty of times over the years and I can't see my love for it fading away.\n\nIt's a bit hard for me to say that the story is good in a traditional sense. It's well written and there's plenty to work through, but the game itself doesn't directly go into it very much. I feel like they really missed out on fleshing out the game with the story that was there, but the game itself is relatively short and can be completed in about 4-6 depending on how you do. There was plenty more that they could have gone with, but at least the game stays strong all the way through. I don't feel like the game has any real weak points. Save for the combat, but I still enjoy the combat personally.\n\nThe art direction for this game is fantastic too.

Un juego para repetir en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n, pero que no deja de ser demasiado caro para la poca durabilidad del juego, pues en apenas unas 3 horas puedes terminar la historia completa. A parte de eso, puedes llevar a cabo carreras establecidas o carreras contrarreloj, nada m\u00e1s.\n\nAunque es un proyecto incre\u00edble a pesar de su brevedad (que debo recalcar que me gusta m\u00e1s el posterior, Mirror's Edge: Catalyst), es cierto que pueden sacarse algunos defectos de este juego, que si tienen cierto peso para el mismo. En algunas zonas, podr\u00e1s verte entorpecido por unas mec\u00e1nicas que a veces no terminan siendo del todo eficientes. Si bien los movimientos de Faith son mucho m\u00e1s realistas que en Catalyst, morir\u00e1s en diversas ocasiones por la ineficiencia de las mec\u00e1nicas y movimientos. El peor de todos (ATENCI\u00d3N SPOILER) ocurre cuando Jacknife falla en su salto mientras huye de Faith, cayendo inconsciente al suelo. Para alcanzarle, deber\u00e1s avanzar a tu izquierda sobre unas tuber\u00edas. Cuando est\u00e9s en la segunda, no podr\u00e1s agarrarte a la tercera por mucho que la alcances sobradamente; Faith, por alguna raz\u00f3n, no se agarra y cae. Para subirte, te ves en la obligaci\u00f3n de subir hasta arriba del todo en la segunda tuber\u00eda para saltar a la siguiente, a veces ni te agarras y llegas directamente al otro ventilador. Este error ocurre debido a que, seg\u00fan las mec\u00e1nicas del juego, Faith est\u00e1 establecida para poder agarrarse a tuber\u00edas consiguientes, pero la tercera en esta zona est\u00e1 un poco m\u00e1s alejada de lo que deber\u00eda, por lo que se desentiende de ella.\n\nOtro defecto que podr\u00eda sacar tratar\u00eda de los enemigos, en concreto de los soldados armados (o cuerpos de polic\u00eda de PK). Estos muchas veces resultan demasiado poderosos y dif\u00edciles de vencer, a veces aunque utilices el bot\u00f3n de ralentizar el tiempo. En algunas ocasiones, morir\u00e1s independientemente de lo que hagas, pues pueden llegar a matarte antes de que incluso te acerques a ellos, pues adem\u00e1s nunca est\u00e1n solos. Por ello, la dificultad en normal ya parece estar un poco m\u00e1s elevada. De la dif\u00edcil, ni hablamos.\n\nEn resumen, \u00bfrecomiendo el juego? Sin duda. Sin embargo, es mucho m\u00e1s recomendable comprarlo en f\u00edsico (que cuesta menos de la mitad) o en otras p\u00e1ginas donde est\u00e9n m\u00e1s baratos (donde puedan probar su fiabilidad al 100%, claro). 20\u20ac me parece demasiado por este juego, solamente por la poca duraci\u00f3n del mismo.", "timestamp_created": 1696942217, "timestamp_updated": 1696942217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147955686": {"recommendationid": "147955686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055504521", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 5989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5989, "last_played": 1696904010}, "language": "english", "review": "Back when EA/DICE used to experiment", "timestamp_created": 1696904125, "timestamp_updated": 1696904125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 200, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927010893821716309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147937121": {"recommendationid": "147937121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261095186", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1696874524}, "language": "english", "review": "Great parkour!\n\nThe fist half is kinda meh but second part is pure awesome!

But as for the game itself, I honestly can't say I had too much fun with it. \n\nThe parkour mechanics were very convoluted imo. On one hand, there are several different ways you can reach an objective for most roof sections which made me really feel like I was actually Faith and was a professional parkourist who had to figure stuff out as they went. On the other hand, the parkour mechanics can be super finicky and end up confusing actions for one another (eg wallrunning vs 180 degree walljumping vs 90 degree wall jumping vs grabbing a ledge). Plus there were lots of parkour sections that were really confusing for no particular reason and honestly should've been pretty straightforward considering once I figured them out I could freerun them easily.\n\nCombat encounters are unclear on whether you should run or fight, making parts where there was only one forced option nearly impossible to tell in some cases. There are a variety of different weapons that enemies will carry, each with their own unique stats, but for the most part you're punished every step of the way for taking on enemies. There's a gameplay hint that suggests isolating a single enemy so you aren't overwhelmed, but how exactly am I meant to do that when they all take the same path to get to me? There's a very unique parry-like mechanic where you can grab their weapon during a shove attack and one-shot them while also taking their weapon which is cool, but it's super inconsistent even with the added benefit of the slow-mo ability designed specifically to better pull off parries.\n\nThe story was messy, had zero stakes for me to be invested in, and the ending was terrible.

Where to begin? \n\nFirstly, this game looks beautiful for a 2008 game, absolutely amazing art style that makes every colour and clean edge pop out. In so many video games a thing I love to do is break the game by jumping on things you should not, and generally exploring. If you have played Portal/Portal 2, some highlights of those games were not the puzzles, but when you had to find various ways to escape. Now put that gameplay into a whole expansive game and you have Mirror's Edge.\n\nA feeling of sadness however, is also present. This game was made by EA, but not the one today. Such an imaginative corporation turned into something from the in game city itself. Out of the trend of remaking popular genres into beloved indie games, I believe Mirror's Edge deserves it the most. The music, the gameplay and art really make this game special and sadly not talked about. I don't feel angry at EA though, just sad... I think these feelings can be perfectly summarised in the amazing song from the game \"Still Alive\" -\n\nI have changed, I have changed\nJust like you, just like you\nFor how long, for how long must I wait?\nI know there's something wrong\nYour concrete heart isn't beating\nAnd I've tried to make it come alive\nNo shadows, just red lights\nNow I'm here to rescue you\n\nI'm still alive, I'm still alive.\n\n10/10 Game.", "timestamp_created": 1694789746, "timestamp_updated": 1694789825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146316562": {"recommendationid": "146316562", "author": {"steamid": "76561199188976711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1694839389}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like fast-paced parkour games with fighting and story, then this is the game for you.

Dirty and dangerous, but alive and wonderful. Now it's something else.\"\n\n[i]Mirror's Edge[/i] is an action-adventure platform game developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nMirror's Edge is set in a near-future city where comfortable life and non-existent crime are achieved thanks to regime that controls the media and its citizens. Here there is also an underground crew of parkour couriers called Runners, who deliver private goods and sensitive information across the city to those who oppose the goverment, marking them as a threat.\nYou play as one of the Runners named Faith Connors, who after one of the runs finds out about her sister being framed for murder. She sets out to discover secrets hiding behind the assassination and to prove sisters innocence.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nPretty simple deal, utilize Faith's parkour skills to navigate the city and complete levels in order to progress! Jump between rooftops, wallrun, slide down, vault over obstacles, climb and more to make your way through cities infrastructure.\nKey part in successful parkour lies within momentum, as taking a moment to gather speed will let you run faster, jump farther or climb higher.\nGame also features help in navigation called Runner Vision, which highlights certain objects or paths with red colour to help you find a way forward, plus to make gameplay feel smoother as you won't waste time and speed in searching where you have to go.\n\nOf course Faith doesn't have that easy, and will have to deal with police force on her path. Game allows you to outsmart opponents and utilize parkour skills to simply pass them, but when moment comes where you are face to face with enemy, you have to get handy. You can perform melee attacks, block and counter incoming strikes, but considering most enemies doesn't want to get close and personal, you might have to reach out and disarm them.\nFaith can use all firearms to kill enemies without the need to get her hands messy, yet bigger weapons than pistol not only slow her down but also prevent from performing parkour moves, forcing you to go guns blazing. Which makes sense, I haven't seen anyone yet do parkour with heavy machine gun in both hands.\nSo game gives you certain freedom in approach: parkour to evade, slap everyone you see or grab cold iron and use it against enemies.\nGetting hit results in health loss and screen being more red than usual, with medicine for such issue being few second of no-damage-taken period when regeneration kicks in. Classic. Get too much damage and you will revisit recent checkpoint. Same applies to parkour, as screwup in a roof jump results in death...and that crunchy sound once Faith lands, or rather splatters...ughhhh, hate it.\n\nEach level has 3 hidden yellow bags serving as collectibles, though you get nothing from collecting them, beside sense of self-acomplishment I suppose. Look for Runner's marks and search areas close to them!\n\n[b]Playtime, replayability and other modes[/b]\nIt took me less than 5 hours to make through the story.\nDefinitely a game that has to be played twice as your first playthrough while still being enjoyable, will feature a learning curve on how to tackle levels and deal with parkour mechanics, making it feel rather rough. Second playthrough thanks to gathered experience and few hours under the belt should be simply more satisfying, seamless from gameplay perspective. Plus, you can collect useless collectible bags you might have missed out on!\n\nAdditionally you have a time trial mode with two options, both rely on parkouring your way as fast as possible and earning medals based on your time. One copies missions from the story, and second focuses on shorter sections with checkpoints you have to pass. If you love cutting miliseconds from a clock and finding most optimal way to the finish line then these modes are made for you!\n\n[b]Pros and cons[/b]\nFantastic controls and fluid movement that make up for parkour with the addition of momentum mechanic, create immersive experience. It's pleasant, responsive and offers solid curve for those who might want to advance their skills in the game by spending more time with it to learn all the little tricks and nuances.\nOne cannot mention Mirror's Edge without talking about fantastic visual side it offers. Mix of sticking out white colour with primary colours used in the game, bounded by ton of soft shadows gives game a very unique artstyle that looks great even today.\n\nAs for 'mixed' element I throw in whole story, not only because presentation through animated cutscenes looks average at best but also due to few confusing plot moments. Very okay, nothing special type.\n\nLevels themselfs also can fit into mixed category, due to them being on every side of the spectrum. While I understand game is linear, sometimes it's so restricted and on rails it just doesn't provide freedom parkour is known for. Additionally there are few moments, due to combat sections for example, where Mirror's Edge becomes a trial and error game which can lead to frustration. But there are chapters which not only feature multiple roads to avoid enemies, giving you freedom to get bit creative, they have solid variety of obstacles to create really fun parkour moments.\n\nFor negatives, combat. Not enjoyable, ruins the flow, quite ofter feeling unnecessary for the sake of padding the time and guns you can utilize are horrible from gunplay perspective. Melee is not that bad but sadly game has very few melee encounters and that is where problem lies, it focuses too much on picking up the gun and enganging in shootouts that break the pacing, rather than on swift hand-to-hand brawling.\n\nUltimately Mirror's Edge is all about flow. If you will quickly get into a game, get a feel of mechanics and movement, it will be a fantastic, smooth sailing experience. However if you get into that one section which makes you fail twice or thrice, you lose focus or get annoyed, or you just don't get into a game as much as you thought, it can feel like a slog, where you are not progressing naturally and have to fight tooth and nail for every checkpoint, making game not as enjoyable as some (myself included) claim. I thought opening cinematic mentioning whole \"Parkour flow\" deal was over exaggerating but after a playthrough I do have to take it back and fully agree.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nFantastic visual style and well crafted parkour make Mirror's Edge a unique title definitely worth playing, even if unsatisfying combat and few \"Trial and Error\" moments might ruin your flow.\n\nFeel free to check out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/] my curator page [/url] for more reviews!", "timestamp_created": 1693676985, "timestamp_updated": 1693676985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723403751850128174", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145511043": {"recommendationid": "145511043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316274292", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1693648304}, "language": "english", "review": "The story doesn't feel complete at the end, nor good in total.

Hay momentos en los que logramos correr sin detenernos, esquivando y saltando obst\u00e1culos, acelerando cada vez m\u00e1s, de una forma tan fluida que se logra una muy buena sensaci\u00f3n de v\u00e9rtigo.

This game had me wanting to re-install Dying Light just to replay it's parkour. I had too many times where Faith didn't do what I wanted her to do, and did all the shit that I didn't want her to do. I will say that I didn't fully complete the tutorial, because it wouldn't let me progress despite doing exactly what it told me to do. The combat is also meh, I had so many instances where I couldn't get the counter-disarm shit right on time for the life of me, and you die in 3 shots practically anyways. Along with this, I had to fuckin deep dive into the files just to unlock my FPS and change the FOV so I can actually tell what I'm doing and where I am. I'm not sure if these changes had anything to do with it, or it was the PhysX shit (that I even turned off but didn't seem to change anything), but after this the game just started tabbing itself out randomly for a few seconds, then tabbing back in. I don't have to tell you that this isn't ideal for a parkour game. I know the game shits itself when the player tabs out (which I figured out instantly the hard way), but I didn't expect it to start doing it by its fucking self. All of this is to say, I want to enjoy this game, I really goddamn do. I've known about it for years and it was on sale so I thought why not play this game from the past. Little did I know.

With its daring leaps, fluid movement, and intense chase sequences, Mirror's Edge stands as a true gem that pushes the boundaries of what a first-person game can be.\n\nOne of the standout features of Mirror's Edge is its groundbreaking parkour-based gameplay mechanics. Players assume the role of Faith, a skilled free runner in a dystopian city, as they navigate the vertigo-inducing rooftops, narrow corridors, and perilous obstacles with seamless grace and agility. The game's intuitive controls, responsive movement, and smooth animations allow players to perform stunning acrobatic maneuvers, such as wall running, sliding, and precise jumps, with a sense of freedom and exhilaration. The level design encourages creative exploration and rewards mastery of the fluid movement system, making every run a thrilling and immersive experience.\n\nThe visual design of Mirror's Edge is striking and distinctive, employing a minimalist aesthetic with bold and contrasting colors. The clean, white architecture of the cityscape serves as a canvas for the vibrant red objects and pathways that guide players through the environment. The visual style not only enhances the immersion but also reinforces the game's themes of rebellion and freedom. The animations and first-person perspective capture the intensity and rush of free running, giving players a sense of embodiment and immersion rarely found in other games.\n\nThe sound design in Mirror's Edge is equally exceptional. The ambient sounds of the city, the rush of wind as Faith soars through the air, and the rhythmic beats of the soundtrack all contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere. The absence of a traditional HUD and the emphasis on environmental audio cues add to the game's sense of immersion, heightening the player's focus and awareness of the surroundings.\n\nMirror's Edge also boasts a compelling storyline that explores themes of oppression, surveillance, and personal freedom. The narrative unfolds through beautifully animated cutscenes and in-game dialogue, providing context and motivation for Faith's actions. The voice acting is top-notch, with convincing performances that bring the characters to life and enhance the emotional impact of the story.\n\nIn addition to the main campaign, Mirror's Edge offers a time trial mode that challenges players to complete levels as quickly and efficiently as possible. The leaderboard system encourages friendly competition and replayability, as players strive to improve their times and master the intricacies of each level. The inclusion of community-created maps and challenges further extends the game's lifespan and offers fresh experiences for players to enjoy.\n\nIn conclusion, Mirror's Edge is a daring and innovative first-person action-adventure game that leaves a lasting impression with its parkour-based gameplay, stylish visuals, and immersive world.

Yes, altough i enjoyed mirror's edge catalyst, i think mirror's edge 1 (graphics and open world aside here, let's make a fair comparison) is better, why? Faith Connors in mirror's edge catalyst moves like a paper clip, she doesn't feel heavy, the parkour feels more fluid but lifeless (compared to Mirror's edge 1, but still really good and enjoyable) , the combat still sucks in mirror's edge catalyst, so mirror's edge 1 is not really missing on that (but the combat in the second game is far superior) And Faith Connors in the first game, feels heavy, her movements, feels more like a human (opinions are my own).\nSo in my opinion Mirror's edge 1 is better gameplay wise but lacks the story, the depth of a open world and combat skill level up that Mirror's edge catalyst offers.\nIf you read the Mirror's edge 1 comic book, you can really start to \"feel the game more\" and understand it and have that \"connection\" to Faith's personality and her lore/universe, to play Mirror's edge 1 and really enjoy the game to its fullest, read the comics, trust me, it adds a lot to the game.\ntaking the comics in consideration (that is canon) Faith's personality is really mature and beautiful, especially for her age, after reading the comics you can really start to see why Faith in Mirror's edge 1 has that \"closed face\" \"don't get near me, i trust no one\" \"back off\" \"conservative\" personality, and why she became rebelious and developed that kind of personality, and why she's so mature for her age.\ni hate Faith's personality in Mirror's edge catalyst, there's literally no depth, she's so less immature and bland for no reason (her background story is similar so there's no reason to) and she cries in front of others with her soaked face wanting acceptance from others, (like she did with that guy that had her mom's painting on the wall) Mirror's edge 1 Faith would never had thrown herself at the floor in front of other folks and cry and rant like she did.\nwhat i'm trying to say is, Faith Connors have gone from your Bad b#tch nobody f##ks with me to your typical normie girl in the reboot. they really screwed up with her personality in the reboot, her personality is not faithful to the original story of the comics/lore.\nand let's be honest here, Faith from Mirror's edge 1 is way more cute and beautiful by a mile, and she looks way more intimidating.\nRant aside, Buy the game (on sale) , is great, and read the comic online, to deepen and complement to the story, and to understand Faith's personality and her universe better. (The comics are canon to the Mirror's edge 1 universe)\n\nWant a good parkour focused game? Buy it!\nWant a good parkour focused game, a better game experience overall, and a half decent ingame story? buy mirror's edge catalyst instead.

Mirror\u2019s Edge is often credited as one of the best. To some, it is. But, to others it can also become a sluggish and frustrating endeavor.\n\nAs a late 2000s era game, the clean and minimalist aesthetic of the game is quite gorgeous. The graphic holds up really well even years later. But, it\u2019s also a double-edge sword. First time players could become confused with the lack of obnoxious landmarks or clear waypoints. The devs tried to mitigate this by having some interactive objects and background painted with visible primary colors, such as red, to nudge players toward a direction. There are also pigeons and rats as indicators Altough, in my playtrough with normal difficulty setting only some objects are painted to help me get a reading of a route. It didn\u2019t help that I was constantly being shot at by polices and guards. The combat and shooting gameplay of this game is not very good compared to its traversal.\n\nCompared to other games with parkour mechanism, such as Dyling Light and Assassin\u2019s Creed that have assisted AIs or low margin for fail during platforming, Mirror\u2019s Edge is quite raw and punishing especially for slow players. It asked you to be quick and decisive in split second or you will lose all the momentum. One can argue that it required good reflexes. I often failed and died trying to figure out platforming puzzles or the best route to escape. Once you have mapped everything (after dying many times) in your head tough, it can be quite exhilarating.\n\nThe story is forgettable and doesn\u2019t make much sense. It has 8-9 levels that you can finish in short period. Even for me that often failed and had to retry a lot, it\u2019s indeed quite short. It leaves a lot to be desired.

Most of the game is spent running on foot while making awesome moves such as wall-running. There are enemies, but since it's not that kind of game you cannot take too many hits. Better hit them one-on-one or perform an instant knockout disarm.\n\nOne of the things that stand out the most, other than being a great parkour game, are the level's aesthetics. They are minimalistic, yet very eye-catching, typically using bright colors such as blue and yellow on white walls or floors. It makes the hallways a pleasure to travel through since they're not the usual boring gray or brown colors. And that's a very good thing, since most levels are just hallways and rooftops.\n\nHowever, the game's minimalist style contributes to its shortcomings. The levels feel too empty, you very rarely meet characters outside of cutscenes. The supposedly bustling city feels as empty as the test chambers in Portal. And since it discourages combat, the final confrontation with the antagonist felt rushed and unsatisfying. There will also be no sequel, as Mirror's Edge Catalyst is a reboot.\n\nFor its age, Mirror's Edge is a surprisingly well-made, fast-paced parkour game, and definitely a title you should play if you are into parkours and platformers. I can say the parkour is better than Dying Light, but then again it's not a pure parkour game. If you enjoyed the parkour in DL you are sure to enjoy it here, just don't expect a grappling hook to help you traverse.", "timestamp_created": 1688283615, "timestamp_updated": 1688283615, "voted_up":

It has the same exact problem with platforming I've seen so many times in other games, all of which mainly just boil down to things failing horribly to register or detect. For example, when jumping off a ledge, the jump key will usually not register so you fail to jump and fall and die. Now go repeat an entire section only to die 10 more times until the game finally decides to register your jump. This also happens with things like detecting a roll at the end of a fall to avoid taking damage, which basically never worked for me. \n\nThere is combat, which is also terribly janky. The game tells you to literally avoid it wherever possible, which turns out to be good advice. Except other times it makes it seem like fighting is mandatory. Until you realize that even in those sections you can just avoid it. Which is confusing, but I guess its also cool that there are different ways to play. \n\nBut when both of those ways are bad, there really is nothing left to like about it. The story isn't interesting and the art style is bizarre mix of minimalism and highly saturated contrast. Even with brightness and contrast at the lowest levels, most of the game is blindingly white, while dark areas like vents are pitch black. You can turn up the brightness to navigate the dark areas, but then the outside areas get even more eye-searing. After a while I got sick of having to open the menu constantly and change the settings, so I just left them on low and stumbled through the darkness like a blind bat, which is fine I guess since those areas are rare. But the game is still boring to look at because everything is one color: white. Here and there are tinges of blue, red, yellow, etc. but you rarely see more than one of these colors together at once. If I had to guess, its because \"of an abstract art direction that ties deeply into the game's themes\" or some other typical corpo excuse for spending less money on the game. Which is consistent with the low budget anime quality of the cutscenes. \n\nPass on this one.

The options menu is lacking in basic functionality to the point it may as well not exist at all. It might not be fair to compare it to modern releases, but it is being sold as a product so I think it\u2019s worth mentioning.\n\nThe port has few ways to tweak the game or how it runs. There\u2019s no way to change stuff like sound effect volume or how Faith (the main character) feels to play. You can\u2019t disable blur effects on their own, you have to turn the graphical quality to low to achieve this. The difficulty option appears to only change how easy combat is. You can\u2019t make platforming or parkour harder or easier to accomplish, which is primarily what you\u2019ll be doing 90% of the time.\n\nThe game uses red and orange to signpost what parts of the environment (chairs, walls, etc) can be scaled or vaulted from to reach new areas. It would've been a great idea to let the player change the colours to suit visual impairments. The game can still be played without these modifiers, but it certainly would've been a good inclusion. \n\nI get that accessibility options like this were not commonplace in 2008, but it does feel like a glaring omission nowadays. I also had severe screen tearing that I could only fix by forcing vsync through NVIDIA\u2019s control panel. For some odd reason, the in-game option did not function at all.\n\nNone of this stuff was a massive deal breaker for me, just keep in mind that the PC port is not the best.\n\nTechnical babble aside, does Mirror's Edge hold up in 2023? Well, it's a bit more complicated than a simple yes or no answer, but I think it's fine considering the age and legacy of the game. It is also understandably dated in many ways. I think it has aged well graphically..mostly. It has a sleek, futuristic white coat for most buildings which fits the dystopia the game takes place in. The colour palette is basic but is easy to read, provided you can see the colours white, red and orange. There\u2019s an overuse of bloom and an eye piercing amount of light at times, but it looks remarkably good for a game this old.\n\nI\u2019m not going to discuss the story or themes of the game because, to be kind, it isn't very interesting or worth much discussion. It is predictable and simple. The game is about finding and rescuing your sister who has been framed for the the murder of a Mayoral candidate. It isn't a bad story I just didn't care for what was happening and it is serviceable enough in getting you to go from point A to B, which is all the story needed to be.\n\nParkour is the main novelty of this game and while I did like the parkour in Mirror\u2019s Edge, I did not grow to love it. Faith moves in a way that is hard to easily summarise in text, but her jumps are heavy and weighty, unlike other platform games. You can\u2019t correct during the middle of a jump which means you are committing to it every time, so falling to your death can happen if you aren't careful.\n\nEven maintaining momentum can be awkward and clumsy, but I sort of appreciate what the developers were going for, even if it was not my cup of tea 100% of the time.\n\nThe game is not a simulator that is trying to accurately depict parkour, but I think the point was to match the *feel* of parkour without making the game even more technical. The problem is that it can feel clunky and counterintuitive, especially to a modern audience. The parkour didn\u2019t really click for me until the halfway point, but I sort of grew to enjoy what it was, rather than what it was not. It can be difficult to make certain jumps or maintain momentum, but it can feel rewarding precisely because it requires mastery of the controls to get the most out if it. I failed a lot during my time playing, but the game usually has decent enough checkpoints that retrying isn\u2019t much of an issue and I eventually got better. It does take practice and a dash of patience, though.\n\nUnfortunately, the missions themselves are hit or miss. They are well designed from a practical basis. The city looks real enough despite there being no people living in it, unless you count armed guards? But from a gameplay perspective they don\u2019t always mesh well with the platforming. I feel like parkour in this game is fantastic when it all comes together, when you speed past enemies and make death defying jumps. The problem is that most missions have a start and stop element which drags the experience down for me. I don\u2019t think the game benefits from having you run from 6 armed guards in one moment to slowly exploring a mall and getting lost in the next. When the game doesn\u2019t come together, you\u2019ll be lost and fumbling around looking for where to go next which kills the pacing of most missions.\n\nI could also complain about how much of a burden the combat system is. You can kick, punch, slide kick and dropkick. This sounds cool but it doesn\u2019t really amount to much, the game makes it pretty clear that you should avoid combat. If you are unlucky enough to get spotted by an armed guard, which happens 100% of the time because they are programmed to spot you as soon as you enter certain areas or a hidden timer has passed. At that point, your best bet is to run or take a guard's gun and slowly take out the rest of the hit squad that has come after you.\n\nI would usually flee because combat is typically an exercise in frustration. There\u2019s no way to guard or dodge so combat is just you awkwardly throwing out limbs and praying the guard goes down quickly before Faith does. Running is usually safer, but this has its own unique set of problems. Primarily, knowing where to go to make progress. Most of my game overs were me scrambling around a facility, hitting a dead end or not fully understanding where to go next. I would then be swarmed by a hit squad and die quickly. I eventually got better at the game but I guarantee the first dozen deaths you have will be like this. \n\nYou can press left ALT to get an approximation of where to head, which just jerks the camera in a direction with zero markings or on screen identifiers, but it\u2019s something. I did not mind deaths where I was clearly making mistakes. Failing a jump and plummeting 100ft to the concrete floor or being gunned down after failing to take out a guard is one thing. Running around like a fool for 30 seconds only to be met with a dead end was a recurring issue that only resulted in a 12 minute story mission almost doubling in length, precisely because of trial and error and some obtuse level design. I get that the developers wanted people to replay the missions so that they could master the more intricate parts, but on a first run it didn't really add to the experience for me.\n\nI did ramble about a few negatives, but I\u2019d still recommend Mirror\u2019s Edge in 2023 (and beyond, assuming the game isn't removed from Steam) to certain groups of people.\n\nIf you are patient and can play what might feel like a glorified tech demo, showcasing a novel concept then you will probably like this game. If you can appreciate demanding platforming challenges or the speedrunning legacy this game has left us with, then you will also be a good fit for this game. On the other hand, if you hate trial and error game design, suffer from motion sickness or hate being stuck or lost, then you might want to think carefully before picking the game up.", "timestamp_created": 1686920588, "timestamp_updated": 1686921587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140117456": {"recommendationid": "140117456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193971167", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1686426188}, "language": "english", "review": "boat level sucks\nother than that, its rly fun", "timestamp_created": 1686856980, "timestamp_updated": 1686856980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140093789": {"recommendationid": "140093789", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121602478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1688916934}, "language": "english", "review": "Back to the old days", "timestamp_created": 1686828375, "timestamp_updated": 1686828375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140092430": {"recommendationid": "140092430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068527419", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1684534082}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice idea for the game.

Running through the city, jumping from trains, to rooftops, to ziplines and crashing through windows at a fast pace provides an incredible adrenaline rush. \n\nThe world and it's use of color was fascinating, and is just really nice to look at even to this day.\n\nThe game also has some great replay value with it's Speedruning and Time Trial modes, as well as plenty of hidden collectibles to find in every level.\n\nI will say that the level design in the second half of the game could be a bit frustrating at times, sometimes spending a few minutes figuring out where the heck I'm supposed to be going, which breaks the momentum you should be feeling when playing the game.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the story wasn't very memorable in my opinion. It's only been an hour since I beat it and I'm already having trouble recalling the plot.

That's not to say ALL of them are bad, for example there is a section where you are trying to reach the bottom of a building, and if you think like a Runner, you can swiftly weave through the enemies and descent before they can even land a shot on you. That's the key word, Runner; the game tries so hard to make you feel like a Runner, but when Merc is telling you to get out of there, and there are 3 dudes camping the slow ass pipe to climb up, you have reject Runner and return to Gunner.\nAnd the enemies don't always carry guns, in some cases it could be tiny room with messy geometry that slows you down. A key point of selling to you the feeling of being a Runner is seeing the world through the Runner's eye. The problem is half way through Faith's be getting that protanopia, but that's okay, because at this point you HAVE the runner's eye. Players should be subconsciously feeling out which objects they can climb and which they can't, which is what parkour is all about. But then they had to go ahead and just subvert everything, pipes sometimes can be climbed up, other times not, ledges are less than pronounced, goal camera that points to the opposite side of the map while needing the player to first backtrack to the previous room to get higher up before proceeding. Many of the problems felt like they could have been solved had the player been able to see the entire section of the parkour level, where instead of being frustrated at not knowing where to go, it could empower you to actually overcome what's in front of you. Which, ironically the game did do during one of the more open areas, but then immediately funnelled into a small linear corridor.\n\njust let me run :(", "timestamp_created": 1685998519, "timestamp_updated": 1685998519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139599531": {"recommendationid": "139599531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198910059792", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1685984226}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont like this game because is boring and cause me to be angry", "timestamp_created": 1685984465, "timestamp_updated": 1685984465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489270389080047607", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139585520": {"recommendationid": "139585520", "author": {"steamid": "76561199388960579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1687654468}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to brutally murder the enemies in a way so they can't fight back", "timestamp_created": 1685963069, "timestamp_updated": 1685963069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139582427": {"recommendationid": "139582427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067633073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1686072684}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, and doesn't require an EA or Origin account.

Your missions range from gathering information, tracking people of interest, and fighting off police.\n\nWhile the story is decent, the best part about the game is probably the parkour. Your character moves fluidly across the entire landscape, and the jumping, wall running, and sliding all look and feels great.\nBut there\u2019s some issues with the game I did not like\u2026\u2026..\n\nThe combat- it sucks. You can punch some enemies but they have guns and usually come in groups of 4+ so more times than not you will be killed quickly trying to understand the best way to deal with them.\nOnce you get a gun from the enemy it\u2019s pretty easy from that point on to kill all the enemies and proceed.\n\nThe level design - while the levels look good they are also annoying as hell to navigate at times. There\u2019s too many points in the game where you must make this critical jump that you will barely make but you end up dying a dozen times because you are always an inch short. This becomes frustrating when you have a few enemies shooting you with laser accuracy and you die midair at last jump. \n\nGraphically the game still looks nice for being 14yrs old. It actually looks better than some recent games in the last 5 years.\nThe voice acting is also very good.\n\nOverall it was a decent game even with its frustrating moments and was fun to sprint across the rooftops while jumping and sliding like a ninja\n\nI played on steam deck and had no issues at max settings 60fps at all times.\n\nYou can regularly find this game for 3.00 on sale and it\u2019s worth it\n\n7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1685684381, "timestamp_updated": 1685684381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139404000": {"recommendationid": "139404000", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097085459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 569, "last_played": 1685675976}, "language": "english", "review": "jump, shoot and run", "timestamp_created": 1685676103, "timestamp_updated": 1685676103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139401438": {"recommendationid": "139401438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299522757", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 466, "last_played": 1685753343}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very cool, kinda short tho", "timestamp_created": 1685671152, "timestamp_updated": 1685671152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139401300": {"recommendationid": "139401300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979614955", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 919, "last_played": 1685670728}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a unique experience and a compelling story.

I had a blast playing thru this game and just looking at the scenery. 10/10 would recommend.\n\n      [table]\n      [tr]\n      [th]Category[/th]\n      [th]Score[/th]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Overall Rating[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Story[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Gameplay[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Graphics[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Sound Design[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Replay Value[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Difficulty[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Bug free?[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] PC Requirements[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td] Game Length[/td]\n      [td]\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\n      [/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [/table]\n      [hr][/hr]\n      \n", "timestamp_created": 1685656150, "timestamp_updated": 1685656150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139393320": {"recommendationid": "139393320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285261851", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1686184223}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aun 14 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, este juego se ve espectacular y las mec\u00e1nicas de parkour est\u00e1n a un nivel incre\u00edble para su \u00e9poca.

This game is the forerunner in the genre of first-person parkour games, and in my opinion, remains the best. The movement mechanics feel fluid and modern.\n\nFor a game from 2009 the graphics are really good and look beautiful. The atmosphere of the game world in Mirror's Edge is really great as well. The game is set in a city that has a really special feel to it, accompanied with outstanding music.  Both the atmosphere and the music give me a certain feeling of wonder I cannot describe. \n\nWhile the storyline may not be the most memorable aspect of the game, it certainly isn't lackluster. The narrative provides a decent backbone to the gameplay, though it doesn't particularly stand out as the game's strongest point. \n\nThe combat mechanics in Mirror's Edge are satisfactory, although they are not particularly groundbreaking. Despite not being the main focus of the game, the combat encounters can still prove to be enjoyable and satisfying. \n\nOn the downside, Mirror's Edge could be criticized for its relatively short playtime. This limitation, however, doesn't detract significantly from the overall experience.\n\nI definitely recommend this game\n", "timestamp_created": 1685621347, "timestamp_updated": 1685621347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139361814": {"recommendationid": "139361814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343907584", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1685609926}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played it 3 times in a span of 10 years, its just good as it was the 1st time.", "timestamp_created": 1685611046, "timestamp_updated": 1685611046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139353228": {"recommendationid": "139353228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113989255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 615, "last_played": 1685591667}, "language": "english", "review": "ta weno", "timestamp_created": 1685591977, "timestamp_updated": 1685591977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139352218": {"recommendationid": "139352218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411078525", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1685589300}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so bright, Jesus Christ.\n\nAlso, what's with the ghost poles, i keep going through them, i might suck, but i swear Faith just doesn't want to grab them.\n\nPretty clunky experience so far, so i guess it's kind of a 4/10 for now.", "timestamp_created": 1685590099, "timestamp_updated": 1685590099, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45267486572265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139348235": {"recommendationid": "139348235", "author": {"steamid": "76561199156656612", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "playtime_at_review": 1492, "last_played": 1700613819}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're an artist, these visuals are your easiest steps to victory.

A m\u00ed personalmente me gusta much\u00edsimo ese estilo, y adem\u00e1s no abusan de cinem\u00e1ticas, que es algo tambi\u00e9n muy a tener en cuenta a la hora de disfrutar del juego y de la historia que te presentan.\nEn cuanto a personajes, tenemos a Faith, que se va a quedar siempre en  mi coraz\u00f3n de jugador, con una personalidad muy fuerte y se nota que los guionistas trabajaron mucho para desarrollarla bien y darle un background muy bueno, y sobre todo sin sexualizar al personaje ya que en la gran mayor\u00eda de veces en los viodejuegos los personajes femeninos tienden a sexualizar, y esto es algo que se agradece mucho porque es un soplo de aire fresco. El resto de personajes est\u00e1n igual de bien tratados por los guionistas, haciendo que en todo momento la historia tenga un sentido y les cojas mucho cari\u00f1o a algunos, y a otros mejor me reservo el comentario de odio...\nPor otro lado, la banda sonora que tiene me parece excelente ya que es muy agradable de escuchar y no satura para nada haciendo que sea relajante la mayor\u00eda del tiempo, y tensa en los momentos cr\u00edticos del juego.\nMe gustar\u00eda comentar algo que me ha parecido muy notorio, y es que para ser un juego del 2008, tiene una iluminaci\u00f3n flipante y muy pulida, de hecho hay bastantes juegos posteriores a Mirror's Edge m\u00e1s modernos, y ni se acercan al trabajo de iluminaci\u00f3n que tiene este juego. \nEs un juego que ha sido muy castigado ya que lo acusan de ser muy lineal, de corta duraci\u00f3n y con un sistema de combate muy pobre, y la verdad es que es un videojuego que en su d\u00eda fue completamente distinto a lo que estaba acostumbrado el consumidor medio a jugar, y se atrevi\u00f3 con mec\u00e1nicas que en esa \u00e9poca eran algo revolucionario. El combate es cierto que es lo peor que tiene el juego, porque se nota muy pesado y sin que el jugador reciba un feedback en las peleas, pero quitando eso se queda una historia excelente y mec\u00e1nicas, que te pueden gustar m\u00e1s o menos, muy interesantes y divertidas.\nSin duda es una obra atemporal que es completamente disfrutable 15 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, y que recomiendo encarecidamente a cualquier tipo de jugador.\nMi m\u00e1s sincera enhorabuena a DICE por el pedazo de juego que es Mirror's Edge.", "timestamp_created": 1685578707, "timestamp_updated": 1685625949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139344930": {"recommendationid": "139344930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979377139", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1685576252}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Est\u00e1 bueno si no sos un tosco de mierda para apretar las teclas.", "timestamp_created": 1685576620, "timestamp_updated": 1685576620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139344420": {"recommendationid": "139344420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072268540", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1685575129}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat is a bit clunky and you do feel the era of when this game is released.

The movement at first can feel exciting, but quickly I found it repetitive given the level design. Moving your camera left or right will slow you down, but also using the arrow keys will make you dodge. The issue with such design game play wise is that any type of turn will get you to lose all of your momentum that you had built up from a few seconds ago when you hadn't had to deal with turning. With that in mind, the game decides to turn the levels into almost mazes, (it's the reason why this game has the \"Puzzle\" tag so high). The levels quickly just become massive halts as you slowly have to navigate a whole giant room to figure out where the next place you need to go is, completely halting that whole feeling of speed that this game is going for. \n\nThis game is very pretty, especially given that this was made in 2009. The world design was done very well, which makes it more unfortunate just because of how much of a slog it can become when your stuck in just a grey box for two minutes instead of running through colourful rooftops and hallways. The worlds are colourful most of the time, but again, quickly as you're stopped on every single wall on the later levels it can quickly become very repetitive and samey. This game isn't very long, but by my 2-3rd hour or so, the world design was completely faded for me and instead it was just my mind focusing more on how awful some of these rooms and levels are designed. Example: One room in particular I remember being awful was in the level \"The Drains\". There are a bunch of concrete poles that come from the floor to the roof, and at first it looks pretty then becomes a nightmare. It's the same jump, over and over and over again copy and pasted for probably more then 50 times given the amount of platforms. It gives you no direction as to where to go, I actually found the secret first just because going forward ended up not being the right way. (You had to go halfway to the middle of the bottom, then go all the way left until you reach a ladder that is hidden on the back of one of the dreaded platforms).\n\nThe last main big discussion point that should be INTENDED with this game is combat. It completely falls flat, getting hit feels underwhelming. Punches? They'll hit you and make your screen go a little grey. Bullets? They will literally just go through you with no indication, you have to be holding your camera downwards just to see a small blood splat that indicates you got shot. Aside from the enemies, the game also has you battling and doing combat. You're punches are weak, every move you do will hit for the same, so there is no reason to go for any cool wall runs or anything when you can literally just kick them in the face and call it a day. You're also able to pick up guns from enemies, this can be done via disarming your enemy which you can tell when to do by when the gun shines red mid swing. (Sometimes guns will literally forget to glow red, just hit you through the disarm, or you might even just die from an invisible melee attack mid cut scene).\n\nThis game could have been a decent experience, but in my whole 5 hours of playing this game, I had to restart my computer 3 times due to alt + tabbing and the game not understanding what that means and just freezing the whole PC. This is common with older games, but I just thought I should mention it in case anyone was not aware. Aside from that, I sometimes would just run into invisible walls, run through walls or fall through the floor, and last but not least just get stuck inside of a box with literally nothing you can do, (the game gives you no way to restart from checkpoints). \n\nIf you really feel like playing this game, just get it on console, this game is just to buggy on PC given the time that this has been rotting away with no updates. I remember when I played this on my Xbox, most of those same bugs were there, but at least I was able to access the home menu and other things without having to completely restart the thing. ^^;", "timestamp_created": 1685435614, "timestamp_updated": 1685435614, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139249575": {"recommendationid": "139249575", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007425372", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1685417923}, "language": "english", "review": "Greatest Gave Ever Made Me Feel Like I Was There In Person! :)", "timestamp_created": 1685420984, "timestamp_updated": 1685420984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139248590": {"recommendationid": "139248590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968195441", "num_games_owned": 864, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1597705492}, "language": "english", "review": "the edge wasnt enough to make my wife sign the divorce papers.\n\n7.6/14.2", "timestamp_created": 1685418885, "timestamp_updated": 1685418885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139246347": {"recommendationid": "139246347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003852545", "num_games_owned": 716, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1685152902}, "language": "english", "review": "a video game classic.", "timestamp_created": 1685414257, "timestamp_updated": 1685414257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139242846": {"recommendationid": "139242846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032123553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 474, "last_played": 1685407433}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to give this title a positive review.

However, the animations between levels had a nice aesthetic and the story rarely interrupts gameplay so I never felt bored or frustrated with it. \n\nThe biggest problem with this game is the combat system. Unfortunately it's just super dated and janky. Fighting enemies is more of an exercise of frustration rather than a cool mix of parkour and CQC.

The basic premise is that you're an information runner that excels in speedily traversing the environment and avoiding combat with those that pursue you.  Unfortunately the game works better in theory than it often does in practice so Mirror's Edge does come with a bit of jank, primarily in the form occasionally clumsy controls and fickle game responsiveness that when combined result in a lot of pointless and avoidable deaths.\n\nMirror's Edge is the type of game that excels when it encourages player freedom and creativity, so it's annoying that it so often wants to force you into awkward combat scenarios equipped with nothing more than half-baked first-person combat mechanics or punish you when it mercilessly decides to misinterpret your wall run maneuver as a point-blank nosedive into the cold concrete beneath you, thus forcing you to replay a short section of the game\u2014sometimes multiple times\u2014as you try to figure out just exactly what it is that the game wants from you.  Mirror's Edge sometimes feels like a game that knows exactly what kind of game it wants to be yet is constantly and actively working against itself at all times to prevent itself from being exactly that.  Faith has a few basic attacks: some punches, a slide kick, and a wall run kick that can be used to fend off enemies, but these resources often fail in comparison to your heavily armoured foes and their firearms.  There are few practical uses for the wall run kick to ever truly be useful, and the slide kick can be tricky to time right if you activate it too early and stop short of your enemy.  There's a disarm maneuver that can be used against enemies that try to melee you and stolen or picked up weapons can be used to gun down any remaining enemies.  It's both neat and bizarre that Mirror's Edge features usable guns in the first place.  I like the fact that I can pick up the weapons from my foes to use them in a fit of desperation, but it's clear that the design team made certain sections with the deliberate intent of forcing the player into weapon-based combat, which seems to be at odds with the game's overall design principles.  I think a system that gave players the choice to engage in firearms as just another option while also outfitting them with better tools to take on or avoid enemies in other ways would have contributed to the game's objective of having a dynamic, player-choice driven gameplay experience.  It would have been nice if Faith had some kind of rechargeable instant takedown mechanic, or a limited use stun weapon that made combat less frustrating and feel more rewarding.  I appreciate lethally armed enemies as a source of upping the stakes and making the threat feel very real, but as combat with them exists in the game it's often more of a source of momentum-halting frustration than the euphoria-inducing high of narrowly escaping death that it was meant to be.  Faith has a limited use ability that slows time down to a crawl, which is primarily used for disarming enemies more easily in close quarters combat.  It seems like a missed opportunity that this ability was never implemented in such a way that it allows Faith to slow down the gunfire and movement of her enemies while she moves at a slightly faster speed that allows the player to navigate their way to safety more easily.  There's a few moments in the game that end up feeling a bit too much like trial and error due to the aggressiveness of enemies combined with not knowing exactly where to go.  Having more tools to avoid, stun, or outright combat enemies more reliably without dying, or having to resort to a pure old-fashioned gunfight every single time, would go a long way in preserving the momentum of the moment-to-moment gameplay while simultaneously avoiding unnecessary player deaths caused by a game that actively discourages combat by design at every opportunity, yet consistently forces the player into situations where there are seemingly no other alternatives.\n\nTo alleviate some of this frustration there's runner vision\u2014an option which can be enabled or disabled freely in the menus that highlights key interactable objects in bright red as you near them.  I prefer playing with runner vision turned off, as this is the kind of game that excels when it encourages player freedom and experimentation, but leaving it enabled does help in alleviating some frustration for new players playing for the first time.\n\nMirror's Edge is at its best when it's not throwing enemies at you and simply leaves you alone to discover its world and traverse its serenely sterile environments in peace.  I find that since the focus of the game is not meant to be on combat that playing the game on easy difficulty makes it a much more enjoyable experience.  The difficulty slider primarily dictates how quickly enemies can kill you and has no other effect otherwise on the much more important puzzle aspect of the game.  For a game that came out for PC in early 2009 it's a masterclass audiovisual experience.  The art design and soundtrack are both phenomenal and elevate the game to another level.  These aspects make Mirror's Edge much more important as an experience for those that appreciate the artistic aspect of games rather than placing more importance on the perfected mechanical side of the equation.  If you appreciate games as not just something you play but also as something that you experience then Mirror's Edge ranks amongst the best experiences there are.  Every time the journey ends and the credits roll I'm always left with the same irreplaceable feeling of satisfaction that I get from watching an incredible or one of my personal favourite films.\n\nMirror's Edge is a game that was ahead of its time; it features a unique world and gameplay concept, interesting (albeit light) commentary on a surveillance-obsessed Orwellian society that increasingly resembles our own, an outstanding soundtrack, and a diverse cast of characters that don't feel like pretentious and unimaginative virtue signaling cardboard cutouts. Yet it's also a game that's flawed, and it wears those flaws on its sleeves, and in spite of those flaws it's all the better for it.", "timestamp_created": 1685355339, "timestamp_updated": 1685365344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139198467": {"recommendationid": "139198467", "author": {"steamid": "76561199385287708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 639, "last_played": 1685343340}, "language": "spanish", "review": "SPOILERS!!!!\nMi primer juego de Parkour y la verdad para ser mi primer juego de parkour (en primera persona) esta bastante bien las animaciones son muy buenas y detalladas a la hora de una persecusion.\nQUEJAS:\n1- Le falto mas pelea a estilo boss sinceramente la pelea final no le encontre mucho sentido.\n2- Para mi opinion el mapa era muy blanco o brilloso lo cual parecia mas una pre alpha.\nCONCLUSION:\nSinceramente tiene una buena historia y muy bonito mensaje el que este leyendo esto es mejor que lo compre y lo juegue", "timestamp_created": 1685344221, "timestamp_updated": 1685344221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139186572": {"recommendationid": "139186572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296605712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1685320620}, "language": "english", "review": "Colors got me acting up.", "timestamp_created": 1685320734, "timestamp_updated": 1685320734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139186511": {"recommendationid": "139186511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054357124", "num_games_owned": 1772, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1590258218}, "language": "english", "review": "Is good.", "timestamp_created": 1685320614, "timestamp_updated": 1685320614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139176832": {"recommendationid": "139176832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146163321", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1685306099}, "language": "english", "review": "smooth", "timestamp_created": 1685306134, "timestamp_updated": 1685306134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139175239": {"recommendationid": "139175239", "author": {"steamid": "76561199171473979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1685303630}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si bien la historia no es tan buena, la protagonista tiene su carisma.

Have you ever been playing a platformer and thought: \"this game is fun, it it would be more fun if I was surrounded by a firing squad at literally every moment of it\"? Then mirrors edge is for you. If you're not a masochist, play something else.\n\nIn all seriousness, I want to like this game so much. When the controls are working, and when your not getting shot, it's an incredibly fun experience. But frequently throughout the game, the parkour mechanics fail. Things you think you should land, you just don't. Jumps you should make, you barley make half way. It's incredibly annoying to deal with.\n\nIf it was just some fiddly controls, I'd be able to set it aside, because as I said, when they work, it's really fun. And they work well enough for you to play around the occasional fiddly moment. But for some reason, every single mission in this game ends up with you getting pinned down by trigger happy cops, spraying their unlimited ammo in your direction. It makes the game next to unplayable. If you hesitate for even a moment, you die. Did the controls break and make you fail a jump? Dead. Did you take a second to look around for where to go next? Dead. Did you stop to catch your breath at any point in the non stop chasing? Dead. I get having some levels where your being chased, it can be a fun action scene to have to quickly parkour through an area, dodging fire. But when literally every level becomes a cop chase, it becomes much more an annoyance than a cool set piece. Some levels will start with just letting you find your way through an area, and those are super fun! but inevitably, you'll end up once again being chased down by the omnipresent cops, and their endless budget for bullets and helicopters.", "timestamp_created": 1685227535, "timestamp_updated": 1685227535, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139113779": {"recommendationid": "139113779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278388095", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1685225641}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly the only reason I give this a positive is because of nostalgia.

The length of the game isn't bad either and would probably take an average player 9-10 hours to complete. Game can be extremely satisfying when you manage to quickly chain all the actions. Shooting feels a bit weird and it's a bit lame that you can only aim with the sniper but since shooting isn't the main aspect of the game it can slide by. Some bugs here and there (especially on that one chapter where you fight the whitesuited runner). Story did end quite abruptly and at a time where it felt like it shouldn't have been the end. Overall I'd recommend this game if you can get it on sale. I got it through the EA sale which lasts until the 29th for 2 euro and can't complain. Paying the full 20 euros is something I wouldn't recommend. Given the amount of time it would get to beat the game I'd recommend a price range of around 10 euros for it to be worth for anyone.

It's hard to describe it as anything else. Even though it was released in 2008, at which point we were already knee-deep in the corporate shitshow that is the gaming industry today Mirrors Edge came to fruition. And published by EA out of all publishers. Of course these were the glory days for DICE, which eventually also got drained of its soul as all developers that signed a contract with the devil.\n\nMirror's Edge is a game that follows no rules but its own. It's defiant in how different it is than other titles released at the time, especially those that sold well. And the resulting vision that the game turned out to be is a true genre defining classic.\n\nThe abstract title also aligns with the overall aesthetic of the game, which to this day is probably my favorite in any game I've played since (which are by now literal thousands of titles). It achieves a distinct futuristic look by contrasting bold colors to white backdrops, which, in an almost poetic way is very similar to the game itself. The effect this achieves is incredible visual clarity at a whim, even though it is utilized fairly poorly too often. It's unique, it serves a clear purpose and when it works there's no substitute. Just *chef's kiss*.\n\nThe gameplay is very smooth, requiring minimal inputs but making good use of the few keys they do use. Even though sporadic combat is a brilliant addition to the game on paper (make me) it is executed very poorly. Combat would be a free ticket to breaking the monotony of the parkour, flowing seamlessly with both the story and existing gameplay as is. Unfortunately it's just really janky and isn't integrated properly into the flow of the game. More comically Faith can even go as far as to pick up large sniper rifles and start blasting baddies with it. It's hilariously out of touch with the tone of the game.\n\nEven though the parkour WAS the golden standard, it starts to show signs of age. Faith has the cardio of a greek god, but she does compensate for it by being as slow as a 300lbs dockworker. It's not necessarily bad as it allows players to actually pick up on cues as they progress, but it kind-of takes away from the pacing (unsurprisingly). The momentum system is of-course very smart, but the game makes so little use of it. Instead it attempts to be more of a \"THINK FAST\"-type of game, rather than one that is very execution heavy. The optimal formula would probably be something in the middle, primarily considering accessibility as a main concern.\n\nThe music is all done by Solar Fields and I would be lying if I were to claim Still Alive didn't bring a tear to my eye, and another one several years later due to sheer nostalgia. The tracks are fitting and add to the game's unique vibe even if they aren't all that special in reality.\n\nUnfortunately Mirror's Edge's sequel was a disaster to me - and even though I was completely flabbergasted EA would give the green to it in first place (due to the mediocre sales on the first installment) the result was more or less as expected. Ubitrash had been making money with easy copy-paste overworlds so EA was having a slice of that. Why they chose Mirror's Edge as the most appropriate victim to their corporate trash I'm unsure of, but the result was a wholly uninspired mess I prefer to forget about.\n\nMirror's Edge is a true classic and one of the most noteworthy triple A titles ever produced. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but a sudden bold thought provoking statement completely out of the blue.

It doesn't help that the bloom is absolutely atrocious and overbearing and the \"runner vision\" which was supposed to help you navigate is slow to appear, that is if you notices its appearance. However, the \"runner vision\" only highlights the environment and it is sometimes hard to know what the game wants you to go when you get to the highlighted environment, whether it is move forward or look back, left or right. Sure, it takes a few seconds of looking around and pressing the \"alt\" key to get the game to point to where you need to be but that just destroys the flow. Some levels have enemies come in to shoot at you, so you get lost in the level while enemies are riddling you with bullets.\n\nWhen there are enemies with guns, you can disarm them and use their weapons but disarming enemies is a chore, you can only disarm when the weapon turns red, not when the enemy is rearing back to slap you with it and the time frame for disarming is quite quick so you'd have to rely on the slow motion mode to help with it. However, when you press the disarm button sooner than you're supposed to, Faith will play out the whole failed disarm animation which is enough time for the enemy to slap you and if you pressed the slow motion button before hand, you'd have to wait the entire duration of seeing the failed animation and then being slapped back all in slow motion because you can't disable the slow motion and have to wait til it is over.\n\nBut once you get the gun, Faith isn't the best at handling it. It's clunky and slows Faith down quite a bit so Dice might as well not bother with letting Faith use a gun.\n\nHave I mentioned that the bloom is atrocious. I don't know about anybody else but the bloom actually made me have a splitting headache. I physically can not play the game for an extended period of time because it is unbearably nauseating. It's especially bad during the level where you're on a white painted roof that is surrounded by white painted buildings and it was like a supernova happening on my screen. I'm literally blinded by the lights. I can't seem to turn it off even if I disabled it in the files.\n\nThe parkour, main selling point, is quite slow. Sometimes, Faith will grab onto a ledge with one hand then slowly reaches the other one up and THEN can you tell her to climb up. Switching pipes sometimes don't work because I phase through pipes and plunged to my death. Sliding is also slow as well and there's no rolling after a slide to regain lost momentum like in Catalyst. \n\nConclusion: It is a flawed game, extremely so. It is still unique for its time and have quite possibly set the foundation for many game that follows in its footsteps like its own sequel/prequel Catayst and Dying Light. However, those games are far more enjoyable than its predecessor. Mirror's Edge Catalyst have taken that foundation and built on it, it made the parkour snappier and faster thus never ruining the flow along with plenty of parkour move that you could chain together into combos which add to the flow of navigation, the \"runner vision\" being a clear line for you to follow which made it hard for you to get lost (though sometimes it can just straight up disappear), combat is easier and you can better chain parkour into combat (Mirror's Edge kinda has this but the execution is lacking); Dying Light's gameplay is more varied. And most importantly, Dying Light and Catalyst never blinds you with its atrocious bloom effect.", "timestamp_created": 1685102105, "timestamp_updated": 1685274035, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139013769": {"recommendationid": "139013769", "author": {"steamid": "76561199446092218", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1685099723}, "language": "english", "review": "unplayable garbage", "timestamp_created": 1685099757, "timestamp_updated": 1685099757, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139012783": {"recommendationid": "139012783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280936312", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 348, "last_played": 1700647426}, "language": "english", "review": "game gives me more stress than fun. it's really chalengging for people who rarely use brain for seach clue, like myself", "timestamp_created": 1685098158, "timestamp_updated": 1685098158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139006252": {"recommendationid": "139006252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106624394", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1685044522}, "language": "english", "review": "The story telling in this game is top of the notch, it's a shame that the game will only lat you about 6hrs.

Parkour is the main focus of the game - jumping from high spaces, wall riding, tightrope walking and more, as you try to find out why the police started acting so agressive towards Faith and the Runners, and furthermore uncovering a larger scheme in the works. The game will tell in you in the begining to avoid fights, but towards the end of the game, there is no avoiding and you can pick up weapons, which is where the game becomes a bit of a shooter, although the shooting mechanics are not there (no aiming, except for the sniper and the other weapons have recoil, you can't reload weapons).\n\nThe game was developed by DICE (most know for Battlefield) and published by EA. The game takes rougly 6-8 hours to beat, depending on how much time you spend trying to find your way through the levels, as the game does not sport a HUD, but objects that you can use - glow in red (this option is called Runners Vision and it can be disabled), but in general, you have no guide or arrow that points through the right way, but with a press of a button, you can see where is your next objective (in case you get lost). Apart from the main story, the game has trials, and a speed run mode for the campaign, if you want more parkour-ing. Even though the game was released in 2009, the graphics are great, texture quality is solid on 1080p, but character animations can be a bit stiff in some cases, mainly when fighting. For the 8 hours I've played, I encountered no bugs and the game crashed only once, on some occasions, if you die near the next checkpoint, you'll spawn there, but I don't think this is much of an issue.\n\nAll in all, it is a fantastic game and for \u20ac2 - it's an absolute steal. The story is quite good, graphics are good and there is stuff to do even after you complete the story. \n\nTL;DR 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1684873632, "timestamp_updated": 1684873995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138862597": {"recommendationid": "138862597", "author": {"steamid": "76561199038024367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 496, "last_played": 1684649988}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing mechanics and awesome story.

The game I felt in love with immediately back in the day. Everything about it is perfect - the unique and innovative gameplay, the immersion, the graphics, the art style, the soundtrack.\n\nSuch simple concept as \"running\" becomes nuanced and intricate the more you play the game. The player is not limited by arbitrary RPG elements, health bars, flying numbers over the UI or any other cancer elements of the modern games. There is just the view from your eyes, a few control buttons and the environment to traverse. The simplicity is refreshing, but it's also just a surface. There is a surprising depth in how you can use your surroundings to move around. By playing the game you will become more proficient and skilled in the running, getting experience without any experience points. That is such immersive aspect of the game that rarely any other game can deliver nowadays.\n\nWhile the story is rather short, the levels are very well designed. The \"runners vision\" highlights pipes and springboards that you can use to casually run through, but there is always a shorter, more efficient and smarter way to cut the distance. Finding surprising paths and tricks you can do to beat time trials is akin solving the puzzle and is quite satisfying. The same goes for enemies, you can disarm them and start shooting from the SMG; you can run over the wall and smack the police in the face; or you can ignore the threat completely and do a (more challenging) no-harm walkthrough where you have to be fast - and smart on your pathing - to avoid the bullets.\n\nTechnically, the game stands out even today. Art direction, well baked lightning and colourful pallet make it hard to resist the desire to make screenshots of the city as you run. The PhysX is underrated and sadly forgotten technology that adds oomph to the scenes and makes the surroundings feel more alive. The shattering glass, transparent polyester materials that break from the bullets, the smoke from the pipes and particles of dust in the air that react to your movement ... it's not ray tracing, but it's better than some default Unreal Engine 4 effect that fades out from the screen in 1 second. And it's in 2008 game. Playing it now in high resolution with 144 FPS is just marvellous.\n\nThe soundtrack is a masterpiece from Solar Fields, it accompanies the game greatly and is one of those soundtracks that is great as a standalone album separate from the game. It adds that futuristic feeling in the calm puzzle scenes, as well as pumps up the drive when you are being chased.\n\nWith regards for the reboot (Mirror's Edge: Catalyst from 2017) - the first Mirror's Edge is not better or worse. It's just a different game, original implementation of the concept. Catalyst greatly improves fluidity of the movement, has fantastic graphics and soundtrack too, a big open world city that becomes your playground to explore, so I highly recommend it as well. Nevertheless, original Mirror's Edge stands on its own - one of the most unique and fun games ever released...

It is incredibly short and sweet, clocking in at just under an hour for experienced players. For me, this is why I come back to it time after time, unlike Catalyst. It tells a narrative in dystopian Orwellian world and then it is done.\n\nI have never struggled with the controls or motion sickness so I cannot comment on that.\n\nUtterly adore this game!

This is one of the few games that are simply a must-play. Criminally underrated title. When I was a kid, I was as blown away by this game's trailer on the same level as GTA V's. Other game that simply blew my mind at the time was Outlast. Few games are simply this good, G.O.A.T. in their respective genres (many created by the titles themselves).\n\nI can't fit all of my thoughts about the game here but I very much agree with those videos and have felt the same after finishing the game. Credit to those people for making such in-depth videos due to their love for the game. This is the essence of \"gaming\", and what many modern titles are missing, with the people playing them also in turn missing what felt so special regarding their past releases.\n\nWant to know more about the game while viewing a critique and analysis at the same time? If so, I HIGHLY suggest Whitelight's \"Mirror's Edge: 13 Years Later\" \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e_zNLyEReg and \"Mirror's Edge | Retrospective - A Flawed Masterpiece https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h5o9UVYmCE by GameTalesHQ on YouTube. SPOILER ALERT. Those are great videos!\n\nThe first playthrough is more messy and harder than it should be because there was a lack of details in the gameplay mechanics tutorial, mainly combat ones. Watch the \"Gameplay\" section on Whitelight's video to find how to take advantage of the game mechanics that they didn't tell you about. After that, it becomes easy.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT!\nMy TIPS regarding fixing/avoiding the VERY few but major bugs this game has, which haven't been fixed (unsurprisingly) by EA:\nI recommend fixing PhysX for NVIDIA users. If you don't do that, the game bugs out and becomes unplayable with PhysX in certain missions, making it impossible to go forward without either disabling or fixing it. Fix it in order to enjoy cool physics at basically no rendering cost. You can do that here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/17410/discussions/0/490123727976080324/\n\n[!] ALSO: Avoid alt-tabbing at ALL COSTS. It freezes Windows big time. My only option when it happens is full-on rebooting. A possible fix for this bug is to run the game in a windowed program designed for full-screen games. I personally didn't and won't go through the hassle at the moment as I don't need to tab out, but you may find this helpful.\n\n\nBTW, I made almost 400 screenshots throughout the game, because, as Whitlelight put it, this game's visuals are eye-candy and haven't aged one bit due to the DICE's innovation baking in the shadows and various effects, that are only now, after nearly 15 years, possible to be rendered in real-time. Feel free to check them out! Also, if you're interested about a more in-depth analysis on the game's visuals, I recommend \"How Does Mirror's Edge Still Look This Good?\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TNSaEJHBrQ&t by Jacob Geller on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThat's all!

You may throw at me rotten tomatoes, but I don\u2019t recommend to play at this pseudo-parkour game. And there is one big reason! I might say that it is tiny quibble. This \u201cfast action\u201d game is very boring! And there are multitude facts. \nFact #1. Gameplay. I believe that it is the most important fact, which directly affects the experience of the game. So, when you buy parkour game what do you expect to get from it? Sense of speed, nice velocity of the running. Right? Yeah, right! But what you get in the end? You get clumsy slow turtle, which just hasn\u2019t the physical ability to run faster, like a typical person, with the normal for human velocity! If you, God forbid, you bump at something, you not only lose your speed, and so your momentum. So you have to run up again and again, and it looks like \u201creverse\u201d moon walk. But it\u2019s not all! When you finally run with all your capacity\u2014 you don\u2019t get \u201cWOW\u201d effect from the running! You\u2019re still very slow! I guess that character just get some really heavy poop in its pants! So it prevents it from running! You know what? Even CJ from GTA:SA runs faster, and more effectively! And I guess that developers were aware of this problem, so they did add some \u201cblur\u201d effect! Like, \u201cDudes! Look at that, our game has blur effect for make you sense of your velocity!\u201d But in this game it doesn\u2019t help! \nSo, due to all of it, dynamic is lost in the middle of nowhere. And this is first reason of the dullness of this game.\nFact #2. Plot. Ok, this plot looks like it was made for some B-type bootleg movie, that you could buy in the dirty \u201cmom & pop\u201d store in Chinatown. Really, man! Why they did base whole game on some desire of helping sister! I even yet don\u2019t know my character well, and you, guys, want from me that I just take my \u201cballs\u201d in the fist and start to help my sister? I DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW THIS WOMAN! WHO THE F IS SHE?  GET HER OUT FROM ME! And, there no reason to get some empathy to main character and even more so to other character. So you watch this story without interest, like some soccer game between Jamaica and Nepal. \nFact #3 Graphic style and in-game color pallete. Hmm\u2026 You know what, first things first, by the way. If you, dear developers, put beautiful Chinese woman on the cover of your game, so be kind to add same person in the game cutscenes! I buy this game and expect that she would be in the game clips, like CGI character for example, but why I have to watch at your cheapy-drawing story-videos? Why they choose this painting style? It is very crude! Developers, you should just use static photo pictures, with that woman, for your plot cutscenes! It would be more pretty, and cheaper, but instead you did chose clumsy animation for your clips\u2026 WHY, DEVELOPERS?! I NEED THE ANSWERS! So due the differences between styles of cutscenes and gameplay moments I have dissonance in my brain! I get split mid because of you!!! Ok, what about color design inside the gameplay moments? It looks like developers just soak it with the bleach! WHY DO YOU USE ONLY WHITE AND RED COLOR IN YOUR GAME MOSTLY?! HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT OTHER COLORS? YELLOW? GREEN? PURPLE? ARE YOU WHAT? ARE YOU A RUSSIAN AMBULANCE VAN, FOR USING ONLY THESE COLORS, OR WHAT?\nMy verdict. Yeah, it is AAA-game, with made-up plot for \u201cplot\u201d and clumsy and slow gameplay, without any possibility of running route - in one word, I would say that it\u2019s boring. \nShould you buy this game? Yes, if it comes with discount. But should you play this game? Nope, definitely you shouldn\u2019t.\nI put 4 score to this game only for good idea, but very bad realization. \n4 boring games out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1684501202, "timestamp_updated": 1684525908, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.370562314987182617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138533169": {"recommendationid": "138533169", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024515811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 536, "last_played": 1690453583}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short, but very fun.

On a visual and audio level, this game is gorgeous even by today's standards. The white city with brightly contrasted colors combined with the fantastic soundtrack and punchy sound effects is such a vibe. Movement feels (mostly) smooth and fluid, which makes the running feel amazing when you are maintaining your momentum through the rooftops.\n\nHowever, there are some collision detection issues that can interrupt this flow and it's always frustrating when it happens. Gunplay feels very stilted and off too; which wouldn't be too bad if it was entirely avoidable, but there are multiple sections where taking out the people in your way is mandatory for progression and they kill the pacing of the game every time. Finally, the story is really short and not satisfying at all. There's a certain character who betrays you and you never get a final confrontation after the revelation, the ending comes out of nowhere, and nothing really feels resolved.\n\nAnd yet I found myself able to look past all of the glaring faults and still enjoy the running for what it is. Mastering the movement of this game and finding a new height to view the city skyline from feels liberating and there's a certain rush that jumping across a massive rooftop gap gives which I have not felt in any other game. Despite its flaws, Mirror's Edge is a unique experience that is worth playing.

It's very linear, but it's one of the best and more unique games I have ever played. It's made by DICE. If you've played any of the recent Battlefield games, you'll notice that they took ALL the parkour elements from this to make Catalyst (the sequel, and then implement all that into BF1 and BFV. It's a work of art.\n\nWith this original game there's some minor FOV issues, namely a lack of a proper FOV slider. There's a few easy fixes though. All it takes is a quick Google search, and only that's necessary if you're bothered by the slightly narrow FOV.\n\nAudio, design, gameplay and style wise this game still holds up for a 2008 title.  It was incredibly well made and still is a fantastic game. If it it was released today as is (with minor technical changes) I think it would be a bestseller, especially with how popular freerunning/parkour is in games these days.\n\nWhen Mirror's Edge (Original) released it didn't sell well. I guess it was too different. All the more reason to get it now, ESPECIALLY on sale. Get it RIGHT NOW.\n\n[b]Addendum:[/b] Go look up Solar Fields on Spotify.

despite the criticisms). The setting is interesting and the environment is pretty to look at, but the actual plot and dialog is meh. However that's not why you are here for... \n\nYou run, you jump and put your acrobatic and pathfinding skills to the test. And you better not stop because 90% of the time people are shooting at you.\n\nYou can punch people, you can grab their guns and shoot their friends, but for me, the real satisfaction comes when you finish Hard Mode without using guns for the first time. Guns make combat 10 times easier yes, but they slow you down, prevent you from doing your acrobatics and generally break the flow. That's not why I play this game.\n\nOn that topic, the game is short. Your first time might take you between 5 to 6 hours, depending on how long you get stuck in the tricky parts and if you watch or skip cinematics. But once you learn it, it gets shorter and shorter. Now I run Hard mode pacifist in under 3 hours. \n\nBut that's the thing, despite being short, it's a game that rewards mastery. It's not a game that loses it's charm when you know what lies ahead. Like racing games, once you know the road, it only gets better. Your second time will feel better than the first, and subsequent playthroughs give you the satisfaction of executing the maneuvers you need with more accuracy, and maybe the discovery of a new shortcut.\n\nIf you like racing, if you like parkour, and aren't intimidated by a challenge that is hard to master, you have to try this game.", "timestamp_created": 1683826437, "timestamp_updated": 1683826437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138102257": {"recommendationid": "138102257", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082501995", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1685301522}, "language": "english", "review": "gud game\njust dont fall to the streets\notherwise your ears will get fucking 360 noscoped by a prestiege 10 guy in mw2", "timestamp_created": 1683740224, "timestamp_updated": 1683740224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138083113": {"recommendationid": "138083113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055273276", "num_games_owned": 567, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1683621080}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game.

From the use of a largely gray/white color palette mixed with way oversaturated primary colors it has a unique style that is immediately striking. It also holds up well visually due to its reliance on style over detail and environments have a very clean and sterile look, something that also matches the theme and story of the game. The Physx effects looked pretty neat and were probably more impressive back at release but are used sparingly, like glass and cloth banners being destroyed by gunfire\n\nSound effects and music are both excellent and the soundtrack in particular really stands out, with a mix of ambient tracks to high intensity electronic stuff during chase and action scenes.\n\nI played with both a controller and KBM, and find them equally fun to use. Controls are responsive and once you are moving quick and in the flow, all the parkour actions are satisfying to pull off. Each level in the game is essentially on big parkour puzzle where the name of the game is to avoid combat encounters and move as smoothly and quickly as you can from one area to the next. You can grab weapons and fight back but the shooting doesnt feel great and its not the point. Huge props to EA for making a big budget game like this where shooting was not the selling point, you can absolutely make it through without firing a bullet and as a matter of fact, its the recommended way. There are a handful of melee attacks you can use to subdue or get out of a bad situation and that is more than enough\n\nThe game is somewhat brief (I think I beat it in about 4-5 hours), but you could probably play longer if you care about picking up the runner bag collectibles, this version doesnt have achievements so I didnt bother. \n\nReally my only complaint with ME is the cheap looking and unappealing cinematics and the fact its over probably a little too soon. The game was remarkably fresh feeling and interesting back in '08 and outside of its sequel there really hasnt been anything else like it since, so it still is.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a fun action game that breaks the mold of endless shooting. Enjoy the movement and soundtrack and this game should run on basically any PC at this point while still looking pretty sharp.", "timestamp_created": 1683644246, "timestamp_updated": 1683644246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138023135": {"recommendationid": "138023135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333642867", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1683583608}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 Mirror's Edge, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0439 DICE \u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f Electronic Arts, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435.\n\n\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430:\n\n1.\u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441. \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u044e\u043a\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u044f\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0438. \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b.\n\n2.\u0412\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c.

I love the first-person view and the section where you jump on the train, for example, that felt fun and was pretty damn cool and unique felt like a badass you know. the minimalist style makes the world look great and easily guides the player where to go with the red colors, although I do wish certain sections were made just a bit better as they felt more annoying than fun, though that may be a skill-level thing rather than a game development flaw. when I mean the looks of this game look cool jumping from tower to tower and seeing where you are going next with certain things in red feels and looks cool, I straight up love the skyscrapers makes me think of the Rufus boss fight in the final fantasy 7 remake on a building. the parkour felt fun except for the sections the game started lagging from glass shattering it become unbearable and unreasonably difficult, like I didn't feel bad at the game I felt like the game was unoptimized and unfairly making it challenging. the ending of the game without going into too much detail I didn't care too much for thought its whatever, it's good for what it was.

As a first-person parkour adventure game released in 2008, it offered players a breath of fresh air with its unique gameplay mechanics and striking visual design. However, as we delve into the era of next-gen gaming, it's becoming increasingly apparent that this once-shining gem is starting to lose its luster.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's acknowledge the aspects of Mirror's Edge that have made it so endearing to fans. The game's minimalist art style, combined with its vibrant color palette, made for a captivating experience that was distinct from any other game at the time. The innovative use of parkour as a core gameplay mechanic allowed players to experience a sense of freedom and fluidity that was unparalleled.\n\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that Mirror's Edge has not aged as gracefully as one might hope. While the game's art style remains impressive, the graphics and overall visual fidelity are no longer up to par with modern standards. The once-fluid animations now appear clunky, and the textures can feel outdated, which may diminish immersion for new players.\n\nThe controls, although innovative for their time, can also feel unpolished and unresponsive at times. The precision and timing required for some parkour moves can lead to frustrating moments, especially when compared to the smoothness of more recent parkour-based games.\n\nIn conclusion, Mirror's Edge is a game that will forever be remembered for its pioneering gameplay and aesthetic qualities. It dared to be different and pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the gaming world. However, as we embrace the next generation of gaming technology, it's becoming increasingly clear that this once-revolutionary title is struggling to keep pace. Despite its shortcomings, Mirror's Edge is still a game worth experiencing, especially for those looking to explore the roots of modern parkour and action-adventure games.", "timestamp_created": 1683002927, "timestamp_updated": 1683002927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137585451": {"recommendationid": "137585451", "author": {"steamid": "76561199166389595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 415, "last_played": 1682898206}, "language": "english", "review": "pain in the ass", "timestamp_created": 1682898272, "timestamp_updated": 1682898272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137507803": {"recommendationid": "137507803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062880055", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1682799170}, "language": "english", "review": "Free run and Design are the things that I really love about this game.\nI did played it through multiple times and I will do it more times in future.", "timestamp_created": 1682799318, "timestamp_updated": 1682799318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137458010": {"recommendationid": "137458010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081949928", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1682737623}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm sad it's over.

While the game's visual style is undoubtedly appealing, with its minimalistic and simple design, it doesn't make up for the game's many shortcomings.\n\nThe gameplay feels clunky and janky, which makes executing certain moves difficult, leading to frustrating gameplay experiences. As a parkour game, you'd expect to fall a lot, but the checkpoint system is excruciatingly terrible, often requiring you to replay long stretches of levels due to a single mistake. This quickly becomes tiresome, especially given the levels themselves are so repetitive and bland.\n\nThe game tries to introduce puzzle elements, but they feel more like chores than anything engaging or fun. They add little to the overall experience, which is a shame as the game could have used something to break up the monotony.\n\nAll in all, while Mirror's Edge has some strengths, including a unique visual style, it falls short in so many other areas. The gameplay is frustrating and the levels repetitive, making it difficult to stay engaged.

Released on PC in 2009, it was praised for its immersive atmosphere, vast vertical and horizontal spaces, fluid game dynamics, and natural camera mechanics that follow the character's movements.\n\nOne of the standout features of Mirror's Edge is its unique art style, which creates a clean and minimalist world with vibrant colors that make the game world feel alive. The game's visual design also includes some truly breathtaking environments that range from soaring skyscrapers to the gritty underbelly of the city, all of which are brought to life with impressive attention to detail.\n\nThe gameplay in Mirror's Edge is equally impressive, with a focus on free-running and parkour-style movement that allows players to navigate their environment in exciting and fluid ways. The game's control scheme is intuitive and easy to pick up, but mastering the various moves and techniques takes skill and practice. The level design is also top-notch, offering a wide range of challenges that require both quick reflexes and strategic thinking.\n\nThe camera mechanics in Mirror's Edge are also noteworthy, as they add to the game's immersive feel by following the character's movements in a natural way that makes the player feel like they are truly a part of the action. Whether running along walls, sliding under obstacles, or leaping across chasms, the camera always manages to keep up with the player, providing a seamless and immersive experience.\n\nOverall, Mirror's Edge is an outstanding game that deserves all the praise it has received. From its immersive atmosphere and stunning visual design to its fluid gameplay and natural camera mechanics, it is a game that truly pushes the boundaries of what a first-person action game can achieve.

The premise of the game was incredibly unique when it first released and it's still a standout title in the gaming industry. The smooth and fluid animations of the protagonist Faith make you feel like you're truly running and jumping across rooftops in a dystopian world.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of Mirror's Edge is its commitment to its core gameplay mechanics. The game focuses on parkour and running, and it executes those elements so well that it's hard not to get caught up in the momentum of it all. The bright and colorful visuals, coupled with the fast-paced action, make Mirror's Edge a game that's impossible to put down.\n\nThe story is another strong point of Mirror's Edge. It's a well-crafted tale of a world in which personal freedom is being stifled and the government is watching your every move. Faith is a likable and relatable protagonist who's easy to root for, and her interactions with the other characters help to flesh out the world and make it feel more real.\n\nHowever, one aspect of the game that can be jarring is the use of animated cutscenes. While the game's graphics are stunningly realistic (for the time), the cutscenes have a distinct anime style that can take some getting used to.

Even if an imperfect marriage of the first-person perspective and parkour mechanics may leave you scratching your head at jarring dips in pacing for what is clearly meant to be an elegant ride - primarily due to bad tutorialization and era-specific level streaming bottlenecks - the meticulously sharp artstyle is ever the safety net, even in those situations. \n\nThe cleanliness of the cityscape is an almost bizarrely abstract dance of whites and blues with contextual accents of red marking your unfolding path, often juxtaposed against bold interior levels where suddenly the balance inverts and primary colors take center stage. But the minimalism in shape and palette is itself a red herring, as material textures and design are the secret stars of the show; for as often you find yourself missing a ledge, doing an imperfect wallrun, or clambering up the millionth red pipe, you still get to appreciate just how polished the material bumpmaps are in every little corner of the world and down to point-blank range. The same can't be said of character models, but it feels like an appropriate compromise here; like I mentioned above, this is a focused shot of technical competence in areas that shine brightest. It feels almost bravely indie in that regard.\n\nTo that end, the length may seem short, but even that ultimately feels like a welcome breath of fresh air. Cool as it might look from the side, kinetic first-person platforming puzzles with crudely bolted-on hand-to-hand combat are not the densely rich gameplay loops you want overstaying their welcome. It's a tight, linear run through increasingly varied concrete mazes with stark color profiles that test your reflexes and spacial awareness, and terminate just as the headspinning gets a little annoying.

Parkour focused gameplay is something that you didn't and still don't see explored very often in big budget games, there are AAA games out there that have parkour mechanics but certainly nothing that has an emphasis on it. And I think that they pulled it off pretty well given the tech of 2009. The parkour mechanics are mostly smooth, the setting is interesting, and the animated stylized cut-scenes are nice. \nI can't help but feel there are a few problems however. Sometimes it's not very clear where you're supposed to go next as whilst the game does have the alt button which lets you know where you need to go next, I find that sometimes the path to that area is not always clear. Although the parkour mechanics are mostly smooth given the era it was made in, it's age does show sometimes as it's still a bit clunky in certain areas. The combat is also kind of clunky but to be fair the game was designed for you to avoid combat in most situations.\nOverall, I think it's a game that took the risk of going into uncharted territory and did it well but with some pretty notable flaws. 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1681509364, "timestamp_updated": 1681509364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136702768": {"recommendationid": "136702768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198956749441", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1681840471}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la historia es una garcha pero el juego se ve hermoso", "timestamp_created": 1681505879, "timestamp_updated": 1681505879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136647544": {"recommendationid": "136647544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194956801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1685107064}, "language": "english", "review": "6/10 HOW IS THIS SHIT SO SHORT", "timestamp_created": 1681419630, "timestamp_updated": 1681419630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136639116": {"recommendationid": "136639116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315528889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1681409629}, "language": "english", "review": "okay", "timestamp_created": 1681409340, "timestamp_updated": 1681409340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136636154": {"recommendationid": "136636154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231327804", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1700114467}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good I may have died at the most stupidest things in parkour but it good i like\nstory is alright", "timestamp_created": 1681403492, "timestamp_updated": 1681403492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136621888": {"recommendationid": "136621888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125112864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 821, "last_played": 1681383423}, "language": "english", "review": "you know what, yeah I like this.\na really good parkour puzzler.", "timestamp_created": 1681386861, "timestamp_updated": 1681386861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136598387": {"recommendationid": "136598387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119389050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 153, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1681270766}, "language": "english", "review": "hitte the fuckign space bar respond", "timestamp_created": 1681338188, "timestamp_updated": 1681338188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136590436": {"recommendationid": "136590436", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087439121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1681411858}, "language": "english", "review": "I may have died more than 200 times.

Dentro rese\u00f1a!\n\nNo s\u00e9 cu\u00e1ntos a\u00f1os hac\u00eda ya desde que jugu\u00e9 por \u00faltima vez en mi PS3, Mirror's Edge fue una propuesta arriesgada por parte de EA, algo diferente a lo que nos ten\u00eda acostumbrado la compa\u00f1\u00eda y fue una idea muy original.\n\nNos ponemos en la piel de Faith, una runner que deber\u00e1 correr por su vida en una ciudad en la que la informaci\u00f3n es todo. Y es que entre cap\u00edtulos tendremos una cinem\u00e1ticas modo c\u00f3mic contando la historia adem\u00e1s de escenas in game en diferentes situaciones.\n\nEl gameplay se basa en el parkour, correr, saltar, trepar por paredes, giros r\u00e1pidos, agarcharse, sumado a un combate (en escasas situaciones) con varios combos de parkour e incluso se atreve a convertirse en shooter de vez en cuando, toda la experiencia en primera persona. Por lo cual si te mareas con los juegos de acci\u00f3n en primera persona y odias el cabeceo constante del personaje directamente ni lo juegues. Los escenarios son variados, encontrando horizontales y verticales, interiores y exteriores, pese a que el aspecto de la ciudad sea igual. Podemos hacer el camino (si bien parece un mundo abierto, no lo es) por diferentes lados y saltos, pudiendo encontrar incluso coleccionables (30). No podemos personalizar a Faith. La m\u00fasica est\u00e1 bien sin destacar. No empatizaremos con los personajes pues no tienen profundidad alguna. Y la historia si bien rebuscada, nada del otro mundo. Pero el concepto, el mundo que plantea, el parkour constante (sin otros aditivos) y los escenarios son \u00fanicos. \n\nContaremos con un bot\u00f3n gu\u00eda para no perdernos y la visi\u00f3n de runner (que podremos desactivar a nuestro antojo) har\u00e1n algo m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil. La dificultad (f\u00e1cil y normal) solo repercute al combate y c\u00f3mo de esponja somos con las balas. No afecta al parkour por lo que recomiendo disfrutarlo en f\u00e1cil. Post game no existe, podremos rejugar los cap\u00edtulos que queramos. Hab\u00eda una tabla de clasificaciones online a modo de multijugador que no s\u00e9 si sigue existiendo.\n\nEl port a steam, 60fps en 1080 es una maravilla, sin ca\u00eddas, va como un tiro, sabiendo que la \u00faltima vez lo jugu\u00e9 en PS3 pod\u00e9is imaginar. Encima no tiene el launcher de EA/Origin, as\u00ed que es una compra asegurada. El juego puede durarte unas 4-5 horas y hay checkpoints.\n\nAcompa\u00f1a a Faith en una ciudad infestada de poder e informaci\u00f3n, donde el m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido se hace con todo.

Just be careful not to bump into anything!\n\nIt's a great stress reliever! There's nothing like running and jumping around a dystopian city to forget about all your real-life problems.\n\nThe game's protagonist, Faith, is a total badass. Playing as her is empowering and inspiring, and you'll feel like you can take on the world after playing.\n\nMirror's Edge is the perfect game to play with friends - you can take turns trying to beat each other's high scores, and you'll all have a great time laughing at each other's mistakes.\n\nYou'll get to experience the thrill of being chased by the police without actually breaking any laws! It's the best of both worlds.\n\nAnd finally, playing Mirror's Edge will make you cooler than all your friends who haven't played it yet. So what are you waiting for?

If it was the year of release, I would absolutely recommend this without question. The concept and mechanics were innovative. The art style was unique. By today's standards, however, I don't feel it holds up well, despite the parkour and movement mechanics.\n\nFor a sale, I'd certainly pick it up and play it through on an easy mode to enjoy the parkour mechanics. First person parkour makes it more enjoyable than, say, Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider, or Uncharted games.\n\nThe story and music are pleasant if you are into late 2000s nostalgia, which I am, so it was nice, but not a story that would draw you in at all. It was predictable and I was not invested in it at all; it felt like a means to connect different levels together for creative parkour and map scaling challenges, not the other way around, where you [i]want[/i] to platform in order to see what's next.\n\nGraphically, the basic art style helps in maintaining a reasonable standard in today's age, and it is creative in simplicity and minimalism. That being said, it gets boring after the first half or so of the story where you progress from white room with blue chairs to white room with green chairs and white room with orange chairs, glancing around for whatever is red to help you out (if that assist is turned on).\n\nIf it didn't take me several years of picking it up saying \"you know what, now is the time to finish this game\" to finish it, I would recommend it.

It was challenging enough to be engaging, with well placed breaks to take a breath and prepare for the next rush through a shootout. Calmer parts were still just engaging. The combat situations were not repetitive and different tactics were needed in different scenarios, which I appreciate. The story was not exactly ground breaking, but it was ultimately not the driving force of the game. It was good enough that I cared to follow it.

They didn\u2019t. The sales figures disappointed EA and when we eventually did get a sequel it had lost many of the things that made this game so unique to begin with.\nMirror\u2019s Edge is a bit of a cult favorite these days and for good reason. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like it, but I sure as heck do. The world you\u2019ll inhabit is a very clean, very ordered retro future where the populace have traded disorder, uncertainty, and crime for a society that\u2019s controlled by the corpo\u2019s. Information is repressed and individuality is discouraged. And for the most part, it seems to work. The world seems better than the one we live in today. There are some that resist this corporate utopia however, and you\u2019ll play as one of these malcontents in the game. She\u2019s a young woman called Faith. These dissidents call themselves runners. They\u2019re basically couriers who smuggle illegal and highly sensitive data by running across rooftops to avoid the persuasive CCTV cameras that litter the streets below. You do all of this in first person, while trying your best to avoid confrontation with the authorities since they are armed and you are not.

I used to play this game as a kid on my older computer since it's really well optimized but I never played more than the first few levels.

Runner Vision is really cool and very helpful during chases. The gameplay is mostly smooth. Parkour is phenomenal and you can't really find anything better, even after all these years. It can be clunky here and there, especially in smaller areas but it's generally great. There are a few platforming puzzles where you have to find an exit in a tight space and it's really rewarding to do so. Regarding melee, I think I didn't grasp it quite well. It definitely felt like I was missing something since everything I knew was attack and counter. It was fine enough though, and it helped me acquire weapons to clear out the rest of the enemies if necessary. The gunplay is fine, it's not that fun but it's very useful.\n\nA few drawbacks would be the story, characters and voice acting. I really didn't follow the story nor did I remember who is who except a few people. They're generally forgettable but it's fine since the focus is on the gameplay. [spoiler] The Celeste fight was really wonky and weird. I really thought I wasn't doing it properly but oh well. [/spoiler] The ending is underwhelming too.

Correr, deslizarse, saltar, buscar escapatorias imposibles es muy diver y en todo momento me incita a seguir buscando una salida para ver el siguiente nivel. El que vaya buscando un juego tipo fps se va a ver defraudado, porque precisamente esa parte de pelear est\u00e1 implementada de manera un poco regulera (de hecho en alg\u00fan momento es bastante molesto porque no te queda otra que pelear, y el juego no va de eso).\n\nA nivel gr\u00e1fico a pesar de ser un juego antiguo tiene tal clase que aguanta fenomenal el tipo, con esa est\u00e9tica futurista de ciudad impoluta. El sonido est\u00e1 bien aunque la ost no destaca (la \u00faltima canci\u00f3n mola y ya).\n\nComo pega m\u00e1s grande, aparte de esa parte de pelear, en mi opini\u00f3n el juego es excesivamente corto (menos de 10 horas me ha llevado) y aunque tiene el planteamiento de poder hacer speedruns de las fases superadas, a m\u00ed no me ha llamado tanto la atenci\u00f3n como para ponerme con ello (me gustaba m\u00e1s el hecho de tener que pensar en el \"combo de movimientos\" para buscar el camino).\n\nEn la Deck obviamente va sobrad\u00edsimo. Ni se inmuta el cacharro, y lo \u00fanico que requiere es un tiempo inicial para adaptarse a los controles con el mando (no es f\u00e1cil, tuve que probar varias configuraciones hasta que encontr\u00e9 una que personalic\u00e9 para estar c\u00f3modo).\n\nNota final: Recomendado. La verdad es que me ha defraudad un poquito. Lo jugu\u00e9 hace ochocientos a\u00f1os y ten\u00eda un recuerdo buen\u00edsimo, pero al rejugarlo no creo que sea ese juego de culto sino sencillamente un buen juego.\n", "timestamp_created": 1672489032, "timestamp_updated": 1672489032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606854856014251709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129770258": {"recommendationid": "129770258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203340858", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1672490473}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendado por su jugabilidad y manejo del parkour a lo largo de la ciudad.", "timestamp_created": 1672487413, "timestamp_updated": 1672487413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129769992": {"recommendationid": "129769992", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980644674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1672486875}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is wonderful.

There's lots of specific spots where you pretty much just have to keep trying again and again until the physics interaction just *works*. (I.e. try ad nauseum until the character grabs the ledge, or the jump after the wall run actually works, the mob gets disarmed, etc etc etc). At the beginning of the game, the difficulty is easy so you can mostly breeze past this stuff, but by the end things ramp up and the jank in the physics engine really starts to break down the game play. There was one specific jump in the 2nd last level I spent over half an hour repeating until it finally worked. Didn't even feel like a skill issue by the time I got it... the physics interaction just eventually registered. Also, I'll put in one last mention that while the game is decent at checkpointing, sometimes you're just stuck repeating a long segment just to be able to retry a buggy jump.\n\nI played on normal (only easy / normal are available until you beat the game), and I liked how it felt like the regular mobs were challenging. Knowing that any particular NPC can delete you keeps you on your toes. I also liked and disliked how the level design doesn't handhold you in many spots. Sometimes you're just left running around scrambling to find a way through. It can be frustrating in a way, but maybe the game's biggest success is capturing that tense feeling of being on the run.\n\nIf the parkour flow wasn't broken all the time by the jank in the physics engine, I could see paying a few bucks for this on sale.

One moment you're chilling, hopping across rooftops, climbing through vents - next thing you know, a chopper and like five dudes with machine guns and sniper rifles are on your tail. You sprint between walls, hurriedly climb over fences, split second decisions left and right, and when you've barely escaped within an inch of your life, the game showers you in this immense relief of 'holy shit, how did I get away with that'\n\nIt is exactly what it says on the tin - think Minecraft parkour but with less tedious and much more satisfying movement. At times, the movement can feel like you're just trying to hit a quick-time event over and over again, but mostly it strikes this lovely balance between [i]speed[/i] and [i]weight[/i] that feels very fulfilling. The other game design elements really compliment it in this regard. The police feel like an actual force to be reckoned with, and the 'fight or flight' part of it really helps pump up your adrenaline. The level design is intuitively crafted, so you always instinctively know [i]where[/i] to go, but never exactly [i]how[/i] to get there. And lastly, the OST in this game is super well done - it subtly nudges you into this edge of your seat urgency, while never drawing so much attention to itself as to impact your immersion.\n\nNow, there are times when these elements fail to do their part. They largely rely on eachother to be 'convincing' - so if e.g. the level design fails at some points, and a row of jumps become just a bit too annoying, the whole illusion of urgency falls apart. I had this happen a few times, and I wouldn't say it impacted my experience very much, but it did show that the game doesn't have the polish it could've had.\n\nI'd also just like to comment on the gun-play - if you're looking for the 'movement shooter' experience in a single player game, this really isn't it. I personally loved the combat in this game - picking up a gun really felt like you weren't a trained shooter (because the MC truly is [i]just[/i] good at running)... which meant you'd get a gun, dump the [i]entire magazine[/i] into some poor unsuspecting cop, then quickly sprint away - which felt really appropriate! \n\nOverall though, this game is just great.

This game rules.\n\nMaybe pedantic nerds would consider Mirror's Edge an FPS, but really it's a platformer\u2014a game about clearing obstacles as elegantly and efficiently as you can. The distinction is extremely important, for reasons I'll get into. And man, does its movement hold up. Running, jumping, sliding, wall-hopping, pipe-climbing, ziplining\u2014this game has it all, and each mechanic is executed to perfection. Rarely does movement in a game feel so distinctive yet natural.\n\nThe story concerns the adventures of a young woman called Faith, one of a group of underground couriers called (what else?) Runners. Together they deliver goods and information around a beautiful, ultramodern City where life is comfortable and there's almost no crime\u2014because of an oppressive regime with tight control over its citizens. Faith has a sister, Kate, who is more straight-laced. (She works as a cop.) The game starts when insurgent mayoral candidate Robert Pope is assassinated and Kate is framed for his murder.\n\nBeat-for-beat, the story of Mirror's Edge is essentially an action film. Even my biased ass can't identify some sleeper genius writing decision that makes it remarkable. The perfect gameplay makes it satisfying, sure, but a lot of action games have great gameplay. That's kind of the point. And yet...the experience of playing through the game has stuck with me all these years in a way no comparable title really has.\n\nI think it's the effectiveness with which you're put into Faith's perspective. You have her skill at running, and her physical limitations. You hear her grunt with effort when she climbs and pant when she sprints. The complexity with which you move through the environment of the City makes it memorable, makes it a character, even in spite of its pristine, sterile aesthetic.\n\nOr maybe because of it? Early on, it's revealed that Faith and Kate's parents were killed in brutal crackdowns that were a response to protests against power grabs by the City's leadership. The game takes place long after they're gone\u2014long after they lost. The City is beautiful now, sleek, elegant, tourist-friendly, soulless. The game's theme, [i]Still Alive[/i] (not that one), is addressed to the City. \"I know there's something wrong,\" it says. \"Your concrete heart isn't beating.\" Faith's feet pound against a home that's dying with each step.\n\nThat's why Mirror's Edge is not an FPS. You can't shoot your way out of gentrification. You can't take an AR-15 to \"development\", wealth inequality, displacement. What magazine, what bullet cartridge, kills exploitation itself? No, Faith is no one-woman army. She crumples at bullets, especially on hardmode, and can't even run with many of the weapons she picks up, rendering them useless except as a momentary last resort. This game is not about [i]overcoming[/i] the villain, [i]destroying[/i] them with superior firepower. It's about running, escaping, surviving another day. That's what makes it so affecting.\n\nMirror's Edge was lightning in a bottle. Flawless gameplay, unforgettable setting, and a perfect length. Faith Connors will forever be one of gaming's most iconic action heroes, a title well-deserved. If for some unfathomable reason you're still reading this rambling nonsense, stop and buy it already. You will not regret it.\n\nP.S.

It's breathtakingly beautiful and gives me that same feeling in my stomach as when the plane takes off and lands.\n\nThe visuals are incredibly cool. In particular, the sweeping skylines and use of bold colours give it a look that is distinctively Mirror's Edge.\n\nThe music is excellent. The ambient tracks in each of the locations are great at setting the mood, but my favourite song is Still Alive from the end credits.\n\nThe game's biggest problem is the frequency of the fights, especially because it doesn't seem to want to be a fighting game. When a game looks the way Mirror's Edge does, you want to spend more time exploring the environments instead of being rushed through the levels. It also makes the game more difficult to play. If some of the moves are challenging for the player, it's considerably harder to take the time to master them when the game is putting pressure on you to hurry. You can fail a level for not being quick enough or by being shot to death by enemies.\n\nMirror's Edge would have benefitted from developing its story and characters. I would have liked to understand the political climate better and to have got to know the people in Faith's life better. But there is enough there to more or less understand Faith's goals and motivations.\n\nThis game's flaws are significant yet I still enthusiastically recommend Mirror's Edge.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/developer/fayestrawberry/] Faye Strawberry Curator [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1665080392, "timestamp_updated": 1672176230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52449566125869751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123443417": {"recommendationid": "123443417", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014217084", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1650901245}, "language": "english", "review": "F**king Guards..", "timestamp_created": 1665070183, "timestamp_updated": 1684841868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504587173461914063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123404171": {"recommendationid": "123404171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385759980", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 594, "last_played": 1672767964}, "language": "english", "review": "Politischer Lesbianismus", "timestamp_created": 1664993794, "timestamp_updated": 1664993794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123396735": {"recommendationid": "123396735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309085610", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1643204933}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game. \nFor a 2009 game, the graphics are top notch. \nBut its too damn short.

This game does not wait for you and it is unforgiving, forcing you to make split second decisions on how to evade the oncoming barrage of gunfire and enemies.  The way you move and look around and interact with the environment around you makes it feel you really are doing all these wall jumps and rolls and punches.  With that and the fact that you can literally hear your character breathing, it really feels like you are controlling a living breathing person.  The various ways to get to that vent or platform or getting around enemies/obstacles is enough for multiple replays.  Your environment is a puzzle to get through.  Add that futuristic aesthetic and music, it's a winner for me.  The only things I'm slightly iffy about are the occasional bugs and animations for the cut-scenes, I like the art but I do feel like the change in art styles do break the flow of the game a little.  The story isn't anything mind-blowing but it's easy to follow and certainly interesting enough to keep you glued to what's happening.

It feels quite tactile and exciting!\n- The OST makes the aforementioned chases feel awesome!\n- Visually pleasing artistic direction that has aged pretty well for a 2009 game.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- It feels like I am always battling to figure out where I am supposed to be going in spite of there being a button dedicated to telling you where to go This is especially prevalent in slower segments. There are frequent moments in which the end destination is clearly visible, but the way to get to it is convoluted. \n- Pretty hit or miss level design overall. You cannot jump or climb on many surfaces you'd think you could, jump distance/height can be ambiguous, visual clutter can get in the way, etc. The levels are not very intuitive.\n- Combat is REALLY bad. You are simultaneously having to mash for your life and watching for a (VERY TIGHT) parry window. Feels like the best means of fighting the clunky AI is to not fight them at all.\n\nEach of these bad points works together to disrupt the flow of the game.

Edge\"[/h1]\n\nExcelente videojuego de parkour en primera persona, manejar a Faith Connors es tan sencillo como satisfactorio y dif\u00edcilmente te vas a encontrar atorado en una secci\u00f3n, el juego se las arregla para guiarte por su mundo haciendo uso de colores llamativos entre tan exagerada iluminaci\u00f3n.\n\nMec\u00e1nicamente es relativamente sencillo pero lo suficientemente bien dise\u00f1ado como para no aburrir ni, por el contrario, abrumar.\n\nSu atm\u00f3sfera destaca por lo blanco y limpio, y se condice con su m\u00fasica (Excelente el track \"Still Alive\" interpretado por Lisa Miskovsky), sin embargo un aspecto con el que choca de cara es su argumento. \n\nEl r\u00e9gimen totalitario del que se nos habla s\u00f3lo hace presencia en las cinem\u00e1ticas animadas, pero cuando toca jugar encontramos mapas limpios y carentes de alg\u00fan indicio de lo que el argumento nos quiere decir. S\u00e9 que hay un comic que se explaya un poco m\u00e1s en todo esto, pero por ahora no lo le\u00ed y en el juego per se hay temas como el de las protestas o la madre de Faith que carecen de peso pese a estar tan presentes. \n\nPero si dejamos de lado estos conflictos u otros como el pedante tutorial, el ca\u00f3tico control de las armas de fuego o el sistema anti-pirater\u00eda (Que est\u00e1 tan mal implementado que puede llegar a ocurrir con la versi\u00f3n original), nos vamos a encontrar con un buen juego.\n\nDivertido, fren\u00e9tico y sencillo de manejar. Quiz\u00e1 sus controles no hayan envejecido tan bien, habiendo a d\u00eda de hoy juegos de parkour m\u00e1s elaborados, pero visto en contexto fue un buen t\u00edtulo.\n\n[b]\u00bfEn conclusi\u00f3n?[/b] Recomendado.

I love the way u can combine all those parkour moves to a decent performence by your own. \nThe way the game basically it's coloured and colored with objects that guide's your route to another building or level. It is ofc desing pretty well. \nThe weapons are well design by dice ofc <3. They are looking like bf3 combined to mw2 like most of all that pkm lmg or mg4 I dunno :D and scar h they made those weapons look like cod+bf combined. But the enemies are just decent they provide a fire towards you and can miss from close distance or missed you in the back while you're apfront 50 metres. Eh that's just basics. \n The whole game is a pretty good big challenge to those who looks for fun and adventure not for those who thinks this is like an Assassin's Creed game :DDD heeeelll no. \nThe music made my mind go ez on this frustration when I was failing up and down. I was really patient and although I was angry a little bit. I made my performance look good to myself and enyojed the whole game. \n  Story hmmmm oh yeah there is a comic tv serie within all the levels at the end/beggining and they're all related with each other so U will be facing some valid politicians chiefs and other antagonists. \n\n And that's that :P I will complete the game on hard mode difficulty cuz it will be a really hard challenge towards those stupid taser guys espacially.                                                                           \n \n                                                                                                                                                  My rating: 9/10       \n", "timestamp_created": 1661779646, "timestamp_updated": 1661779646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121408982": {"recommendationid": "121408982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149367063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1204, "last_played": 1661911060}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the game for its time as well as the story, just an all around fun little game to play!

This review is moreso about the Steam Deck experience.\n\nThis game was great to finally finish, as I've attempted multiple times before but never really got into it. Being on the Steam Deck made it easy to pick up and play quickly. The controls are mapped to a standard Xbox 360 style, which makes it pretty intuitive. However, this game does run odd for its age on the Steam Deck. One of the main issues was that PhysX is on by default, when I turned that off the serious frame drops went away, but would still occasionally have minor drops. With PhysX on, there were points the game dropped down to 18fps average, with actual 3fps lows. After turning it off, it occasionally would dip into the 40's, but otherwise held 60fps most of the time.\n\nThe game itself is a simple, mostly on the rails parkour style game. It's obviously not open world, but has the illusion that it's very large due to the landscape being mostly large buildings/rooftops.

The only thing the game could benefit in terms of graphics are maybe some higher resolution textures in some places.\n\nThe story is kinda boilerplate. It uses elements from film noir (getting framed for a crime you didn't commit, cutthroat politicians and businessmen, etc.) and a bit of sci-fi. The sci-fi part isn't really fleshed out that well. I don't think it would have taken that much to inject a little more environmental storytelling into the levels. Same goes for the runners themselves. I would have loved it if the game started out with you doing some normal runner jobs before the story really kicked off. But oh well, we didn't really get that.\n\nAnd yet this game is special to me.

Running around and doing parkour feels great, mostly: Faith has a nice sense of momentum, you can wall run and jump, and when you know what to do and where to go the game feels really great to play. Unfortunately, the combat in this game is atrocious and ranges from mildly annoying to downright frustrating. There were also a few instances where Faith would fail to grab a ledge or pipe, resulting in me plummeting to my death, but thankfully there's plenty of checkpoints that help with the frustration. This is also a pretty short game; my playthrough only took me about 4 hours (I don't know how I didn't beat this game as a teenager when Steam says I put 25 hours into it), and I wouldn't be surprised if a decent chunk of that time was me retrying sections after dying to something stupid.

To be entirely fair to this game, it's 13 years old... but that doesn't excuse the absolute lack of polish when it comes to *all* of its mechanics.\n\nTo begin, the most core part of the game is parkour... Unfortunately, it's non-fluid, unintuitive, and clunky. For a 2009 game it may have been great, but for 19.99 today? Utter shitshow. A game's mechanics should be reliable, predictable, and should be working well with the gameplay. The parkour is anything but reliable. For a game that's all about fluidity, you seem to be hindered by a light breeze. Turning is a shitshow of slowing you down, snagging corners make you come to a dead stop, and jumping toward a ledge is a complete cointoss of whether you'll land it, have to hope Faith grabs the ledge, or just plunging to your death because the game decided to say \"No, you didn't grab the ledge this time\". And yes, even when spamming spacebar, it is completely random whether or not it works. Springboards are another thing that only works when it wants to, and god forbid you disarm someone near one; It may trap you in the actual springboard.\n\nThe combat is... shit. Makes Skyrim look genious. Right-clicking when the gun turns red is a mechanic that only works when it feels like working. You can have timing down to a fucking tee, using slow-motion and everything, and still miss a disarm because the game just didn't feel like it at that moment. Which, in most cases, gets you killed and you need to go back to the last checkpoint...\n\nThe \"Find your way\" mechanic, where you press Left-Alt works so-so. It's a great idea, until implemented in a game where you're supposed to be running most of the time; Never press it near edges of rooftops, it WILL turn you into an involuntary skydiver. There's also the problem with it turning you to look straight into a wall, giving about as much information as a blank piece of paper.\n\nIt may have been a mistake to play Catalyst before this one, but I probably wouldn't have played Catalyst at all if I had done them in order; this game is just so off-putting when it comes to gameplay. At least the story is good.\n\n\n*I actually have to edit this, because I got a bit further in the story, and somehow, everything has changed*\n\nNot for the better, mind you. It's 10 times worse. The combat system is as wonky as ever, making the later parts of the game borderline unplayable. The parkour is as unreliable as an old Saab 900, to the point where you're actively looking for a way to get to the next checkpoint without having to press spacebar. And best of all; The little guidance that you did get from pressing Left-Alt only works if Left-Alt decides to work... but the devs decided that it needs to shut off at times. I'm actually impressed that I, not to mention my voice, has made it this far.\n\nIt gets even better, though. This entire game is rendered non-canon in Catalyst, as Faith thought Kate had been killed during the November Riots, and Kate thought that Faith had abandoned her. Wait no, that's Cat. Right, this entire game never happened... So I suffered through this for nothing, story-wise.

Using a bright, sleek city and red/blue design language allowed the game to age gracefully. The movement is brilliant in idea, but I'm not convinced it's actually good, and that's the main gameplay. I've played 2 hours. The controls are weird still. They're OK though. What's less OK is the frequency I execute the controls properly but the game's auto-contextual elements don't work: I jump atop a zipline instead of jumping onto it to ... zipline. I climb a wall, hoping to hold the top and not jump over, but my character auto pulls herself up and throws herself to her death. Every AC game ever has done better on this front with similar or better movement. Between this, the game being so on-rails, the controls and the game's direction hints being so bad, it's in a weird spot for me. It has a lot going for it, but it's genuinely a bit frustrating. Oh, it also just crashes constantly. For example, every single time I alt-tab, it crashes. \n\nOverall, feels frustratingly close to being great. but for now, it's just good enough to beat for the $5 I got it for.

Its graphics and art-style are timeless. It's short and we never got the DLC for the Steam version but it is unique. The combat is wonky to the point where you're better off not engaging with it - but once you nail down the controls and feel of the game, you'll get into \"the zone\". Where the game wants you to be: always on the run. Always on the Edge. [/h1] \n\nI still remember the very first trailer. Being a big fan of parkour, I was immediately hooked, kept tabs on the game\u2019s release and eventually, a demo came out on Xbox Live. \n\nAlthough extremely short, I played that demo to death. The movement felt amazing. The graphics and the art style were something else for 2008, even though it runs on UE3 which was known for its \u201cgrey and brown\u201d aesthetic because of Gears of War. It still looks great today thanks to its immaculate visual design and its (at the time) unique baked Global Illumination solution. Every frame is screenshot material.\n\nSo I bought the game day one on 360 and had a blast\u2026 For about three hours. It\u2019s that short. But Mirror\u2019s Edge is all about running, thinking fast, finding a better path each time. So I kept playing, clearing the few different game modes it offered, and did the same on the PC version later. \n\nEven though I basically played the same levels a thousand times over I never got bored. Simply put, I never found another game like Mirror\u2019s Edge. Even its sequel is very different, although similar at a glance. For you see, Mirror\u2019s Edge is more of a racing game where you control a human being rather than a FPS or platformer. It\u2019s more akin to SEUM or time trials in DiRT Rally than say Dying Light. \nIt\u2019s one of those games that puts you into \u201cthe zone\u201d as they call it. You\u2019ll feel like a speedrunner \u2013 except that\u2019s just how the game is meant to be played.\n\nThe combat kinda sucks, to the point where it\u2019s better to just ignore it as much as you can. Some sections of the game will somewhat force you to fight although it is possible to beat the game without killing anyone. \n\nThe story is nothing to write home about. It\u2019s there, it moves you from one level to the other without getting in the way so I guess it\u2019s fine. The OST is absolutely amazing, composed by Solar Fields. A master of his craft which is ambient stuff. \n\nNow there is one notable downside with the Steam version: we never got the DLC, which is simply amazing. It\u2019s Mirror\u2019s Edge at its best. However, the PC version is moddable and it\u2019s possible to play them that way now.\n\nSo, should you get Mirror\u2019s Edge? Absolutely. Why? Because if you\u2019ve never played it, you never played anything like it. And if you already played it \u2013 then you know you can clear that section you always had trouble with but faster. With a better flow. Without missing a single beat. Improving your time.

It's my pride and joy, all thanks to this game that continues to hold a special place in my heart.\n\nThe Enchanting Protagonist\n\nAt the heart of this masterpiece is Faith, a captivating and wonderfully developed protagonist.

Its striking aesthetic, visionary visual design, and unique art style create a world that's as much a work of art as it is a game. The soundtrack is equally mesmerizing, introducing me to a treasure trove of emotionally charged music that still resonates with me to this day.\n\nParkour Prowess and Pulse-Pounding Action\n\nThe core of the game's brilliance lies in its parkour mechanics. The fluidity and grace of Faith's movements are nothing short of exhilarating. It's an experience that makes you feel like a true parkour/free-running virtuoso, effortlessly navigating the cityscape in ways that redefine the boundaries of what's possible in gaming. The game's action is relentless and intense, keeping you on your toes as you weave through the urban jungle.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nUnparalleled visual design and art style that create a captivating, immersive world.\nA gripping story with a protagonist, Faith, who stands as one of the most compelling characters in gaming.\nAn emotionally resonant soundtrack that enhances the overall experience.\nParkour mechanics that make you feel like a true free-running maestro.\nA sense of constant fluidity and intensity in the gameplay.\n\nCons:\n\nWhile the parkour mechanics are sublime, they may take some time to master for newcomers.\n\nConclusion - An Artistic Marvel\n\nIn conclusion, Mirrors Edge isn't just a game; it's an artistic marvel, a breathtaking masterpiece that has the power to change lives. It's a game that's both fun and profoundly moving, an embodiment of pure artistic expression in the world of gaming. I cannot recommend it enough\u2014it's a privilege and an honor to have experienced this gem in the world of interactive storytelling.\n\n\nGanon: (in his booming, ominous voice) Well, well, well, what have we here? Mirror's Edge, you say? (chuckles evilly) Let me tell you, my fellow Koridaians, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece!\n\nGanon: (with exaggerated enthusiasm) It's like a perfectly executed evil plan, except it's not evil! The moment you step into the world of Mirror's Edge, it's like entering my lair, only with a lot more jumping and a lot less danger. And believe me, I know a thing or two about danger!\n\nGanon: (with dramatic flair) The beauty of this game, my loyal minions, is unparalleled. The cityscape is a sight to behold, just like my magnificent castle! The colors pop like a freshly polished Triforce, and the rooftops, oh, the rooftops, they're perfect for planning your next sinister move... I mean, your next acrobatic feat!\n\nGanon: (laughs wickedly) But what truly sets Mirror's Edge apart is the sensation of freedom as you parkour your way through the city. It's like the feeling I get when I steal the Triforce of Power, only without that pesky Hero of Time chasing after me!\n\nGanon: (grinning) The gameplay, my fellow Koridaians, is as smooth as a Moblin's freshly greased club. You'll be running, jumping, and sliding like you're on a quest to rescue Princess Zelda herself! Except in this case, you're the hero of your own story.\n\nGanon: (with a hint of nostalgia) And speaking of stories, the plot is surprisingly engaging. It's like the Legend of Zelda, but without that pesky Link getting in the way of my plans. (chuckles)\n\nGanon: (with a triumphant tone) In conclusion, Mirror's Edge is one of the GRRRRRREATEST games I've ever played in Koridai! Just as great as anybody's face becomes if they join me too! It's an exhilarating experience that will make you feel like you're soaring on the wings of a Loftwing.

Smash through windows, crawl through vents and disarm enemies along the way on Faith\u2019s search for the truth. Seeing red is quite literal in this case in fact you are actually looking for it as it lights your path. Keep your allies close while you race to discover what revealing secrets lie at the top of the shard. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMirror\u2019s Edge is a different kind of game from the style EA usually puts out. You play as Faith who is able to wall run and hop or slide her way through the city as a runner to transport things discreetly. She is trying to solve a crime that her sister has been framed for and she is racing against time itself to save her. \n\nThe game itself feels a lot like a first person Enter the Matrix game minus most of the fighting. As a runner Faith primarily uses hand to hand combat and she can use guns if she disarms an enemy but the majority of the game is focused on speedrunning and it is usually in your best interests to avoid fighting unless you really have to. On consoles there was even a trophy for finishing the game without using any weapons.\n\nPlaying through the game in first person view definitely makes it rather interesting. You can look around for objects in red to help guide you to where you need to go but the game can also be incredibly picky, if you don\u2019t do it in exactly the way it wants you to do it you will miss and have to keep repeating it until you figure out the way that they expect you to do it. Luckily the game is rather forgiving and if you miss a jump you won\u2019t have to retrace your steps too far.\n\nIt is a very interesting game with a beautiful artistic style. The game isn\u2019t all that long, but it does have a variety of different levels ranging from rooftops to underground sewers and unfinished construction sites to explore. Some of the later levels can be challenging because the enemies are heavily armored with machine guns and Faith dies in a couple of hits. The part with the server room on the final level was particularly frustrating. On the harder difficulty they don\u2019t give you any help at all. You basically have to figure out how to navigate it by yourself without the red hints but if you have already played the game before then this shouldn\u2019t be too complicated as you already will be familiar with how the gameplay works. \n\nThis was one of the first games to showcase PhysX technology which was designed with a separate card dedicated to just physics in mind. Since then Nvidia integrated the technology into basically every geforce card and now you can run it without needing any additional hardware. I\u2019ll admit it adds rather neat effects (like flapping tarpaulins in the wind as you are running on scaffolding or glass shards that shatter when you break a window). It had a big hit on performance with video cards when it was released (7800/8800 GTX) era but now a modern gpu should have no problems with it. The differences are rather subtle but it is pretty cool when it\u2019s enabled it adds more realistic effects to certain things.\n\nOverall I had a fun time with this game and once you have understood how the parkour style works it can be pretty rewarding as you focus more on the flow and learning how to keep the momentum going. It is a rather unique kind of experience. It's hard to compare this to other games as I don\u2019t really know what to compare it to. There is a sequel to this that was built with the newer Frostbite engine and is similar but much prettier, it\u2019s called Mirror\u2019s Edge Catalyst. I do recommend this if you are looking for a game that is different from the usual RPG or FPS shooters and is more about fast thinking and intuition then this definitely might be of interest.", "timestamp_created": 1656650108, "timestamp_updated": 1656650108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563225507736206055", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117968975": {"recommendationid": "117968975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891851193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1680699052}, "language": "english", "review": "its ass", "timestamp_created": 1656644398, "timestamp_updated": 1656644398, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.360907554626464844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117967429": {"recommendationid": "117967429", "author": {"steamid": "76561199155879563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 369, "last_played": 1689617610}, "language": "english", "review": "run fast. fall miserably.", "timestamp_created": 1656641942, "timestamp_updated": 1656641942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117935515": {"recommendationid": "117935515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830832813", "num_games_owned": 796, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 700, "last_played": 1617761101}, "language": "spanish", "review": "alguien vio la historia de esto?", "timestamp_created": 1656603607, "timestamp_updated": 1656603607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841313362121582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117928457": {"recommendationid": "117928457", "author": {"steamid": "76561199264253185", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1700675015}, "language": "english", "review": "This game earned a place in my heart since the first time I played it, there is just nothing bad I can say about it.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the color combination is gorgeous, the city design is outstanding, the immersion is on point.

Its ultra-vibrant environments and wind-kissed sound design is a real treat to the senses. Along with the iconic movement options of a seasoned parkour expert, Mirror\u2019s Edge makes for a cozy seat in the driver\u2019s side of a daredevil\u2019s car.\n\nAs for the story, it wasn\u2019t bad, just very predictable. If nothing else it at least justifies Faith\u2019s running around with a believable reason. The only area of significant complaint is how finicky the game can be at times. For instance there were a few times where the objective marker didn\u2019t work and I ended up at a dead end for a brief period, or times where enemies were a bit too obnoxious in their placement.

There are a lot of annoyances, but overall I think it's an important part of gaming history that most people should experience.\n\n[h1] The Good! [/h1]\nLet's start out with the good. For one, the movement itself feels great. Getting a long string of successful jumps together feels awesome. The sense of momentum is almost perfect, and the feeling of presence in the game world is some of the best that I've experienced in any 1st person game. The great sound design, viewable 1st person body, and good animations help both of these points become a reality. \n\nSecondly, the art direction and world design is truly timeless. The semi-realistic, slightly stylized city and the clean, solid, bright colors make for a game that still looks great 13 years later. You can see the low-ish polygon count if you stop and look around, but the game is so fast that you usually don't have time to. \n\nThe animated 2D cutscenes are also really fun to watch and are so much more interesting than if they were boring 3D in-engine cutscenes like most other games. The voice-acting is also great all around.\n\nLastly, Faith is just a badass character. She's so fuckin' cool and really fun to play as. You really feel like a superhero playing as her, and her backstory and motivations round out the character perfectly.\n\n[h1] The Bad! [/h1]\nThat being said, there are a LOT of annoyances that keep this game from being a masterpiece. Firstly, the combat feels extremely half-baked and clunky. It can feel cool when you are able to disarm an enemy and use his weapon to clear a rooftop of baddies, but most of the time that doesn't happen. Most of the time you awkwardly flop around and whiff your attacks before being completely rekt. The best parts of the game are when they leave you alone and just let you jump around by yourself for a while.\n\nOne small thing I didn't like is how abrupt the ending is. There isn't a single line of dialogue after the last short gameplay section, it just suddenly rolls to credits. I'm not saying it needed to be super complex, but having nothing at all just feels kinda rushed.\n\nLastly, the game is way too easy in general with how frequent the checkpoints are. It almost feels like playing an old arcade game with unlimited quarters. You'll die a shit-ton, but you always respawn like 10 feet from where you died so you can just kinda mindlessly brute-force your way through most of it.\n\nAlso, the game breaks when alt-tabing, so don't do it.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\nOverall it's at LEAST a solid 8.5/10 experience. I'd recommend it to anyone at $5, but maybe hold off on a full-price purchase unless you plan on playing it several times, because there just isn't that much content.", "timestamp_created": 1656118812, "timestamp_updated": 1656119674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117544007": {"recommendationid": "117544007", "author": {"steamid": "76561199018577117", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1678690143}, "language": "english", "review": "free run game funny", "timestamp_created": 1656111842, "timestamp_updated": 1656111842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117529584": {"recommendationid": "117529584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987011333", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 135, "last_played": 1682968715}, "language": "english", "review": "cool game just dont tab out since it will glitch your monitor", "timestamp_created": 1656094456, "timestamp_updated": 1656094456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117519280": {"recommendationid": "117519280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217921001", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 102, "last_played": 1651593807}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun to speed run", "timestamp_created": 1656082542, "timestamp_updated": 1656082542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117486242": {"recommendationid": "117486242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337167356", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1659399005}, "language": "english", "review": "Still an amazing game in 2022.

game to anyone that's a fan of parkour or FPS games. While it can be challenging to get the controls down, the game is smooth with a unique and very pleasing art style. There are some draw backs in my opinion, like a short story and rudimentary gunplay, it more than makes up for with extra content (remember when that was a thing?), and time challenges; with those negatives even adding to the charm of the experience, in my opinion. Sadly though, EA being EA, the asking price is just shy of $30 CAD - nearly [i]half[/i] of the original asking price back in [b]2008[/b]. While you can pick this game up for around $5 on sale (although I can't say the same with all their other games), this is just plainly unacceptable, and hurts the series overall as it drives potential fans away - ever more shrinking the community, and lessening the probability that this game will get future support, or more games in the franchise. If you do end up grabbing this game, please do so on sale! We don't need to be encouraging this behaviour. \n\nHonestly, I miss the days when large studio's weren't afraid to take a risk and release a game with a new formula or idea like this game, instead of the same old microtransaction filled stuff we get nowadays. Don't get me wrong, with publishers like EA it's going to be profit over the consumer - it always has been - but maybe if there were more new games like Mirror's Edge coming out today, we'd over look the old DLC way of doing things.

I mean you looking for a parkour game? This was the game, this is the game and probably will remain the best as a classic forever. So what are you even waiting for?\n\nHere are a few things I noticed about the game that made me enjoy it:\n\nThe challenges: For those of us who like to play at the hardest difficulty, this is not that hard of a game but it forces you to escape rather than fight if you do not master combat skills as much. The fact that the red door guides you is nice but I think it can be more challenging to simply remove it on the hardest difficulty. Apart from this, there is races and you may always want to re-approach the game in a different way.\n\nThe level design: I appreciate the simplicity on the game and really liked the modernity which the game brings in terms of the looks. Again it isn't as diverse as the second one but it is still up to date. I like the simplicity of it, I felt like I was outdoor on a sunny day chilling on the rooftops and then when the chases kick in, you really are motivated to search for the best escape and the game does a good job as to pointing you to where you need to go.\n\nWorth buying in today's time?: Well today as i'm writing this we are in 2022 and the game was made in 2009 and I definitely would go back to it even in the future. In a sense this game is still the best parkour game you can find at the moment.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1653604233, "timestamp_updated": 1653604233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

And there is no options, no variations, there is just a single plot. If you try to change the flow of the story somehow, the system force it back. Plus, if you don't finish the story mode, you can't play other mode.\n\n[b] Combat [/b]\nThey prepared several chances of combat in the story mode, and  it was a, well, SH!T.\nThe enemies have longer reach than you, faster than you, can detect you wherever you are, and get knock back or groggy irregularly.\nAnd then you, the protagonist, seems couldn't got much talent. You can punch maximum 3 times at single attack. But if you start the flow of the punch combination, you can not do anything, such as moving, jumping, counterattack, etc., until you finished 3rd blow of the punch. Oh, Yes, counterattack. You can take over the enemies gun by the counterattack, and at the same time, you can knock them out too. And it has cool action.  But it doesn't mean you are invulnerable during counterattack. And usually, you fight with several enemies at same time.\nWell, there are many great things about combat, like a camera view fixing bug, stupid AI, etc., just play and feel it. It will be awesome.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nI was excited to play this game. Steam store reviews were VERY POSITIVE, many people praised this game, PV was looked good. Then, what else?

Mirror's Edge is easily one of my favorite games of all time, and PC is easily the go-to best place to experience the game.\n\nThis is easily a title that could be considered a \"comfort game\". Its short length, combined with gameplay that is easy to learn, hard to master and extremely rewarding makes this a great experience to pick up on and off whenever. The modding community has also been growing a lot over the past few years, with many custom maps and even a multiplayer mode being developed. The replay value is huge.

Firstly the game is suprisngly slow, its about building momentum but even when you run for a bit and build up speed its just slow, i did expect to run faster than an average game lets you but this feels slower than an average game lets you. Your move set for free running is also suprisngly weak, there is crouching for sliding and letting go of objects and jumping for clinging up to them or wall jumping. Thats pretty much it but using those is off at times. Certain actions youll do using those is climbing pipes, or clinging onto some platforms and troughout the game you just miss the things. Id jump on pipes in a way and id just drop next to them and next time i respawn id slide down them. Same with platforms there is 1 spot where i actually caught on a platform below another so i couldn't climb up, and another where i climbed up a Vent's top part [got a screenshot of that] There is absolutely no, how to say it, adjustment from the game? Like if you aren't on point you are going to fall.\nThink of another game, here ill drop an extremely random one, GTA, hate me all you want but jumping from building to building in San Andreas is absolutely fine, and you can do some mad clinging on buildings, hell CJ will cathc something mid jump if there is something where as at times in Mirrors Edge id have to repoisition myself and then hope id catch the thing im looking at.\nFall damage is completely random, there is a roll mechanic where you nulify it but the falls that require it don't make sense. I had taken damage in vents and some shorter heigts and then id fall just fine on certain higher stuff i just ended up doing the roll just to make sure nothing happened.\nCombat is unimpressive. Hand to hand you have like 4 moves, punch, disarm, dropkick and lowkick and in all honestly its too basic. There isn't even a block so you are there just mashing until you kill something, there is a dodge tho, at least i think its a dodge. There isn't any interesting combat combo, or some cool move you can pull off like on load screens. Now i didn't expect something like Oni or Yakuza but i sure didn't expect this little of it. Shooting which i commonly heard is the worst part of the game is honestly kinda fun, there is no weight to it and sounds aren't too great either but suddenly coming up and taking an enemy's gun and then moving others is just fun.\nAnd this is best part of Mirrors Edge, starting something and then it developing it, doing multiple platforming jumps in a row, chaining enemies and yknow, cool stuff. But you don't do that.\nThere are quite a few scenarios down the line that just seem poorly thought out. Shooting sections require you to pick of 1 enemy with a gun and then from there go to the rest but there is 2 sections i feel like you are put in an ass position where you will die over and over. To quickly talk about disarms, cool mechanic, seems absolutely broken for 1 of the guns, and 2 particular sections i talk about have 2 enemies in your sights with those guns, very very very not fun.\nThere is a platforming bit on a train where timing of your jump is very scuffed imo i don't think i even deserved to pass it once i did. An elevator one where i straight up gave up trying to catch a wire mid air after a while. Aperently high framerates mess with physics but i checked its aperently fine on 60 and thats what i played on.\nStory is just dumb, partially has to do with the game being like 4 to 5 hours at most which i don't know what was the price of this game at release but that is low, its especelly obvious when the game just goes from 1 to 100 to like 50 to whatever else it wants.\nAnd really this game is doing what it wants, the story does what it wants, the platforming works when it wants and the shooting sections are fair when they want to be.\nThere are just better games for hand to hand combat, platforming, shooting, story and while at times Mirror's edge is a nice combination it doesn't help it from the fact that in reality all those things are poor.", "timestamp_created": 1651585724, "timestamp_updated": 1651585724, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462432146072387695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114867569": {"recommendationid": "114867569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177751797", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1651484703}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game aesthetic I've ever known.
