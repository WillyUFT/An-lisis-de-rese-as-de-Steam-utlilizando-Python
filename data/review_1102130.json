The outfits, the aesthetic, the dreams. I looked like Krish. I have never been left more heartbroken after playing a game in my life. I turned around to see my s/o in tears after we finished. She was devastated that Florence did not end up with Krish. She continued to cry. I\u2019m a fan of romances such as 500 days of Summer and La La Land, where sometimes life can get in the way of love. Perhaps love is something where people enter your life, change, and grow for the better. My only wish is that I wish they had an ending for Krish. This was a story about Florence, and about how others can rekindle a sweetness for life itself that can continue long after they are gone. The art in this game is brilliant. The comic book-style graphics and interfaces made for a unique storytelling environment \u2013 the puzzle piece mechanic for the conversation was amazing. I started to visualize conversations with my s/o as puzzle pieces and it actually made conversations smoother and more constructive.\n\n---\n\n\tThis is the significant other here: the one that looked like Florence. Yeah, this game made me sob really hard. The gameplay itself is very cute, intuitive, and enjoyable. I thought the colors, artwork, and transitions were very beautiful\u2014and the story wrecked me. It\u2019s bittersweet. It literally breaks your heart. But it squeezed my heart more because my significant other and I literally look like these characters. We have similar personalities: ambitious towards goals, artistic, emotional, etc. I really hope it's not a similar ending, but bittersweet might be in the future. Props to the creator, and I hope she\u2019s healed from her relationship. I hope \u201cKrish\u201d has healed as well. I resonate with the story a bit too much, and as much as I want to recommend it to people, I also don\u2019t want to. It might tug at your heart a bit more than you want. Every time I think about the game, I cry a little. \n", "timestamp_created": 1700429011, "timestamp_updated": 1700429011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549376785755157471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150197251": {"recommendationid": "150197251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118026707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1700093817}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful, a story conveyed through its visuals music and puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1700093887, "timestamp_updated": 1700093887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150151498": {"recommendationid": "150151498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407442931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 83, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1700114563}, "language": "english", "review": "thank you.", "timestamp_created": 1700022389, "timestamp_updated": 1700022389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150147840": {"recommendationid": "150147840", "author": {"steamid": "76561199201878091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1700011884}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this story.

Florence Yeoh was attracted to Krish's violin sound and developed a crush on him. An accident leads them to meet and know each other, and then to date and live together. The beginning of a relationship is always warm and wonderful, adding power and color to an otherwise boring life. Florence Yeoh and Krish did a lot of things together, encouraging each other to achieve a better self, a very romantic love.   But there will also be a day of argument, when the problem can not be resolved by words, the relationship cracks appear.  If at this time the two people's words become increasingly sharp, the words become more aggressive, the relationship will break down.  Florence Yeoh and Krish have a big fight, two people neither let anyone, as if the fight proves that they are right. This was a very wrong idea, so Florence Yeoh broke up with Krish.The feeling of falling out of love was very bad, and Florence Yeoh was immersed in the good memories of the past, until one day she picked up the paintbrush sent by Krish.Painting has always been Florence Yeoh's dream, and she seems to have found the original intention of painting.Florence Yeoh set up a website to sell her paintings, and she succeeded. Many people appreciated her paintings and even held an exhibition.  Florence Yeoh was no longer immersed in the sadness of the past.  She became better and stronger by relying on herself and the pursuit of her dream.Because of Krish, she had the drive to paint, but what kept going was her perseverance in her dreams.  Everyone should understand that their own success, their own happiness, their own carefree, is not given by others, but you have achieved.No one lives by anyone.  I have been wandering in the mud, there is someone like Krish to pull me out, let me feel the vitality of life and color, that time is simply my happiest days.   But there are always fights in a relationship, and in one of those fights, I said what I regret the most in my life.Those words let me cant pull back this relationship, I want to catch him, but I do not know how to cherish, do not understand that language is the sharpest knife, so I lost him.

Mounting itself as a beacon of artistic elegance, \"Florence\" crafts a narrative ballet that unfurls the complexities of love and self-discovery with poignant grace. This review embarks on an analytical odyssey, delving into the multifaceted layers that constitute the ethereal tapestry of \"Florence.\"\n\nArtistic Visual Language:\n\nFrom the very first brushstroke, \"Florence\" declares its artistic intent with fervent confidence. The minimalist visual style transcends mere aesthetics, becoming a language that reverberates with the resonance of emotion. Employing a subdued color palette and charmingly abstracted characters, the game channels the influence of graphic novels, fostering a sense of engagement akin to a page-turning novella.\n\nThe seamless integration of visual elements with the interactive medium imparts a tangible immediacy to Florence's world. Each delicate gesture, each whimsical flourish speaks volumes, crafting a nonverbal narrative that resonates beyond the screen. The graphical metamorphosis paralleling the ebb and flow of the protagonist's emotions is a testament to the developers' dedication to visual storytelling, echoing the cinematic language of auteurs.\n\nAudio Sculpting and Subtle Nuances:\n\n\"Florence\" employs an auditory symphony that delicately entwines with the gameplay, elevating the emotional cadence. Kevin Penkin's original score, akin to an aural caress, navigates the player's emotional voyage with deft precision. The minimalist arrangement, interwoven with motifs that mirror Florence's emotional journey, seamlessly underscores the narrative beats.\n\nSound effects echo with a narrative purpose, intricately choreographed to mirror the characters' interactions and feelings. The rustling of paper, the chime of a phone notification, the subtle crescendos of a piano - each auditory element is a deliberate brushstroke on the canvas of player experience.\n\nNarrative as an Interactive Dance:\n\nThe narrative architecture of \"Florence\" diverges from conventional storytelling paradigms, weaving an intimate tale of love, aspirations, and self-actualization. The game's core conceit rests in the symbiotic relationship between its interactivity and narrative, converging to mold an emotionally charged odyssey. The player isn't merely an observer but an active participant, their engagement mirrored in the protagonist's emotional journey.\n\nThe narrative dissects the eponymous character's life with a surgeon's precision, each interaction dissecting layers of personality and personal evolution. By deconstructing the mundane aspects of life \u2013 the rise and fall of relationships, professional struggles, familial dynamics \u2013 \"Florence\" subverts the banal and renders it extraordinary. This deconstructionist approach, akin to a literary deconstruction, peels away the veneer of routine to unveil the raw core of humanity.\n\nInteractive Choreography and Pacing:\n\nThe balletic choreography at the heart of \"Florence\" elicits parallels with the rhythm games genre. However, this endeavor ascends beyond the confines of mere mechanics, employing gameplay as an extension of emotional expression. The narrative pacing is intricately calibrated, mirroring the oscillations of real-life interactions. Tapping into the minutiae of routine, \"Florence\" transforms the act of brushing teeth, folding laundry, and sharing conversations into an interactive ballet that celebrates the intricacies of human connection.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn a medium often commoditized by frenetic action and grandiose narratives, \"Florence\" emerges as a transcendent magnum opus, seamlessly intertwining interactivity, artistry, and storytelling. It elevates the gaming sphere, redefining the boundaries of emotive engagement. Through its meticulously curated aesthetic, harmonious auditory design, and profound narrative sensibilities, \"Florence\" weaves an emotional tapestry that invites players to explore the symphony of everyday existence. As a paragon of interactive art, \"Florence\" beckons the gaming community to embrace the power of nuanced emotional storytelling, transcending the boundaries of traditional entertainment into the realm of soul-stirring experiences.", "timestamp_created": 1691834184, "timestamp_updated": 1691834184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143933227": {"recommendationid": "143933227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164529496", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1691784634}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a pleasant little romp that lasts two hours.

Maybe because I expected some kind of deeper message or being offered mature answers ... But it did not deliver it. Still, it was worth the time and the ideas for the puzzles were neat - it made you feel like you are going through the stages together with the characters. But story\u00b4wise, It only once again recycled the idea that \"even good love ends if you are not your own person first\" - which is not always true, sometimes the other person can teach you to be more your self. And if it is a supportive partner, they will make you blossom - if it is the right person. And vice versa. \n (maybe if they portrayed some really drastic imbalance/incompatibility, the end would feel less forced and less petty... Instead, they made it seem like completely normal things inside a relationship - such as differences in opinions, some fights, different goals - cannot be worked on together and will inevitably lead to a bitter scarring end. It was hinted at Florence suppressing self from start - but it did not feel like something that she could not have worked on, once noticed... If the relationship started being abusive, maybe the message would also be more focused, more clear... - but the guy was just immature - also something that he could work on. So instead of feeling healed by the game after my own situationship trauma -  it made me feel unexpected dread O __ O ).\n\nWork cannot replace a missing relationship, but it can distract you from the pain or help you channel the pain into useful thing.

What gives?\n\n\"In Florence, the player follows the story of 25-year-old Florence Yeoh as she lives her daily routine and meets Krish, a cellist she sees in the park. The game features little written dialogue and tells Florence's story through a series of brief chapters. Puzzles are used to reinforce pieces of Florence's life as players progress through her story.\n\nLead designer Ken Wong wanted to create games that eschewed violence and was inspired by his work on Monument Valley to have a more narrative-focused experience that included puzzles. The game received critical acclaim that praised the game's art-style, music, and narrative structure, but received some criticism for its ending.\"\n\nWell, first of all, the puzzles in this game are sweet and simple, but more than that I admire the way they were intertwined with the story. They served as interesting narrative devices and helped you experience the childlike creativity when putting colourful shapes on paper, the way it gets easier to talk to someone with time or how to decorate a shared space when there's suddenly someone new in your home. The way the balance shifts in arguments (in this game, literally), how routine catches up with people and the process of letting go.\n\nThe art was very sweet and simplistic; in its details you can see how this is a beloved project by its developers. It is well-narrated and definitely on the better side of virtual novel games.\n\nI think the game will give you as much as you are willing to think about it and put your own two cents on top of the story. While playing the game, I could definitely enjoy and reflect on it and strive for a full achievement game play. So I guess it's also pretty cool for achievement hunters. (You can go back to specific chapters, making it easy to complete)\n\nI did not enjoy the game after all of this praise, because looking back, the story is very clich\u00e9. Meet cute between boy and girl and life plays out. It is not very unique in these aspects, but more of a feel-good (and bad) slice of life game. I would've liked the story a little bit differently, but that is entirely subjective. The people behind this game wanted to tell a specific story and they achieved that and baked a simple delicious dessert. But I guess these kind of games are just not my cup of tea.\n\nI would've enjoyed a different portrayal in relationships, puzzles that don't give you the feeling of a fight between two people, but cooperation and problem-solving. It is a sad and stereotypical route to take: people getting bored of each other very soon after dating, fighting and growing distant. I would've loved a twist on this! Where are my healthy relationships of two people that actually like each other? People growing because of their love to their partner. Partners that don't give in to the clich\u00e9 of being bored of each other, but finding excitement themselves.\nBut those are very high expectations fueled by wishful thinking! And I understand that this is not the story they wanted to tell: there are at least as many stories as people in this world.\n\nSo, after all, I can recommend this game. If you are hesitant, wait for a sale perhaps. But if you love the idea of this game and are prepared to put your head casually into it, go off. It is quite enjoyable and has nice symbolistic value. My criticism could be even taken as a plus, because the game enabled me to reflect on different relationship dynamics, which is the selling point of this game for me.", "timestamp_created": 1689933425, "timestamp_updated": 1690115383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142470948": {"recommendationid": "142470948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279205692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1689456824}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que decir?

The visual storytelling and representation of themes and motives is really well done. I particularly liked how a dialogue bubbles are jigsaw puzzles that get easier to solve, the more you know someone. Not all the interactions are great, the game constantly switches up horizontal and vertical scrolling and sometimes you don't scroll at all. Sometimes I had no idea what to do, but the game solved itself anyway. I would have liked more gameplay elements that reinforce what the characters are going through. The whole thing can be completed in 30 minutes, no idea how people spend hours with this game.\n\nNow the main issue is, this is the most generic, unoriginal story about a couple basically ever. Unfortunately, once you realize the story is as deep as a puddle, it becomes incredibly boring too. The visuals and animations are lovely, but when there is zero substance behind anything, I don't see any point in learning about the protagonist. The last half of the \"game\" turns into a total slog. \n\nI am sorry, just watch any decent A24 movie, the stories in those films about relationships are infinitely more compelling than this clich\u00e9 dump. I would say, the game paints a really unhealthy and backwards picture of relationships and self-fulfillment. The story basically says that the honeymoon phase is the only good part of a relationship and once it becomes the norm, it's no longer worthwhile. And then randomly picking up a hobby that you did as 6 year old is totally going to fill your life with wonder and creativity, even though you have zero practical skills in the field. This was probably written by a teenager or someone with a really immature look on life. Truth is, life is messy, work is hard, social circles are not easy, you can't just view things through a rose colored glass. \n\nThe more I think about this the more I dislike this story.

Florence is a short product with a [u]BIG[/u] message! \n\n[h1]Non-TLDR[/h1]\nFlorence (Flo in short) is developed by Mountains and published by Annapurna Interactive. The PC version was released on Feb 13 2020. It is also On: iPhone/iPad, Switch. As of this writing, Metacritic (https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/florence) shows:\n[list]\n    [*]An average user score of 6.7 from 44 ratings\n[/list]\n\nIf you love visual novels or story rich games, should you try this? Definitely a yes.\n\n[h1]Controls, Audio, Visuals, Story[/h1]\nVisuals: Simple and beautiful. It looks like its hand drawn. +1 to the visual team.\n\nAudio: The music in this game is beautiful. +1 to the audio team.\n\nControls: mouse clicks +1 to the devs. I will elaborate more under mechanics.\n\nStory: On the surface, this may seem insignificant, obviously the story focuses on the main protagonist's life [u]but[/u] it also tries to cover some life/social issues in a very small format. Good work story telling team. + 1 to the writing team\n\n[h1]Mechanics[/h1]\nFlo comes with a chapter saving system! it has confirmation button to move to the next screen! and you can also \"skip\" end credits!\n\nMany game studios overlook at this sort of design choices and over the time, i find myself repeating the same thing over and over again whenever i submit my writing on visual novel games. Emphasizing how important it is to have these because it affects replay-ability. and Flo delivered it. From a small game studio that nobody has heard of. so kudos to the devs.\n\nThroughout the game, Flo has small, simple puzzles. It does not infuriate you and does not break the immersion. It lets you enjoy Florence's day to day activities.\n\nThe best part of the game? is the controls. just a simple mouse to click and drag. no finger entanglement crap going on here. I can see the devs really tried to deliver a \"seems less\" gaming experience with all this choice of design. Great work! \n\n\n[h1]My personal thoughts/My Summary[/h1]\nFlorence to me is like a tiny version of Life is strange. The hand art is amazing and coupled with the amazing music, you'll feel relaxed and you'll find yourself progressing through florence's daily day to day easily. It is a very short game but that doesnt mean it doesnt offer much. Remember i said its like a tiny version of Life is strange?

"language": "english", "review": "Florence is a short point and click puzzle game by Annapurna Interactive. This game can make you feel amazed about how the mechanics alone can bring you into an atmosphere of happiness.\n\nYou play as Florence Yeoh, a adult  woman who works as an accountant. Of course, with the short time provided by this game, the selling point of this game is the gameplay and story. The gameplay will show you how every day Florence passes its time, from waking up to the end of the day. You will play as yourself in this game, following all her routines like work, liking social media posts etc.\n\nThe story will focus on how bored Florence is with her life. She had no friends, and the only one she called was her mother. Every day feels the same way until she meets someone in the park. That person played a beautiful melody on his cello. That day would start a new life for Florence Yeoh because now she has a boyfriend.\n\nThere are no major flaws in this game, expect short gameplay. I just finished the game for 1 hour and all achievements are done. Playing this again can bring back the enchanting feel again. That's obvious since it's a linear story game.\n\nEven though the gameplay is short, this game offers many chapters that you can play and each chapter has its own unique gameplay. The story pacing is impeccable and I could feel the emotions going through the gameplay itself, a truly amazing experience.\n\nI think it's worth your money, even if you've never played a point and click game before. This game is not difficult at all and I think everyone can enjoy it. Once again I recommend this game to anyone who is tired of all the AAA games that have the same concept and wants to experience something better.\n", "timestamp_created": 1688924133, "timestamp_updated": 1688924133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141688846": {"recommendationid": "141688846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067405757", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1688918981}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and also great lesson about life.

[/h2]\n\nIn the game, you laugh, cry, get stressed, and when you are tired of the daily bad news, you can take refuge in it for a short time. Of course, this good feeling does not last long, but for these few minutes, your mind will be filled with positive energy.\n\nThe game has everything together. As much as it depicts the beauties of love in the most pleasant way possible, it also talks about problems. A real life that may be a little far from the current reality, but it has sweet and difficult moments that many of us may experience in every second.\n\nFlorence narrates the story of a girl who is drowned in everyday life. He goes to work every day, looks at his Instagram from time to time, watches TV, and sometimes talks to his mother on the phone. However, an incident gives a different color to his life.\n\nWe see very few writings in the game and there is no dialogue at all. Instead, the creator has used music, coloring and puzzles to narrate his creation. From the very beginning, when you enter the menu, the game will enchant you with its music, and this feeling will be maintained until the end.\n\nDepending on what happens, you hear a different piece of music and these pieces show parts of the characters' emotions. Graphics have the same task in the first place. The change of colors and the intelligent movement of a certain spectrum, well depict the current world of Florence and the atmosphere that dominates her life at every moment.\n\nFlorence does not have an engaging gameplay, the game was presented as an interactive story from the very beginning, and therefore, like other titles of this genre, all you have to do is a few simple clicks or changing some objects.\n\nHowever, these small movements are not only for the interaction of the player with the game, and the developer has put a part of the story of the title on them. In Florence, everything is at the service of the story, and the creator showed the emotions of his world in ways different from what we have known so far.\n\nIn the end Florence is worth a try. A pleasant and short experience that can make you feel better.", "timestamp_created": 1688667139, "timestamp_updated": 1696141694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621136724948883057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141462258": {"recommendationid": "141462258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291974203", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1688445937}, "language": "english", "review": "my emotions are a mess", "timestamp_created": 1688663227, "timestamp_updated": 1688663227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612676024436950684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141453365": {"recommendationid": "141453365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410951438", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1688653866}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, cute experience where you just let the story happen while you relax and interact a bit.

Similarly when an argument starts, the pieces become sharper, adding to the tone.\n\nOverall, the gameplay was perfect for the type of game. \n\nThe sound design was also perfect, and even after the game completed I kept it open to listen to one particular piece which was just so beautiful (and in a perfect loop for anyone else like me just wants to chill to it for a while). It really added to the story and the emotions in certain scenes.\n\n\nIn terms of the story, it\u2019s on the shorter side, with a full play through taking around 30-40 minutes. Despite that, it\u2019s packed with a rollercoaster of emotions, and really was a perfect length to tell the story it did. I only mention the length in case it influences someone\u2019s decision on what price point is worth it. \n\nA cleanup of achievements afterwards doesn\u2019t take long, for anyone interested in that - chapter select lets you jump straight to the scene with the achievement you missed and you can fly through them quickly and just enjoy the story without worrying on your first play through.

And in chapter 9 when they have an arguement their speech bubbles start to get sharper connection points instead of the round ones before.\n\nAnd how when they fight in chapter 14 as they sleep their puzzle pieces dont fit each other. Little things like that, that tell the story really made me so pleased with this game.

It captivates you into a completely different world and a person\u2019s life and sometimes you just need to get away from your own life to jump into someone else\u2019s and learn something. \n\nIt may not look like it at first glance, but the story is original and raw. It\u2019s not common to see breakups reflected in a positive light like it is in Florence. I love that it lets you engage in all the negativity, the heartbreak, the pain and the healing process to be able to process and understand the positivity of it. No, not everyone is going to become extremely successful in an infamously non-lucrative field, and that wasn\u2019t the point of the story at all. The point is that her relationship, despite being broken, changed her for the better. It taught her to self-reflect, learn about herself, take risks, and to love herself enough to gather the courage to do something she loves. It is often underestimated how these little choices can change your life and I love that this is demonstrated through a heartbreak she had. A relationship and heartbreak can leave you loving yourself more and have a stronger sense of who you are. That\u2019s the lesson here. \n\nThrough her investing in herself, she was able to get over her heartbreak. She looks at a photo of them in the end, when her life is going so well that she built all by herself, and she smiles. She smiles because she learned to move on through loving herself. Not enough people do that. \n\nThe game is very short, under an hour, but it\u2019s concise and it hits all the points it was trying to make. It told the story it needed to. It didn\u2019t have to break down every single detail and situation. I actually liked how vague it can be because it leaves you to consider other lives, feelings, and thoughts on your own. You don\u2019t need to get bogged down in details and get stuck in the mindset of \u201cX is mad because Y therefore do not do Y.\u201d People and life are a lot more complex than that. \n\nThis is the longest review I\u2019ve ever written for a game and the most thought I\u2019ve ever put into a game and it\u2019s only 45 minutes long.

It's also available on mobile, but the PC version has a gallery of early art and concepts (which you should only view AFTER completing the story).", "timestamp_created": 1680254280, "timestamp_updated": 1680254280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135758107": {"recommendationid": "135758107", "author": {"steamid": "76561199362444638", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1691128487}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD GAME FOR WHEN U BORED", "timestamp_created": 1680203495, "timestamp_updated": 1680203495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466304361820220947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135718052": {"recommendationid": "135718052", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231568895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1680147395}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely an amazing game.

It's heavily story driven with minimal point-and-click gameplay. Some of the gameplay sections could be described as puzzle like, but nothing is challenging. Limited and simple though this gameplay is, it is cleverly implemented at various points, such as a section where an argument is taking place and you must fill the speech bubble with various shapes. These shapes start as simple puzzle pieces, but as the conversation progresses to argument, the pieces become jagged and sharp and the speed increases. I enjoyed reflecting on how the gameplay drove home the narrative in place of dialogue. If you like short, artsy, narrative driven games, I recommend it. It can be beaten in under an hour, but it's clear this was a passion project for the small dev team.

I never really review games but I saw a lot of misinterpretation for this game.\n\nIf you're worried this game tells you to throw away valuable relationships just because you want to follow your dreams, don't worry. Because it doesn't tell you that. This game is about what it means to progress through life and how even your failures, including failed relationships, can become a valuable resource that helps you grow as an individual. It also demonstrates a very important piece of life advice: The circumstances in your life are always bound to change, and the more you grow, the more you outgrow certain things. Or you may grow into new things. \n\nThe game is short but the message the game sends is quite strong. Whether it is worth five dollars, maybe I would just wait until it's on sale because of the length and simple mechanics. Great art style, but the game itself feel more suited for mobile platforms (I believe this is on the app store). Watch a YouTuber play through it if you feel unsure.

[th]Rating[/th]\n\t[th]Description[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay Loop[/td]\n        [td]4[/td]\n\t[td]You've likely heard of this game because of the \"puzzle mechanic\" haven't you? If you don't know what it is, play it without knowing! I talk about it in the next section, if you're already familiar. Aside from that, there's simple gameplay mechanics the game uses to tell its sweet and simple story. I do think they could've been slightly more creative within the same mechanics itself, and I elaborate it later - but I overall loved the things they ended up doing. It's a VERY short game, I'd be surprised if someone doesn't finish it in one sitting. It has some unique ideas on how it tells it's simple story through the interactive medium - and if you're someone who's into that, you should certainly give it a shot.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Narrative[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n\t[td]The story is as simple as they come. And that's not a bad thing at all. It follows [spoiler]the story of Florence through her monotonous life, which is broken when she meets someone. We follow wholesome moments as both of them grow as individuals, grow as a couple, and eventually grow apart. It's a simple premise, made interesting by how it uses mechanics to convey certain ideas. My favourite example is when you both start talking, the puzzles that comprise the dialogue bubbles are more complex and harder, but as the conversation eases up, so do the puzzles. Such a simple yet fantastic way of conveying that! It does get overused slightly IMO and wish they'd just gone with the \"less is more\" rule on that one, using it only on the imp bits. My main issue is that the story doesn't seem to have a strong takeaway or something in its ending that hits you with something impactful. Like okay, they break up and she's living alone now, so what? What else could they have done? Well, there's this bit when he's moving in with you where you're allowed to take some stuff off your shelves to make space for his stuff. And then when you break up it comes back as you clear those shelves. I was VERY much expecting this to come into play in the ending, because a normal player would 100% forget to clear at least ONE of the guy's items, right? And then Florence spots it, and just longingly thinks back on her great experience and how it changed her for the better, and how people in your life will always leave traces of themselves in your life, however temporary. Would've been such an amazing bit to end in, and factor in its own gameplay mechanics for it. Another thing I wished they'd done was do away with all \"text\". There was no dialogue, which is great - but it didn't need chapters or text to show things either. Would've been so unique to have a game tell its story without the use of any words at all.[/spoiler] So yeah, I've a lot of appreciation for what this game does, but little changes here and there could've elevated it to another level![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Visuals[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n\t[td]The game's obviously pretty aff. Has a very distinct, simple art style.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mechanics[/td]\n        [td]5[/td]\n\t[td]I enjoyed the puzzle mechanic ofc, which seems to be the first thing people talk about when speaking of the game as well. Aside from that, it was simple stuff like clicking, scrolling, dragging and dropping. But again, it's just as much about how you use it eg. basic minigames to establish monotony in her life. Like how I said the cupboard arranging bit could've been used to hit home a message so strongly![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Challenge[/td]\n        [td]4[/td]\n\t[td]There isn't much of a challenge the game offers, and I don't mean just in terms of \"video game challenge\" - but simply understanding/interpreting its themes and ideas. It's a pretty straightforward story. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Variety[/td]\n        [td]5[/td]\n\t[td]Given the length, the game sure tries to fit in some variety in conveying its themes and ideas. I do think they tend to get repetitive after a while and wish they'd put in a couple more inventive ideas in there. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mapping[/td]\n        [td]-[/td]\n\t[td]-[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n\t[td]The music is pleasant and sets the tone that it's going for, for sure. However, it wasn't that striking or memorable to me, like I can't think of any tunes as of now. Granted, that's not the only thing video game music is chalked up to do, but it was also pretty homogenous throughout the length and IMO some moments could've been accentuated with even better use of music. Overall, pretty good though. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Interface[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n\t[td]The game's not great on a controller. I'd def recommend playing this on mouse, and oddly - on touchscreen? It seems to be made for that, actually. Aside from that, the interface is pretty and def does what it needs to. As I said above though, I kinda wish the whole chapter concept wasn't there.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Pricing & Performance[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n\t[td]I'd recommend picking this up on sale. The length might be a problem for some people, but I don't mind a short length.

Of particular note is how Florence conveys the way conversation feels, whether awkward, or sharp and confrontational.\nIt's a lovely idea what jigsaws can convey with how easily they fit together.\n\nThe painting mechanic, which is closely tied to dreams, I find interesting in how it seemingly sets up, pays off, and then is subverted.\n\nIt's a nice touch how one of the things you put together early on re-appears a number of times over the game.\n\nPicked up on sale, storytelling with jigsaws has been a nice gentle experience to have at the end of the day.", "timestamp_created": 1677267916, "timestamp_updated": 1677269355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133513047": {"recommendationid": "133513047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168593979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1678144515}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Llor\u00e9", "timestamp_created": 1677262666, "timestamp_updated": 1677262666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133511918": {"recommendationid": "133511918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124716782", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1677261413}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this on sale because I was influenced by a tiktok.

Al igual que ese juego aqu\u00ed vemos la historia de una joven mujer llamada \u201cFlorence\u201d; vemos su d\u00eda a d\u00eda, sus aspiraciones y sus sue\u00f1os contado a trav\u00e9s de minijuegos que tambi\u00e9n simulan conceptos relacionables. \n\nA diferencia de Laura\u00b4s Story, aqu\u00ed no hay una relaci\u00f3n destructiva de la cual no sabemos si correr, llorar o espantarnos. Aqu\u00ed solo hay lo que existe en una relaci\u00f3n promedio: conocer a alguien, salir con ese alguien y empezar una relaci\u00f3n con esa persona. Y al igual que cuando se comienza una relaci\u00f3n, aqu\u00ed van a haber cambios.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 clase de cambios? Bueno, ese depender\u00e1 de c\u00f3mo lo experimentes t\u00fa. \n\nEn t\u00e9rminos simples: crecer duele, relacionarse duele y aprender a dejar a ir a las personas tambi\u00e9n duele. Pero esto no significa que sea algo malo.\n\nAl igual que Florencia, aprender a dejar ir no tiene porque ser malo y algunas veces las relaciones cambian.\nNo es bueno, ni malo; solo es.\n\nTu, jugador/a, vas a ver el crecimiento de Florencia. C\u00f3mo lo experimentes, depender\u00e1 de ti y s\u00f3lo de ti. \n\nPara concluir, Florence es un juego diferente a los convencionales juegos \u201cPoint & Click\u201d, los desarrolladores claramente ten\u00edan una visi\u00f3n acerca de su juego y, en mi opini\u00f3n, la lograron plasmar de manera fiel a su idea original (la galer\u00eda de arte nos da una muestra clara de ello). \n\nPese a su duraci\u00f3n, Florence logra dejar una huella en aquellos que se atrevan a darle una oportunidad.\nDas\u00e9la.\n", "timestamp_created": 1671499412, "timestamp_updated": 1671499412,

The style of hand-painted art, the music following the ups and downs of the plot, the ingenious interaction of the design, and the hidden small details are all amazing!\n\nHere are some small details worth remembering in the game:\n\n\u2460 Three time turntables\nMy childhood friends and grown up classmates gradually left and went their separate ways. When they were young and ignorant in love, they gradually returned to a lonely life\n\n\u2461 Dialogue fragments between male and female leaders\nMen and women have different forms of interaction when they meet, know, fall in love, know each other, and even quarrel.\nWhen we meet each other, there are many pieces, small pieces and miscellaneous pieces. We have been busy for a long time, so we can say a word. When we slowly transition to love and familiarity, the pieces of dialogue will be very simple and clear. Finally, when we get together, we need to put together two pieces of pieces at the same time, which also means that love needs to go in both directions. In addition, the game also uses bright red and more sharp and strange dialogue fragments as the dialogue performance when two people quarrel.\n\n\u2462 In the memory, the dream that the male master said freely and the dream that the female master wiped out in the mirror when he was a child may have forgotten.\n\n\u2463 It is gradually pressed under the sundries, and the paint tray is given by the man.\n\n\u2464 Let go chapter can choose to stay, but can not save the outcome.\n\n\u2465 Open the carton, add the owner's items at home/clean up the traces left by the owner, and close the carton.\n\n\u2466 The female owner started again, and once again gathered up the things and closed the cardboard box before the photo with the male owner.\n\nThere are a lot of details in the game. The whole process ended in half an hour. The time is a little short. Many fragments have been forgotten when writing the evaluation, but it still left me a lot of deep impression. I think that although this work generally tells a love story, it still shows us more about the life attitude of the female owner. After all, love is not the whole of life.\n\nPerhaps for individuals, family members, lovers, brothers and friends will all become our passers-by. Your family will grow old, and you will form a new family; Lovers and friends will leave, and you can also find another one or a group. Except for ourselves, everyone will only accompany us for a period of time in a certain stage of our life. As time goes by, they will gradually go away for various reasons. Not to mention three lives and three lives, it is a lifetime. Half life and half life may also be an extravagant hope.\n\nJust like the female leader was relieved when she finally saw the photo taken with the male leader, there was a good time in the years of moving forward together, and there was nothing to regret. As for the future, of course, the most important thing is to improve yourself. The more things you will know, the more you will feel resonance. Meeting more people will no longer make them easy passers-by.\n\nSimple and clear hand-painted painting style, non conversational narrative style, accompanied by melodious music, can make me calm down, put aside all trivial matters, and taste this work carefully. Thank you for making me have a good morning!\n\nPs: When making achievements, I found that there was a scene of quarreling with the male leader, so I could not talk. It's very interesting that whoever quarrels with a lot of words and loud voice will have to coax the other party afterwards. qwq", "timestamp_created": 1670653214, "timestamp_updated": 1671447413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128205766": {"recommendationid": "128205766", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053378616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1670563810}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me really emotional, I feel like anyone who is a person of color would really appreciate this game.

What's with Annapurna's love-relationship with social injustice? In Florence, we are basically treated with a story of a young woman's journey to self-love, after a loving relationship that unfortunately \"just didn't work\". Coupled with amazing visuals and music depicting Singapore, it's not hard for the game to manipulate emotions from us. The game, like in Edith Finch, KNOWS the underlying problems in its story. \n\nFlorence's mom, like so many parents not just in Singapore, disapproves of her interest in painting and Florence ends up with a brain-dead desk job working on spreadsheets. She fell in love with a cellist busker - Florence's life sparked once again. Here's the catch: Florence is Chinese, and the bf, Krish is Indian. The subtle racial divide is forever present, THE GAME DELIBERATELY SHOWS THIS TO YOU: Florence meets and is welcomed by Krish's big Indian family, and his fun friends. However, Krish never had a happy moment with Florence's mom; it is even implied that the mom never knew about Krish at all (in mom's phone call, Florence can still say to mom \"not to look for a boyfriend for me\"). Still, race is not the issue the caused the love to fall apart - not directly anyway.\n\nThe game implies that Florence fell in love with the music more than the musician. This is not the biggest sin in the world, love can grow over time, after all. Krish, through Florence' encouragement, finally enrolled in the prestigious Academy of Music to become the next Yo-Yo Ma. That means full-time study for Krish, and is now dependent on Florence financially. Krish is also supportive of Florence's art - gifting her a watercolour set (!?you give that to a 25-y.o. woman!?) and encourages her to paint. However, the financial strain catches up with the couple; Florence once again has no time for her painting in order to work. She also has no time for Krish, who himself is dedicated full-time in his schooling. Florence is unhappy once again, and they finally broke up. TALE AS OLD AS TIME.\n\nSo how will Annapurna end Florence's story? Why, through magical crescendo, of course - which they perfected in Edith Finch. Florence, armed with her watercolour set, discovers that she is a painting prodigy. Chinese mom finally came to her senses and is now supportive of her, now that her talents can be made into a business. Familial love triumphs all, Florence is happy and her watercolour paintings are being exhibited with obviously rich patrons. So how about the Indian guy who presumably is still toiling at the Academy? Nope, no mention of him again, now that Florence essentially won the Race Lottery. \n\nSo what does Annapurna teach us, kids?

Its a shows the search for happiness and how bumpy life can be sometimes.\n\nGraphics: The artwork of this game is simplistic. It allows you to absorb the story being told and really engage with whats being shown to you. It allows you to suck up every last detail and spares you time to just soak it in when you need it.\n\nGameplay: Much like the artwork of this game, the gameplay stays simplistic. There is absolutely nothing to subtract from the experience. You control the speed that the story play out and please take it as chilled out as you want. Want to go fast? feel free but it'll only detract from your experience. Want to just sit back and let the music take you away? yes... yes you do!\n\nAudio: The music that plays throughout the game will be music i listen to for some time to come. Its simply beautiful. Every single moment. Please just play it even if you only do it for the calming songs that get sprinkled throughout. The game lets the music set the tone and lets the players mind do the rest of the work to make you just... feel something. I believe everyone's life experiences and feelings that come from the songs will drastically change your emotions that occur during the story and effect the time you have during its short run.\n\nAudience: The type of person that would want to play this is someone who wants to just grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and just... let go.\n\nPC Requirements: You can play on a potato if you want but bring some damn headphones with you cause it'll only make the experience better for you.\n\nDifficulty: Only difficulty i see is from this is the difficulty of recovering after such a wonderful experience.\n\nGrind: If you find a grind in-game let me know cause i didn't find any but i have had to start grinding therapy sessions after finishing it and realising i wont be able to play it again for the first time.\n\nStory: The story is a short and sweet section of girls life who goes by the name Florence Yeoh. You will be introduced to Krish and the way you will feel begins from that. Enjoy.\n\nGame Time: I finished in roughly 45 minutes but play time will vary because i did sit at multiple sections to listen to the music, just for a second.

It's not in my top ten list but has still managed to leave an impression. \n\nPros: Lovely soundtrack, an ending I didn't expect but was certainly pleased with, and I really appreciated how the way you're prompted to engage with the gameplay adds emphasis to how the lead characters are feeling, particularly when they're in conversation with each other. \n\nCons: The gameplay itself. It feels like a walking simulator without being one. What I mean by that is that you're prompted to do certain repetitive tasks such as tapping buttons or moving the mouse so Florence brushes her teeth in order to go with what's happening on screen with little to no meaningful choice.

Eso s\u00ed, va haciendo pausas para darle m\u00e1s hincapi\u00e9 a las escenas m\u00e1s importantes.\n\nHistoria\nUna historia bastante t\u00edpica pero es contada desde un punto de vista en el que casi seguro que todos nos hemos visto reflejados en alg\u00fan momento de nuestras vidas. Pero lo muestra con un formato de videojuegos que no podemos dejar de parar e interactuar con cada escena que nos va mostrando.\n\nGameplay\nComo ya he dicho el estilo de juego es una sucesi\u00f3n de cap\u00edtulos hechos con minijuegos que nos har\u00e1n ir interactuando con la historia para hacernos part\u00edcipes de cada acci\u00f3n que realicemos.\n\nValor \nEs un juego r\u00e1pido de pasar, pero est\u00e1 bien cuidado con muchos detalles tan bien pensados que no te lo esperas.

For that alone, I'll give it a positive note.\n\nNow spoilers regarding the story:\n\nI was looking forward to experiencing the story of a hopeful, dreamy-eyed girl, possibly witnessing a cute romance. What it has left me with was a feeling of crushing failure and sadness. Poor girl, grasping at the need to fulfill her life with something meaningful. Something that could be called occupational therapy - making art. \nA girl focuses her time on something bringing her serenity and even money and recognition. While standing alone in her room, smiling to the memory of a nice man who brought her inspiration, yet is no longer in her life. What a bitter, sad story about realising your faults and healing some bonds (with mom), while losing - perhaps forever - others (I can't imagine the family of her boyfriend would still be in touch with her).\nDespite all the bright colors and pleasant music, I can't bring myself to play again. It's not a sweet story with a happy ending. The sweetness all the love and compationship the two people had makes it that more tearful, when it's cut short. Perhaps it will speak to some younger people with a full life ahead of them... For me personally it lacks the positivity I was looking for. \nMaybe make a sequel, where these two mature and make up? Realise they indeed can bring out the best in one another?", "timestamp_created": 1666723969, "timestamp_updated": 1666723969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124283156": {"recommendationid": "124283156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058506867", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1666543386}, "language": "english", "review": "Best slideshow gameplay ever created \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1666543457, "timestamp_updated": 1666543457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124243105": {"recommendationid": "124243105", "author": {"steamid": "76561199080712193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1676853318}, "language": "spanish", "review": "DESTROZA MENTES \ud83d\ude2d", "timestamp_created": 1666479998, "timestamp_updated": 1666479998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124229367": {"recommendationid": "124229367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173051837", "num_games_owned": 1092, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1666461053}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short, but beautiful.", "timestamp_created": 1666461132, "timestamp_updated": 1666461132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124224863": {"recommendationid": "124224863", "author": {"steamid": "76561199326498755", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1666455458}, "language": "english", "review": "really pog game, loved it <3333", "timestamp_created": 1666455744, "timestamp_updated": 1666455744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124175345": {"recommendationid": "124175345", "author": {"steamid": "76561199104022978", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1666380560}, "language": "english", "review": "WHY AM I CRYING.

I played, I cried, I shared it with my boyfriend because I knew he'd love the way the game was executed. He played and was also really touched by it, and I can even see it right now that he had marked this game on his wish list. The game stuck with me after playing for quite a long time, because certain parts felt familiar...in a bad way. But I refused to recognise that maybe my relationship wasn't going anywhere. Fast forward a bit, found out my boyfriend of 5 years whom I shared the game with was being unfaithful to me, with my best friend of 13 years. The painful ordeal of breaking up dragged on for a month and I had to witness a lot of ugliness. Then a ton of shitty things happened afterwards. Recently opening up my Steam after almost a year of not daring to touch it brought back a lot of emotions. I saw this game, listened to the familiar music and kind of just broke down and cried. It brought back memories of me playing it the very first time, of me sharing it with my ex-boyfriend, and of the past in general. It's still an amazing game, I want to replay it again once everything hurts a bit less, hopefully to remind myself that things will be better for me too in due time, just like in the game. It's a very beautiful and well made game, give it a try, it's worth your time. (Set. 7th 2022)\nUPDATE: It's almost a year since I posted the original review, and a bit more than 1.5  years since my breakup. I has sunken into severe depression after what happened, details aren't necessary but I was deeply let down by my significant other, my best friend, and my family. The blow was devastating, I didn't think I could ever pick up the pieces of myself and recover to a state that I could continue to live with. Life felt pointless. Somehow I still struggled on, even though days blurred together, even though I had nothing to look forward to tomorrow, I still waited for the next day. I'm happy to say that it was worth it. Recently, after 1.5 years I'm finally starting to feel better. I'm finally able to accept what took place and the way it's changed my life. I still struggle with a lot of stuff but I'm laughing again, I'm listening to music again, things bring me joy again, and however trivial the reason may be, there is a point to life again. I remembered this game and I came back and played it again today. I once again struggled a lot with the chapter about moving on, just like in real life. And I felt uneasy during the honeymoon stages of the game, since I already knew how it would end. Interestingly enough, this is why I've not dated, made friends or had much social interaction since. My faith in relationships and friendships did not recover, and a part of me don't think it ever will, but I look forward to the day where life proves me wrong. Just like in the game my relationship with my mother improved, a happy coincidence! I've picked back up cooking once again, and it's brought me a lot of joy. Although unlike Michelle, I have no plans of turning my hobby into a job! xD I'm in a much better place right now, and I look forward to replaying the game in a few years to see how it makes me feel then. It's still an excellent game that I recommend anyone and everyone to play.

It fits though, and everything you do make sense with what is happening in the scenes.\n\nThe art, music and overall feeling is where the meat is, and it's done wonderfully. It looks great and has a lot of style. The story is quite predictable but told nicely and with a lot of love. The visual style and effects make the fact that you do very little still feel good and complements the story. Like the puzzle pieces when structuring dialogues which reflects the mood of the conversations. Soft and round when happy and sharper and pointy when angry. Small details like that are abundant and impressed me quite a few times.\n\nAll in all, it's very short and semi-self-playing but told well enough.

Each animated vignette presents lovely visuals with vibrant colors and a preeminent soundtrack that strongly enlivens these mini chapters.\n\nScenes typically move forward like a storybook by scrolling down. Sometimes up. Some side-swiping mouse interactions felt less responsive, a reminder that this title was initially designed with a touch interface in mind.\n\nOtherwise, the player must sort through uncommonly simple mini games that present an interesting collection of ideas but rarely evolve into significant interactions. Most of them represent everyday moments, while some shape more meaningful branching points in Florence's life that ultimately reveal her true self.\n\nSimulate conversations without words using reconstructed speech bubbles. Shake life into Polaroids. Solve elementary math equations. Float up to catch musical notes. Bring images into focus after a blur. There many more such segments that last a few seconds each. All interactions appear designed for young children in their ultra-simplicity.\n\nFlorence does not eat the crusts of her toast or pizza. She tags social media likes on her work commute. She savors sushi while watching TV. She works spreadsheets but, ultimately, she desires to earn a living selling kaleidoscopic pastel paintings instead. She could be anyone.\n\nThis is a story about ordinary life, sadly accurate and probably relatable to most average people on different levels, without a Hollywood happy ending or any profound impact. Sympathetic, honest, common. It stands out compared to the average landscape of video game history but still has no replay value outside of achievements.\n\nInconsequential phone conversations with Florence's mother where choices don't matter make her relationship with mum feel utterly pointless. Same with how you choose items to keep or put in a box when moving together with Krish, or any of the linear actions presented, really.\n\nI expected more feels given the significant amount of praise received by this title on multiple platforms. Sort of bittersweet with a somewhat positive message to keep chasing your dreams but it's all a bit too ordinary. There were some good moments, like the unmatched and drifting puzzle pieces as a metaphor for difficult conversations, where no one wins the argument.\n\nExtremely short, completed under 1hr (I played it twice several months apart only to see if it would resonate more). I love concise experiences, but this is excessively condensed, as you fast forward through Florence's life with barely enough time to get emotionally invested in anything or anyone.\n\nLike the game itself, this is a bittersweet recommendation that barely passes the mark.\n\n[h1]Positive[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Lovely visuals with vibrant colors\n[*] Preeminent soundtrack strongly enlivens animated vignettes\n[*] Bittersweet but positive message\n[*] Several relatable everyday scenes\n[*] Sympathetic and honest\n[*] Includes early concept art gallery\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Negative[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Ultra simple mini games fall flat\n[*] Every single activity is inconsequential\n[*] Florence's life relationships feel pointless\n[*] Low effort to convert touch-controls for mouse interactions\n[*] Extremely short\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1660446095, "timestamp_updated": 1660446095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120564209": {"recommendationid": "120564209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094204545", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1693087054}, "language": "english", "review": "u wanna listen to the best OST while going thru a breakdown for an hour ?", "timestamp_created": 1660406362, "timestamp_updated": 1660406362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120557297": {"recommendationid": "120557297", "author": {"steamid": "76561199373167461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1660397692}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me ha recordado mucho a unpacking, por la forma de contar la historia a trav\u00e9s de los objetos y los colores, es una experiencia preciosa, ya que la mec\u00e1nica y la m\u00fasica hacen brillar al apartado art\u00edstico, y todo en conjunto hace que sientas  que est\u00e1s viendo una pel\u00edcula en la que puedes participar.", "timestamp_created": 1660397888, "timestamp_updated": 1660397888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120543438": {"recommendationid": "120543438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353839692", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1660376568}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Por la chucha, por qu\u00e9 son tan buenos los juegos de Annapurna.", "timestamp_created": 1660376629, "timestamp_updated": 1660376629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120490608": {"recommendationid": "120490608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154285034", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1660259651}, "language": "english", "review": "i thought it might have more emotional weight. i didnt find it very affecting. some interesting storytelling techniques and effective game design but the story just wasn't particularly compelling. id say its just not worth the money unless its on sale and you like that kind of thing.", "timestamp_created": 1660302064, "timestamp_updated": 1660302064, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543340384960174561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120410658": {"recommendationid": "120410658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354175696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1660080363}, "language": "english", "review": "Florence is a little gem.

In terms of its storytelling, much of the game\u2019s narrative will feel relatable, particularly to young women who remember restricting parts of themselves to make a partner more comfortable, or who reminisce on ignored early warning signs with partners long gone.\n\nWhile the story is short, and not necessarily breaking new ground for romance narratives, what makes Florence special is the intuitive, accessible, and beautifully conceptualized ways that gameplay is used to replicate the feel of many moments in Florence\u2019s relationship journey. The plot itself may be simple, but the ways you interact with story beats really help to emotionally draw the player into feeling the emotions on display without requiring characters to outright say how they feel.\n\nA wonderful example of this is the way conversations in the game are often represented by touch screen puzzle speech bubbles, where the player has to take their time slowly putting together the next sentence to be said, awkwardly struggling to make the conversation flow. As the couple gets more comfortable with each other, the puzzles are made of fewer and fewer pieces, flowing more quickly and requiring less thought and care. Arguments are far too easy, with insults thrown out without any assembly required, and apologies are perhaps some of the most difficult to piece together.\n\nFlorence is a short and simple game, but one full to the brim with heart and charm. It\u2019s only a couple of dollars, but it\u2019s well worth taking half an hour to stick on some headphones, find a quiet space alone, and sitting to play through it in a single sitting\n\nGame Play\ud83c\udfae 8/10\nGraphic \ud83d\udc40     8/10\nMusic\ud83c\udfbc         10/10\n\nhttps://www.syfy.com/\n", "timestamp_created": 1660148605, "timestamp_updated": 1660148605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571428537368774414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120376748": {"recommendationid": "120376748", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090915443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1660022892}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute storyline, love the self acceptance", "timestamp_created": 1660113964, "timestamp_updated": 1660113964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120338747": {"recommendationid": "120338747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088850405", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1666545063}, "language": "english", "review": "Wholesome and real", "timestamp_created": 1660057879, "timestamp_updated": 1660057879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120338593": {"recommendationid": "120338593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096891183", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1660057334}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and quick game", "timestamp_created": 1660057714, "timestamp_updated": 1660057714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120274382": {"recommendationid": "120274382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170185883", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1659960964}, "language": "english", "review": "Slice of life as a genre is the most common choice for everyone of us. It doesn't matter if we talk about literature and simultaneously about movies or games. Many of us are curious about certain challenges, feelings, situations, which is why probably there is never ending wave of stories created for viewers, readers and every gamer. \n\nAlso, for self-care, comforting and balancing, we seek among fictional stories for something that can resemble our experiences, and through seeing the fictional resemblance of them, it might help us in cooping with those. In case of \"Florence\" all of us might admit, that this game has sort of therapeutic character and show us shine and darkness behind life experiences. \n\nAs we follow the story of a protagonist-girl exposed to dreams, goals, while also looses and heartbreaking moments, we might find in each part of it something very likely as our own experiences. Simple puzzle elements of the game, scrolling, painting, uncovering the pictures or little bit of self-choice thing - are very well cooping with each chapter and overall design. \n\n\"Florence\" does not force on you being fast; this is that sort of a game, which perfectly suits a players for which peaceful moment and casual games are what they are seeking for.

The edges of the dialogue puzzles getting sharper when Florence is angry and the dialogue puzzle getting progressively easier as Florence and Krish get more comfortable is so beautiful.  \n\nIt has got its ups and downs, I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1659891526, "timestamp_updated": 1659898218, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551159381866455078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120215624": {"recommendationid": "120215624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311451848", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1659873213}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet :)", "timestamp_created": 1659873507, "timestamp_updated": 1659873507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120185685": {"recommendationid": "120185685", "author": {"steamid": "76561199202963975", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 68, "last_played": 1659823698}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta triste", "timestamp_created": 1659823744, "timestamp_updated": 1659823744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120110494": {"recommendationid": "120110494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199693727", "num_games_owned": 1150, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1656428434}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Florence[/i] is the result of developers disregarding the first rule of the ye olde game-making testament - [b][i]Time : content ratio[/i][/b]. Instead, they decided to tell a story via [i]Florence[/i], length be damned. So you lot who measure the game's worth by that, in my opinion, absurd criteria, please move along. [i]Florence[/i] is not for you.\n\n[i]Florence[/i] is for those more interested in the journey and the memories it begets. So accompany Florence in this short, slice-of-life game about taking chances, happiness, monotony, moving on, and all that fun life jazz, as you witness all her ups and downs as she attempts to adult. And I'll leave the story synopsis at that, as experiencing it firsthand is the core of this adventure, and it wouldn't be right of me to rob you of it.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2829241828\n\nBut I will talk a bit about the visuals, which serve as the narrator in this mute game. I love the minimalistic, stark, cartoonish look. Depending on the scene, the backgrounds go from brimming with detail to completely absent. In some cases, they are nought but a single solid colour. However, I understand why this was done. As it is situational, it occurs only in instances where the background could potentially deter from the individual. Thus, the developers managed to further highlight certain bits on your screen with this trick. So no foul here.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2827391375\n\nVisual cues are also a big part of certain puzzles, especially the grocery store dialogue jigsaw puzzle. That was just amazing. And it's a damn shame there weren't more puzzles that \"[i]evolve[/i]\" during gameplay. Still, they managed to make puzzles feel connected to the story by having them also convey Florence's emotions. [b][i]They aren't just some pointless puzzles, detached from what's happening on your screen[/i][/b], serving only one purpose - accommodating some form of interaction between the game and the player. No. They also partake in telling this story of Florence and her attempt at adulting. And best of all, these puzzles are simple, swift, with no-fail conditions, and above all else, just fun to do. There were some repeats, mainly the dialogue jigsaw puzzles, but they also have [i]visible[/i] differences I rather not spoil, which made them [i]fresh[/i]. And this goes for the rest of the catalogue - [b][i]even if there are occasional puzzle repeats, the game's puzzle catalogue has enough variation that I didn't mind the occasional misstep.[/i][/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2845011379\n\nSo there you have it, [i]Florence[/i]. Finishing the game will probably take you the same amount of time it took you to read this review ([i]probably a bit more, but humour me[/i]), but is that so bad? [b]I say ney![/b] The most important thing be if some piece of the game sticks with you long after the credits roll. And [i]Florence[/i] manages that by dealing with the ups and downs of [b]adulting[/b], something many of us are all too familiar with.\n\n[quote]If you enjoy this review, come and read more wisdom from the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40407656-Gospel-of-Sv.-Prolivije/]Gospel of Sv.

After seeing it on Steam at a lower price a few years later, I was excited to give it a go. However, I was very disappointed to realize that the tasks (or puzzles if you can call them that) in this interactive storybook become very repetitive and boring (such as the constant need to complete speech bubbles using the same mechanics). Also, there was obvious evidence of pretty lazy game design as I had to like the same pictures when the character was on social media on two different occasions in the story. But my absolute biggest issue and frustration with Florence was not being able to see the cursor when playing on my Mac! Whether full-screen or not I had to guess where the cursor was almost all the time which was super annoying. This was most certainly a bug as I was able to see a hand instead of my cursor on the screen a few times but it only lasted for a few seconds before then disappearing. This game was clearly designed for devices with touchscreens and not laptops and the developers had not bothered with converting it to a stable laptop experience.

[/h1]\n\nThis short, almost an hour long game is a trip down memory lane for most of us. It's a point-and-click adventure that's very linear and to the point and that will probably have the most sensitive bunch in tears halfway through.\n\nFlorence uses an amazing hand-drawn artstyle to tell the story of bored, working half-a-day shifts, accountant Florence Yeoh. Instead of following through with her passion, she chose the easier path that most of us find ourselves in; needless to say, that same path has led her to be an accountant, which is a job she dreads. \n\nFlorence keeps going through her mundane, routine activities, bored, unambitious and in disbelief as her life is wasted before her eyes... until she meets Krish! Krish also suffers from this horrible routine, so he and Florence found common ground and fell in love. However, as you might have already experienced, love is usually one-sided and as Florence pushes Krish to pursue his passion for music, she keeps her love for painting all in as she goes through her mundane activities. She keeps thinking that he's worth everything, that he's the very first person to ever love her, so she keeps thinking that her passion is less worthy than his... Krish moves in, and Florence is happy... but Krish hates routine, the same routine Florence has been accustumed to for very long... Krish craves change, he loves to travel, to meet new people while Florence is more of a \"settling\" type. Years pass, and as the tension rises between Florence and Krish, she will experience one of her worst losses yet.\n\nFlorence is an amazing game that I recommend to everyone; even if they hate point-and-click games. It is just \"real\", out of real life, that deals with an issue that most of us have dealt with before or will inevitabely have to deal with later in our lives. My only complaint is that it was quite short, but for what it's trying to convey, the short length of the game actually adds to the charm.

I can't say that the game drastically changed me on the inside, though now that I've replayed it 4 years after my first playthrough, I feel and understand that this short smartphone gaming session that I had back in 2018 left a small, but tangible mark in my soul. Which is probably also true for many other people. This overview is my token of appreciation for Annapurna Interactive and Mountains for all the emotions I've experienced by diving into this minute, yet dazzling creation.\n\nFactually, the game is a visual novel with a set of mini games, accompanied by peaceful, inspiring, tense and simply sad, yet always very beautiful music, which changes depending on what's going on in the main character's life. The mechanics used for interacting with the player wonderfully portray our current everyday lives, which we thankfully or unfortunately still have to live. I won't give any spoilers away, though it doesn't even make sense to attempt to describe anything, because even though the game is very short, it's an emotional, and even intimate journey at times, which is best experienced on your own for the first time, without knowing any details. And that's because every single mini-game or mechanic will be perceived differently by every individual player, since they are related to the things everyone faces in their real lives one way or another. So your perception of all these things and the reactions evoked in response to them are exactly the experience and feelings which will be unique for everyone, even though, in my opinion, the developers' intended answer was rather simplistic and straight-forward at the end of the game.\n\n[url=t.me/alsor_overviews] My Telegram channel with full overviews of the games including the games from other platforms (EGS, Playstation, Nintendo Switch).

It's not just the fact that it's the exact same story that is the go-to for these games when they don't want to hire an actual writer, it's also that it has nothing new to say about any part of it.

The minigames aren't anything to write home about, and there...isn't a lot of story here. Basically it's every Hallmark movie ever - Florence is the straight-laced overachieving business type character who has a job but nothing else in her life and is miserable, and Krish is the manic-pixie dream boy with a rebellious and creative streak who shows up and teaches her about stopping to smell the roses and that there's more to life or whatever.\n\nSo at least props for swapping the normal genders I guess! \n\nI also respect the very grounded take on adult life, despite the Hallmark plot, you have probably lived Florence's life before. Very real. \n\nIt also doesn't last very long, you'll finish it pretty quick. The picture roll at the top of the steam page is actually a pretty big chunk of the game...\n\nThat said, it's still unique and pretty good. A little light for a steam game but exactly the right size for a bite-sized mobile game, which is what it is. As a game in the minigame bundle genre like Warioware or Rhythm Heaven, it doesn't stand up. As a comic strip, it also doesn't stand up. But as a crossing of both those things? It's pretty cool, I've never seen anything like it before. I'm reminded of the scene from Ratatouille, where Remi eats the apple and it makes a sound, and then the cheese and it makes a sound - but then both *together* and the screen blows up pink with fireworks and the music swells? Yeah it's like that, more than the sum of it's parts.\n\nFlorence is a cool as a comic book that is also a game, their use of interactive elements through minigames as symbolism to explain what's going on in the story and make you participate is a unique format and it's neat for that alone. If you're expecting to have your mind blown by a deep and groundbreaking story, you're going to be disappointed. If you're expecting to have crazy fun with tight controls and engaging gameplay, you'll also be disappointed. But if you're expecting to be wowed by the clever use of gameplay mechanics as storytelling and admire the artistry of the interactive medium... this is the right place.\n\nGood but probably overhyped, temper your expectations and you'll be happy.\n\nA solid \"Huh.

It is NOT a game that has different endings to explore, and it is not something I would consider re-playable for the average gamer.\n\nThat being said, Florence is a work of art. Its hand drawn visuals are charming and its obvious that a lot of love went into writing and making this game. It's a thoughtful, story-based point and click game where the player joins Florence as she discovers what she is passionate about. The story is relatable and wholesome. \n\nI bought Florence on sale for half price, and i feel that the amount of time i spent with it was worth the money.

There are fights, and it highlights that sometimes people fall out of love, and the game depicts the struggles of falling out of love with someone you've spent a great deal of your time and emotions with.  \n\nIt's one that hits very hard, and I think that this teaches a lot of valuable lessons.  Love is something both people work with, but it is okay if things don't work out.  It depicts that relationships are grisly and sometimes partners fight, but as long as you can come back and talk things out, you'll be alright.  It teaches that even when times get tough, you have to keep going, and sometimes you don't realize all the good memories until a later time.

It does it quite well, and really captures what it's like to grow into adulthood and be in a relationship.\n\nAlthough the interactive components do add value to the experience, I think that Florence would have been just as strong of an experience within the pages of an illustrated book. I can only think of a couple of parts where the interactivity truly made the experience something more. The rest of it felt like I was playing a zen version of WarioWare Inc.

I will say this, take your time with it and GO IN BLIND, it makes the experience so much better, you won't regret it.  That being said.   It has a really cool mechanics that I've never seen before.  It's story is short, simple, but lovely and touching.  And that soundtrack,  I'll be honest, I had already forgot who wrote and preformed the songs, but they all did an amazingly wonderful job.  The classical tracks just fit the game so well.  I actually listened to the music before playing and it just made me want to play the game more.  Its beautiful and really well recorded.   It's a wonderful game with a good story of love, loss, and progression after hard times.  I have not got 100% on the game yet, but I would like to go back and get all the achievements I missed, but I do recommend going in not knowing what they are.  (Or even that they exist but to late)  as its really fun to just have one pop up for just playing the game.  Overall it's an amazing game all around.  The fact that it's all told through visuals and music (no dialogue is ever spoken and no text to tell you what to do, the bit that's there is only for context,)  makes it like your going through the story with the character, and making the events happen.  It's, again, really well done.  I will say it is a shame how fast you can go through, even if you take time take in each image.  It can feel like you just started an act and then your 3 more in.  Not to say it's not well paced, it's just you have to pace yourself as you go through.  If I have any advice for this game it's to not rush it.  Enjoy it.

I have played very short 1 hour ~ 2 hour long games that cost more than this does and I didn't regret many of them. The whimsical art style in Florence has a charm, but that's about where it ends for me. I am a very emotional person who loves to wallow in the occasional melancholic and cathartic game, book, and TV/film genres. I love a good cry or even anything that gets my emotional senses tingling. \n\nThat being said, I've had more of an emotional reaction from a sad animal shelter commercial (you all know the one, cue Sarah McLachlan's sad advertisments) than this game. It's hardly interactive, which is fine, if it makes up for it elsewhere. The game being extremely short is already a downside, however, it could have made up for it in other areas. The art style is cute and whimsical but I wouldn't consider it to be making up for the lackluster gameplay or the shortness and lack of replayability with the game. If the story was very emotionally fueled and memorable, then I'd have thrown all criticisms of gameplay length, art style, and lack of interactive gameplay out of the window. However, the story was very mildly bittersweet and didn't move me much. This is coming from someone who will cry at sad songs, will cry through sad films, and has gone through several breakups that have left a scar. Trust me when I say that I am all about the bittersweet and cathartic human experience, but, this was a very mediocre and shallow representation of one.", "timestamp_created": 1641331389, "timestamp_updated": 1641331389, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465444296598434448", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107312371": {"recommendationid": "107312371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339039799", "num_games_owned": 761, "num_reviews": 274, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 445, "last_played": 1689479724}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Relatable.[/h1]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3003560016 [hr][/hr]For me, Florence is a game that tells you what does relationship looks like (Even though I haven't had a relationship experience yet). Starting by doing your daily routine [i](eat - work - repeat)[/i] that feels usual and then you need to take a break [i](like go outside).[/i] Later on, you found someone that attracts your heart & hoping that you'll find that person again. And guess what? you found that person again and then having a chit-chat. Day after day, the bond between you & that person is getting stronger and 1 person will ask for a first date.\n\nAfter couple of months of dating, you live together, doing things together, supporting each other, and genuinely make you & that person lives better. But sometimes bad things happen. Whether it's about life, work, mood, or fighting about something. Until you feels like you & that person aren't meant to be together. And then you broke up with that person & let that person go.\n\nIt might be hurts when someone that you loved so much broke up with you. You maybe couldn't forget but [b]YOU MAYBE COULD MOVE ON.[/b] [i]Memories between you & that person weren't always about bad things, there were also good things that happened even the sweetest one. The relationship between you & that person ends in heartbreak, but the moments, the memories, and a gesture of love led to a new life.[/i]\n\nLast but not least, Florence really helped me about loving someone & being with someone and also living a fulfilled life. [spoiler]Maybe one day I could find a person that attracts my heart. Who knows -I never know what will happen next.[/spoiler]\n\nI didn't regret playing this game over & over even it is short. I honestly really loved the soundtrack when Florence meets Krish for the first time. It gave me goosebumps & made me happily cry.

It's a relatable game and that's why for some of us it hurts so much. Her life is an endless routine of work, sleep, and spending too much time on social media to fill in the invisible yet present void. We've all been there. One day, she meets a cello player who makes her see the world in different colors. Florence is intimate, raw and personal.\n\nThe game lets you experience their relationship from the beginning, which makes it even more relatable especially when the puzzle dialogues are starting to appear. At first, the pieces seem more complex, there's many of them that you need to piece together, but as the story goes on, the pieces become easier and easier to piece together, since in a relationship at first you don't know what ground you're standing on and you need to carefully use your words until you learn about the things you have in common and it becomes much easier to talk to each other. \n\nThe relationship shows the nice parts about it: flirting, helping each other grow and supporting one another's dreams; but also shows the not so pretty parts in relationships as well: fighting, taking what you have for granted because of the comfortable (maybe too comfortable) routine going on and sadly growing apart. The ending makes you understand that not every loss is a loss. That sometimes you need to go through a rough patch and even though at first it's hard and you're feeling lost, in time you find yourself and that passion you forgot you still carry with you.\n\nGameplay wise it consists of simple mini-puzzles that cannot be failed. The game presents itself as minimalistic but don't let that fool you. It is as impactful as its simple graphics. \n\nHonestly, if you are someone that has been through at least one real relationship, this game hits way too hard. You see the progress from the early stages until the last one, leaving you feeling nostalgic and craving for more. \n\nIt is a bittersweet experience that in my opinion is worth the full price. \n", "timestamp_created": 1640656333, "timestamp_updated": 1640656333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785314440727233887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106699065": {"recommendationid": "106699065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191194862", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1640596035}, "language": "english", "review": "i cant express how relatable this is for anyone who's apart of genZ, play it. i cried", "timestamp_created": 1640647338, "timestamp_updated": 1640647338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106688382": {"recommendationid": "106688382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002637002", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 331, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1656669579}, "language": "english", "review": "This is more of an interactive graphic novel than a game, but as such it is quite a beautiful one - both graphically and storywise.

A continuaci\u00f3n entramos en detalles: \n\n[h1]Argumento:[/h1] (no hay spoilers)\n\nNos ponemos en el papel de Florence Yeoh, una chica de 25 a\u00f1os que se siente atrapada en un callej\u00f3n sin salida. Una vida de rutina en un trabajo que no le llena, horas de sue\u00f1o y mucho tiempo perdido en redes sociales. Un d\u00eda conoce a alguien que quiz\u00e1s sea la persona que le haga darle la vuelta a su perspectiva de la vida.\n\nCon esta tem\u00e1tica tan sencilla y cotidiana se nos presenta esta mini-aventura en la que los personajes se expresan mediante gestos y bocadillos sin texto que nosotros mismos tendremos que interpretar, ya que no hay ni una sola palabra ni voces en todo el juego. Todo se sobreentiende bien a pesar de este detalle, ya que la emotividad de la m\u00fasica y su apartado art\u00edstico hace que todo sea muy f\u00e1cil de interpretar. \n\n[h1]Jugabilidad:[/h1]\n\nFlorence tambi\u00e9n resulta un juego at\u00edpico en este apartado. Podr\u00eda parecer una sencilla aventura gr\u00e1fica, pero su control es distinto a lo habitual, quiz\u00e1s porque est\u00e1 pensado para jugarlo en dispositivos m\u00f3viles. Con respecto a esta versi\u00f3n de ordenador solo tendremos que hacer uso del rat\u00f3n, aunque seg\u00fan leo tambi\u00e9n se puede hacer uso del mando, algo que sinceramente no he probado. \n\nEl manejo es bien sencillo: en ocasiones tendremos que darle solamente a siguiente, en otras arrastrar la pantalla como si de una web se tratase, en otras ocasiones tendremos que recoger piezas de puzle para completar los bocadillos que representan lo que se est\u00e1 diciendo en las conversaciones, hacer clic en algunos objetos, arrastrar otros y alg\u00fan que otro peque\u00f1o y muy sencillo mini-puzle, nada que nos haga tener que pensar demasiado. \n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/h1]\n\nNo esperes grandes alardes en este apartado, Florence no busca sorprenderte por unos gr\u00e1ficos realistas y llenos de efectos. Su est\u00e9tica le imprime una personalidad \u00fanica, muy original. Gr\u00e1ficos muy sencillos, trazos dibujados a mano de forma simple pero bien realizados que transmiten mucho con muy poco. \n\n[h1]Sonido:[/h1]\n\nLa banda sonora es simplemente perfecta. Nos acompa\u00f1a de fondo durante todo el juego ya que no hay voces en los di\u00e1logos, pero la m\u00fasica est\u00e1 tan bien compuesta y elegida que se adapta a la perfecci\u00f3n a la situaci\u00f3n que se est\u00e1 representando en cada momento, transmitiendo los sentimientos de los personajes de la historia de una forma soberbia.\n\nOs dejo mi lista de pros y contras:\n\n[H1][b]PROS:[/b][/H1]\n\n- Todo lo que transmite con tan poco\n\n- Muy emotivo\n\n- Art\u00edsticamente es precioso\n\n- A pesar de su argumento cotidiano, el planteamiento es muy original\n\n- La banda sonora es una aut\u00e9ntica maravilla\n\n- Es muy sencillo sentirse identificado con la historia que nos est\u00e1 contando\n\n- Se puede conseguir a buen precio en \u00e9pocas de ofertas\n\n- Tiene logros Steam\n\n- Tiene cromos y art\u00edculos en la tienda de Steam\n\n[H1][b]CONTRAS:[/b][/H1]\n\n- Es muy corto, no llega ni a la hora de duraci\u00f3n. Quiz\u00e1s te dure algo m\u00e1s si tienes que rejugar partes para conseguir alg\u00fan logro que se te haya escapado\n\n- Su precio base es elevado para lo que ofrece, solo lo comprar\u00eda de oferta\n\n- No es rejugable, hubiera estado bien la posibilidad de tomar decisiones distintas que tengan peso en la historia\n\n[H1]Conclusi\u00f3n:[/h1]\n------------------------\n\nUna bonita experiencia de muy corta duraci\u00f3n, que me ha encantado pero que sinceramente solo recomendar\u00eda en el caso de encontrarlo de oferta con una buena rebaja.

The game follows a girl stuck in a boring job with no friends and no love, but with a dream for a better life. It\u2019s a slice of life kind of story, there aren\u2019t any unexpected twists, strange mysteries or high stakes. Just some of the most heartwarming and heartbreaking moments of a girl\u2019s life. The story is very relatable and will definitely leave an emotional impact on you. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game consists of simple mini-games, they don\u2019t require any special skills and can be easily completed by someone who hasn\u2019t played videogames before. Simple as it is, it doesn\u2019t get boring and the mini-games themselves are so masterfully integrated into the narrative, so you can\u2019t imagine [b]Florence[/b] being anything other than a game. Every gameplay mechanic tries to convey some emotion, best example of this would be the jigsaw puzzle that appears during conversations and gets easier and easier with each level as your character gets more familiar and chattier with her friend. \n\n[h1]Graphics & Audio[/h1]\nIt looks like a hand-drawn comic with a lot of love put into it. It\u2019s not very detailed and character faces look very simple. But it\u2019s very emotional, it seems like every detail was put in its\u2019 place for story-related reasons and not just for the good picture. The music is perfect. It sets the tone of the game and every melody hits you right in the feels. Some of the tracks will probably stay in your head long after you finished the game.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nSpecs: Intel Core i5-7300HQ, 12GB RAM, NVIDIA GTX 1050 4GB.\n\nIt runs perfectly in 1080p at 60 FPS. There are no technical issues whatsoever.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nWhile it is a short game with simple graphics, almost no gameplay and a story you\u2019ve heard a thousand times before, you can\u2019t just pass it by. It\u2019s a small game, that will evoke more emotions in you in the span of 30 minutes than a complex big budget game will in 10 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1639839526, "timestamp_updated": 1639839526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602709531784057617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105968826": {"recommendationid": "105968826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198433278912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1609113419}, "language": "english", "review": "YES", "timestamp_created": 1639740304, "timestamp_updated": 1639740304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105937983": {"recommendationid": "105937983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288511266", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1639685551}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short game, but I found it very sweet!

misma[/h1]\n\nFlorence es un juego bastante dif\u00edcil de catalogar, y mucho menos decir si es un juego recomendable o no. Es uno de esos t\u00edtulos en los que desear\u00edas que hubiera un bot\u00f3n intermedio para valorarlo.\n\nEl juego, como podr\u00e1s ver en la tienda, tiene un \u201dmuy positivos\u201d, pero eso no significa, ni de lejos, que sea muy bueno. Simplemente es un juego simp\u00e1tico y agradable que no te llevar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de una hora terminar. De hecho, llamarlo \u201cjuego\u201d me parece pasarse un poco. M\u00e1s bien es una experiencia interactiva de perfil bajo donde nos cuentan una historia. Una historia bastante normalita por otra parte. \n\nEs decir, si lees algunas rese\u00f1as, podr\u00e1s ver cosas como \u201cuna historia incre\u00edble\u201d, o \u201cuna historia muy hermosa\u201d, etc\u2026 Bueno, despu\u00e9s de haber jugado al juego y haber visto lo que ofrece, el \u00fanico motivo l\u00f3gico que se me ocurre para que alguien diga eso es que no ha tenido una pareja en su vida. Que, por lo que veo, seg\u00fan las rese\u00f1as, son muchos. Legi\u00f3n, mas bien.\n\nEl juego no te cuenta una \u201chistoria incre\u00edble\u201d, ni una historia \u201cmuy hermosa\u201d. Lo que hace es contarte una historia de amor entre dos personas que se conocen, y punto. \u00bfEs bonito? Hombre, hablamos del amor, pero no es especialmente buena la historia. Es decir, si ya has vivido algo as\u00ed alguna vez en tu vida pues te sonar\u00e1 a algo ya visto y as\u00ed pues pierde gracia la cosa. A buen seguro la mayor\u00eda de la gente tiene mejores historias personales que contar sobre el amor que la que se cuenta en Florence.\n\nEs decir, el juego cuenta una historia de enamoramiento, pero todo es muy normal, no es una historia estramb\u00f3tica, ni interesante porque te sorprenda ni nada por el estilo. Es una historia de relaci\u00f3n de pareja como la que se da millones de veces al d\u00eda en este mundo.\n\nPor otra parte, el juego ofrece, aparte de su historia, peque\u00f1as pinceladas a modo de minijuegos. Son entretenidos en su mayor parte, y graciosos en algunas otras. No es que aporten demasiado, pero se agradece. De hecho, ser\u00e1 la mayor interacci\u00f3n que tendremos en la paup\u00e9rrima hora que dura el juego.\n\nEn definitiva, Florence es un juego at\u00edpico, muy muy corto, que no ofrece nada no vivido a quien haya vivido, pero que se deja disfrutar durante breves instantes. Lo recomendar\u00eda para bundle o rebajado en su m\u00e1xima expresi\u00f3n, pero poco m\u00e1s. No creo que merezca la pena hacer una mayor inversi\u00f3n debido a su escas\u00edsima duraci\u00f3n y a lo poco que aporta realmente.", "timestamp_created": 1637890986, "timestamp_updated": 1637891142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592029929161071777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103954984": {"recommendationid": "103954984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016295868", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1637876702}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Pese a que a m\u00ed me ha parecido excesivamente corto, recomiendo jugarlo porque es una experiencia totalmente nueva.

I knew the type of game it was going into it, and I knew it had very little \"gameplay\" and was quite short. I don't mind any of these things, in fact some of my favorite games are very similar in these aspects. Unfortunately Florence just left me kind of underwhelmed. It's not a bad game, in fact I think if you're into these kinds of games that you'll enjoy it. I just didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I would after hearing all the praise this game has gotten. It has some very interesting, unique, and well executed ideas in terms of what you can do with simply clicking and dragging things on screen, and the way the game is able to turn simple actions into representing the emotions of the characters is quite remarkable to be honest. The art style and music are both beautifully done and add a lot to the game. They both change accurately to the situation and help make this experience what it is. Sadly though, what is perhaps the most important part of these types of games, the story, is where the game fell short for me. \n\nThe entire game takes probably 35-40 minutes to play through, not even half of most movies. The game just isn't long enough to build up the relationship between the characters to make anything it does really feel anything. Most of the emotions I felt playing this game came more from the artwork and soundtrack then my actual feelings towards the characters. There just isn't enough time to really build the bond between the characters and everything that happens between them is very cookie cutter and predictable. It's all honestly just kind of predictable. Despite the stories flaws, if you can get it on sale for the $3 asking price it normally goes down to and are usually a fan of these types of games, then I think there's still enough that's done right to make it worth your time. It's just a shame because if they had just fleshed things out a little more, this game truly could've been close to a masterpiece.

The characters in this game are well developed enough for the player to understand the type of individuals they are and witness the way that they will grow throughout the game. The story itself is fantastically told. Everything from gameplay, to sound to visuals all contribute and blend perfectly to portray such an amazing journey. \nThe Settings in this game add another layer of characterisation and depth to Florence as they themselves tell their own story and give more details and ideas for the player to branch upon.\nVisually, this game looks stunning. The artstyle is done in this pencil drawing/scrapbook style which fits the tone perfectly. Even the way colour is used in the game is great as it becomes a great indicator of the tone/emotions that are taking place in a certain moment. \nSound and audio again just add even more layers to the games story telling and makes this experience more immersive. The OST with its grand violins and orchestral pieces help greatly with the emotions that are being portrayed in a certain scene and the audio choices for when the player is interacting is just so satisfying. \nIn terms of gameplay, there isn't a lot here. You will be mainly be using your mouse to click or drag things that are key for a particular moment. While that might not sound engaging, the way the developers work around this and the things that you do interact with really make you feel that you are progressing and contributing to the story. The only thing i wish the game had was a longer run time just because i loved every bit of this game!\nOverall, Florence is a brilliant story-rich game that had me hooked from start to finish and i would recommend this to anyone wanting to be sucked up by an amazing narrative of becoming ones true self.", "timestamp_created": 1635646088, "timestamp_updated": 1635646088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101918490": {"recommendationid": "101918490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042909748", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1635631922}, "language": "english", "review": "It's short, but so is life.", "timestamp_created": 1635631999, "timestamp_updated": 1635631999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101909116": {"recommendationid": "101909116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074968965", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1635622248}, "language": "english", "review": "Florence \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19(\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e08\u0e1a\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e43\u0e19\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 40 \u0e19\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35) \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e01\u0e47\u0e40\u0e15\u0e47\u0e21\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e36\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e15\u0e04\u0e39\u0e48 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e40\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e32\u0e28\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e07\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e23\u0e27\u0e21\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e48\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e35 \u0e21\u0e35\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e07\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e36\u0e01\u0e14\u0e35\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e39\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e36\u0e01\u0e40\u0e28\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e01\u0e49\u0e33\u0e01\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e15\u0e04\u0e19", "timestamp_created": 1635621925, "timestamp_updated": 1635621925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101890653": {"recommendationid": "101890653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297341934", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1635604842}, "language": "english", "review": "This game hit me right in the face.

This game is so beautifully made; it captures all of the feelings of the time in one's life it explores: new love, heartbreak, ambition and new beginnings.\n\nIt's essentially an interactive novel, and yet each section utilises play mechanics that brilliantly mirror the action. When Florence falls off her bike, the player has to adjust the image as she regains her senses. When she goes on a first date, a conversation-shaped puzzle becomes increasingly easy to solve. It sounds simple, but it sidesteps that awkward balance so many VNs struggle to find between being a game and being a story with buttons. Florence's playstyle fits the story perfectly.\n \nArtistically, it's flawless. The art style and soundtrack are so inviting; the music will be on loop in your house for days to come, bringing all the feels back both good and bad. While it's a small game from an indie dev, it feels and looks polished. Like Moebius-inspired platformer Gris, the colour palette is an important part of how Florence tells its story. As it progresses, colour becomes a currency that is gained and lost as the title character experiences the highs and lows of their journey.\n\nAs an Australian gamer, I very much appreciated this accurate portrayal of our culture: the suburban, art-filled world of Melbourne (which reminded me of another favourite, Necrobarista (worth your time)) that sat in contrast to the garish, larrikin stereotypes that so often plague our representation. Florence feels sophisticated, and it celebrates the multiculturalism that Australia should be so proud of.\n\nPlay it. Buy it and play it over and over again. Revisit it when you're happy, or when you're sad. And as it is an easy game to play, share it with people who might not normally play games. Florence is a gift.

I was expecting something more along the lines of a visual novel, but I love how the devs made subtle yet impactful changes that showed the creativity and character in this story. The playthrough is simple, and while it's nothing groundbreaking, and you complete easy, routine tasks like solving math equations or unpacking items or putting together puzzle pieces, it works to highlight the themes of the story, and the interactive aspects make it feel more personal. I think the strongest aspect is the original soundtrack, with moving piano and strings. There isn't much dialogue in this game, and though I was at first taken aback that the player doesn't get to hear the conversations, with little written text, it became clear that the expressions show enough emotion, as well as the accompanying music. The significance of the puzzle pieces stands out especially, noting how the pieces become more congruent, becoming closer to one, and then on the other spectrum, become jagged to express the lack of unity and connection. Basically, \"Florence\" shines in its illustrations and storyboard, providing the player with plenty of depth into the themes of self-discovery, loss, and finding a place in this world. It's beautifully and delicately told, and though under an hour, completely worth it. You can tell the devs care about their work in the concept and character art that is accessible to the player, and I love when that care comes through to the player.", "timestamp_created": 1631818681, "timestamp_updated": 1631818776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99426359": {"recommendationid": "99426359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857703600", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1635474909}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen NO-JUEGO, esta muy bien dise\u00f1ado, brilla el arte y la banda sonora. por el precio que tiene lo vale completamente,  se pasa f\u00e1cilmente en 40-45 minutos solo el juego sin los logros, quiz\u00e1s te lleve unos 10 minutos mas en completar el juego al 100%. super recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1631764123, "timestamp_updated": 1631764123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99422426": {"recommendationid": "99422426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310316785", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1631756842}, "language": "english", "review": "Omg it's so beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1631756934, "timestamp_updated": 1631756934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99418961": {"recommendationid": "99418961", "author": {"steamid": "76561199147869080", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1631750220}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego si bien es corto en longitud, la historia es verdaderamente cautivante cada minuto.

You are experiencing her life as she transitions through it. \n\nThe artwork is charming, I especially love some of the more romantic scenes depicted of Florence and her boyfriend Krish. I was rooting for them till the end and well the story did have a happy ending of sorts, just not the one I was expecting. \n\nSo positives-strong emotional story, great music, and great art style.
