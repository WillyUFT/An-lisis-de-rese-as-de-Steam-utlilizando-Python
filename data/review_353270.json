I am going to replay it with a guide at some point to get the true ending but my review is going to be based on the route to the good ending.\n\n[h1]THE STORY[/h1]\n\nI have played the other Re;Birth games already and I had high hopes for this game. With the exception of 1 part of the story I didn't really like ( I will go into that more later ), this game delivered. All the new characters were pretty interesting and seeing a lot of returning characters was really great as well. The plot was well written and there were some twist that I honestly did not see coming.\n\nSo now I will briefly talk about the one part I did not like. This is sort of a spoiler so only read it if you don't mind a minor spoiler. [spoiler] This game treats Nepgear like garbage. She is the but of every joke for half the game. They make several references to Re;Birth 2 where she was the main character and mention how weak she was as a main. I actually really like Nepgear and I really enjoyed the second game. I don't know why Idea Factory seems to hate one of there own characters that much. If it was only a few Nepgear jokes that wouldn't be that bad but she is treated pretty awful in this game, even by Neptune. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\nThis game is mostly the same as the first 2 games in game play but takes some steps backwards. The biggest change that I definitely did not like is that literally nobody but the main characters get EX moves and the main characters only get team up moves and no solo moves. I don't feel this was because my level was too low because all my characters were past level 90 by the end of the game. It also felt like it took longer to recover SP after EX moves which will make you not want to use them at all. The coupling moves will take even longer to recover since not only do you need to recover SP for the character that started the move but also the other character that is not active at the time.\n\nThis game did add some cool gimmicks that were not in the other games. One is these hidden blocks that you have to hit with your head, Mario style. I also felt like the jump was more useful in this game than other games.  There were alot more interactions you could have at the Basilicom including 1 on 1 interactions with Neptune herself. They even added a quiz game show in where you could win a crap ton of money playing ( DO NOT SKIP THESE )\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are mostly just reused assets from the previous games. There was a lot more variety in the areas you could explore which was a welcome change. The only complaint I have about the graphics is the change in the battle UI. It looks noticeably worst than the previous games. But that is just my opinion and you may like its simplicity more than I did. You will get used to it but it is the one thing that will stick out if you are coming into this game fresh off the last game.\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\n\nOverall, I think this is a solid game. I like all the new characters, the story was interesting, and it maintains the addicting the gameplay of the first 2 games. I personally like Re;Birth 2 a little more but I still think this game is definitely worth checking out.", "timestamp_created": 1699214486, "timestamp_updated": 1699214486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149303428": {"recommendationid": "149303428", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015254019", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 8059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8059, "last_played": 1698836946}, "language": "english", "review": "ridiculous", "timestamp_created": 1698836998, "timestamp_updated": 1698836998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148808390": {"recommendationid": "148808390", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971098718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 328, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1698231870}, "language": "english", "review": "Got it in a bundle with 3 other Neptunia games but not worth it gameplay is boring and janky.", "timestamp_created": 1698177683, "timestamp_updated": 1698177683, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486111104488372803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148283195": {"recommendationid": "148283195", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039685148", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 309, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1700597107}, "language": "english", "review": "Nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep Nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep Nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep nep", "timestamp_created": 1697381623, "timestamp_updated": 1697381623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148177767": {"recommendationid": "148177767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198994283468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1552, "last_played": 1675954966}, "language": "english", "review": "It's shame that Re;Birth3 don't have Re;Birth mod ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1697258275, "timestamp_updated": 1697258275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147456597": {"recommendationid": "147456597", "author": {"steamid": "76561199248971695", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1696787162}, "language": "english", "review": "join the Nep cult", "timestamp_created": 1696186026, "timestamp_updated": 1696186026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147314594": {"recommendationid": "147314594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196615751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2932, "last_played": 1697048796}, "language": "english", "review": "Now that I finally got all the achievements for this Neptunia game in particular, I can say it's my long time favorite game of the series (played it before, just another platform), and clearly better than Re;Birth 1 and 2, being the most polished game of the trilogy. Because, let's be honest, Re;Birth 1 destroys the original story in a disgusting way, so it's the worst version of the Superdimension story, with Victory gameplay and that's it. And Re;Birth 2 is just mk2 with a few changes, more makers, but it's still the same game with the same boring protagonist and repetitive story about piracy being bad and people praising it cuz of a forced edgy ahh ending.\n\nRe;Birth 3/Victory on the other hand, brought a better and more enjoyable story, with a good amount of new characters with solid interactions and fun moments, no exe drive gauge so you need more strategy, a better version of Stella's Dungeon (R;B3 only), and overall, it's the most enjoyable one. The reason why it's hated by a lot of people is because of TWO. THINGS. yes, only that.\n\nThe first one is how Nepgear is treated in this game, this was because people found Nepgear as a boring ahh Neptune with depression and self-confidence lil' girl back when mk2 was released, so she's always made fun of during the game cuz of that and only that (and just a few moments). Nepgear fans can't just accept that, they just cry about it and say this game sucks only cuz of their character getting a non-protagonist treatment.\n\nThe other thing is; Plutia/Iris Heart, probably one of the most important characters. People complain about Iris Heart and her questionable behavior, but entirely ignore that she was really important, she saved Blanc, she saved Peashy, she saved the dimensions, she's better than what you think, stop ignoring the good things she did.\n\nAnyway, I really recommend this game, pretty solid Neptunia game with funny moments and an epic story filled with references (as always).", "timestamp_created": 1696028952, "timestamp_updated": 1696028952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537669956684112549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147171300": {"recommendationid": "147171300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308087683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3643, "last_played": 1518592952}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like classic rpgs, dont buy this (and probably other neptunia rpgs), specially without a big discount.

This imo is not enough to recommend this, or any other game in this series with similar design. If you are curious about the general plot and style of the dialogues, a better option would be watching the anime.\n\nThe negative:\nAlmost everything else: the music becomes boring from lack of variety; same problem with dungeons, which feel like copy+pasta, and closer in design to extremely low budget and generic dungeon crawlers (and probably worse). The gameplay is very repetitive, and the game becomes grindy with little reward. The game works and feels more like a \"visual novel with extra steps\" than an rpg with minor visual novel elements (ie persona games). There little immersion outside dungeons, and you will spend most time surfing in-game menus that represent interactions (ie towns are menus).\n\nAlso the game lacks mods that maybe could improve a bit the experience and reduce its simplistic nature. \n\nThere are so many cheap rpg games with far better storytelling and quality in script to choose before this one, that spending time in this one is as bad as doing physical damage to yourself. If a gatcha game could become an undercover assasin, neptunia games would be that assassin (so its also a bit like a gatcha game without the typical huge amount of micro-transactions).", "timestamp_created": 1695862546, "timestamp_updated": 1695862546, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146979849": {"recommendationid": "146979849", "author": {"steamid": "76561199147230102", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4865, "last_played": 1697853591}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Story [/h1] (9/10)\nIf I may say that the story of Neptunia Rebirth 3 is the best compared to the two previous series. Starting from the plot of Neptune who was transported to another dimension and it turned out to be a game industry from a different universe. There it turns out that Neptune again has to defeat an evil boss called the Seven Sages. with the help of the new character Plutia (iris heart) together they defeat the seven sages up to the final boss rei. very amazing story. so many new characters, especially in terms of bosses, are very good, making this game very exciting to play\n\n\n[h1] Graphic [/h1] (9/10)\nThe characters in the game Neptunia Rebirth 3 are very varied compared to the two previous series, the description of the boss is very interesting, like a mecha robot. And again, in Neptunia Rebirth 3 there are two new CPUs, namely Iris Heart and Yellow Heart. Rei can even be a CPU in its HDD form. making this game even more exciting with so many new characters\n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] (8/10)\nI really praise the gameplay this time. The gameplay in Neptunia Rebirth 3 has progressed quite a bit. The first thing that is interesting is that the number of playable characters that can be accessed at the start of the game is already large. so that leveling becomes easier, rather than appearing one by one according to the storyline. secondly, the UI of this game has improved a lot, so it is better to look at and understand, then the downside is that in general it is still the typical Neptunia combo and the addition of challenges that require you to do them to get skills. This of course adds unnecessary grinding, making the game quite boring.\n\n\n[h1] Sound [/h1] (7/10)\nThe sound of this game is still the same as the two previous series, so it doesn't feel like there's anything different, like a big DLC \u200b\u200binstead. So the developer should add new sounds to make the game experience more exciting\n\n[h1] DLC [/h1] (8/10)\nThere are many and various types of DLC in this game. Starting from DLC about new areas, new quests, new items, even DLC to get new characters which of course helps players to get achievements.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1695612007, "timestamp_updated": 1695612007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552095651626586914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146318913": {"recommendationid": "146318913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368198606", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 743, "last_played": 1694798119}, "language": "english", "review": "It says I've played for 12 hours, but I've actually played for 56 hours for my first play-through.  This review is more-so based on the PS3 version \"Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory\" that this is based off of, but I've played enough of this version of the game to explain the differences and tell if this is still worth while or not.  Let's start with the pros:\n\n- The combat is outstandingly designed, a lot of fun, and can be incredibly deep.\n\n- Bosses/Boss fights are hard, but in the best way possible (at least in my opinion).\n\n- The humor is OUTSTANDING and as good here as it is in any other Neptunia game.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is a blast if you understand the combat.  There aren't a lot of pros, but the quality of the pros MORE than makes up for the lack of quantity.  Now for the cons:\n\n\n- Assets are ruthlessly re-used.  This is nothing new for Neptunia, but it positively hampers the experience a lot more than it should...  This includes dungeon layouts, enemy designs, and even bosses.  It really does eliminate the element of exploring, and finding anything that's really new.  I don't mean to go on and on about it, but this really is (and always has been) Neptunia's greatest weakness...  I really hope this changes, because I sincerely believe these games would be a lot more popular if it does...\n\n- The story is nothing special, but it is interesting enough to keep you engaged and invested.\n\n- This version of the game gives you access to many characters that you realistically shouldn't have access to.  There's a point in the game VERY early on where you have like 10 different cutscenes and each one gives you a new party character that you realistically shouldn't have.  I understand that they wanted to make the game easier and more accessible, but this is a very strange way of doing that.  Especially when they give you access to Histoire who's strong enough to basically beat the entire game if you just use her.  A difficulty setting is how you do this correctly; not throwing 10+ party members at players randomly.\n\n- A few cutscenes drag on longer than they need to.  Specifically cutscenes before major boss fights.  You have the option to skip these, but for those who listen to the dialogue (which in a perfect world is everyone) it makes situations harder to take seriously since they just drag things out.  Despite this, I STRONGLY discourage you from skipping any dialogue that you haven't already seen.\n\nOverall, this is still an OUTSTANDING experience despite all of the shortcomings.  If you like anime, and Japanese humor, you'll certainly enjoy this.  And if you're a fan of the series, you really do need to play this.  One more thing I'll say is that the anime uses a very similar plot to this game, but this game is a MUCH more complete version of the plot and has enough differences to make it really interesting and worth your while.  Honestly, this is the DEFINITIVE version of the plot used in the anime by a long shot with LOADS more content.\n\nP.S.\nDon't be a impatient, SERIOUSLY read/listen to ALL of the cutscene dialogue!  For me, half of the fun in the Neptunia series IS the cutscenes, so don't cheat yourself out of half the fun if you paid full price (or even if you didn't...).", "timestamp_created": 1694758382, "timestamp_updated": 1694758382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145648411": {"recommendationid": "145648411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367882132", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1634703259}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVmKAzZBQg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcaC8Gt8Go8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66eqUid5k88\n", "timestamp_created": 1693827383, "timestamp_updated": 1693827383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145418293": {"recommendationid": "145418293", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995941214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2903, "last_played": 1693370774}, "language": "english", "review": "is good gaem", "timestamp_created": 1693535054, "timestamp_updated": 1693535054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145277631": {"recommendationid": "145277631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333175410", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1835, "last_played": 1693029819}, "language": "english", "review": "They did my girl Nepgear so dirty...", "timestamp_created": 1693335286, "timestamp_updated": 1693335286, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145234441": {"recommendationid": "145234441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032089073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 19418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2785, "playtime_at_review": 3018, "last_played": 1700751774}, "language": "english", "review": "The beginning of your Nep-Nep experience, part 3!

the game and that's kinda fine but it is very detrimental to the gameplay process as a whole. Nep-nep games should be light-hearted and easy to pick up with the right amount of mechanics. Not too deep, but also not too shallow.\n\nRequiring the player to grind more however backfires to the experience.  I am talking about the \"Challenges\" system which introduces small bonuses if you meet a certain criteria but they are not worth it, needless to say, they also don't contribute much to the overall gameplay. But then you notice that EXE skills are gated in this challenges and you begin to understand why I don't like it.\n\nGrinding that 100 skill cast will add up on your gameplay and you might not even notice it. EXE skills can also be ignored as coupling EXE skills exists and can be unlocked by simply leveling. This type of mechanic introduces another set of needless grinding which is tedious. Furthermore, characters with high sp costs are more at disadvantage here. There are methods to do this quickly, some might even say I'm just crying, and yes I am. Previous nep rebirth games did not require you additional grinding to acquire EXE drive skills, it is acquired through leveling.\n\nWith that out of the way, this sequel also is buggy.\nSometimes world map elements can glitch out. Appearing black or missing textures.\nControls not working properly.\nSoftlocking mid-battle.\n\nmore bugs have also been experience by other players but the bugs above can be solved by re-launching the game.\n\nOtherwise I still enjoyed the game, the characters, humor, and overall feeling of the game.

"language": "spanish", "review": "En esta tercera entrega de la trilog\u00eda Re;Birth seguimos las andanzas de nuestras CPU's y el resto de personajes, el modo de contar la historia es el t\u00edpico de la saga, estilo Visual Novel sin decisiones, Gr\u00e1ficos estilo anime t\u00edpicos de la saga, voces en Ingles o Japon\u00e9s y textos en Ingles, el modo de combate es el de siempre, RPG por turnos con un ligero toque action ya que te dejan moverte hacia el enemigo, puedes tener 4 personajes a la vez en combate m\u00e1s 4 personajes enlazados para cambiarlos en cualquier momento en mitad del combate lo cual te da m\u00e1s dinamismo a la hora de luchar gracias a los Rangos Lily t\u00edpicos de la saga, las  habilidades y combos se ven muy bien y son muy \u00e9picos, hay gran variedad de personajes, as\u00ed pues elige los que mas te gusten y a disfrutar. \n\nComo es t\u00edpico al menos en la saga principal, jugaremos en un mapa mundi con ubicaciones en las que podremos entrar y explorar, algunas explorando directamente y otras solo a trav\u00e9s de eventos o a trav\u00e9s de un men\u00fa (en las ciudades como siempre tendremos el men\u00fa para las tiendas y dem\u00e1s), como siempre para desplazarnos en este mapa mundi usaremos el \"puntero mini Neptune\" XD para seleccionar la ubicaci\u00f3n a la que queremos acceder, tendremos eventos principales de la historia, eventos secundarios, etc. \n\nLa historia muy interesante con su t\u00edpico toque de humor tanto en escenas principales como en eventos secundarios.\n\nBueno como no quiero hacer ning\u00fan spoiler del juego, voy a dejar mi rese\u00f1a hasta ac\u00e1, si hab\u00e9is jugado a los Re;birth anteriores este os va a gustar y en caso de que no hay\u00e1is jugado jam\u00e1s a un Neptunia, os recomiendo jugar el Re;birth 1 y 2 antes de embarcaros con este, disfrutar\u00e9is mucho del t\u00edtulo as\u00ed que a comprar la trilog\u00eda para sacar le todo el jugo", "timestamp_created": 1671791811,

This game got rid of a lot of stuff that was in the original, like the Legendary 7 Skills (sin) and the chirper in towns were replaced with a boring menu. Cutscenes that were dubbed in the original (The DLC character events) aren\u2019t in this game for some reason. Speaking of DLC, why are they not included in the base game? I thought this was a remake, not a port with a fancy coat of paint.\n\nIt was good that they made the EXE moves and SP moves share the same meter, at first. The SP bar never goes past 1000 upon a level up, making EXE moves not really worth it. SP also doesn\u2019t regenerate after leaving a \u201cdungeon\u201d. \n\nUnlocking plans through character challenges is really lame too. I don\u2019t want to stagger a battle, just to unlock voices, or unlock a fifth combo slot. I preferred just getting skills through level-up anyway. \n\nIn Re;Birth 1, that game at least changed some parts about the original\u2019s story. This game, however, doesn\u2019t change a thing.

You still start with 4 moves but you can unlock a 5th move through challenges. You won't have it for every character but it's nice to have.\n\n+Finally removed the dumb treasure revealing shenanigans the previous installments had. This mechanic was trash and no one found anything with it without Laplace's eye. I didn't realize how happy I would be now that we had mario blocks instead of the dumb Treasure finding shenanigans.\n\n+On this note, the new challenge system is nice as we get mini-achievements throughout our playthrough. It does feel satisfying and it definitely feels like a well-made system. I am upset some things are locked behind the challenges but overall this was an upgrade from the previous title. There may be a tad bit too many challenges tho.\n\n+The plan system is still the fun resource that we know and love that changes the game and adds to the grind. It is still the same plan system as ever with nothing new but it still is nice to have. Again still super important as lots of stuff is locked behind plans.\n\n+I found the story to be on par with rebirth 1 or even better. Definitely infinitely better than the story of rebirth 2. I am happy to say they didn't go downhill from the story of rebirth 2. The main cast having Plutia definitely made the experience much more entertaining. I am happy to say this one kept me entertained as Neptune meets the same people but in a different dimension. Maybe I feel this way since rebirth 2 story was just boring since the main cast wasn't as good.\n\n+The world is still filled with a lot of references from different games and is still fun to read through all the unimportant dialogue. There is a ton of funny dialogue with the DLC. I am happy to say the gaming references are still everywhere as you can expect in the series. That being said if you are the type to get annoyed at a lot of notifs and are uninterested with the characters this part may annoy you since it feels like its the most in the series.\n\n+This version has a lot of free DLC so you have a big choice of characters to play throughout the story. On this note, I am again happy to say, you can just keep playing your favorite characters instead of having to grind everyone since this game doesn't have any power creep.\n\n+The big numbers are here. There really isn't a big change in terms of gameplay when compared to rebirth 2 so most of the combat is the same except for the fact that you can focus on going for challenges now too.\n\n+Of course the reason we are in this rabbit hole is the characters. They are all still great, quirky and entertaining with one another. Despite being from a different dimension, the characters are still pretty much the same lovable bunch. This game we have much much much more screentime for Noire so that gets a big plus from me. Of course not to mention the inclusion of Iris Heart. I skip almost all animations in this game's combat but when I use the skill Verbal Abuse from Iris Heart, the l1 button remains unpressed. Neptune and Plutia being the main duo just really makes this game.\n\n+The soundtrack is still amazing as again, it is basically the same as the previous two titles. On the note of sound design, the voice acting is still godlike for both subs and dubs. Iris Heart being voiced by Kana Hanazawa is a godsend and a bonus to the already amazing cast of voice actors this series has.\n\n+Again, there is still fanservice for all.\n\n-Repetitive design for monsters and dungeons makes it a chore to traverse through new dungeons sometimes. It also doesn't help that there's a lot of required quests to progress through the story so you will be going back through these sometimes.\n\n-There is a lot of 4th wall-breaking in the dialogue. This might seem like a plus but god there is actually a metric ton worth of 4th wall-breaking and they really milked it and it got tiring and boring.\n\n-Why are EXE skills locked behind challenges... Specifically the use 100 skills challenge. This was very very frustrating to unlock honestly.\n\n-On the note of unlocking, there are so many plans locked behind Stella's dungeon. I never even reached the break the damage limit plan throughout the game.\n\n-Again like the other installments you will be missing out on stuff and plans if you don't go for new game+\n\nOverall still a really fun game and definitely an upgrade from rebirth 2.

This quick overview aims to tell you if RB3 is the one you should purchase:\n\n[u]Does ReBirth 3 run without issues on a modern rig?[/u]\nWell, there are three things to consider here:\n1) Idea Factory was being [i]very[/i] unskilled at PC ports back in the day so you have to manually set your wanted resolution and borderless option in the game config files.\n2) Even if you chose a high resolution, the game has not by default changeable features such as low quality AA that still make it look pixelated. To combat this you can use a third party mod called \"Neptastic\" that puts the game visually very close to modded Megadimension VII.\n3) The game sadly was coded with a 2GB memory cap and already used to crash every now and then in vanilla. But adding Neptastic will increase this problem immsensely since you now use up more memory. So you will also need to patch the exe of the game to a 4GB limit. Despite that crashes will occur and you need to save often.\n\n[u]Okay, so why should I bother with this mess at all?[/u]\nRebirth3 has several things going for it, that you will not get in any other game produced after it:\n- It has by far the largest cast of characters\n- It has by far the longest story\n- The story is actually somewhat decent and not just a load of Nep Bull\n- Countless references to anime and gaming\n- It's the last game featuring strategic combat with a guard gaunge on the enemies\n- It has a much cleaner interface and menu structure over RB1 and RB2\n- Many hidden dungeons\n- Countless unlockables and grinds\n\n[u]And where are the cons?[/u]\n- Far less dungeon variety than VII\n- The presentation aka coolness factor of transforming is more basic\n- Stella dungeon is just annoying\n- You need to put the time in to unlock stuff like exe drive individually per character\n- If you prefered the simple combat structure of VII you might feel annoyed by guard break\n- If you prefered the more complex combat structure of Sega Hard girls you might feel annoyed by just saving up SP to exe bosses right away\n\nIn any case: Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 3 is the one Nep game that's still worth picking up so many years after its release. And that one already was a remaster of Victory. For the best vintage Nep experience this is the game for you.

The game has a lot to offer, and if you're a fan of these types of games, I would highly recommend a relaxed and fun playthrough. The CG artwork, soundtrack, and voice acting are honestly really good (pretty high tier talent involved) and the story never really gets dull or just an over the top grind. \n\nIn regards to getting 100% achievement, I spent a bit of time trying to set up the routes to the True ending (e.g. getting plans for optional dungeons, finding the materials for Stella's Dungeon Floors, and went through multiple game cycles to get everything in Chapter specific events) and would highly recommend using a guide for a bit of a  more optimized setup. This is down to personal preference, but it's really not worth your time to try and find the intricacies all on your own, especially since the Harem chip is designed to dramatically cut the Lily rank grind down and there's really not much information on how to efficiently utilize it otherwise.\n\nA complaint that I have for this port would be that whenever I am in a dungeon and use a symbol attack or get into a battle, I'm teleported across the map to a fixed spot, or across the entire dungeon when I would be farming a specific enemy for Quests. I read online about it being a Vsync issue or something related to monitor refresh rate with the game, but was not really able to find a viable solution and just had to deal with it. While it didn't really deter me from finishing the plat, it definitely was annoying, and hopefully a fix can be found or better communicated so it doesn't leave a bad impression for newer players (I never had this problem in the other games). \n\nUltimately, I would highly recommend this game, as I feel it is the strongest addition to the Re;Verse games and has a lot of content to work with.

Its a game that has a lot of inside jokes and that relies on you understanding the cast quite well. Its fun and builds of the best parts of the previous games to make it way stronger. \n\nThe story is simpler then rebirth 2 but much more consistent in enjoyment. There are some small twists and interesting plot elements that keep the overall plot just as engaging as the usual banter between parties that you should be used to if you played a Neptunia game before.\n\nThe combat is simple but a lot more dynamic compare to the previous games, its even more flashy and allows for a lot more customization of party lineups. Out of the first 3 rebirth games I spent the most time here but it honestly didn't really feel all that bad in the end. The animations in combat are really fun and keep the combat engaging even in the late game.\n\nMy main complaint would be that the absolute last couple areas require you to grind and even once you grinded and clear everything it seems like they didn't put THAT much effort into the reward for clearing everything in the game. I would have loved to see more effort put into these dungeons. In the end they are absolutely not necessary to enjoy the main bulk of the game and it doesn't get in the way of the main story, but it still sucks to not be rewarded with much after all that work.\n\nIn the end its another Neptunia game but I would honestly say this is the best out of the Rebirth trilogy.

Critics often describe gameplay is a severe drawback to this franchise, and while I can't speak for the other two games, I did not feel that to be the case in this game. The attack styles and skills had enough variety that I felt as though my strategy decisions were meaningful. It's nothing revolutionary but it will not impact your enjoyment of the game. My only complaint is that most of the dungeons feel a bit lacking in terms of utility after the post-game, and only one or two are worth grinding in.\n\n2. In general, the story is fine, taking on a more light-hearted tone compared to its predecessor. The bread and butter of Neptunia is putting the cast into a room together and watching them interact in goofy ways so it gets the job done. Speaking of the cast...\n\n3. Plutia is adorable. I love everything about her character, from her soft and fluffy design, to her bubbly (and slightly sadistic) personality, to her absurd attack style. Even her snail-like speech cadence is great as it means I get to listen to her speak just a bit longer. I think Neptunia would really benefit from adding more characters with unusual weapon choices because seeing her fight bosses using semi-animated dolls in her pajamas brings a smile to my face every time I see it. PLEASE bring her back in another mainline game and not retcon her from existence like she was in VII :')\n\n10/10 would take naps with Plutia again.

The formula proved to be so succesful that Victory's engine and systems were used for the Re;Birth remakes of the first two Neptunia games, as well as the base for [url=store.steampowered.com/app/524580]Fairy Fencer[/url].\n\nIn this adventure Neptune travels to another dimension called the Ultra Dimension, where she meets another Planeptune CPU called Plutia as well as all new and redesigned versions of Noire, Blanc and Vert. The star of the show is of course Plutia, she's based on Sega Megadrive and is a bipolar sleepy head with a very special transformation gimmick. She acts as a second protagonist and stays with you for the whole game. Together with Neptune they have excellent synergy and their stunts and antics are lots of fun. The game's story is also pretty clever and covers a very long period of gaming history, from the Atari video game crash to the release of the first Xbox console, hence the different designs for Noire, Blanc and Vert, as they're supposed to be retro versions of their usual selves. There's a pretty large cast of awesome villains and some other CPU's will also be joining the fray as the story develops further.\n\nThe gameplay is the smoothest in the series. It's neither too hard nor too easy, and you never need to grind. Material gathering has been streamlined with a better version of the Stella's Dungeon mini-game (first featured in Re;Birth 2). There's no need to grind shares or lily ranks to unlock any content. The only possibly questionable change is the removal of the EXE gauge, you now use SP for EXE drives and everyone has 1000 SP which can be replenished via either rush attacks or consumables. Returning to world map doesn't restore SP.\n\nThe game is quite long at 50+ hours. There are 3 endings (bad, normal, true), and reaching the true ending unlocks a lengthy post-game chapter with its own story and events. Almost all of the characters in the series are playable, one way or another.\n\nTo sum it up, whether you're a newcomer or an old fan, Re;Birth 3 is a must play if you have any interest in Neptunia or Idea Factory games in general. You can even play it as your first Neptunia game, as Re;Birth 1 is non-canon and there's only a few references to Re;Birth 2.", "timestamp_created": 1623622740, "timestamp_updated": 1625021304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539460241794586182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93601287": {"recommendationid": "93601287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150153033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 14571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14571, "last_played": 1622783837}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably the best neptunia game in term of storyline and progression at least for me\ntbh i love all the neptunia series (except the one they tried to port on VR) and this piece is the one had me enjoy the most.\n", "timestamp_created": 1623470462, "timestamp_updated": 1623470462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92127842": {"recommendationid": "92127842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198461348606", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 597, "last_played": 1647911611}, "language": "english", "review": "It has funny nep", "timestamp_created": 1621206024, "timestamp_updated": 1621206024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91963581": {"recommendationid": "91963581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122760895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 5141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5141, "last_played": 1469863552}, "language": "english", "review": "Rebirth 3 is a great game and a must play if you liked the first two nep games.", "timestamp_created": 1620968480, "timestamp_updated": 1620968480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91622970": {"recommendationid": "91622970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198954912560", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 579, "last_played": 1695934797}, "language": "english", "review": "Plutia", "timestamp_created": 1620443853, "timestamp_updated": 1620443853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91610594": {"recommendationid": "91610594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085790847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 8214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8211, "last_played": 1625473542}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Nepgear needs more love![/b]", "timestamp_created": 1620424215, "timestamp_updated": 1620424215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91155312": {"recommendationid": "91155312", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131942944", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1626357590}, "language": "english", "review": "it's neptunia game", "timestamp_created": 1619767789, "timestamp_updated": 1619767789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590316593647003174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91092230": {"recommendationid": "91092230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424963869", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1619250931}, "language": "english", "review": " \"This is the majesty of a CPU!

While the writing itself back to being amusing and irreverent, 70% of the entire game's main story is filler, and conversations go on for so, so long, with often little purpose. You will be fighting each of this game's villain group, the Seven Sages, 3-4 times each, even to the frustration of the characters themselves. This, of course, is not the first time that Neptunia has recycled villains, but it is the first time that you win each fight, for the character to simply be let go and perpetrate a new Saturday-morning-villain-esque plan. It's boring and does nothing to progress the plot or facilitate character growth--it's just fluff.\n\nAs with any Neptunia game, you need to go into this game expecting a visual novel with RPG elements, there's 'that' much. Yes, the gameplay itself is designed to be classic JRPG grind and played through multiple times, but after the first run you will be shocked at how quickly the game flies by when you're skipping the copious dialogue. That in mind, the gameplay is the same as ever, though extra attention has been given to the pacing of skills, items and plans in this game, making it feel a lot more thought out and less game-breaking. Still, if you're familiar with the Neptunia format then you will be falling right back into that same groove, with all the same enemy types and maps, so don't burn yourself out if you've just finished Re;Birth 2.\n\nRe;Birth 3 lacks the strong story arc and supporting characters that Re1 had, focusing almost exclusively on the new main character, Plutia, and the CPUs interactions with the new villains. There is no main goal of the story, and the CPUs just kinda faff around, responding to things as they happen, leading to zero urgency and the characters themselves calling certain (critical path) events a waste of time or side-story. If you like the Neptunia format and writing, it's more of the same, and will satiate you in the same way an anime series' movie will give you a taste of what you loved, but ultimately leave you wanting more and craving the original. That said, Plutia and Peachy are instant favourites and welcome additions to the cast, and elevate the game from being pure fan-fiction, but I could do with less sexual assault.\n\nSpeaking of which, adding Peachy and Plutia to Re;Birth 1 as DLC was kinda a massive spoiler for this game's story, so... that's a shame.", "timestamp_created": 1618250622, "timestamp_updated": 1618250622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483271360397338867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89860483": {"recommendationid": "89860483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024340430", "num_games_owned": 1968, "num_reviews": 6500, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1617758768}, "language": "english", "review": "Metal Gear Solid 4 story telling.\n\nWith coomer bait.", "timestamp_created": 1617758989, "timestamp_updated": 1617758989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345238089561462402", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89784943": {"recommendationid": "89784943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199844462", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 885, "last_played": 1632582860}, "language": "english", "review": "nep nep", "timestamp_created": 1617647091, "timestamp_updated": 1617647091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89511085": {"recommendationid": "89511085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096856503", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 7270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7252, "last_played": 1635639987}, "language": "english", "review": "Nepstation is where I get my news", "timestamp_created": 1617300644, "timestamp_updated": 1617300644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89470778": {"recommendationid": "89470778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133180557", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1627950781}, "language": "english", "review": "Its funny. :3", "timestamp_created": 1617242218, "timestamp_updated": 1617242218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537037014961242676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89297342": {"recommendationid": "89297342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026084461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2755, "last_played": 1617001276}, "language": "english", "review": "Having beaten the rebirth 1 and 2 I believe this one is loads better.

With Plutia as my favorite (if you couldn't tell) it has a lot of great characters, they're all funny and have a great story.

The villains are ridiculous, the characters are as always fun, the other dimension premise is just that and you can't expect a serious story when one of your mains is Iris Heart. People say this game is really mean towards Nepgear but it does it as an actual joke, it doesn't just s*** on the character. Honestly i ended up liking Nepgear a lot more in this game than i ever did in the previous one. I think the problem was that while RB2 focused on Nepgear, RB1 and 3 follow Neptune around but their stories don't really focus just on her.\n\nCombat changed a bit, but not really that much. I found it a bit too easy (it's the third game with the same mechanics after all) so i used Fortify Enemies from the start, that made it pretty hard at times but fun (if you enjoy that kind of thing).\n\nThe localization of this game is terrible, just awful. There's a very easy to apply patch for that that improves it a lot (if you like MEMEptune then keep it as it is).\nAs always the japanese voice acting is great and covers almost everything (even the dlc characters events), the english voices are VERY limited in this one.\n\nThe game is a bit noisy, the character's footsteps sound like buckets instead of shoes and the constant jingle every time you get a character achievement is a bit too much.\n\nOne thing i kind of disliked was the lack of playable characters relevant to the story.

In typical Nep fashion though the dialogue is why you want to play this game, and it's one of the funniest in the series imo.\n\nIt also comes with a bunch of free DLC which is great and is actually pretty challenging because unlike previous titles you don't get access to the high end colosseum fights until right near the end of the game and the equipment they give you. There is a lot to do in this game, especially the post game stuff after the true ending, and the bonus fights are much easier than previous entries because they don't block your skills and items, be warned the strongest boss in the game is in one of the post game stories and even at level 999 is quite hard. My playtime is how long it took to get all achievements and do everything, it will take you less depending on what you want to do.\n\nIf you're a fan of Nep games or looking for a JRPG that doesn't take itself seriously and provides a nice change compared to all the serious titles out there I'd recommend this title.

Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory - I consider Re;Birth3 to be a step backwards. I'm truly not a big fan of Re;Birth3, despite how much it actually attempts to remix and improve upon what Victory did bad.\n\n[h1]Here are areas where Re;Birth3 improves upon Victory:[/h1]\n- Reduced difficulty.\nVictory was sort of infamous for being insanely tough and very grindy. I've counted many times on Victory where I was thrown into a boss battle, only to realize I was incredibly under-leveled and underprepared for it. A perfect example would be the first Blanc boss battle where I had to grind nearly 15 levels to actually stand a chance against her. Re;Birth3 solves this problem by not only reducing the difficulty overall, but also by essentially shoving overpowered characters into your party that make grinding pretty much a non-issue.\n- Additional story content.\nRe;Birth3 attempts to remix the story from Victory by adding additional supplementary material. You get to experience it as soon as you start the game as you are thrown into a VR-esque world as Neptune and navigate a mini-dungeon to escape it. Stuff like that is peppered throughout the game and it's a welcome addition.\n- More maker characters.\nVictory as a whole was only played with CPU characters. IF and Compa were not playable and it didn't have any other maker characters, at least not without DLC to my understanding. Re;Birth3 solves that problem by giving you more maker characters to use in battle and actually incorporates them into the story without drastically altering everything.\n- Framerate.\nVictory on PS3 is also infamous for running like absolute crap. The game can't even hold a steady 30 FPS most of the time and dips into the teens very frequently. For some - that makes the game absolutely unplayable and I can understand that. Thankfully, Re;Birth3 solves that issue with a silky smooth, uncapped framerate, or you can choose to manually cap it to 60 with VSync or something.\n\n[h1]Here are areas where Re;Birth3 falls short compared to Victory:[/h1]\n- The PC port.\nI had a lot of trouble with the PC port of Re;Birth3 in particular. From random softlocks, game crashes, black screens, etc., it was genuinely frustrating at times to deal with this poor port of the game. There are tons of community made patches for these issues, but unless you know where to look - the experience out of the box is not going to be a pleasant one.\n- The gameplay.\nRe;Birth1 and Re;Birth2 were heavily based upon Victory's gameplay. Heck, I'd argue those games are just reskins of Victory slapped onto Steam, which wouldn't exactly be inaccurate, but those games are superior because Victory's gameplay formula [b]works.[/b] Re;Birth3 attempts to mix things up from the other Re;Birth games by changing one small yet crucial mechanic - [b]the EXE drive.[/b] Short and to the point - it's annoying and cumbersome in this game, making it way less useful than it was in the previous games.\n- No scouting system.\nThe scouting system in the original, while a bit annoying since it was required for the True Ending, was overall a fun side-mechanic to unlock optional dungeons you can use for grinding or getting useful items early on if you get lucky. That system is gone from Re;Birth3 and instead replaced with the much slower, much less useful Stella's Dungeon mechanic.\n\nI'm sorry to say but I don't really recommend Re;Birth3. The additions and improvements are nice and all, but with a crappy PC port, inferior gameplay due to the gimped EXE system and the removal of the scouting system makes me prefer the original version of the game by a longshot. It sucks too because I think that Victory's story, despite being incredibly long and the cutscenes feeling like they take 60 years to complete, is the best in the series, considering it's the perfect chance to get to know a set of CPUs from a different dimension right down from their humble beginnings.\n\nVictory/Re;Birth3 takes place in what's canonically known as the Ultradimension, and you begin the game in a very primitive version of Gamindustri with 2 nations, eventually expanding into 5 as you go on through the game. You get to see each CPU's humble beginnings and how they deal with hardships running their nations and all that stuff - it goes through a very Neptunia-esque story about competition, co-operation and then defeating some bigger villain in the picture. In Victory/Re;Birth3 - you get to experience every waking [i]moment[/i] and, to me - that makes the story engaging and a lot more personal. I seriously prefer the Ultradimension CPUs to the Hyperdimension ones.\n\nIt's just a shame that Re;Birth3 is just not very good in my opinion. If you have a PS3 and don't mind the flaws I pointed out about Victory here - that version is the one you should get, should you want to experience it. But if you don't and are considering Re;Birth3 - at least consider looking into fixing the awful PC port yourself via community patches so the game doesn't freeze or softlock constantly for you.", "timestamp_created": 1593436339, "timestamp_updated": 1593436339, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707013070583343506", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71615894": {"recommendationid": "71615894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065196550", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 701, "last_played": 1593533015}, "language": "english", "review": "neptuneia", "timestamp_created": 1593392948, "timestamp_updated": 1593392948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477941185235977173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71592364": {"recommendationid": "71592364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059398282", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1987, "last_played": 1592846322}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, it mocks itself.

A massive portion of the humour in this game delves down to \"lmao boobs\", there was boob jokes in the previous titles but not to the extent that there is in this game, it's just ridiculous. I mean, that's all Vert's character is in this game \"I have the boob, oh smeg she has the bigger boob REEEEEEeeEEEEEeeee\" and I hate it. SPeaking of the characters, I fuckin hate Plutie, dunno what it is but I just canna stand her, she pisses me off to no extent, one of the main reasons I dunna like this title. Actually, I felt like all the characters got a massive downgrade character wise in this one, everyone just felt wrong and off and like they were trying too hard to be what they were in the previous titles but just weren't (And yes I know \"hurr durr they're the counterparts from another dimension, they're not the same\", but I don't give a fuck, they're worse than they wore before, even Nep felt wrong).\n\nOnto actual gameplay, they fucked the combat I feel. Yeah it's the exact same combat system as Rebirth 1 and 2, but the removal of the EXE bar and having absolutely everything tied to SP was a dumbass desicion I think. SP is static, you can't increase your total amount, it's always 1000, which makes the fact that every special move, the exe moves, and even the combo finishes depend on your SP dumb. Beacuse exe and finishers are tied to it, I felt like that if I used special moves in combat I was being penizlised because I couldn't maximise my damage outside of them because the rest of the time i'd be farming SP with weaker moves just to do decent damage, spent most of the time ignoring the specials because of it and only using EXE attacks to finish fights off. \n\nI liked the addition of the character challenges and was happy to see them come back in Mega Nep V II, which i've yet to finish but am already enjoying it a shit load more than this one. But that's about it for enjoyment, didn't really like the \"new\" characters, the story, or the combat changes. Did the game twice, once for the normal ending and then again for the true ending because the normal ending was so bad that it made me angry so I had to go through again to be less mad. \n\nOh and also Nepgear gets absolutely shafted in this game, and being a Nepgear fan this also jades my view on the game. \n\nSo my main reasons for disliking the game are Plutie being awful, and Nepgear getting skuffed. but I don't give a fuck I don't like the game, worst in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1574543142, "timestamp_updated": 1574591297, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4,

Some gameplay but mostly story wise. There is no motivation behind the actions of the protagonist and the rest of the main cast, their motivation should be protecting their people but from what we can see in the game, that's just not true for most of them. And the main antagonist is a hypocrite, I mean she thinks that the CPUs are bad at their job while she on the other hand was absolutely horrible at it. The  new character Plutia is pretty bad, in her base form she is a generic cutie girl, while transformed she is a sadistic girl for no reason whatsoever. She at times ruins the story by being op compared to the others for no reason. And then there are the minor villains who just lack a backstory completely, some got way more potential than Rei, but they are wasted. Not to mention the countless plot holes.

[/h1]\n\nI must say that I am very pleased with this game as they finally brought back the roots, the original style of the story to what it was like in Rebirth 1. \n\nThis game generally did much better than Rebirth 2 not only in the story, but also with the introduction of new unique characters to play as and new enemies. The battle interface and system is also new and improved.\n\nSpeaking about characters, there is a particularly interesting character in this game that may send shivers down your spine or get you excited; a sadistic woman that will show you what it means to squeal, cry and beg for mercy while she finds pleasure in giving you pain. So try not to make her angry if possible.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful Neptunia game and I highly urge all Neptunia fans to play this, after playing Rebirth 1 and 2 of course.\n\nOh yeah, did I tell you not to make Iris Heart angry because you\u2019ll be in serious trouble if you do?\n\n10/10  Would make Iris Heart angry again and suffer the consequences", "timestamp_created": 1553558441, "timestamp_updated": 1634017275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49749273": {"recommendationid": "49749273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085941437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1553723489}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Wonderful Fun for Turn-Based RPG Fans [/h1]\n\nI will update this review when I have more time logged onto it. But I just got done playing Megadimension Victory II and booting up Cyberdimension 4 Goddesses Online. Those games are very sad compared to this game. This game is an example of why the Neptunia series has so many fans. IFI...please return to making great games like this.\n\n[b] The Good Points [/b]\n\n1) You get a plan to make a weapon. It tells you what you need to farm to get what you need. You go farm, you build the plan, and you buy the weapon. It's beautiful and simple.\n\n2) The story flows naturally instead of completely depending on the \"converse\" option of MDVII.\n\n3) The sound is sharp and the graphics are crisp. This game is not a shabby port. It is a work of art.\n\n4) You can play with the team you want to play with without worrying about grinding for 10 hours in the same dungeon just to catch up the party members that were left behind due to all the party member swapping that is mandatory in MDVII.\n\n5) Turning on and off world plans using system memory is genius for a game built on the idea of gaming world. If you don't want the EXP booster you got from the DLC, turn it off in game! It's user friendly, lore-friendly, and freaking AWESOME! How about some of that user-friendliness in MDVII?\n\n6) This is very minor, but...I LOVE the \"battle complete\" fan fare music in the Hyperdimension games. It is missing from MDVII. I want it back.\n\n7) Quests happen when they are supposed to...unlike how they get dumped into the bucket in MDVII. If you get a quest in a Hyperdimension game, you can go do it right then (or soon after). If you get a quest in MDVII, you may not be able to do it for 30 more game hours (no joke).\n\n\n[b] The Bad Points [/b]\n\n1) To afford a single costume you must get the most valuable coliseum award in the game three times. This is just nuts. I would have LOVED to have been able to buy the costumes via DLC.\n\n2) I couldn't turn in a quest because I didn't know that the boss event I was staring at would make the quest I just completed expire. But it wasn't necessary that I hand in the quest, so it's no big deal. And now that I know that this sort of thing happens, I can work to prevent it in the future.\n\n3) The A and B buttons seems to be transposed. As a result, I occasionally cancel my attack when I mean to use a guard break attack. Again, it's no big deal.\n\n4) There is no new game plus. There is no way to play the whole game through with your favorite waifu team in their favorite duds...even if you do all that insane work to get the costumes.", "timestamp_created": 1553497401, "timestamp_updated": 1553720979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49723120": {"recommendationid": "49723120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041016520", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2866, "last_played": 1565563923}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the most fun game I have every played :)", "timestamp_created": 1553378261, "timestamp_updated": 1553378261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49616158": {"recommendationid": "49616158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332570268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 6904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6784, "last_played": 1557819712}, "language": "english", "review": "Waifu Candidate: Plutia <3", "timestamp_created": 1552838230, "timestamp_updated": 1552838230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49490071": {"recommendationid": "49490071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074538860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1484278188}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Las historias pueden ser cortas, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed entretenidas, tanto como amo esta saga, espero alg\u00fan d\u00eda dejar la pereza y sacarle el 200% y todos sus finales :D", "timestamp_created": 1552251908, "timestamp_updated": 1552251908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49457007": {"recommendationid": "49457007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110927941", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1558787712}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played only a bit of this game i'm enjoyed it as much as the others, this game is still as fun as the others and i'm liking it also more than the first one becouse of the change of characters, i like a lot Plutia's change of personality and it being in a different place than the first and second game, the stages might get repetitive after a while but it's not something bad and you do get showered with stuff right from the start if you have the dlcs on.", "timestamp_created": 1552137548, "timestamp_updated": 1552137548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49420522": {"recommendationid": "49420522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095082555", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 342, "playtime_forever": 2371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1617, "last_played": 1553798386}, "language": "english", "review": "A great return to form!

I have Intel Core Graphics GPU, and the file was ig75icd32.dll. \n\nWith `dumpbin -exports`, I found that the function exports in the dll was exactly the same as ig8icd32.dll in system directory (sysWOW64 for x64 archetecture's x86 dlls).\n\nIt is highly likely that steam's driver conflicts with the driver installed on the system, and the game may crash because of a conflicting function call. I removed the steam dll from the game directory, and the game runs as if nothing has happened. Currently I can't safely say that the crashing problem is solved (still need more time to see), but this solution did not bring about new problems as far as I've learned.\n\nOther vendors' driver may also have similar problems, and manually changing them may or may not solve the problem.\n\n(DLL Hell again...)\n\nIn all, the game is a great game.

There's several new characters and several jokes that are actually quite creative.\n\nThe wave of enjoyment continues, but after a few chapters, I began to notice a pattern.  There was a lot, and I mean a [i]ton[/i] of side dialogue.  This is usally a great thing in games, but it drastically distracted from the JRPG elements of the game.  Most of the hours I have in this game aren't gameplay hours, but rather time spent reading a ton of side conversations.\n\nWhen you [i]do[/i] play the game though, it's quite enjoyable.  There's a few minor improvements to the systems, including Stella's Dungeon and a 'passive' stat gain.  Some characters seem overly weak compared to others, but much of this is due to bundled DLCs.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good Re;Birth game.

Plato's Republic. All the characters ever do is make a few game references, compare breast sizes, or whine about having to do any work while your stereotypical serious character scolds them for being lazy. Then proceed to milk the \"joke,\" the \"comedy,\" if you will, for endless hours on end. Or at least feels like hours to me because of inane the dialogue really is.\n\nLike seriously...there IS a story to this game, but I'm not quite sure what it is because my attention span just goes right out the window when the characters needlessly and endlessly prattle on about being geeky gamers and making fun of each other in the most unclever and childish ways possible. I THINK the story is supposed to have a bit of political intrigue?\n\nThere are several lands run by CPUs/ie the main waifus who are supposed to represent different real life gaming consoles (though I don't see how other than the colour scheme of their clothes...err...kind of?) and there's a group of generic villains called the Seven Sages who want to NOT have CPUs rule the lands, but also want to enforce better rules for each land. Some of citizens actually agree with their ideas on how to organize society, and then...I dunno? That's kind of mentioned for like...a second before the characters proceed to just insult each other endlessly and needlessly as I already mentioned.\n\nBut yeah...the gameplay is good, though. It's nothing revolutionary, but it is actually fun to play its battle system where you can assign different combo attacks per character. I think it's a decent system to focus on breaking the enemy's guard before spamming heavy attacks or using rush attacks to build up our combo number for...I forget what that contributes to.\n\nAnyway! As you can tell my thoughts and opinions on this game are kind of scattered and poorly written. Such is the effect of having to put up with the most inane and meaningless dialogue of any game, book, TV show, or movie I have ever experienced in my life. If the developers could hire an editor to help cut down some of the excess dialogue so that we actually get a good balance between comedy and story progression that would be greeaaaaat. But as it stands now, the comedy lands for only a short chuckle until you are forced to put up with milked out and watered down versions of the original joke while the characters proceed to prattle on and on and on and on and on and on and on...", "timestamp_created": 1537300718, "timestamp_updated": 1537300718, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534997761249542236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44715776": {"recommendationid": "44715776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296887293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1493228224}, "language": "english", "review": "This is now my Very Favorite Video Game!

Since this is my first game in the Neptunia games I will not understand most of the characters so I dont have a huge say on them. (Other than Plutia) Which is great because this game informed me what a CPU is and it kinda gave me a 'You need to play the other games to know' situation but it was fine!

Casi todos los eventos se dan en una nueva dimensi\u00f3n introducida en esta entrega, la cual estar\u00e1 conectada a la anterior en la trama. Tiene 3 posibles desenlaces, y considero todos ellos v\u00e1lidos, a diferencia de los 9 del juego anterior. Por lo general, me ha gustado m\u00e1s que la de la entrega previa, y los personajes nuevos me han parecido bastante interesantes.\n[*]La tercera parte de la saga viene con todos los DLCs excepto uno preinstalados con el juego base, algo que extiende bastante su duraci\u00f3n y contenido.

Esta parte vuelve a pecar de imperfecciones arregladas en la anterior; se reutilizan demasiadas mazmorras tanto del primer juego como del segundo, \"compensando\", en cierto modo, con un par de escenarios nuevos con dise\u00f1os remarcablemente atractivos.

Thankfully, the devs appear to have thought the same way because Neptunia 3, or \"V Generation\", is a welcome return to the sort of game that I enjoyed so much with the first installment with its mix of comedy and fourth-wall breaking. And having the characters talk about the size of their boobs.\n\nA few years after the second game, the land of Gamindustri is back to relative normality with the CPU's on good terms and running their nations. Except for Neptune, of course, who is far too busy playing tons of games to do any actual work - much to the annoyance of the oracle Histoire and her younger sister Nepgear. But after being forced to get out of her home and do some quests, Neptune suddenly finds herself getting sucked into a portal and falling (again) into an alternate dimension. But when I say Alternate dimension, it actually is also something of a return to the past as the only nations that exist in this other world are Planeptune (Sega) and Lowee (Nintendo). In other words, Neptune has entered a world reminicent of the older \"console wars\" of the late 1980's and early 1990's. So Neptune, over the course of years of trying to figure out how to return to her dimension and screwing around, gets to witness the evolution of Gamindustri from the late 1980's to around the mid 2000's. And for the cast to compare boob sizes with the other characters and CPU's.\n\nThis was actually rather interesting to me seeing what this game portrayed and then to try to compare it to my sketchy knowledge of how things went in real life. I didn't get all of the references or what everything was meant to represent, but I got enough to understand and enjoy the story. Planeptune comes off as a nation that somehow survives against all odds despite its CPU's being extremely lazy and not doing their job. Lowee is the ancient nation with a traditional Japanese look, but which hampers itself by being closed off to the outside and lacking innovation. Lastation enters the fray and quickly surpasses both of its rivals due to being driven by innovation and seeking constant improvement. Leanbox jumps into the game after watching from the sidelines for a while, but ends up having far more bark than bite and doesn't make much of an initial impact. Lastly, there is a \"PC Continent\" in one of the DLC packs which is a gated land reserved only for those over 18 and is implied to be a haven for [i]massive[/i] amounts of porn. If that last one didn't tip you off, then i'll say now that the Gamindustri that Neptunia 3 depicts appears to be the Japanese gaming market rather than the global one. At least that's how it came off to me. Either way, you get to go to all of these places as Neptune throughout the course of the game and enjoy the stories that unfold. And to watch characters try to come up with ways to make their boobs grow bigger.\n\nCharacter-wise, there are two major additions aside from the cast of villains: Plutia and Peashy. Both of these characters were DLC party members in the first game, and if you read my review of it you will know that Plutia in particular was a very powerful party member with a bizzare character transformation. This time, Plutia and Peashy are actual characters that you get to spend quite alot of time with as part of the main plot. Plutia, who is the alternate dimension CPU of Planeptune, is a sleepy stuffed animal-making girl that comes off as a massive airhead. But when she transforms she ends up becoming a psycho dominatrix who speaks in innuendos, terrifies everyone she meets, and inflicts severe trauma upon numerous characters. Compared to this, Peashy is rather dull by being little more than a super-strong little kid who floats between cute and annoying. And as a topic of annoyance for the other characters because Peashy has the largest boobs in the entire cast when she transforms.\n\nRegarding the villains, the piracy allegory that annoyed me so much in Neptunia 2 appears to be gone entirely in favor of... something else. To be perfectly honest, I'm not entirely sure what they were all meant to represent. One of them, Rei Ryghts, is spelled out quite clearly, but it is more murky for the others. The impression I ended up coming up with was that they were supposed to represent moral guardian types who wanted to completely fuck up Gamindustri. But unlike the Piracy issue where I consider it to be a fight between two dark greys rather than the black and white Neptunia 2 portrayed it as, this is far less ambiguous. Moral guardians are just shitheads, so I had absolutely no problem with them being depicted as such. It certainly gave me extra motivation to beat them up when their boss battles came up. And to watch their secret meetings where they didn't talk about boobs.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is pretty much the same as it has been for previous Neptunia games. The same JRPG stuff. The same cloned repetitive dungeons. The same need to grind levels to fight tougher enemies. And so on. The biggest change is the SP/EXE bar which now is limited to 1,000 for all characters. This is rather annoying since it means that the best moves can't be used much at all and you have to do a fair number of regular attacks to recharge it. Little problem against trash monsters in the dungeons. A bit more of a problem against harder boss fights. Also thanks to DLC, Stella's Dungeon now takes far less time to explore and so has become less annoying. Once you get the best equipment, it really does become a quick and easy way to get a bunch of items. And it is something you will probably want to check to see if it is finished after having gone through lengthy scenes where a fight nearly starts over the importance of boob size.\n\nNeptunia 3 brought the series back to the more comedic tone found in the first game, but which took a backseat in the second. The story was surprisingly enjoyable as a journey through the history of game consoles. The characters are as good as they always have been in this series, with Plutia being a particularly fun addition to the cast. Gameplay is still a JRPG slog, but it is made much easier with the bonus \"Plans\" you can get that boost XP gain and such. After having been so annoyed by Neptunia 2's piracy allegory that I gave it a \"no\" recommendation for ruining my fun, this was a welcome return to what I had enjoyed about the first Neptunia game. Actually, Neptunia 3 is probably my favorite game in the series so far. An easy \"yes\" from me. With only one more game left in the \"main\" story to play (for now), I do wonder how this will all wrap up. Hopefully it will end on a high note.\n\nBy the way, this game has alot of dialogue about boobs.

way less subtle and while Neptunia has never been a subtle franchise I don't like that much that this time everything goes too much in your face, the characters are pretty much the same that in the previous games, stereotypes that make fun of jrpg tropes and nepgear (the protagonist of the previous game) tones down the self-deprication and becomes a little less annoying (she still is though) aside from that, it's what you expect from the franchise, nothing amazing, nothing terrible, makes fun of more jrpg tropes and tries to have fun with itself\n\nNow the scores:\n\nReal Score:

Prime examples would be those who voice Nepgear (Purple Sister), who generally has a cute yet concerned voice so that story can be coherently be told to the player with out much consideration on character perspectives twisting anything. (Imagining Neptune rather than Nepgear commentating on the current state of the story and how.... o wait.) Another example of voice acting would be that of both Noire and AnnoyDeath (A villian), who perfectly harmonize in there over the top performance and complement on another so well, which makes for some hillarious scenes between the two. You can see for yourself on Youtube of the scene from the anime between to the two if you are undecided on whether to buy the game or not.\n\n-The most colourful and interesting cast to choose from to date, introducing all of the playable characters from Rebirth 1 and 2, whilst also introducing further characters to play around with. With there being a wide arrange of characters to play overall, the game also allows you to play in whatever play style you want to, with a variety of balances between offence and defence, as well as combinations that allow you to really break the damage cap, the options are endless.\n\n-The difficulty for the game is tailored entirely on how you want to approach the game, with there being so many characters to choose from, as well as a difficulty selection screen that can determine the strength of the enemies that you face, without any effect on the story for those choices inparticular.\n\n-The characters interactions, just like any Neptunia game is a  beautiful, 4th wall breaking, otaku inspired work of art, that only certain individuals will be able to fully appreciate. The cast, with the introduction with alternatives to the exsisting characters Vert (Green Heart), Noire (Black Heart) and Blanc (White Heart), allowing for differing situations that involve them in different scenarios, as well as entirely new characters like Plutia (Iris Heart), this overall makes the game feel like much more of an extension to the already adorable cast of characters.\n\n-Speaking of characters, the Seven Sages was a more creative way of drawing out the situation that each character was placed in from the persepctive of both casts of characters relative to one another, with a few suprises here and there to keep it interesting. By this I mean that unlike the other game's, the villians have there own objectives and instead of being plain underlings like clearly shown in Rebirth 2. The main villian certainly being someone who does some pretty terrible things in order to complete there objective and which is certainly a quest in order to save her rather than to simply defeat her. \n\n-In my opinion the more colourful and enjoyable to look at game in the series, especially with the menu screen, that makes full use of the screen space and anime character sprites. Same can be said for the in game world, models and particles. Generally full of vibrant colours to make each seen feel surreal and more fantasy like.\n\n-Although mobs and levels are generally recycled from previous games, it allows you to famialrise yourself with the environments so that you always generally know which direction you should be going in. Even some of the old bosses are reintroduced into the series which are always welcome and some new levels are added into the mix that spice up the experience. Inparticular the new Lowee castle level is suprisingly high in quality in comparison to everything else as well as the last level having a generally awesome looking colour scheme to take screenshots with if desired.\n\nCon's:\n\n-The main issue that I have with this tittle is the consistency in which the game can crash, due to there being issues with loading textures that cause the game to bug out or even sometimes with the menuing malfunctioning and casuing your game to essentially lock up. I would reccommend you save very regularly between levels and potentially consider creating more the one save file in order to prevent any corruption from occuring.\n\n-The animations are somewhat still inferior to that of Megadimension Vii and the currently releasing Neptunia game. Some attacks feel slightly miss timed or awkward and some are even bugged out, Blanc hammer being the perfect example. Some of the walk animation's could also use with smoothening out and the symbol attack animations for the characters dont give clear visual feedback at all, making it at times frustrating for new players to handle attacking enemies in the field.\n\n-The soundtrack is generally weaker than every other Neptunia game, nothing really standing out except for Plutia's theme, which is actually well executed and generally make chills go down your spine.\n\n-Although the UI graphically may look amazing, the general feel is completely the opposite to other Neptunia games, which may make the transition between the two a little more awkward to get used to.\n\n-Stelas Dungeon and the remake system in general is to HEAVILY relied on in terms of progression of the story and is probably my biggest concern in reccommending this game over the other's and could even point others in another direction if I didn't know prior to playing the game. The true ending of the game HEAVILY and I mean HEAVILY relies on you having previously used the Stelas Dungeon mini game mechanic, in order to unlock multiple levels to find various fragments. This means that you are literally waiting for a mini game that also involves RNG, in order to get the correct plans in order to progress the story.

Just buy the super cheap DLC and save the frustration.\n\n-The end game progression after that of the main story isn't really worth your time unless you either want to 100% the game or if you want to just get the appropriate costumes and weapons for that of your favourite characters from the series. Other than that, you can pretty much sweep through the end game mobs as long as your party is competent and is well balanced.\n\n-Although minor, the new SP system narrows the players ability to be flexible with there character selection and the way they go about combat, as generally moves with the ability to generate SP are entirely superior to moves that can do moderate amounts of damage or break armor.\n\n-It is reccommended that you play this with a controller, so if you don't have one, your experience might be somewhat awkward by comparison.", "timestamp_created": 1525941667, "timestamp_updated": 1525942125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41940501": {"recommendationid": "41940501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357577024", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4888, "last_played": 1686224646}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no", "timestamp_created": 1525890418, "timestamp_updated": 1686213513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502309739589691162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41774922": {"recommendationid": "41774922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043388752", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 740, "last_played": 1499814804}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is for degenerates and lowlifes if you want your kid to grow up the biggest loser in town get him this game.", "timestamp_created": 1525097140, "timestamp_updated": 1525097140, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.185257002711296082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41765045": {"recommendationid": "41765045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258961223", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 7284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7163, "last_played": 1508893493}, "language": "english", "review": "Ran flawlessly without bugs.

It's a good game with some mechanic changes which may take time getting used to\n\n[i]Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation[/i] is the third installment of the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth franchise. The game takes place after the events of [i[Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth: Sisters Generation[/i] so it is adviced to finish playing that game before proceeding to this one.\n\nMajority of the story takes place in the alternate dimension. In here, our lovable main character, Neptune, Meets the narcoleptic Plutia, CPU of the atlernate Planeptune. In this alternate dimension, there also resides alternate versions of the other Nation's CPUs: Noire, Blanc and Vert, with little to no difference to their original counterparts.\n\nThis time around, the CPUs face on a new enemy faction, the Seven Sages, which composes of very familiar looking members [spoiler] Recycled assets *ahem*[/spoiler]. \n\nHere I'll talk about the Pros, the Neuts, and the Cons\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n1. Nep-nep main character. Instant 10/10\n2. Very Cheap OP DLC. Use it if you want to cheese through the early parts of the game. They fall off in performance in the late game\n3. Pururutooooooo~\n4. 3D CUTSCENES! EMERGERD! AND THE CHARACTERS WEAR THE COSTUME YOU EQUIPPED THEM WITH!\n\n[h1] NEUTS [/h1]\n\n1. [u]The Grind[/u]. I don't really mind this since I am used to grinding but others may find it repetitive and boring. \n2. [u]The new SP system[/u]. Unlike in the previous Neptunia Re;Birth games, the SP in this one is charged by dealing damage to enemy creatures. They also removed the EXE Drive bar. EX Finishers can now be activated depending on the amount of SP you hold. I personally don't like this one, the EXE drive bar of the previous game was already a good system, but I kinda understand why they changed it, as it can be easily be used to cheese through boss fights.\n3. [u]3 Endings[/u]. The first game had 2 endings, the second game had more than 6. This one only has 3. Was kinda expecting more, but maybe I'm the only one complating about this\n4. [u]Recycled Assets[/u]. Budget cuts? Maybe, but there is a difference between taking some old assets and using the entire things. Most of the dungeons here are dungeons you see on the previous games. Not just the dungeons, the mobs too. With only name and color changes. \n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\n1. [u]LACK OF ENGLISH VOICES[/u]. There is so many scenes, both main and side quest, that lack english voice acting. About more than 50% of the entire game lacks english voices. I'm not the type to use the english voice, but I know there are many people out there that do. And they will probably be surprised that despite this game having english voices in the options menu, there is not much english voices.\n2. [u]FREQUENT CRASHES[/u]. This is the only Neptunia game that i have played that crashes very very frequently. One times it crashed after a boss fight and I have to do the damn thing again! I am not sure what is causing this. I have posted in the community and found out there are alot of people that have the same problem as I do. And as our goddess Neptune has said [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1302297276]\"Ugh! Debug your games properly, Idea Factory International!\"[/url]\n3. [u]STILL NO GRAPHICS OPTIONS[/u]. Now I kinda understand why this option doesn't exist, because it's a port from the Playstation. But it should be noted that unlike the Playstation, PCs don't always have the same specs. Some have high tier specs and some don't. I belong to the lower tier and I have been playing this game at lowest resolution at around 8-20 FPS. The game doesn't seem to be affected by game boosters. I have finished the previous game and I feel I am not getting the same experience as the higher tier owners do just because I have to deal with the low fps. \n\nDespite all these flaw, I would still give this game a solid 9/10. Most of the problems I stated are due to my own personal preference and poor economic status. Except for the crashes. Seriously. Fix it. Otherwise, Plutia will make you fix it~", "timestamp_created": 1520782525, "timestamp_updated": 1551788707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score":

More then 15.  \n+ UI has been redone in places, with benefits. \n\n- Removed the ability to see the stat changes some items will have without equipping them. This is VERY annoying. \n- Stella's Dungeon hasn't been removed. It sucks slightly less but still sucks. \n- Keep's the second game's need to talk to a s***load of random people and get nothing from it. \n- Still has easy to miss key items that can fail to spawn, small chance of ruining a run. \n\nTL;DR: Solid game.

I was interested and watch the anime and worth it. I saw this game and finally I can afford money to buy it.\n\nObjectively, I highly recommend this game for hardcore fan of JRPG or one hour daily player like me. This game can be played for one hour per day because of fast battle yet entertaining moves and dialogues. The voice actings are really good both english and japanese although I recommend to play with japanese voices. The characters itself have unique and good role of the series, even the antagonist. Stella's Dungeon is really worth it to play while working my homework.\n\nHowever, this game can be really tough if you don't grind XP and SP. The story itself can be really long for one event before you can progress.\n\nAs a summary, 9/10. Buy this game while on sale. Deluxe edition is recommended [spoiler] you can get an awesome stuff :) [/spoiler]. If you can't decide to play RB1, 2 or 3 first, it doesn't matter at all but I recommend play RB1 first to get better introduction to the series (I watch youtuber play RB1 and RB2). For low-end player [strike] like me [/strike], you need to setup your .exe file so it can exceed 2gb usage. If game still doesn't launch or outstanding 2 fps, sorry, you need another PC.\n\n*First ending edit : After 100 hours playing [spoiler] with AFKs [/spoiler], I got good ending at the first run and true ending at the second run with back up save. I recommend to get the true ending first then get another ending. True ending will give you some stuff to help you progress through the post credit events or NG+. You can back up save to get all of the endings at one cycle but your gallery won't carried out. Unfortunately, it means that you need to play with same save data at least 3 times to get full gallery.\n\nAs I said above you can play this game 1 hour per day and even while do your homework, but this game is grindy and actually RNG based to get your drops so be careful to schedule your play time or you can play this game AFKs by only playing Stella's Dungeon and get your drop without hit any single button and without interruption, perhaps.

Funny as hell, I kekked almost always during first gameplay. Game mechanics are great, there is significant progress through series. So far, Re;Birth 3 stands at the top in series. \nGraphics? Nice, cute, nothing demanding on your hardware. But here is one and only negative - thanks to BIG game breaking bug, which is caused by limit on your RAM usage, combined with use of integrated graphic card, in certain events game crashes. In one important point in story, where you need from your computer both memmory and graphic processing during cutscene, game is unable to proceed definitely. Normaly, that would mean game over, uninstalling and negative rating/bashing from players. But hopefuly community is great and solution exists, so you can play and finish it (and make overall performance better). Shame on devs, it isn't patched by them. But as I've said before, this is one and only negative.\nStory is crazy, whacky comedy, full of fanservice and even the bad guys are funny as hell. Main character Neptune is back and she rocks, as all fans like it. It makes up for the Re;Birth 2, which was good, but somehow failiure in comparison with first title.\nOverall, if you like RPG with solid game mechanics, if you want to laugh and please your heart with abundant fanservice, this is the best choice.

Just love seeing her reactions)\n\n+ No need to grind for shares anymore (THANK GOODNESS!!!)\n\n+ The maker charas (Except for Compa and IF), doesn't have any roles in the main story, but they have plenty of sub events and even CGs.

The game itself is set in an interesting world, and while the characters might be a bit childish at times, they are still recognizable and likable characters. Plus. a game set in \"Gamindustri\", referencing games and gaming and stuff, and constantly nuking the 4th wall -- that has to be fun. As far as I'm concerned, I liked it.\n\nDon't misunderstand, though. The game may be set in \"Gamindustri\" and the 4 nations may represent 4 console manufacturers, but the actual story is a standard fantasy-type story where some bad guys want to topple the good guys. \"Gaming\" is more a of general world theme, not so much the theme of the story.\n\nYou may want to be careful though. The visuals are nice but somewhat dated, the story is told in a visual novel style with endless streams of text boxes giving a lot childish dialogue that can be tiring. Some of it is voice acted, but many scenes are not.\n\nAlso, the game is very repetitive. Like they only have a handful of dungeons (which is where the gameplay happens), and reuse them again and again and again. The same applies to monsters, although those might at least get a color change :-) And they have more boss fights than bosses, so expect repeats there as well, even for story bosses.\n\nSome aspects of the game might feel a bit grindy, like having to walk through a dungeon again and again until it gives you the item that you are looking for. Upgrading lily ranks or challenges to get the char upgrades attached to some tiers is just pointless grinding as well.\n\nIn addition to the actual story the game also gives you quests... which are forgettable, to say the least. Not only are they just standard fetch/kill quests -- I've stopped reading the texts pretty soon as those made no sense at all.\n\nThe game can also get annoying with it's inventory, since there's no sorting. If you want to check whether you have a certain item, select the category, and read through the list until you find it, or hope that you didn't miss it if you didn't see it. I'd also like to sell off the tons of garbage materials for some extra cash, but it feels too tiring due to the lack of useful sorting options.", "timestamp_created": 1500932400, "timestamp_updated": 1505078860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481283396482467651", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33714128": {"recommendationid": "33714128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275317798", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1512207595}, "language": "english", "review": "Mommy Plutia saves me", "timestamp_created": 1500706374, "timestamp_updated": 1500706374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488911300897598267", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33689274": {"recommendationid": "33689274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188713761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 276, "last_played": 1531807691}, "language": "english", "review": "i enjoyed play this game. this game have nice graphic  and friendly UI.

Neptunia, si ya has jugado almenos el rebirth 1 o 2 o los dos xD este tienes que jugarlo si o tamb\u00eden, podr\u00edamos decir que es m\u00e1s de lo mismo que de los demas Rebirth?, s\u00ed y no.\nPor una parte tengo que admitir que si por su caracter\u00edstico sistema de combate por turnos, es verdad que su apartado gr\u00e1fico es muchis\u00edmo mejor que en el de anteriores entregas pero en ese aspecto es mas de lo mismo.\nAhora si os tengo que vender la moto con el juego, esque hay una gran variedad de personajes nuevos (femeninos +1 masculino) con los que podr\u00e1s armar tu escuadr\u00f3n perfecto para las peleas, ademas de un sistema de Quest mas interactivo, ahora os explicar\u00e9 mas sobre este sistema de quests.\nSistema Quest's : En este sistema ahora cogeremos las misiones de igual manera en las guilds de las ciudades principales, ya sea: Planeptune, Lastation, Lanbox y Lowee pero ahora si nosotros abrimos el menu y v\u00e1mos al apartado de quest's si le damos click a la misi\u00f3n esta nos da muchos mas detalles sobre donde como y con que podemos conseguir el objeto que pide la quest o si es de caceria, nos dice exactamente en que dungeon podemos matar a los enemigos que pode la quest, si esta es en f\u00e1cil, dif\u00edcil o hell la misma quest nos lo dir\u00e1, esto la verdad es muy bueno ya que almenos en los otros  2 rebirth no pod\u00edamos saberlo y de la \u00fanica manera de saberlo era mirando las dungeon y saber los enemigos que habian en cada una de ellas o bien mirar la ''Nepedia'' para buscar la dungeon y sus enemigos y atrav\u00e9s de ellos si era posible saber que objetos se podian conseguir en dichas dungeons y enemigos.\nNada mas que decir, un muy buen juego si eres un fan de la saga (Como yo :3) pero si nunca has jugado a uno te recomiendo que empieces con el Hyperdimensi\u00f3n Neptunia Rebirth 1 (tengo review sobre el Rebirth 1 >_<)", "timestamp_created": 1498658836, "timestamp_updated": 1498658989,

Then I picked it up again today and realized why. Re;Birth 3 is a valiant effort at revitalizing the series, but it just doesn't do enough.\n\nFirst off, the battle system has been substantially modified. Now there is no EXE gauge - instead, your SP gauge does double duty. Suddenly, Rush attacks actually matter. No longer can you half-heartedly assign some spare points to somewhat-decent Rush attacks; now you have to think carefully and balance between all three types. Now everybody has to worry about Rushing. It adds a little more strategy to the gameplay - though I will say that grinding your SP back up after a boss battle can be quite a chore, especially when your fastest characters keep killing enemies before the slower ones even get a chance to touch them.\n\nInside dungeons, the hidden treasure system has changed slightly. Now instead of using that annoying radar, you look for shadows of invisible blocks (think Mario) on the ground and hit them. They all give you credits, but only one per run of a dungeon gives you an item. So basically, it's the same as before, but they're easier to find. Heck, in some dungeon layouts, you can even see the box shimmering in the air. That said, though, the developers continued their infuriating trend of hiding important items in them. Plans, weapons, armor, even [i]costumes[/i]. The cooler the item, the lower its spawn rate is, with costumes and accessories reaching nigh-impossible levels. To give you an idea, I spent three hours doing nothing but going in and out of Ario Plateau (or was it Luji? Screw it, I can't be bothered to remember), waiting for Blanc's school uniform and accompanying hat to spawn. And apparently I'm one of the [i]lucky[/i] ones. If you want to unlock all the cosmetic options in the game... may Noire have mercy on your soul.\n\nAnother thing that got a spit-shine is Stella's Dungeon. It's much more straightforward now, and the DLC bundled with the game (the base game, mind you - for once, they've decided to give you the non-cosmetic DLC for free) makes the first several areas go by pretty easily. Uzume hasn't left my side in... well, forever, actually. It eventually becomes hard to lose at Stella's Dungeon, assuming you exercise a minimal amount of caution.\n\nDungeon layouts are, again, recycled. You'll see a lot of familiar places that pervaded the first two games of the series, though - like Re;Birth 2 - this game adds a couple more to the mix, some of which I found greatly enjoyable. The Luji Plateau layout is full of whimsy, and I found the Lowee Castle layout's myriad winding corridors to be a joy to wander, confusing as they may be. That said, there's still a lot of recycling. There's a lot more dungeons in this game than in the other two games, meaning you'll be running into the same layouts perhaps even [i]more[/i] than you did in them. Plus, all the layouts from the first two games are laughably hostile toward the new hidden treasure system, as their floors are too detailed/dark to see the shadows. There's a plan that shows the treasure spots on the minimap, but still. When you're grinding for that Noire weapon you absolutely HAVE to have, it gets painful to just bounce around like an idiot hoping you're close enough to the box for it to register a hit.\n\nWhich brings me to a new feature: \"challenges.\" There are certain \"challenges\" that can increase characters' stats, grant them plans, and so on. These range from \"jump X times\" to \"spend X battles outside the party.\" The vast majority of them, though, require the character to be the leader. And with one, two, three... 28 characters in this game, this gets painful FAST. Heck, I've had Nepgear as my leader for pretty much as long as I've had her, and I'm still nowhere near maxing out her jumping challenge. Oh, and did I mention? Each character's standard EXE attack is locked behind a \"use skills X times\" challenge. So you have to do some grinding before anyone becomes worth using. And once your first few characters do get their EXE attacks, you won't want to use anyone else. Looks like Histoire is gonna be a permanent member of my lineup.\n\nThen there's the story. It's nothing as good as the second game, but it's still pretty competent. There's ups, downs, and so on and so forth. Even the villains get comfortable amounts of screentime. The second game had a hard time striking a balance, but this game - despite having more villains - gives each of them enough time to feel like they were worth including. I will say, though, that the recycled boss fights get old fast. Come on, even the second game had a few fights that weren't Underling or the Four Felons. Fortunately, there's only three endings this time, so you don't have to undo the Change Dungeon on Millennium Labyrinth five thousand times just to get 100% CG completion.\n\nAnd last up... the translation. I'll come out and say it: it's just as bad as in the second game. Fortunately, the most brutalized characters (Nepgear and Ram) are background characters in this game, so it's not as noticeable. The memes, though, are in full swing. More so than they were in the second game, since Neptune is the main character again. Be afraid. Fortunately, there's a fanmade patch for this game, too, so it's playable. Then again, IFI shouldn't be forcing us to resort to these extremes in the first place.\n\nHowever, it really cannot be understated how much stuff there is in this game. Not content - [i]stuff[/i]. There's a zillion dungeons to mindlessly wander in search of that dag-blasted LASOU Uniform, there's a zillion different characters to buy weapons (and make accessories) for, there's a zillion different plans to make and challenges to complete, there's a zillion different enemies to get item drops from, the list goes on and on. Re;Birth 3 is by far the most egregious of the trilogy in terms of mind-numbing grinding time asked of the player. Never has any other game - even the other Neptunia ones - so thoroughly crushed my desire to complete it - or even finish it. That's right. I haven't even finished the game. I'm sitting around in Chapter 8 right now because I've come to see the game as a chore. The rewards I get for farming enemies and making plans are meaningless when they're just the exact same things as in the other games. Why bother buying all these weapons, accessories, and costumes when I already have them in Re;Birth 2? This game recycles almost every item that it contains (except for, obviously, the Plutia- and Peashy-specific ones), making them worthless. And the story isn't bad, but it's nowhere near good enough to keep me engaged.\n\nThis is why I said the game tries to improve upon the formula, but doesn't go far enough. If you've played either of the first two games - and if you're looking at this game, then I'm assuming you have - then you aren't missing anything. There's really no reason to buy this one. The second one was worth buying, despite the repetitiveness, because of its story. This one has no draws. Just ignore it and move on to something else.

Why? Because it's awesome.\n\nI'll assume here that you know about the Neptunia series and know what you're getting into. If you do not, I strongly recommend that you start with either Re:Birth 1 or 2, and check gameplay videos first. This series is notoriously low-budget, so many might be put off by how the game feels.\n\nTL;DR: Gameplay is mostly the same, though there are a few nice balancing changes and some great quality of life changes. Story-wise, in my opinion Re;Birth 3 is miles ahead of 1 and 2. As a Neptunia game, this is a solid 9/10.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Awesome story. It's like the devs were like \"this is the 3rd game, how about we make an actual story?\" and they did it. Some surprises, some plot twists, stuff that I didn't come to expect from this series. \n+ Plutia. Amazing new character! Her being in the story is part of what made it so awesome.\n+ Different dimension, different versions of known characters. Noire, Blanc and Vert behave mostly the same, but they feel more interesting this time around. They also interact more with each other instead of mostly Neptune, something that bothered me in past games.\n+ Lack of Uni, Ram and Rom. Okay, I know this is a personal opinion but they were very uninteresting and I'm glad they barely showed up here.\n+ EXE bar is now the same as SP and EXE skills now cost more bars. Now the tough fights aren't about you spamming EXEs anymore, and you don't have to spam rush attacks every time you go into a dungeon to build up EXE, since SP doesn't diminish on its own.\n+ I feel like I should mention Plutia again, for being so awesome.\n+ By pressing Y (Xbox gamepad) on quests and plans, you can now see where items drop, where monsters are found, if the dungeon needs to be changed or not, and etc. Extremely useful.\n+ Stella's dungeon is more polished. The stuff she finds can really help you out.\n+ No more scanning for hidden items in dungeons. Now you look for shadows and jump on them to reveal a hidden box with stuff, there are around 4 to 6 boxes in dungeons and only one has items. Unfortunately, in dark cave dungeons it's literally impossible to see the shadow. And fortunatelly, around halfway through the game you get the plan that lets you see them on the mini-map.\n+Challenge system. You get certain in-game achievments for each character for things like damage dealt, enemies killed, skills used or how many times you jumped. Each challenge has multiple levels and each level will award you with permanent stat gains. In short, the more you play a character as a leader or in the main party, the stronger she'll be.\n+ Shares no longer necessary to get different endings (or plans, that I know of). Honestly, shares were just a bothersome requirement in previous games.\n+ A few dungeon bosses have nasty surprises prepared for you. I'm looking at you, Nurse Binder and Gargoyle.\n\nComparing this to previous Neptunia games, I can't think of many cons. But there you go..\n\nCons:\n\n- Nations in the other dimension are separated from the world map. Now you have to click on them, go to their screen and then you see their respective dungeons. Visually it looks great, but now there's more loading time.\n- Most playable characters aren't actually on your party. You get every Maker character plus the Oracles but they're just add-ons, none of them are really with you, which means they don't take part in the storyline. Most people won't care about it, but it made me refrain from using them on my first playthrough.\n\nThat's about it, I guess.. IMO this game is better in almost every way compared to the other two. If you liked them, don't hesitate to get this one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1493398943, "timestamp_updated": 1493398943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31407755": {"recommendationid": "31407755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015134765", "num_games_owned": 1016, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 2211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 988, "last_played": 1634516094}, "language": "english", "review": "IMO gameplay wise the worse neptunia but still a good entry storywise.

Ahora existe una \u00fanica barra de SP y tanto las t\u00e9cnicas SP como las EX utilizan la misma barra, ya no es una sola sino que cada personaje tiene la suya propia. Hicieron ajustes al balance y consumo de las t\u00e9cnicas SP, ahora son m\u00e1s efectivas, pero hay que tener cuidado porque hay que ser m\u00e1s estrat\u00e9gico para jugar porque te puedes consumir todo el SP sin poder hacer t\u00e9cnicas EX cuando las necesites.\n\n- Ahora los personajes no CPU (CyberConnect2, MarvelousAQL, Falcom, etc) pueden entrar en un estado llamado \"Awakened\", que si bien no es como el HDD de las CPU, si hacen que sus ataques y t\u00e9cnicas sean un poco m\u00e1s poderosas.\n\n- Ahora los personajes que quedan K.O, antes de morir, tienen la opci\u00f3n de intercambiarse por el personaje que est\u00e1 de apoyo, lo cual me parece genial.\n\nTiene mucho del primer Neptunia: Vuelve Neptune como CPU principal y protagonista, con la ayuda de las otras CPUs principales, aunque tambi\u00e9n despu\u00e9s aparecen sus hermanas y son personajes jugables tambi\u00e9n. Tiene una historia bastante buena y al final me gust\u00f3 mucho el antagonista principal. En total yo logr\u00e9 desbloquear un total de 28 personajes, cosa nada dificil de obtener, todos jugables.\n\nEn resumen: A mi me ha gustado mucho este Neptunia, considerando sus puntos fuertes y sus puntos malos (que los tiene).\n\nRespecto de los bugs, ca\u00eddas de framerate y crasheos, tristemente es una constante en este tipo de ports, asi que lo m\u00e1s recomendado antes de encontrarse con esos problemas y tirarse los pelos de la rabia, primero es desactivar el ajuste de escala de la pantalla (eso se hace en el .exe del juego), luego parchear el juego para que use m\u00e1s de 2GB de memoria. Los que tengan tarjetas Nvidia, meterse al Panel de Control de Nvidia y activar algunos par\u00e1metros como filtrado anisotr\u00f3pico, luminosidad, sincronizaci\u00f3n vertical, etc. Hay varias gu\u00edas en internet sobre c\u00f3mo hacer lo que he explicado muy resumidamente.

That being said, while it heavily relies on premade assets and basic gameplay ideas, it still delivers on new features for the game. Sadly it falls completely short in the stability department. \n\nI joked about it for part two, but this time, if you know the first game, you really know most of this one. It copies every map of Re;Birth 1 and some of 2. As the maps of 2 were sometimes lacking in depth, this is a welcome rebrand for Re;Birth 3, if lazy. And of course nearly no new enemy types are added, just rebranded - if at all - and sent out. You will even remember some of the quest texts. While this could draw the ire of many players, the story theme of \"A world in the Past\" actually makes it an irony in itself. So if you can adopt it to your game's storyline, you might let them get away with it. \nThe story is set in another dimension, the Ultradimension, and has Neptune being exiled to it from her own home the Hyperdimension of Re;Birth 2. Yes, this game is an actual sequel! In her first days in the Ultradimension, Neptune quickly realizes that not all is as she remembered... and the future has yet to be written for her and others. In this setting, the game excels in its most important asset yet again, the meta-story and its jokes about the console wars of the past. Many of its easter eggs, secrets and jokes make more than up for its grindy gameplay and exhausting repetition even for those that don't follow Red's wifey fetish or like to play dress up with digital assets. All of this is delivered in the now common format of a novel-rpg hybrid. \nWithin this genre, this game is as casual or hard as you want to as it continues the trilogy's idea of \"play like you want\". You quickly get the plans and choice to craft harder or easier enemies, to get more experience or to just play the game normally. That being repeated even from Re;Birth 2, much HAS changed in terms of gameplay to its two predecessors! The old % grinds have been replaced with them being tied to the story and are only part of the actual immersive gameplay of the quests. Further the eternal button mashing to scan for hidden treasures in maps has been replaced with the \"Super Neptune Sisters\" blocks you can see hover in all treasure locations in a ghostly outline. While only one of them offers treasure like before, all offer a small monetary benefit for hitting them. And it saves the liftetime of your X button.\nThe biggest change to gameplay though is the removal of the party shared exe drive and the variable status of SP, this games type of mana. Now its maximum is always 1000. While it was feasible to have heavy-hitters before with characters like Falcom with immense hit counts collecting your exe drive, your rush attacks now actually refill your own SP and only those. This bar works as your exe drive as well as your mana pool per character. So slow characters tend to fall behind in refilling their abilities unless you switch to defending for them to catch up. This also devalues the super exe attacks, which are far less rewarding than a traditional guard break combo before unleashing the necessary amount of SP with a normal SP skill on the enemy. The gameplay has truly been changed.\nStella's Dungeon also makes a return, this time with 20 floors of one dungeon to clear. The gameplay has been streamlined and flavored with side-characters you in the past only talked with. They can do the scouting work for her and new ones get added per cleared floor, offering up new abilities or rare items and monsters to find. It also takes less time than before, at least with the DLC plans. As in Re;Birth 2, even sped up, the last dungeons took A DAY, none will take more than half an hour with it.\nThe game's crafting system still focuses most on clothes and outside changes on the CPUs. Unlike Re;Birth 2, though, the developers could reuse all assets from Re;Birth 1 and thus the immense long list of accessories from Re;Birth 1 makes a resounding return. Don't expect anything new, but if you loved some in Re;Birth 1 or 2, the chance is high you can recreate them in Re;Birth 3 all over again. There will be no lack of recipes to grind for, unless you cheapen your experience so far with the easy mode recipes, that you run out of MB.\n\nSadly, the greatest problem of this game is THE EXACT SAME Re;Birth 2 had. It tends to crash during repeated transmissions between zones in speed grinds in medium to long play sessions. And while before it could also happen in battles with graphical glitches in components of characters warning you about an impending crash, this time it has hit the novel-rpg sequences instead. Once one of the story assets turns into a weird cut out black blop or the background disappears, abandon all hope. Before the sequence ends, the game WILL crash. Unlike Re;Birth 2 there is no chance you reach a savepoint by then. Save often and restart your game at least every two hours to prevent bad surprises. This game was not polished or properly ported. Long play sessions will risk your current advances in the game at any moment. While the lack of graphics in the sequences can be funny, the loss of a hard fought boss might not. At least restart before a boss fight at the save point and make sure to never do long grind sessions without going out of the dungeon or to a savepoint to keep the data.\n\nLike with its predecessors, my main interest in the game still stems from the light humor of it and the quirky story. And it delivered well, despite or especially because of some darker themes in this new installment! It might have been one if not the best of the trilogy I played. I can only compliment the author of many of the jokes. While not all work all the time, I found myself enjoying and laughing. And in the end that is what matters. \nThe gameplay has been diversified a little and the minigame actually became a proper minigame to enjoy. Before I called the gameplay solala, now it can be considered average. So the game overall is already better than any of its predecessors, of which it heavily borrowed in assets and gameplay anyway. As always, the fun lies in the characters and story, if you love to break the fourth wall, have some wifeys or a digital dress up party... or a nostalgic grind. \nPlay it your way, and try to enjoy the insanity of our Hyperdimension's Neptunia. But if you are reading this, you surely had some fun with its prior installments and thus you can't go wrong here. Just consider the stability issues past the two hour mark per session!\n\nMy final verdict for Hyperdimension Neptunia is finish it, including the Social Games DLC storyline, Stella's Dungeon included!", "timestamp_created": 1487444531, "timestamp_updated": 1487444531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565828859806060791", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29971490": {"recommendationid": "29971490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059602829", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1495219295}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished Chapter 3 and for me it\u00b4s the best Re; Birth so far. many funny moments and Nep moments :D\n\npros and cons:\n\npros:\n\n+ You guessed it Nep-Nep :D\n+ Plutia (and for those who like her more \"mature\" side)\n+ 4 party members like Re Birth2\n+ many characters to complete your party or whatever you want :D\n+ many optional Items like accessoires and dungeons to unlock\n+ nice story\n+ a mini game inside the game (who don\u00b4t like to go on a adventure with a cat?)\n\nCons:\n\nthere are no real cons, maybe to less nep moments? and if you don\u00b4t played Re; Birth1 and 2 then you should hurry up and play them :D and not reading this here.\n\n<--- no i am not a mad magician, sorry to disappoint you", "timestamp_created": 1487281278, "timestamp_updated": 1487281278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29929451": {"recommendationid": "29929451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283186503", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 709, "last_played": 1678526325}, "language": "english", "review": "It was my Valentine's Date\n\nI went with my waifus to the Gamindustri cinema to watch 50 shades of Plutia\n\n\nIm so lonely ;_;", "timestamp_created": 1487109219, "timestamp_updated": 1487109219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569807052612304688", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29929031": {"recommendationid": "29929031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060021383", "num_games_owned": 582, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 2153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2153, "last_played": 1480992864}, "language": "english", "review": "9.9/10\n\n0.1 deducted for not having Splash or Solid Park as the regular battle theme.\n\n(If you liked the first two games, quit wasting time and buy it!)", "timestamp_created": 1487107488, "timestamp_updated": 1487107488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29872000": {"recommendationid": "29872000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200718251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 4503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3454, "last_played": 1501435257}, "language": "english", "review": "Re-Birth 3 was the best one of them so far, loved it from the very start.

Lo digo porque he visto muchos casos en los que le han cascado an\u00e1lisis negativo a R;B2 porque no continuaba la historia de R;B1, no se desarrollaba en la misma dimensi\u00f3n. S\u00ed, por mucho que os joda, [b]el verdadero lore de Neptunia empieza con R;B2.[/b])\n\n[b]R;B3 es una mezcla que junta lo mejor de las dos entregas anteriores.[/b] [b]Vuelve a recuperar la frescura y dinamismo que ten\u00edan los di\u00e1logos en R;B1[/b] (debido a que Neptune vuelve a ser la prota y Plutia es amor) y [b]los villanos del juego tienen cierta profundidad y son un grupo variado[/b] (este era el problema que le ve\u00eda a R;B1, que te pasabas el juego detr\u00e1s del mismo personaje todo el juego. R;B2 ten\u00eda un repertorio de villanos m\u00e1s amplio, cosa que agradec\u00ed.)\n\nEl juego cuenta con [b]un nuevo HUD renovado que se siente muy fresco[/b] y un [b]peque\u00f1o (gran) cambio en el sistema de combate: la eliminaci\u00f3n del Medidor EXE.[/b]\n\n[b]Ahora las Unidades EXE, habilidades PH y dem\u00e1s, comparten la misma barra de PH[/b], cosa que hace al juego m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, ya que no puedes lanzar Unidades EXE con la tranquilidad de que podr\u00e1s seguir usando boosts o heals. Habr\u00e1 que pensar y planear mucho m\u00e1s cada turno. [b]A excepci\u00f3n de ese cambio, el sistema de combate sigue siendo igual.[/b]\n\nTodo el sistema de Planos sigue igual, aunque en R;B3 [b]introducen los \"Big Dungeon Changes\", que cambian los enemigos fuertes y los objetos recolectables en una mazmorra[/b]. En el apartado  \"Sistema\" podemos ver que adem\u00e1s de los que aparecieron en R;B2, hay nuevos planos que cambian la BGM entre otras cosas.\n\n[b]El sistema de b\u00fasqueda de tesoros tambi\u00e9n lo han cambiado.[/b] En vez de ir spammeando el bot\u00f3n como locos para que el \u00e1rea los detectase, [b]ahora aparecer\u00e1n cubos flotantes invisibles contra los que tendremos que saltar[/b] (al m\u00e1s puro estilo Super Mario) para que nos salgan objetos.\n\n[b]Tambi\u00e9n han introducido unos \"minidesaf\u00edos\" por personaje que nos otorgar\u00e1n recompensas[/b] (del rollo: \"Salta 100 veces con Neptune\" y nos recompensar\u00e1n subi\u00e9ndonos alguna estad\u00edstica o con un Plano que le desbloquee algo al personaje.

Por lo que Nep y su nueva compa\u00f1ia tendr\u00e1n que encagarse de luchar contra una malvada organizaci\u00f3n que planea eliminar a las Diosas.\n\nAsi que bueno, nos encontramos con un juego que incluye novedades en el sistema de combate(hasta 4 preciosas combatientes podr\u00e1n luchar a la vez), en el sistema de ataques EX, haciendo que estos usen las barras de  la ahora dividida en barras, barra de SP(para hacer ataques especiales, magias, bufos o lo que sea) as\u00ed que de cierta forma hace que se tenga en cuenta si es mejor usar un ataque ex, subir un bufo o lo que sea dependiendo de la situaci\u00f3n.\nLa Mazmorra de Stella.... ha vuelto y por ya no da tanto asco, pero personalmente en varios momentos de la aventura me he olvidado de ella o me ha saltado la notificaci\u00f3n de que ha vuelto en medio de una escena importante.\nPor supuesto se siguen manteniendo la maravillosa mec\u00e1nica de saltar fuera de los combates para mirar las b......astante abundantes desnivelaciones que habr\u00e1 en nuestro periplo por las zonas ........y por supuesto las bragas(incluso aunque sea un mis\u00e9ro frame en ocaciones).\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay un maravilloso sistema de desafios, aclarar primero que es POR PERSONAJE, que incluyen saltar X veces, usar X habilidades, recibir X da\u00f1o, y un largo etc, que desbloquean algunas mejoras de est\u00e1distica y ciertas utilidades en forma de planes para ese personaje en concreto :D.\n\nFinalmente y por ello lo menos importante pero aun as\u00ed lo m\u00e1s gracioso una lista de cooooosas maravillosas que se pueden encontrar en este maravilloso juego de Diosas kawaii parodiando empresas de videog\u00fcejos:\n-NEP m\u00e1s nep que nunca, con nuevas formas de decir sus frases caracteristicas al saltar.\n-Caidas constantes......................................sobre Noire(pobrecita :( )\n-Un maravilloso personaje con tendencias s\u00e1dicas que aterrorizar\u00e1 a multitud de personajes del juego.\n-Slimes\n-La odiada por muchos, querida por otros tantos, Nepgear :DDD.\n-Debates sobre quien las tienes m\u00e1s grandes.\n-Bullying en exceso a Nepgear.\n-Cantidades industriales de berenjenas en una parte del final del juego(ALIMENTO DE BESTIAS Y DEMONIOS >:( )\n-Y sobretodo, chistes:malos, buenos, fuera de contexto, sin sentido,etc.....\n\n\nAs\u00ed que si, se puede decir que HN RB;3 es una digna tercera parte, bastante mejor que la segunda, pero para gustos colores......por lo que si est\u00e1s deseando comprartelo, hazlo y recuerda.....\n\n\n\n\nJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMPUUUUU", "timestamp_created": 1483316521, "timestamp_updated": 1483316521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Overall this iteration of the anime JRPG is the best for me so far. The story takes you on a fun ride with lively characters and great humor, without jeopardizing the integrity of the overarching plot. \n\n1. The characters get a lot more action in this game compared to previews iterations, with more dialogue even for the side characters. Plutia as a new characters really brings another dimension to the whole trope theme, and, although unfamiliar at first, quickly became one of my favourites of the series. Even the bad guys seems a lot more real compared to the typical conquer the world villain, and all of them are redeemed in the end. \n\n2. The UI is improved greatly, with a whole new menu, great new battle UI, and separate maps for the different nations. Access to an improved Stella's Dungeon early in the game really helps with collecting materials and completing plans. \n\n3. A lot more dungeons this time around, together with an improved Stella's Dungeon, make completing plans a lot less tedius. The new change dungeon plans also provides an access to challenging bosses a lot early in the game. \n\nOverall this game is a really fun ride, and I recommend it to anyone who is a lover of JRPG and anime games. Definitely check out Re;Birth 1 too, as it establishes the characters and makes this game a lot more enjoyable.

Wew. This was a fun experience. Introduced another new dimension (The Ultradimension) 2 new waifus (Peashy and Plutia) and a ton of new things to do. Let me begin on the improvements from the last 2 games\n\n1. The menus now looks more vibrant and better to look at. The old one was fairly bland and not much, but this one now looks stunning and nice too look at every time. \n2. They removed the search system (couldn't use that at all without a plan) into a hidden block type deal where the blocks are fairly easy to find but could be missed in a quick glance\n3. Stella's Dungeon has been improved a ton, now including a partnering system\n4. THE END GAME DOES NOT MEAN YOU RESTART. FINALLY. There are multiple after-game things you can do, like fight bosses and such.\n5. Nep-TV. Adds a bit more depth and connection to the games in my own opinion.\n6. The map system is now divided up into sections (You have to go into a world map then choose, for example, Planeptune, just to enter an area).\n7. It's not as much of a grind to finish the game.\n\nAlso, unlike Re;Birth2, this game actually has a good story that isn't 100% doom, gloom, and all serious. Plutia being my favourite character for how many times she makes situations better by doing horrible things. Nepgear also gets an improvement, seeming to be more of a comic relief type character and not the serious younger sister as before. Neptune may be a bit more mean spirited in a way, and even was lazy to do some fairly important and life threatening things, but I didn't note it and forgot about it. \n\nAll in all, this game is how the original Neptunia 3 helped the series. Made improvements on things that needed fixing, and overall was good. One of my fav J-RPGs of all time, and I will soon not forget this journey.

Nothing has changed. It\u2019s still a JRPG trough and trough. For the third time you play teenager girls having an adventure by visiting dungeons, fighting monsters while they attempt to break the 4th wall to make fun of popculture and videogames.\n\nAnd this time the writing is back to form. The girls take nothing serious and get sidetracked a lot by talking nonsense even in front of impending doom. And It\u2019s gloriously entertaining! Some of the situations the girls find themselves in are so hilariously stupid that they become good again.\n \nThe same gameplay pattern too? Yes! Follow the story as visual novel, go to dungeon, fight monsters, beat boss, continue, Repeat! New is that instead of a single overhead worldmap, the world is separated into small subscreens. Some of them get unlocked by going into a dungeon from one side and leaving trough the other. Clever!\n\nStella\u2019s Dungeon, the spelunker mini game, is also back. And unlike the previous version (which forced me to not 100% the last game) it\u2019s fast, more complex, yet simplified. There is still a gigantic amount of items to craft, to loot and use but it won\u2019t bulldozer over you because the devs finally added a feature to check which monster, in which dungeon drops which item: Making the constant alt-tabbing to a browser window to check the games wikipedia obsolete.\n\nThe combat system got changed a tiny bit as well. You can\u2019t spam superattacks anymore, cuz actionpoints don\u2019t automatically refill when leaving a dungeon. Actionpoints need to be gathered by attacking monsters with rush attacks. Makes the combat much more challenging. But overall it stays the exact same. Yay for animation-skip-button!\n\nShares of the nations no longer come into play to progress the story. The 3 possible endings will be triggered by watching optional VN-events. There is more details to it, but please check one of the dozens guides that explain how to get the endings. Thanks! \n\nThe humour is marvelous, all characters loveable, all essential DLC\u2019s are already integrated into the game without any additional purchase.

This one will be more like changes between previous games and this one.\n[list]\n[*]Stella's Dungeon\nNow this system became more related with game and most of the time items you need or plans or anything you can get only from there. Not like in the re;birth 2.\n[*]Interface\nMenu has changed (like someones cares about it ._.). Now because of 2 different dimensions we have 2 different maps. First one is our good-old hyperdimension simliar to re;birth 2 map, but this dimension is not here as main one becuase we can do stuff here only at start or end. Because of this not a lot of dungeons appear here. Second one is more unique and new becuase they did like you must to enter in country to get into its basilicom or dungeons, thats really cool and because of this there is lot of place for dungeons. There are also plans to change music in main menu and in fights i like those ^-^\n[*]Treasure system\nThis one I don't like that much because treasure system here depends more on luck. Because you need to jump to get items like in mario but you have a low chance drop for some plans or costumes and this is really annoying when you need to waste time to just farm them so many times. Besides after you finish game and make last steps and finishing with plans most of them you can find only in hidden treasures.\n[*]Post game\nNew really good thing they did that after you completed the game you still can be in world and there is no need to start a new game again you can do it whenever you want. Besides with dlc came a lot of additional fun content like \"regu and bamo story\", \"searching for treasure\", \"island r18\", \"trial period?\" \n[*]Story\nThey made story really cool here and long. 10 chapters in case of true ending, besides really a lot of additional dialogs which are really cool and with cool arts so don't miss them! What about endings? You don't need more farm shares with tears on your eyes to get that or another ending. Here everything is really easy you just need to collect items or check for special events.\n[*]Colosseum\nHere they changed only a bit they just added a... let's just call this a \"second round\". After you kill one enemy you think \"oh good this is done\" there shows up another one, and more and more :D So be carefull with them. One more thing is, which I really dont remember if this was in previous parts but here from colosseum battles you don't get exactly weapons or armour you just get plans for them and guess what? On higher levels the item you need for plan is obtainable only from Stella's Dungeon and of course with low chance of drop ._.\n[/list]\nI guess thats all what i wanted to say.

If you're new to the franchise, this game is a good starting point, well, actually any game is a good starting point.\nFor how I see it the games of this franchise provide not an excellent game, but a fun experience overall. \nCombat is very simple but it works and it's been a bit tweaked to make it harder to spam ultimate attacks, making those special abilities more likely to be used in battle (in the previous games those were almost useless).\nStorytelling uses a visual-novel style like the previous games and there are a ton of anime and games references (some very obscure, like the pineapple salad for macross). The scenes tend to be veeery long, and while the dialogues are well written sometimes they drag on for too much, but you can skip them.\nA peculiar feature is the remake system, basically a crafting system that lets you create new items, gain new abilities and change the monsters in dungeons, it ends up being very simple, but it's a good addition to boost the replayability of dungeons.\nIf you like anime games, I'd say either nep1 or this are a must buy.\n\n\n[i]For a nep player:[/i]\nMost of it is pretty much more of the same classic nep, with an arguably better story, fun characters (all of the nep1+2 team) and dungeons and some small improvements. This time the story is a continuation of nep2 and is not set in an alternate universe. \nThe exe drives now require sp (and many of the classic ones need to be unlocked via character challenges) and you'll probably have to initially rely on the normal special abilities, which I found great, because in previous games I ended up not using these normal ones at all, with the exception of compa\u2019s healing.\nDungeons are more diversified and the new ones are really cool, but there are pretty much no new monsters introduced in this game. \nThe other two main additions are the character challenges from Fairy Fencer F (basically little stat bonuses you get for doing stuff with your characters) and a post game state where you can choose if you want to jump into NG+ or keep playing.\n\n\n\n\nThis game usually gets huge discounts so you should wait for one of those and then you're guaranteed to have a game worthy of 30+ hours of fun with neptune and her friends.\nI recommend buying the DLC since it helps in the most frustrating rng part of the game, the Stella's dungeon.\n\n\n[i]So, overall:[/i]\n\n\n+ Well written wacky story\n+ All the characters from nep 1+2\n+ Character challenges\n+ Remake system \n+ Fair price with regular discounts \n\n\n- Stella's dungeon (but it's way more useful than in nep2)\n- Dialogues scenes are too long\n- Tends to get very repetitive\n\n\n\n\nEnding up this review I want to spend a couple of words on Idea Factory, the makers of this game. \nIF has been a role model for japanese devs who want to port their games on steam, they started with some games being buggy due to their inexperience but they always tried their best to fix each one and learn from their mistakes. In the last two years they have shown their respect for the steam userbase by having games coming out well polished (doing even closed beta events that you can register to to help their test the game) and never censored, and by having fair pricings with up to -40% on launch for at least their last 4 games (maybe more, I honestly don't remember). \nIf you're an anime fan and you want more and more japanese games being ported on steam in my opinion this is a great company to support.\n", "timestamp_created": 1480266739, "timestamp_updated": 1480266739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64856952428817749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27850342": {"recommendationid": "27850342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123218704", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4888, "last_played": 1532596327}, "language": "english", "review": "So many cute chara and 9/10 fan service.", "timestamp_created": 1480263433, "timestamp_updated": 1542874341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27781899": {"recommendationid": "27781899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046806847", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1713, "last_played": 1455044622}, "language": "english", "review": "Memes", "timestamp_created": 1480228966, "timestamp_updated": 1480228966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49212348461151123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27778343": {"recommendationid": "27778343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054682602", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9852, "last_played": 1478164349}, "language": "english", "review": "This game continues on with the idea of the previous 2 Re;Birth games, and improves on some aspects, while changing one thing that I thought was good enough from the start.

Clearly CH and IF learned from their mistakes and got a better game because of that. Amoung the improvements since the re;birth 1 there are:\n\n[list]\n[*]Longer story\n[*]Post end-game content besides just the coliseum, now there are some alternative stories you can do!\n[*]NG+ whenever you feel like (after ending the main story the game doesnt shove down your throat the NG+ to continue, you get to the world map and there is an event which gives you the option if you want to) (amazing improv if you ask me)\n[*]More stella's dungeon and with much more control over how much you want to travel/risk.\n[*]No more google searching those annoying materials, you can know where you gather the materials for those helpful plans, be it a dungeon, a quest, shop, etc. Also if you CAN'T get it at the time it will tell you.\n[*]More nep-nep! (thank god)\n[*]More & new characters on the main story which you will bring new comedy and situations\n[*]Now featuers challanges, doing certain amount of X with each character will reward you with plans and stats (which could do some difference but not enough to make you feel you are being forced into it)\n[*]+1 combo comands, being a total of 4 instead of 3\n[*]Hidden treasures are now not so hidden and you dont need to spam a button like an idiot through out the entire dungeon to find only one and to the luck of RNG-sus (on that note plans and items within this are a bit more easy so they dont feel just as punishing and trivial tho still a bit hard)\n[*]Dungeon desing is much more inspiring than before and less plain, now jumping actually is a thing and not just for candy eye on peeping [spoiler]in which at any case the developers are well aware of it and even you unlock a plan to exactly that after jumping 100 times[/spoiler]\n[*]All the characters (markers) of R;B2 are on the game and FOR FREE!\n[*]Bosses are more likely to use spells everyonce in a while [spoiler](they are still kinda plain and you can brute force your way through but I'm sure they will get with something more satisfaying)[/spoiler]\n[*]EXE drive is a bit nerfed and more focused on coupling and formation in order to execute\n[*]Questing is a bit more relevant on the main story though not quite related\n[*]Less endings but you have more control over it with less requirements and is more intuitive, so you may not need to read guides for it\n[*]Also [b][u]you can't be locked out[/u][/b] of an ending [spoiler](read conquest ending R;B2)[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\nWell that wraps around the most important things I noticed (and remember at the time being). It's a must buy for anyone, be it fans of the series and friendly for newcomers (tho I still recomend starting on the R;B1 to appreciate all the improv over the franchise)", "timestamp_created": 1479141448, "timestamp_updated": 1479141448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26592320": {"recommendationid": "26592320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281510067", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1481540124}, "language": "english", "review": "l love this game ,and l hope the language can add Chinese.Because l am not good at Japanese and English.", "timestamp_created": 1479082603, "timestamp_updated": 1479082603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611152291297912598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26583791": {"recommendationid": "26583791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055615816", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8023, "last_played": 1530190062}, "language": "english", "review": "A great JRPG game with a lot of stuff to do.", "timestamp_created": 1479052889, "timestamp_updated": 1509742363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26534784": {"recommendationid": "26534784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076876312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3627, "last_played": 1481714384}, "language": "english", "review": "I faught a battle and won victoriously.

I might make no sense in some of these lines. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.**\nAs someone who started with the Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory on PS3 for the first out of the Neptunia series, I was really on for a treat. I also played the previous two Re;Birth games, and I can only tell this was going to be a great game overall.\n\nFor starters, this was based on the best Neptunia game I played back overall (the two Re;Birth games were fun, but not that much fun), meaning that I was going to enjoy the upgrades for this game. It included an extra chapter (which was ridiculous), some extra scenes that were pure fun (but not as fun as a certain side quest) and even characters the original Victory did not have (being the four Oracles of MKII/Re;Birth 2). And with messing around with the Plans, you could just do stuff like skipping battles (given you're a much higher level) when you Symbol Attack enemies, make the game relatively easier/harder, double EXP/G obtained and much more.\n\nIf you want a game that is comedic with serious moments and you just want to beat this game, you can absolutely get this. Just be warned; there is fanservice here and there. A LOT OF FANSERVICE. (Especially when you get to meet Iris Heart the first time...)\n\nAlso, this game comes with the DLCs of Victory; new characters, new weapons/armor, Level-limit breaks (now it's up to 999 instead of 99), and if you try the DLC dungeons, be sure to grind a lot. And when I say a lot, I mean nearly 400~800 Lv will suffice...(?)", "timestamp_created": 1478344793, "timestamp_updated": 1478344793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26424008": {"recommendationid": "26424008", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976916788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1543800299}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best written, funniest rpgs of all time, and my 4th favorite jrpg i've ever played.  (behind Chrono Trigger, Persona 4, and Final Fantasy 4 respectively)  \n\nRuns extremely well on just about anything, without the freeze bugs I ran into on the vita.  Uses the same quick, fun combat as the previous rebirth titles (which replaced 1 and 2's original combat with this game's)\n\nHas 29 playable characters (though only 7ish are central to the plot) and my first run took around 45 hours, due to some built in cheats (via a crafting system) and ng+ subsequent runs for achievements are much quicker, taking 4-5 hours or so if skipping cutscenes.  Combat is basic, but fun, and reasonably challenging until you get overleveled (which will happen) the ability to skip all animations with the left shoulder button (or tab i think?) helps speed things along as well once you start to tire of the flashy animations 30 hours into the game.\n\nI loved the unique plot that spans several decades of the character's lives with a slow burn of a conflict that uses that timespan to resolve itself in clever, unusual ways you don't often see in jrpgs.\n\nAnd goddamn is it funny (if you like that sort of dumb, anime style comedy) I have never laughed out loud so much during a game (other than maybe portal)  \n\nPlay it! do it for plutie!\n\n\nMain differences between this and Victory (ps3 version)\n\nMuch more voiced dialogue (though its still nowhere near 100% of the game)\n\nAll old dlc is now free and included (the only pay dlc is a cheat pack for a dollar.)\n\nslightly different opening (a new tutorial dungeon)\n\na new post game story arc (relatively short mind you, one dungeon and boss after several cutscenes)\n\nthe scout system is replaced by the less confusing, but still annoying stella's tower, which operates somewhat similarly with some rougelike elements.\n\nthe synth system is replaced by the remake system used in the other remake games, it also \nreplaces the flags, allowing you to just toggle them on and off instead of spamming scout missions to ge ttheir effects.\n\nruns at 60fps (vita runs at 30ish)  as opposed to the 15ish of the original.

While it is super easy and fast to refull SP during battle, Combo points never go past the 400 points cap meaning you cannot take full advantage of building up fully powerful combo setups.\n\nDespite the two small flaws, I still enjoyed the game. :D", "timestamp_created": 1477517208, "timestamp_updated": 1477517208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498235106468200684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26236862": {"recommendationid": "26236862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063148593", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3560, "last_played": 1447829125}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1477516892, "timestamp_updated": 1477516892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447704166173934937", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26211702": {"recommendationid": "26211702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121597178", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1449505286}, "language": "english", "review": "Nep nep save ur life", "timestamp_created": 1477387450, "timestamp_updated": 1477387450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471371114253997803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26185581": {"recommendationid": "26185581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048096457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 793, "last_played": 1446853177}, "language": "english", "review": "animated boobies > real boobies", "timestamp_created": 1477240979, "timestamp_updated": 1477240979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416772991418838501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26164310": {"recommendationid": "26164310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280446121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1478253203}, "language": "english", "review": "the game won't stop crashing right before isrs hearts reveil", "timestamp_created": 1477146522, "timestamp_updated": 1477146522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444835513830184937", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26140346": {"recommendationid": "26140346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056049609", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 3253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3253, "last_played": 1472827335}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent, funny JRPG worth getting on sale.

I can say they have slowly made improvements in gameplay mechanics, graphics, and the story. The parodic humor has been consistant throughout the series so far, but unfortunately the constistency of content still applies to the same old recycled dungeons and reskined monsters. \n\nRebirth 3 is probably my favorte one so far. The story has more depth while making more sense, and character development seems to flow more smoothly unlike neptunia 1 and 2. The new character Plutia was a refreshing addition as her humor was the most intesting of all. I am planning on getting the 4th installment of neptunia during sale time, so I hope they made more improvents in content rather then reusing some stuffs in thier most polish finish product.\n\nAs for my recommendation, this game isn't for a particular group of audience (westerners mainly). There are many obvious turn offs and understanding of jokes because of cultural differences and interests. Aside from that, I do get an old final fantasy and fire emblem gameplay mix vibe from it, so that is probably why I like and continue to play through all the neptunia games. The old ATB, simplistic gameplay design, and the special attacks (.EXE skill attacks) resemble that of limit break moments like final fantasy 7,8, and 10.

Gamindustri for quite some time, that is, until an anti-CPU group, led by Rei Rhyghts appears, at first, she's pretty klutzy, that is, until Neptune gets sent to another dimension, known as the

the same as Re;birth's 1 and 2, so only slight differences may vary, for example, a character's EXE attack can only be used if they have a bar filled in their SP bar, so instead of having 4 EXE bars, you could have 16 EXE attacks depending on if you use them, non-CPU characters have access to an awakened state, which powers them up, and of course, we have the challenges, from staying out of battle

There are also some good features that make this one a little better:\n\n-The new SP system, which needs a bit of effort to fill up without items at first (Unless you have drill, which makes you god-like), but gives every party member their own exe drive, so you can use multiple ultimate attacks in a row.\n\n-Using four characters at once instead of just three. Not sure why they didn't do that with the first one though.\n\n-This time you're allowed to choose between keep playing after finishing the story or start next game cycle instead of pulling you straight into the beggining of the story again.\n\n-They added a feature to let you track which monsters have that specific drop you're looking for\n\n-Those little plans to customize your game that make playing it all the better with your favorite character.\n\n-Good soundtrack, from awesome battle tracks to funny or casual music during cutscenes.\n\n-More Nep...what's not to love about that?\n\nNow as much as I love this game and could keep going on and on about it, it has it's flaws:\n\n-Some 3D scenes or battles can get laggy when fighting with everyone in HDD mode, especially around the ending.\n\n-The game and grinding might get slow and repetitive after a while, especially around the last levels.\n\n-The true ending can be complex to get without a guide to help you. And even then you might have to do a few game cycles before getting it.\n\n-In Re;Birth 1 and 2 they added Processors to give Noire's HDD form her pigtails hairstyle from Victory, but didn't bother doing it the other way around in this game...not really a flaw, but fans of her original hairstyle (like me) would have loved it.\n\n-A lot of people wanted a DLC that let you have Rei Ryghts as a playable character, but that never happened. Again, not a flaw. But indeed something that would have made a lot of people happy if added.\n\nConclussion:\n\nAs a fan of the franchise, I might be overlooking some flaws.

I never consumed all my SP in previous games, but now it's something you need to manage.\nThere are now Challenges (slay x foes, fight x battles, nothing hard really), that you'll need to complete to unlock bonuses - AND YOUR EXE DRIVES! - so be prepared to grind a lot. \nA lot of people said this game is easy.

There are only a few new looking dungeons.\nThe gameplay itself didn't changed much, so for those who are familiar with this series can dive in instantly.\nThe battle system is fun, but you might need a bit of grinding.\nStorywise it is packed with funny jokes, although the translation seems to be a bit off, noticeable on Nep's (the main character) lines.

lazy. Histoire gets mad and orders her to get out and learn how to become better at her just and just not be lazy basically. A organization has forms that is against the CPUs and wishes for the people to rule themselves with laws. Nep is sent to another dimension by some form of magic. She must find a way to get back home.\n\n[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]\nThe combat is the best it's been in the series. The content is greater than the previous titles. The story is easily better than the first game, but I probably liked the darker second game story better still. The humor is back in full force. Stella is actually a very good part of the game... assuming you buy the DLC. Several endings again. Tons of unlockables again. I love how often it breaks the fourth wall and doesn't take itself seriously.\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]\nPerformance on my end was poor even on a high end rig since evidently this has issues on AMD cards. The level resources are basically all from the previous titles. I wish they used tile sets or something so they were at least a little different. The DLC is basically required for Stella to be tollerable. The grind as always returns if you want the true ending. The voice acting is probably about the same, but because this game has more story scenes  it means even more are not voiced.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nEasily the best of the Re;Birth games, but not without issues.

If you're new to the franchise, that might be a let down if you want a mature  and serious story. Not a bad thing but it's good to say that in the very beginning so you will know what you're getting.\nHowever, if you are acquainted to the franchise, welcome back! This is a worthy sequel.\n\n[h1]DO I NEED TO PLAY RE;BIRTH2 BEFORE PLAYING THIS?[/h1]\nIt's not necessary but it would be good if you did. The story is set a few years after what happened in the end of Re;Birth2. There are some references and dialogues that you won't understand otherwise, and you will know and connect better to some returning characters. But that's only a small piece of the whole game and you will be fine if you're playing this first. \n\nThat said, lets begin the review:\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIt's a turn-based RPG, where you can move your character through a certain radius each turn, and his position in the battlefield determines his hit range and the amount of enemies he will hit with normal attacks. There are three types of normal attacks and there's up to five attacks in a single turn. Rush attacks fill your SP gauge faster, but are weaker. Break attacks are focused on destroying the guard of your opponent, and the Power attacks are what deal more damage. \nThe first attack is determined by the weapon and can't be changed. The other four attacks in each category are customizable, and you can attach different attacks in each of them. In Re;Birth2, there were up to four attacks, instead of five.\nSP is used for skills and EXE Drives, that deal a lot more damage but are more expensive. In Re;Birth 2, the SP Gauge and the EXE Drive Gauge were separate things, but here they are united, and I really think is better this way, for you can't spam skills and EXE Drives anymore: if you use an EXE Drive, you will lose points to use skills, which requires a more careful planning.\nThere are many equippable weapons, armors and clothes, as expected in a RPG game.\nThe Remake System is back. Basically, is where you use the Plans you get throughout the game (by key events or exploring) to unlock items, weapons, attack slots, dungeons and more, and change some aspects of the game (like the Fortify Enemies plan, or the Jump Higher plan, Change Dungeons and so on). It's really fun, and necessary to get the True Ending.\nThe mini-game Stella's Dungeon is back with some nice additions. In it, you equip Stella with the weapon, armor, and amulet of your choice, and send her to climb a tower to the top. She climbs by herself and the game shows the amount of time it will take. She keeps climbing even if you quit the game. There are 20 levels with more than 5000 floors, and you can select up to what floor she will climb and then stop. You have to be wise to select the equipment and up to what floor she will climb. In each run, she gathers new equipment (for her and for the main game) and some itens you can use in the main game too.  The addition is that you can select a partner for her now. There are dozens, each with specific skills.\nThere are many dungeons, including many optional ones.  However, the game suffers from the same problem that Re;Birth 2 has: the recycling of dungeons and monsters.  Most of the dungeons are copypaste of others with different monsters and with one or two roads blocked or open, and many monsters and are the same of others, only with different colors. The dungeons, as in Re;Birth 2, are too small to encourage the player to explore it. \nThere are missions to complete in the guild, like killing specific monsters or gathering specific items. You get credits, items and shares in reward. Shares will be better explained in the Story section, but basically each nation has a percentage of them, and you have to keep a balance between them. The amount of shares gives a boost in the attack of characters of each nation and may give you some plans and unlockable story events, but the impact is minimum compared to Re;Birth 2, where specific amounts of Shares were necessary to achieve different endings.\nYou can unlock the Colosseum too, and it has dozens of battles. Each with it's own rewards.\nThe Lily Rank shows the bonding of characters, as you can pair 4 front-line characters with 4 back characters. The Higher the Lily Rank, higher the boosts and coupling skills. \nThe Challenges give permanent boosts to the characters if you complete them, like \"Walk 100 meters with x character as the leader\" and so on.\n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe whole Neptunia franchise is based on making a parody with the gaming industry, so expect a hell lot of references. This franchise takes place in a world called Gamindustry, and there are four nations, each with it's own Goddesses, called CPUs.  The faith in each Goddess is what give them power, and this is called Shares. In the beginning of the game, Neptune, the CPU of Planeptune, is throwed to another dimension, where a group called Seven Sages is acting and trying to create a world where CPUs don't exist. She, then, must try to go back home, and help defeat the group in that dimension. \nThe story is told in Visual Novel style in the dialogues. It develops well, not rushing the pace, but I felt that the pace was too slow sometimes. My main complain is about the Seven Sages and enemies in general: I know this franchise won't have a dark story, but I just couldn't feel any sense of threat from them. This happened only when the real enemy unfolded, but it takes too long. Re;Birth 2 has a real threat behind the context from the very beginning, and you can feel it throughout the whole game, even with the light hearted mood. But even so, the Seven Sages are very charismatic, and the real enemy of the game has a badass final battle in the True Ending Route. The new characters are very nice, and the returning ones, if you already know them, also get a place to shine.\nI only got the True Ending, and it took me more than 50 hours. I was careful in exploring all I could, but I missed a lot still. Expect a long game.\nIf you get the true ending, there are tons of post-game content, and this is really nice. New dungeons and Colosseum Battles, and a post-game story that takes around 2 hours to complete. Even so, you can start a New Game+, keeping the levels and equipment to get other endings or leveling up the characters more.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nSince it's a Vita Port, the game is surprisingly beautiful, but don't expect detailed scenarios and such.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nGood, and there are some nice songs, but overall, nothing that should deserve a special note.\n\n[h1]Should I Play It?[/h1]\nIf you like turn-based RPGs with an awesome combat system and a light-hearted story with nice characters, go for it!  If you already played the previous games, and liked them, know that this is a worthy sequel. You will spend dozens of hours for a nice price, so go for it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1470194347, "timestamp_updated": 1470194347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548486411571502686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24672530": {"recommendationid": "24672530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177653311", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1520770402}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is great and has alot of humor and parody moments if you played the others in the series you will definitly love this one", "timestamp_created": 1470154618, "timestamp_updated": 1470154618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24633502": {"recommendationid": "24633502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032566296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1468532262}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh yis", "timestamp_created": 1469970280, "timestamp_updated": 1469970280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464628458023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24627908": {"recommendationid": "24627908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277928033", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3272, "last_played": 1527218086}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1469942803, "timestamp_updated": 1469942803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464628458023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24588102": {"recommendationid": "24588102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202034229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 7032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2064, "last_played": 1520525476}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No leas los comentarios.

But it is neither compelling or interesting when the same arc repeats itself every chapter.\n\nAlso the re-use of enemy models and area models is a little ridiculous. Once you've seen 5-6 dif places you've pretty much seen em all.\n\nAlso the outfits annoyed me.

I indeed played the two prequels, and this time something has changed. First of all we can notice that it has been introduced the same achievement system from Fairy Fencer (ps: you really should play it if you enjoyed Hyperdimension Neptunia <3), basically these are small tasks that the more you complete, the more they'll give you small bonuses. (Example: You jump 100 times you'll get extra 10 STR, 1000 times 15 STR etc. etc.). These tasks aren't so important, also each character has its own achievements.\nAnother important change is the Exe Drive Gauge that has been removed. In other words, the Exe Drive Gauge has been included in the SP (basically the Mana) bar. So your SP bar is not used just for casting normal spells, the more you'll fill it the more you'll able to use your different Combo finishers as well as your EXE skills. (Combo finishers won't consume SP bar, it just require it filled by a certain amount, while the EXE and normal skills consume it).\nDespite that i refused to play with Histoire since i found her way too op (same for the new character in late game).\n\nLast minor change is about endings, don't worry no spoilers. You finally don't have to end a game every time with different % Nation's shares :D. However the true ending requires a lot of grinding, but if you manage to get it... just worth it. Best ending of all Neptunia series.\nOh almost forgot the most important part of the review: Yes, the plot is even more amazing with even new more amazing characters. The gameplay is more or less still the same, but it's just so good anyway :3\nIf you enjoyed playing all the prequels then you definitely can not miss this awesome chapter, JUST GET IT <3\nPs: IRIS HEARTH NEW WAIFU CONFIRMED, PLEASE PUNISH ME.\n\n[ITA] Mi \u00e8 davvero piaciuto tanto tanto questo terzo capitolo. Ho giocato indubbiamente i due prequel, e questa volta troviamo delle differenze. Innanzitutto possiamo notare come \u00e8 stato introdotto il sistema di achievement identico a Fairy Fencer (ps: dovreste giocarlo se vi \u00e8 piaciuta la saga di Neptunia!), in pratica consiste in piccole missioni che pi\u00f9 vengono completate e pi\u00f9 daranno bonus aggiuntivi permanenti. (Per esempio: Saltare 100 volte con un personaggio vi dar\u00e0 automaticamente 10 punti forza, saltare 1000 volte ve ne dar\u00e0 15 e cos\u00ec via). Queste piccole missioni non sono di cos\u00ec fondamentale importanza, inoltre ogni personaggio ha le sue proprie missioni, quindi se proprio vorreste massimizzarvi un personaggio con tutti i bonus possibili dovreste sbloccare gli stessi achievement PER OGNI personaggio, e fidatevi che sono troppi.\nUn altro cambiamento importante \u00e8 la barra EXE (Exe Drive Gauge) che \u00e8 stata rimossa, o meglio, integrata con la barra SP (praticamente il Mana). In parole semplici, la barra SP non servir\u00e0 pi\u00f9 solamente per evocare le magie normali, ma avr\u00e0 anche la funzione di permettere l'uso della Combo Finisher (ovvero l'attacco base finale, normalmente il 4\u00b0 attacco del personaggio di tipo Rush, Power o Break) quando si avr\u00e0 la barra riempita di una certa quantit\u00e0 (in base a quanto richiede la Combo Finisher). Inoltre le skill finali EXE consumeranno semplicemente la barra SP esattamente come le skill normali.\nA parte questi cambiamenti, mi sono rifiutato di giocare con Histoire in squadre perch\u00e8 secondo me \u00e8 troppo OP (cos\u00ec come il nuovo personaggio giocabile verso la fine del gioco).\n\nUn altro piccolo cambiamento, tranquilli niente spoiler, finalmente non dovrete pi\u00f9 scervellarvi a ottenere i finali basati sulla % degli share di ogni nazione :D. Nonostante ci\u00f2, il true ending (tanto per cambiare) richiede tanto grinding, ma se riuscirete ad ottenerlo... beh, sappiate che secondo me \u00e8 stato il miglior finale di tutta la saga, davvero fantastico <3.\nOh quasi dimenticavo la parte pi\u00f9 importante della recensione: SI, la trama \u00e8 fantastica con personaggi altrettanto fantastici! Ormai sappiamo che il gameplay alla fine \u00e8 lo stesso, ma \u00e8 tutto troppo bello comunque :3\nSe vi sono piaciuti i due sequel, allora non potete assolutamente perdervi questo terzo bellissimo capitolo.\nPs: IRIS HEARTH NEW WAIFU CONFIRMED, PLEASE PUNISH ME.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1466435858, "timestamp_updated": 1466435858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23614907": {"recommendationid": "23614907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041104112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5190, "last_played": 1577108189}, "language": "english", "review": "I gotta say, I've never heard of the Hyperdimension Neptunia series until early this year.

Each region represents a different console/company, I'm not 100% sure what each one is tbh but I do believe it goes something like this Lastation represents the Playstation, Planeptune represents Sega, Leanbox represents Xbox and lastly Lowee represents Nintendo.\n\nThe story here is more or less the same but this time Neptune has been pulled into another dimension and must find her way back to her own world by gathering enough shares but a criminal organisation who basically want to get rid of CPUs are interfering with your efforts so you have to stop them.\n\nArfoire my personal favourite villain plays her part once again too and like the previous 2 games the gameplay is pretty much the same except for a bit of ironing out here and there so no complaints there. Challenges were added which when completed grant you stat bonuses which is a nice little touch. \n\nMy only complaint however with the game as a whole is the way you have to unlock the EXE Drive, this is done by basically using special moves 100 times which can take a while and I find the quickest way to do this is to fight weak monsters so you can KO them in a single hit each time.\n\nOverall this game is simply fantastic, attack animations look beautiful.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1464370927, "timestamp_updated": 1464376575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39037594199180603", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23133025": {"recommendationid": "23133025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008755524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 29325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23595, "last_played": 1569393698}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Waifu Simulator", "timestamp_created": 1463905891, "timestamp_updated": 1463905891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5098152756690979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23055470": {"recommendationid": "23055470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118076384", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1199, "last_played": 1464172542}, "language": "english", "review": "It's more Nep-Nep, what more could you want?\n\n10/10 would Nep-Nep again.", "timestamp_created": 1463582026, "timestamp_updated": 1463582026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485992640256881714", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23029026": {"recommendationid": "23029026", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998415963", "num_games_owned": 2368, "num_reviews": 213, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1449984587}, "language": "english", "review": "A Good Game.", "timestamp_created": 1463439964, "timestamp_updated": 1463439964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497367590665817261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23016222": {"recommendationid": "23016222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075465231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 10367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5052, "last_played": 1549625850}, "language": "english", "review": "Best of the series.\nEverything you love, but more of it.", "timestamp_created": 1463387341, "timestamp_updated": 1463387341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497367590665817261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22976257": {"recommendationid": "22976257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067495136", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1526737431}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS JUST BEATUFIL MAN, GET IT DA RIGHT NOW SON!

The combat system isn't incredibly deep, but it works and is fun enough (though I still feel the Break chain of attacks is relatively useless). HDD attacks feel a bit more balanced and not nearly as broken as in Rebirth 1. \n\nStory wise, though the Neptunia games have never had strong stories, but this one feels the best to me. It follows Nep as she is transported to another dimension, the world of the 1980's game industry, which is a novel idea and leads to fun geeky jokes about the era. The characters have always been what drives the Neptunia games, and this one brings back nearly every previous character in some form, which I adore. \n\nI found the game relatively easy for most of the main story, but that post game content, dungeons, and Colliusum battles require strategy and will kick your ass if you aren't prepared, which I really like. It's an appreciated difficulty bump for more hardcore players. \n\nIf I had complaints, the biggest one is the continued recycling of dungeons and enviroments. There are only a handful of dungeon layouts, and \"new\" dungeons are simply old ones with a new enemy coat. This was a problem in Rebirth 1 and 2 and it's a bit irritating it coninues here. The required amount of level grinding is also very grating. \n\nBut overall, Rebirth 3 is my favorite of the Rebirth games and I don't regret putting in the time. Had a lot of fun!

They range from 'annoying' to 'insufferable' to 'I really wish this game had a Conquest ending so I could personally murder Plutia and Vert'.\nI say with absolutly no hyperbole or jest that there were many times during this game where I experienced genuine physical and mental pain. I'd have to stop playing and try to take my mind off of the game for a while before I could even consider coming back to it.\nStill, if you enjoyed the other games, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this one. Just give some thought to buying the DLC, as that's the only way to have any of the Human/Maker characters available to use.\nI look forward to the day where we get a Neptunia game that puts less focus on these one-note CPUs, and instead puts the interesting 'side' characters in the limelight.", "timestamp_created": 1461276612, "timestamp_updated": 1461355635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568904697895050049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22533618": {"recommendationid": "22533618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184110950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 12971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3813, "last_played": 1687771876}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a game for anime lovers like me for example other people should try this game out because it's funny and it's my type of game where I can just roast one of the bad or the good guys I don't like but hey its my opinion and I'm ok with your opinions on this but try it out for yourselfs", "timestamp_created": 1461159986, "timestamp_updated": 1461159986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22532234": {"recommendationid": "22532234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062292984", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1392, "last_played": 1464672240}, "language": "english", "review": "I sometimes wonder what i am doing in my life", "timestamp_created": 1461154045, "timestamp_updated": 1461154045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22518593": {"recommendationid": "22518593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110817286", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1013, "last_played": 1481504911}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego :D", "timestamp_created": 1461083815, "timestamp_updated": 1461083815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504984736442565918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22468894": {"recommendationid": "22468894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171966735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2114, "last_played": 1483618681}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked the other two games you'll likely have a very long gaming hourly session with this. \n", "timestamp_created": 1460866957, "timestamp_updated": 1460866957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22442210": {"recommendationid": "22442210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054006923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4291, "last_played": 1455672724}, "language": "english", "review": "Third installment of the neturnia game series released on steam, now it's hard not to openly compare it to the other two before it but so I won't really try, sorry. As far as game difficulty goes its in between the first and second one, the first Re:birth being the hardest and the second being the easiest.\nThe easiest point of this game is the shear number of characters you get though DLC (which appears be to DLC mostly if you have saves from the previous games rather then buying) outside of the DLC characters it has the smallest cast of playable characters being only the CPU's, (so take it as you want on the DLC characters being bad by making it easier or good to make up for the lack of characters).\nCombat system is the same as the previous two with a few diffrences, first off collusium battles are easier now with the monsters being less OP, second off you are given the option of switching KO'd character with there back character, and third, the EX system of the game for combat has been drastly changed, rahter then a shared EX gadge that is shared by the party it is based on the individual characters SP, alsong with those changes SP regenerates a little per hit and all characters have there SP locked at 1000 (no increasing it this game). Along that some line of though I want to add this means you can't spam HDD all the time, your SP doesn't recover when you leave a dungeon, it only recovers from battle or items, but a small plusside (for the DLC characters at least) everyone has an HDD action, or rather none CPU's have Awakening, more or less a super sayain golden aura with boosted stats.\nMusic is still more or less the same with a few plans that can let you change the music (but only the default or a single alt.) \nAnother new addition (Which can be really annoying if your a completionist) is a challange system, basicly you do something a number of times and you unlock stuff (mostly small stat ups with the final level of the challanges being a large stat up, but also some plans), the ploblem here is that some of these are beyond annoying such as one challange where you have to run away from battle, the final level of the being run away from battle 3000 times (and again just one of several) and also it only applies to the active characters (meaning for the one were you have to walk around the map for so many meters you have to do with ALL the characters to competly complete it).\nStory wise you'll see a lot of similarity between the anime version with some base setting from the second game (and somehow a lot of refrensing to the first). The story was good and had a lot of good build-up with a bit of acualy game history in it (you'll more or less see the game industries history be built up and refrenced a lot, specially with processors for the CPU you unlock frequently at the start of new chapters). Fans of the series most likly already know that Plutia is a main character so lots of great stuff to expect (Including a priceless scene between Iris Heart, IF, and Arfoir).\nOverall tone of the game feels more like the first one with the more wacky and sillyness that you've come to love (or might come to love) from the series and managing to mix in nicely a somewhat serious tone channeling more of the same feel with the first Re:birth but with a lot more fourth wall breaking in this, to a point where even some of the villians do it.\nOverall if your a fan of the neptunia series, or wanting to play a less intensive/serious RPG this is a good game to get and unlike the second Re:birth without any major game breaking DLC (except an experience booster plan but easy enough to ignore)", "timestamp_created": 1460773217, "timestamp_updated": 1460773217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527777791023254395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22437657": {"recommendationid": "22437657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104055177", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5255, "last_played": 1460750719}, "language": "english", "review": "100% all 3 of the Neptunia games and they tried to do it a bit different in this one, which is not always good. \nFirst what i liked:\n\n+ They removed share character locks, share endings or having way to many endings\n+ Its Neptunia what can you say more \n\nNow what i dont like:\n\n- They added an item that you only can get 1 time per true ending and is needed to make some of the best weapons in the game, which is really dumb and just a cheap way to replay the game\n- They added the achievement system from Fairy Fencer and you are forced to do specific tasks to unlock really                                                       important plans for each character which gets annoying\n- This game is probably the grindiest one of all Neptunia games, because there is really no fast way to make xp and money like in the other games, where you got a lot in the colosseum in a decent amount of time\n- They also increased the prices for items in the shop by a lot, for example each best weapon in the game cost 10million alone, not even speaking of all the other stuff you can buy, which is also a really cheap way to extend the play time\n\nSo overall they tried to change a few things which are good but the most changes they did i really dont like its just like they wanted to extend the game time by making one time items, enormous prices, annoying achievements and really low xp and money rate to make it a grind fest.

This problem was even more serious in earlier Neptunia games. It is recommended to read the guide carefully before starting the game if you want to get as many achievements as possible. Not so much of a big deal as a disadvantage, but still, better to be aware of missable events ^^.\n\nAs I mentioned, I\u2019m a sincere fan of this series, so I\u2019ll try to cover as many general aspects as I can possibly think of:\n\n    This game, which can be called HDN re birth 3 (on PC) or Victory (on PS3) for short, is a tactical role-playing game in which players take control of 4 characters both in the front line and the rear line (meaning 8 in total). This makes this latest product different in a more catchy way, probably easier to get the gist of the gameplay compared to the 2 earlier Neptunia games; for new players of HDN, I suggest you to play this first (like me), because this one gives less penalty compared to the 2 earlier ones. When a character dies, for example, in HDN Victory, the system still allow switches between the K.Oed character and the rear character, while in others you need to revive the dead before doing so, also, you have all the characters from the earlier games to use, and so on\u2026\u2026.. but don't worry, the story in this game is settled completely differently from the earlier ones, only the same characters remains\n.\n    However, sometimes you will still face challenges, in this case, there are two ways: \nDevelop a strategy or to train characters by fighting monsters from time to time. You can slay bosses which are difficult to beat at the first encounter more easily with the 2nd solution, but in my case for example, I always try to beat the boss with strategies in spite of being difficult, which wine and dines my own tactical strategy ^^, and well, sometimes this takes time -.- .\n\n    About the characters, well, let's say that you will never have enough with them, their cuteness is really, unbeatable (even I cannot resist >^<), in my opinion, this is a special and important feature for this series, every character is different, which is why the use of strategy becomes interesting here [spoiler]excluding the OPed histoire[/spoiler].\n\n    Speaking of items, weapons and crafts, we have an abundant amount of which in this game, this keeps leveling up the character\u2019s ability as players upgrade their equipments while training. Crafts, which are called plans in this game, play an extremely important role in this game, some plans gives you extremely powerful weapons while others provide very useful items, many maps even require the corresponding plan to be unlocked, therefore, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it is important to sometimes pause from advancing the storyline in order to get some plans done, this makes the gameplay a lot easier. There are different ways to get a plan done, some requires you to gather items from enemy drops, others needs you to gather ingredients in the field of a dungeon...... et cetera. Don't worry about getting bored, even exploring them can be fun ^^.\n\n    Soundtracks and CGs in this game are also well done. Idea Factory, together with Compile Heart, created its own style of character\u2019s painting design which is genuinely unique, you can\u2019t find anime artworks with similar ingenuity of manga creation elsewhere. Soundtracks are generally a good background support to the gameplay, although I can\u2019t think of anything extraordinary, these soundtracks are special for me personally in terms of melody, hopefully you will enjoy them as well ^^.\n\n     About potential bugs, I don't think that I encountered more 5 bugs after 82 hours of gameplay, so for me, the gameplay is pretty solid. I'm sorry for players who often experiences crashes in game, I am not really helpful here...\n\n    Thank you for reading this review, I hope that this did give you a general idea on the system of the game as well as the main features. However, I have to say that even if it did, it remains only a vague introduction, there are tons and tons of things which only you can discover in this game, no descriptions can really work for HDN series.

And even more content than ever. You can easily put a lot of hours to this game. Trust me. Now lets talk about advantage and disadvantages.\n\nAdvantages:\n-+1 Combo: You can perform 5 combos right now and another EX Finishes.\n-Easier to explore Stella's Dungeon: Instead of explore the actual dungeon in Re;Birth2, this game become \"Areas\". One area includes a lot of items. Easier to finish. And you can deploy her while you are in dungeon too.\n-Easier to acquire plans: Plans that you will get you will find less plans because Stella will find it for you.\n-Explore the actual Nation: Instead of every nation in the same map, you have the large map that includes nations and each natio have it's own map.\n-More dungeons than ever: Means you can grind easier.\n-Leader effect: You will get bonus stats based on what character is the leader.\n-Better looking menu: Why I frogot about this. It's easier to understand.\n\nDisadvantages:\n-Some crashes and framerate drops: Still better than the second game. But in first game I got zero crashes and framerate drops. Especially wheh I fight the CPUs I got bad framerate drops. Even I have an awesome rig.\n-Grinding like the previous games: The way Neptunia was meant to be played.\n-More useless plans: You know what, I hate this. More features and also more useless plans. The +1 combo I said above should use plans...... for each character.  Leader effect I also said above should use plans too. No individual EXE Skills, only the couple and frontline EXE Skills was given through the story. Why? BECAUSE YOU NEED A F*CKING PLAN TO UNLOCK FOR EACH CHARACTER. F*CK THIS.\n-Now SP and EXE Drive gauge become one: Means hitting enemies refils SP gauge because they remove the actual EXE Drive Gauge. Means Ex finishers based on the amount of SP you have, EXE Skills consumes SP(1SP bar means 250 SP=1EXE for previous games).Many like it. But I don't.\n\nOverall: This game is superior to the first two games(Oh and also U. forget about it, hugely lack of content). This game has a lot of content that you can't get enough.

4851, "last_played": 1499975820}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Once again, I have left writing this review for far too long[/h1]\nIronically, like my review of Neptunia 2, which was quite delayed, I am once again going to be reviewing Neptunia 3 mostly as a sequel, though I shall also try my best to review Neptunia 3 as it's own game, also akin to my review of Neptunia 2.\n\n[b]Is it the best game ever?[/b]\nNah, still Valkyrie Profile. I doubt anything will change this fact for a long time.\n\n[b]But is it a good game?[/b]\nDefinitely. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 Victory Generation is a brilliant game and well worth playing if you're even remotely tempted.\n\n[b]I'm still lazy, and writing Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 Victory Generation everytime I wish to refer to the game is arduous and word count consuming, so Neptunia 3 it shall be.\n\nSo, what's new?[/b]\nWell, not alot, really.\n\nTo my knowledge, Neptunia V was the first in the series to use the current \"freeish movement\" battle format that has been used in the rereleases, the Re;birth series, so while a slightly updated rerelease of V nicely rounds out the first three games of the series, it does feel a little silly. \n\nNot that I care, I'm not buying a Ps3 just for Neptune. (I totally would, though).\n\nThat being said, the Re;birth series [i]did[/i] also port Neptunia to the Vita and consequently, the PC.\n\nWhile I stand by my statement of \"not alot, really\", this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The format of the game they have works, can be quick for that post-story grinding and doesn't feel like a chore when you're near the end. It's good.\n\n[b]So, Tom, what [i]is[/i] new? Tell us properly this time.[/b]\nOk, alright, I'm sorry.\n\nThe story is new, obviously. It's quite good, as well. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though in my opinion the story of Neptunia 1 is better, the story of Neptunia 3 is still very good, if not a little better in some aspects. With a new story comes new characters. Some are \"new\", while others are actually totally new. Plutia, Lady Iris Heart, is fantastic and shall hopefully be a staple character in the future games [Spoiler](She's not in VII ;<)[/spoiler].\n\nWith a new story, we get a new dimension, but unlike Neptunia 2 to Neptunia 1, Neptunia 3 is set in the same universe as Neptunia 2, and is a direct sequel to it. This new dimension is effectively gaming in the late 1980's and early 90's, and it's awesome. Fun fact, this makes some of the characters in it older than my glorious self.\n\nChallenges have been [strike]lifted[/strike] borrowed from Fairy Fencer F, and a little character scaling has been adapted into them. While they don't really do anything important, some of the challenges grant very nice and useful things if you manage to finish them off, but this may take a while.\n\nNeptunia 3 is also the first in the series to use in game cutscenes, albeit very few. They are enjoyable, and a nice break from Visual Novel presentation.\n\nNepstation! I almost forgot Nepstation. A mock TV show that is inbetween chapters and separate to the plot. 'Tis a fun little breather as well as having extra stuff to do and win.\n\n[b]So, what returns?[/b]\nNeptune, obviously, as does her sister and all of the other main cast. A good chunk of side characters also make an appearance but the Oracles are on holiday, or something. \n\nStella's Dungeon also makes a return; it's bigger and better and less invoking of your ire if you have any plans to 100% the game's achievements. Doing so will still take a great amount of time, however, and I personally cannot be arsed with that. Despite the length that Stella's dungeon lasts, it always gives you useful things and also gives you some key things, such as Plans for increasing combos.\n\nOther than that, alot of what you will expect from Neptunia returns. The game still retains it's humour, BAMs, optional dungeons, post game content and a large amount of attire for the girls.\n\nYou know what else returns? THE SOUND SETTINGS DEFAULT TO MAX. STOP THIS.\n[spoiler]They did stop it, finally, in Neptunia VII. They only default to ~35%. Wonderful.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]So what about that port?[/b]\nThere's... actually extremely little to say here that wasn't already said for Neptunia 2. As aforementioned, sounds still default to max, but other than one seemingly rare game breaking bug that I had, which can be fixed with a little help from Google (I don't know if the developers have fixed it officially at this point), there's nothing new or different.\n\nTo be fair, this is a good thing as the port quality of the previous two games was pretty solid and this is no different.\n\n[b]So, what else?[/b]\nAs with Neptunia 2 to Neptunia 1, all the dungeons and so on look nicer, there's some newer enemies here and there, while the UI and menus all look better and more streamlined.\n\nThe resource management has been rearranged a bit; the EXE drive is taking a break for this installment and the mana has been standardised to 1000 at all levels. I like this, skills no longer cost disproportionately high amounts of mana early on, and mana potions are now worthwhile past Chapter 2. Mana also regerates a little between turns, I believe.\n\nThe Mana is divided into four chunks, and special moves now use up to all four of those 250 mana chunks to cast, further providing relevance for mana potions. Sadly, nothing else has been rescaled,  combat-wise, so Formation and Coupling Skills are still fairly redundant, the tier 2 super moves are still generally the best, while the AoE supers are still blatantly the strongest. That and Neptunia [i]still[/i] doesn't have a worthwhile final Power attack, though she does feel a little stronger.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\nMuch like with the rest of the Neptunia series, I'd happily pay full price for Neptunia 3 and enjoy it for what some may say is too long. As it happens, I once again bought the game on release sale for \u00a313, Yay sales.\n\nI love this series, and as such, have since bought and played alot of the new Neptunia VII on the PS4 [spoiler]which is amazing[/spoiler]. That does mean that I'm unlikely to grant you with another Magnum Opus review for a while, but I'm afraid we shall all have to deal with it.\n\nAlso, it must suck to be in your older sister's shadow. Especially when your older sister is so utterly perfect and amazing and there is now twice as much perfection for you to compete with.", "timestamp_created": 1457749776, "timestamp_updated": 1457833807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21777510": {"recommendationid": "21777510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065636487", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1635553893}, "language": "english", "review": "Buying this game also includes:\n\nCons\n-Your parents disowning you\n-Quitting league of legends\n-No longer having friends\n\nPros\n-Waifus\n-More Waifus\n-Nepgear\n-Nepgear\n-More Nepgear\n-Nep nep\n-that loli ass\n\n14/5-Better than Fire Emblem Fates\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1457741776, "timestamp_updated": 1457741776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21769178": {"recommendationid": "21769178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068953669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1459957533}, "language": "english", "review": "It true ...it a good game\nBut ...When in fan servicce time\nIt hard to play in front of my family....\nScare to think they though i playing a girl game\nand a pedo @@\nDamn it\n", "timestamp_created": 1457715969, "timestamp_updated": 1457715969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21769084": {"recommendationid": "21769084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259842271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1459055745}, "language": "english", "review": "Kawaii xD", "timestamp_created": 1457715661, "timestamp_updated": 1457715661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21767055": {"recommendationid": "21767055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201590643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1457015534}, "language": "english", "review": "Say this tongue twister with me! \"How much Nep would a Nep Nep Nep if a Nep Nep would Nep Nep.\"", "timestamp_created": 1457708951, "timestamp_updated": 1511747124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21744539": {"recommendationid": "21744539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037043399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 618, "last_played": 1449445983}, "language": "english", "review": "All you need to know:\n\nIs a game about girls who are video games.\n\nRequires you to be of-age.", "timestamp_created": 1457603687, "timestamp_updated": 1457603687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21741129": {"recommendationid": "21741129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078844152", "num_games_owned": 771, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 4868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2181, "last_played": 1544355010}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Call Of Duty, but has guilty pleasures.

"review": "Re;Birth3 V Generation is basically a direct improvement over the previous entries in the series, and in many ways is even superior to the most recent mainline release, Victory 2. The quality-of-life improvements in R;B3 from previous entries are substantial, and the game itself, for those who haven't played Victory, is superb. \n\nThe Neptunia franchise, for those unfamiliar, features fairly standard JRPG gameplay, but the main attraction are the visual-novel-esque story and character interaction segments. In contrast to mk2/R;B2, Victory/RB;3 features a story that is far more about the characters than an overarching plot (though one is present). Most of the time you spend playing the game will probably be spent watching the very colorful cast interact with each other. The initial party (and main characters in this entry) of Neptune, Plutia, and Noire is an excellent combination of personalities that really sells the more slice-of-life atmosphere present in R;B3 compared to its predecessors. I think it really should be mentioned that Kana Hanazawa, who provides the voice for Plutia, is near her best in this game, demonstrating an absolutely masterful range and stellar performance.\n\nHaving played and enjoyed all of the main games in the franchise, I personally find Re;Birth 3 to be the most entertaining and fun entry in the series, narrowly beating out even V2. If you have played any of the other games in the series, I strongly encourage you to purchase this game, and if you have not yet played a Neptunia game but are interested in the series I think RB;3 is the best place to start.", "timestamp_created": 1457491495, "timestamp_updated": 1457491495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21720516": {"recommendationid": "21720516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069240691", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1552878807}, "language": "english", "review": "anime t*ties", "timestamp_created": 1457491047, "timestamp_updated": 1457491047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21718612": {"recommendationid": "21718612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140811742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1210, "last_played": 1532311116}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game  MORE WAIFUS  but   has 1 bug  whit the  battle system the enemys  didnot attack  in ramdom battles  and i need refresh the game   \nthe frozen enemys are ramdon  and   i lose so much progrest for this reazon \nmy ingles es malo :v", "timestamp_created": 1457481821, "timestamp_updated": 1457481821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49199792742729187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21717127": {"recommendationid": "21717127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035228092", "num_games_owned": 2290, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 7740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7678, "last_played": 1453875276}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mas divertido de la trilogia, lejos.\n\nVuelven los personajes anteriormete vistos con una nueva historia, en una nueva dimension.\n\nEste titulo tiene mucho mas de novela visual que los anteriores, con muchas mas interaccion entre los personajes, ya sean los buenos o los malos.

I'm just going to call the game Nep-Nep 3 from now on.\n\nOK. Nep-Nep 3 is, at its core, a pretty much by-the-numbers JRPG. Fight monsters, level up, fight more monsters, level up, etc.  There's a crafting system wherein you take items gained from battle to make new items, as well as to unlock items to be sold in shops. The battle mechanics are a bit unique, and combine strategic placement of your characters along with combo attacks that add some variety to what would otherwise be pretty stale gameplay.\n\nThis game gets most of its fan following from 2 main points. The first is a positively ludicrous amount of fan service. The cast is made up exclusively of cute girls wearing elaborate and often skimpy outfits.  The second is the game's sense of humor. Its main character, Neptune, is extremely self-aware and very genre-savvy. She KNOWS she's in a video game and so do most of the other characters. They make comments about it constantly and they're always breaking the 4th wall, and Neptune will frequently talk directly to the player.\n\nSo if you're looking at Nep-Nep 3, you've probably already played the previous games in the series. If you haven't, here's a quick rundown of the setting. The world of Gamindustri is split up into 4 nations--Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee and Leanbox. Each nation is ruled by a goddess, often referred to as a CPU. These goddesses take the beliefs of their people and translate them into formidable combat prowess. They gain this belief, called \"shares\" by supporting and helping their people. They used to fight each other constantly for domination of Gamindustri. Now they all find themselves as more friendly rivals than bitter enemies (thanks to Neptune's actions in a previous game). If you think all this stuff sounds familiar, that's not by accident. The whole game is an allegory for the entire game industry (Gamindustri, get it?) The nations of Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee and Leanbox are meant to represent the hardware manufacturers Sega, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft (in that order).  The entire world is littered with references to video games--some subtle, others REALLY blatant) and the whole thing has a vibe of \"we changed the names just enough to avoid getting sued\".  It's part of the humor though.\n\nIf you have not played the first two games, I wouldn't worry about it too much. There's stuff that happens there that will be referenced in this game, but they'll generally explain what they're talking about when that happens.  Also, the games are all pretty similar to each other. The big downside is they recycle a lot of assets from game to game, from enemy types to character models to even entire dungeon maps. To a degree this makes some sense as all the games take place in the same spot, and in a pretty close time frame--so the world really doesn't change much. That said, the appearance of the game is decidedly last-gen.  The character animations are stiff and the models are of a middling quality. (Then again, all 3 of these games are console ports, so that may have something to do with it)\n\nSo how can I sum all this up?  Well, if you played Nep-Nep 1 and 2 and enjoyed them, this is more of the same, so you'll like it.  If you didn't care for either of those two games, don't bother.  If you're on the fence but like a funny JRPG that doesn't take itself too seriously, I suggest giving it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1456508530, "timestamp_updated": 1456508530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21475699": {"recommendationid": "21475699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063051890", "num_games_owned": 1027, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 3769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1278, "last_played": 1458147775}, "language": "english", "review": "Game about a bunch of girls discussing chest size.", "timestamp_created": 1456497640, "timestamp_updated": 1456497640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21453110": {"recommendationid": "21453110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089263056", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1527259957}, "language": "english", "review": "Noire <3", "timestamp_created": 1456439246, "timestamp_updated": 1456439246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21436511": {"recommendationid": "21436511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008145878", "num_games_owned": 801, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 544, "last_played": 1561469682}, "language": "english", "review": "Lets be honest XCOM 2 just came out and you know you're going to spend atleast 75$ on it.

Story based game (Visual Novel) with a mix of turn based and fighting game... which is surprisingly interesting at times. In fact, I'm not a man who smiles very often, but I did smile a lot due to this game! :D[/i]\n- me, 14th of November 2015\n\n[b]<If you don't want to read all the descriptive and narrative stuff... just scroll down to the lists, but maybe that means that you won't like the game since it has a lot of story>[/b]\n\nSo, I hope that you have seen the trailer and a few screenshots before reading this review. This game is a Japanese RPG with its iconic characters. It's a Turn-Based game with Fighting animations. The storry is very funny and if you don't like reading the story and you only want mindless slaughter... leave now.  The game itself is a remake of the PS3 version, I don't know the PS3 version of this game but I do know that the rework from the first game and that one had huge differences.  \n\nIt's a port from the PSVita and you feel that, the interface wasn't actually remade for PC Gamers so this version still is PSVita, but enhanced with some mouse support and maybe some additional feature. I ended up playing only with the keyboard the entire time, and remapped part of the NumBlock to fit for combat, movement and navegation. I haven't played with a gamepad but I strongly recommend using one (Most likely Xbox 360 ro Xbox One if you don't want to get in trouble). It also has some optimization issues and has an FPS limit, quite low for my taste actually.\n\nThe characters are interesting, the story is funny in a simple way and the combat effects are wonderful and \"hype\", [i] I want to be punished by HDD' Plutia: Her Ladyship Iris Heart[/i] and you learn a few things... like some body parts in latin or references about the console wars.\n\nThe \"Plans\" system isn't good in my opinion.... most weapons end up being useless before I can even buy them after crafting.... I tend to have unlocked the next tier default weapons and their stats beat them easily. No gain by crafting most weapons (there are exceptions). Only Armor and Ornaments tend to have some utility in this game... the rest is just for decoration. The game isn't that challenging... and you can't actually change it, I have it in hard mode and I still end up slicing the boss with Neptune's special ability. Once again... optimization issues (laggy). The [u]map design[/u]... and the [u]textures[/u] (flooring and maps), they could seriously improve A LOT Some BGM could improve (specially the boss music when fighting the fellow goddesses) The [u]SHARES[/u] system apparently is totally useless... shares get reset after cutscenes or however you want to call them...  I had 100% shares on planeptune and got set to 10% after a storybreak... [b]AWESOME! (NO)[/b] and there are a few more and I will add them once I have meditated a bit.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\n[b]+ + +[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Interesting/funny characters.\n[*]Nep-nep.\n[*]Wonderful skill animations\n[*]Funny & simple story.\n[*]Plenty of outfits to buy and to craft.\n[*]You may learn new things related to gaming and gaming culture... also maybe japanese culture.\n[*]It's [b]KAWAII![/b]\n[/list]\n[b]+++[/b]\n\n[b]- - -[/b]\n[list]\n[*]It's a port and you feel it.\n[*]Not or poorly optimized.\n[*]Map design and textures are poor.\n[*][Personal objection] It's turn-based.\n[*]Many plans end up being useless.\n[*]The shares system apparently has no impact... atleast it's not friendly.\n[*]The game is easy... if you get beaten by an enemy, just grind a bit and you'll beat it in no-time flat... so it usually isn't very challenging.\n[*]Some boss-battle music ruining the atmosphere... It rather makes me laugh than feel epic for beating them. (Vs the fellow Goddesses)\n[*]The combat system itself is boring in terms of tactics, if not for the animations, I'd say it's too cheap [the system]. Turn-based but without advantages for tactical positioning (except that it's dumb to have all characters right next to eachother, because then AoE's can hit all of them)\n[*]27.99 \u20ac? No, that's somewhat overpriced... I'd put it on 20\u20ac so atleast reduce it to 25\u20ac.\n[/list]\n[b]- - -[/b]\n\n\nAll in all, I was very happy with the game. I don't regret having bought it.\n\nPS: You want one of those x/10 , right? Well [b]NO![/b]  You can't mathemathically quantify [u]ART[/u], and if you think that you can you're a fool.

Done that, you start a random bullet on head. Your PC may or may not run the game. Doesn't matter if you have or not the required to run (I have above and still crashes). You might want ask Idea Factory for help with game issues, as crashes and bugs. They will reply your email only to check your comp settings and hardware. Done that, forget more help. So, unless you use the Steam Guide for crashes and bugs, you won't advance on the game. It can't stand longplays. At least with me, the sounds start bugging and at some point, it crash. Usually when having a long battle. Crash.The game lacks a manual too. Nothing will say what or how to do and the ingame help is very basic as \"jump button for jump\". I'll say. If you buy it, be aware that it may crash like hell and you will have to find solution on your own.\n\nNow the game. The game is good. Funny.

The odd,yet very interesting thing is that the girls are all based or represent game consoles or game engines.\n\nPros:\n+Very fun story and dialogue between the characters\n+ Cute and likeable characters\n+4th wall breaking- Adds a certain charm to the game and makes things funnier\n+Battling- You will be doing a lot of battles in which you will be doing the same thing over and over again,but because of the pretty animations and cool Special abilities,it doesn't get boring\n+Design of characters- All of the characters have some things,like ribbons,hairpins or clothing that clues and hints on the game console or engine they are representing\n+Customization- Many accesories and clothing to dress your characters into\n+Do a lot of stuff- There is a lot of grinding to be done and for the most part it is well done\n+Story is easy to get into- Playing the previous Hyperdimension games is not necessary to understand the story,since it pretty light-hearthed\n+Light yuri and ship-teasing\n\nCons:\n-Technical Difficulties- Had to mess a lot with the properties and install some other stuff to get the game to function properly. Sometimes the game stilll crashes for me on one of the two PC's I played this game on.\n-Too much to grind- I said that the grinding was well done,but there are some things that require an insane amount of work and time spent to be achieved. Getting all of the endings is and maxing out lily ranks is super tedious.\n-Dungeon and enemy recycling- This is a very big game,which uses recycled maps and enemies to a great amount. While I can tolerate the recycling of enemies,since a lot of RPG's and other games do that,I can't tolerate the recycling of the same map for 4+ times.\n-Repetition of tropes- This is an anime-like game and expect to see a lot of stuff you saw a million times before (There is the topic of breast sizes,which the characters talk about quite a handful of times. It may be funny the first or second time,but after that it gets a bit ridiculous).\n-Not enough yuri - Moar is required \n\nOverall,this game is/was very fun to play and I will spend more time playing it. Hyperdimension is one of the best RPG's I played and it will be a big favorite of mine. Looking forward to more Hyperdimension Neptunia games and I may play the other games aswell.

But then, the point of sale of Neptunia games lies with their charismatic characters and hilarious writing, so I didn't find myself bothered by the deja-vu and neither should you.\n\nSpeaking of Re;Birth 2, if you had the misfortune of playing it, you'll be glad Compile Heart took feedback to heart and castigated their prior game hilariously.\n\n[b]Warning 2:[/b] Just as with Re;Birth 2, the last chapter and true ending require you to do some stuff. Fortunately, Re;Birth 3 is way more forgiving than 2 and the conditions are harder to miss. Just read a guide here on the forums and you're golden.\n\nMy only complain: If this game aimed for the early days of the console war... where are all the old discarded consoles?? Where's SNK? Where's Nec? Where's Panasonic? Where are Phillips and Bandai? Where's Mattel? That was one HUGE wasted opportunity. WARNING: COMMENT ON THE GAME's LAST CHAPTER [spoiler]I'd have actually left Planeptune in ruins after Ryghts' bombardment and turned Nep into a wandering Wuxia goof to remain faithful to what happened in the console wars.

As much as I hate to admit it, Compile Heart's opus to moe console wars has succesfully stolen another 40+ hours of my time. Instead of playing Undertail or whatever it is the kiddies are going ga-ga for, I surrendered myself to the latest entry in the Neptunia Saga. \n\nNow why would I do such a silly thing?\n\nBy now, we're all familiar with how the Hyperdimension Neptunia formula works. These games are not known for their complex dungeons, intricate plots, or especially difficult battles. They're Sunday Funday affairs, the kind designed to make you feel like the good and awesome person that you are. You're smashing those wacky monsters by the thousands, crafting plans to unlock neat stuff, and enjoying a thorough introspective on the console industry and boob-jokes. That said, formulas eventually become stale. There's only so much that can be done with a concept. An injection of fresh ideas or even a change of direction is necessary to keep a game series interesting. \n\nHow does Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation accomplish this daunting task? Um... It doesn't.\n\nBut it's like I always say: When the Devil isn't in my Crystal Light, he's in the details. Nep-Cubed stays fresh not by messing with the formula, but by improving on practically every aspect. First off, let's talk about the characters. In the last game, Nepgear is a nice girl, but she was saddled with the unfortunate task of playing an everyday heroine. The Neptunia series isn't built for characters like her. So, in N3p not only do we get Neptunia being her usual absurd self, she's joined by Plutia. With this gal, it's either sleepy-time or sadomasochistic time. Nepgear returns, but she's become a trifle touched in the head, possibly due to all of the complaints about how normal and boring she was. Noire also gets main-character duty this go-around. Her personality is: \"It-It's not like I [i]want[/i] to play the straight-woman or anything!\" Nearly everyone else makes an appearance in the story and/or the dozens upon dozens of optional cutscenes. Whereas Re;Birth 2 was lacking in personality, this game is practically a personality explosion. \n\nYou know what else I disliked about Neptunia 2? Being stuck with the same party-members for the vast majority of the game. R3;Birth neps that issue in the bud. As soon as chapter 1, a deluge of playable characters are dropped in your proverbial lap. These heroines also receive a new ability called \"awakening\". It's basically an HDD-level boost for non-CPUs/Candidates. Share-shenanigans are a thing of the past as well. Once you reach the specific point in the story, you'll unlock a character, no colosseum or quest grinding necessary. \n\nThe battle-system has received some slight revisions. The SP meter is tied into the CPU's ability to perform EXE moves. So if you perform so many special moves, or cast enough healing spells, you won't be able to perform EXEs, until you attack the enemy to rebuild the lost meter. There are also less EXE moves in general. While these changes can be considered nerfs, this attempt at balance makes the fights a little more complicated than: spam rush combos > spam EXEs > spam level-up screens. Still, unless you're actively trying to stay weak, you'll shred 90% of the enemies in this game.\n\nAnother practically life-changing improvement is the \"search\" function. When you can't be arsed to remember where a \"magical contract\" or a \"magical contact\" can be found, you can run an in-game search. Yes, shift+tab and the nearest FAQ in the Steam community is available, but at least it's obvious that Compile Heart cares. Stella (ugh) also makes her return. She's got a nice racket going doesn't she? Everytime she makes an appearance in a Neptunia game, the urge to buy DLC rises by 5,000,000%. This time around she's exploring a massive tower. A number of extremely useful plans are tied to this tamogotchi nightmare, so you might as well fork over that extra dollar. At least it doesn't take her 12+ hours to explore the later locations.\n\nBut you know what? One of the best qualities of R3;Birth is those times where it shows some charm. I mean, okay there's still plenty of fan-service, the plot and villains being ridiculous, and the overabundance of cute girls doing kyuuuute thangs. Somewhere underneath all of that nonsense, there are rare moments that warm the ancient & cavernous ruins I consider to be my heart. I'd be perfectly content if this series was just a farce, but it understands the right ways to capture my attention. Then again, for all I know this is just another method Nep-fever sinks it's claws into my soul. Idea Factory is making sure I stick around to buy Neptunia VII, and the musou-like hack & slash, and the Noire SRPG, and Blanc Vs Zombies, and the Sega Hard Girls cross-over...\n\nIt's questionable how long I'll be able to participate in this rodeo. The Re;Birth series always does enough to keep the players addicted, and this entry is a continuation of everything that works. If you're expecting something more, then I don't know what to tell you. You certainly can't expect to enjoy this game if the previous entries didn't grab you. However, if you're a fan, then I'm positive that this entry won't disappoint.", "timestamp_created": 1452493569, "timestamp_updated": 1453960796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663607180118560791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20442611": {"recommendationid": "20442611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979963966", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3573, "last_played": 1457592317}, "language": "english", "review": "I have now played it all the way through with the exception of a few arena missions.

Without the depth. Each character has a max of about 3 special abilities/spells. Also the characters are not balanced with each other at all, there are some characters that are clearly much more powerful than their counterparts, so really there is no reason to ever use them. The combat system is pretty important, because you will be doing a lot of fighting. And I do mean a lot, its pretty much grinding simulator, the game.\n\nAs for the comedy elements, its... well its just really not that funny. The game is self aware, but it just doesn't execute it all that well. The puns and the references are kindof fun for an hour, but after that it just gets repetitive. Here is an example of one of their recurring 'jokes', Neptunia/other says I want to play video games, someone gets mad and yells at them, they are scared of person and call them a stupid name that signifies they are angry/unreasonable. Did you laugh? Well that is repeated about 59 times so you had better enjoy it.\n\nAnother thing is the side characters that you get while going through the game. What is the point of them? They aren't even acknowledged in the main game. It is entirely possible for you to have a character, that according to the story is in the castle doing important work, also somehow go around helping you destroy monsters to fulfill your daily quota. Some characters dont have any story at all, and seem to be shoved in just so they could have more characters.\n\nAlso it is very hard to play with a keyboard, this game was made for a controller and shows it, so if you dont have a controller, you will have a bad time figuring out the controls.\n\nOverall the game wasn't terrible, it just wasn't good.", "timestamp_created": 1452397026, "timestamp_updated": 1527202419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467877835035324097", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20434057": {"recommendationid": "20434057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143869057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1452745449}, "language": "english", "review": "i come back for nepnep pantsu 10/10 -fapable", "timestamp_created": 1452380743, "timestamp_updated": 1452380743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20431327": {"recommendationid": "20431327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179494687", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2866, "last_played": 1472241273}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing story,Kawaii girls and good game\n\nthis game is AWESOME\n", "timestamp_created": 1452372698, "timestamp_updated": 1452372698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20417021": {"recommendationid": "20417021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155039010", "num_games_owned": 993, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2193682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19920, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1700763906}, "language": "english", "review": "Who needs a girlfriend if you can have waifuus.\n\nnepnep/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1452333109, "timestamp_updated": 1452333109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593103349208831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20413492": {"recommendationid": "20413492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066127675", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 12128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7878, "last_played": 1590134951}, "language": "english", "review": "I was at showering scene and was about to finish the scene, my mom came in.

Originally on PS Vita game, it was later ported to the PC and released on Steam.\n\nJust like with the previous two games, it's a unique take on the idea of \"Console Wars\" with every console being anthropomorphised into a \"Goddess\". Being a direct sequel to Re;Birth2, it takes place a few years after defeating the Deity of Sin once and for all. Everything returned to normal, and peace ruled over the world, but something bad is happening again and confused Neptune is thrust into a completely different dimension set in the past / alternate reality where she'll meet the predeccessor who founded Planeptune, Plutia, as well as different versions of the characters from her home world, and will have to figure out who's behind her dimension traveling, as well as stand against the local threat - the Seven Sages, opposing the Goddesses and their newly-found nations.\n\nThe gameplay is basically your typical turn-based jRPG with minor tactical elements. Your characters and enemies take turns performing attacks, using abilities or items. It's rather simple to get a grasp if you played any other turn-based RPG. Outside of dungeon exploring and fighting, you can use shops, view the gallery, accept and complete quests, or use special \"Plans\" to add or modify existing content in the game. The difficulty feels just right - it's not as hard as old-school jRPGs, but also not easy enough that you will be bored (unless you specifically overlevel your characters for the upcoming fights). The game even hands you certain Plans that make the enemies tougher or easier, so there's always some way of tuning the difficulty a bit if you want a challenge or - the opposite - want to focus on the story. Majority of the content is grind-based, however, so if you care about exploring everything, you'll have to level up your characters quite a lot. That being said, the general progression has been improved upon in comparison to the first two Re;Birth games - you don't have to grind nearly as much to get past certain boss fights. Also, there is an actual post-game now, and even some bonus storylines and events if you get the True Ending.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that while the previous Re;Birth games on Steam had some minor performance issues and crashes, this one runs very smoothly, and never crashed once for me. It shows that Idea Factory knows how to make a solid PC port.\n\nThe story is quite engaging, with you traveling across the alternate Gamindustri, making friends with the alternate versions of past characters and fighting against the common threat, interspersed with jokes about gaming cliches, breaking the fourth wall, and all sorts of humor. Of course, it's full of fanservice in one way or another, but what would you expect from a game that creates Moe Anthropomorphisms of game consoles?\n\nThe graphics are good. You might notice blurred textures here and there, but it's nothing big, and it's pretty to look at, especially that the general quality was noticeably improved in comparison to the past games. The only reason you might not like it is if you don't like anime style.\n\nIn the sound department, we get mostly electronic music or rock, with quite a lot memorable or downright awesome themes. It's definitely worth listening to even outside the game. An interesting thing to note is that Nobuo Uematsu, the composer for [i]Final Fantasy[/i], worked on some of the tracks in the game.\n\nAs far as the DLC goes... there is only one. Well, technically more, but Idea Factory performed an awesome move and decided to include [i]all[/i] the DLC characters [i]and[/i] Additional Content Packs, so by purchasing the game you automatically have access to 15+ bonus party members and level cap 999, as well as all the extra Colliseum fights and dungeons. The only one that doesn't come with the game helps you level up faster and makes the optional Stella's Dungeon minigame a lot easier and faster, neither of which feel neccessary.\n\nThe game also pretty much requires New Game+ in order to unlock everything, since one playthrough does not yield enough MB (Megami Bytes) to craft every Plan you can get.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, featuring adorable, likeable characters, nice graphics, great music, interesting storyline, as well as lots of humor and content.

Compared to the previous titles, the battle system has been revamped, changing the SP/EXE drive system, introducing plans to extend combos, enabling up to four characters to fight simultaneously and more. Plus you no longer have to mash the Y key in dungeons while hearing the same sound over and over to find hidden goods. They're now in convenient boxes scattered across the world. Yay!\n\nStory-wise, the game sticks to its roots. Everything is taken lightly, cuteness and the occasional fanservice is everywhere. Some jokes are taken a tad too far - the size of Blanc's chest to fourth wall breaking stacked onto fourth wall breaking. It's actually a rather refreshing Visual Novel, with a good portion of the story events voiced. Plus, the option to swap between the English and Japanese voices is a plus.\n\nIn terms of the combat and dungeoning, Re;birth3 does a better job at balance and dungeon progression, with a defined difficulty curve in the story dungeons and a large number of side dungeons in case one wishes to do some grinding. Yes, the dungeons are repetitive, often the same tileset with minor modifications, and most enemies (there are actually many different types) usually share the same sprites, but it isn't too big of a deal. The new combat system starts feeling a bit odd, considering SP and EXE are now one and the same, but eventually you get used to it and realize how ridiculous SP Boosters are. Unfortunately this makes Rush type skills far less valuable as SP Boosters now contribute directly to EXE Drive and Skills can be spammed less. The plus side is you don't have to grind EXE every single time a dungeon instance is entered or reset.\n\nLike the other remakes, re;birth3 has a ton of DLC (which is actually included this time for free! sans the mega-convenient one) adding in a ton of humorous events and characters. Stella's dungeon is back from re;birth2 with far more valuable rewards to be gained. Mostly the same system, but some bonus items can be scored by having a scout detect a new area upon clearing a floor.\n\nOverall, as a JRPG, the game is quite simplistic, and fairly grindy (even with Super EXP Up). Not really for everyone, especially those who aren't really a fan of the art/story/characters. As a Visual Novel, the game is incredibly entertaining, making events shy away from mashing a button hoping it ends to something worth savoring. Especially if it's voiced. If you're a fan of the Neptunia games, this is definitely worth it. If you don't mind grindy JRPGs and a bit of fanservice, this is definitely worth it. Eh. As long as you don't mind the art style, characters, JRPG elements and writing, this game is totally worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1451959043, "timestamp_updated": 1451959043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20303906": {"recommendationid": "20303906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158346194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 479, "last_played": 1454385251}, "language": "english", "review": "Same old nep. \n\nWhich I mean in a good way.

"[h1]Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation[/h1]\n\n[b]Introducci\u00f3n:[/b]\nQuien compra este tipo de juegos de IF y CompileHeart, sabe lo que se va a encontrar, juegos de corte visual anime, vistoso, colorido y divertido, sin prestar mucha atenci\u00f3n a la historia, que siempre tiene connotaciones divertidas, gags, provocativas y algo absurdas (aunque hay excepciones claro).\n\n[b]Historia:[/b]\nLa historia tiene un trasfondo relativamente real, ya que posiciona a las consolas de diversas generaciones (tomando principalmente el rol de las m\u00e1s modernas), como personajes, y las introduce en lo que fue la guerra de consolas, relatando [b][u]a su manera[/u][/b] los sucesos de estas \"guerras\", incluyendo no solo los sistemas principales, si no otros, adem\u00e1s de varias franquicias y compa\u00f1\u00edas, que en cierto modo colaboran en el juego.\nLa t\u00f3nica general es muy humor\u00edstica, con algunos peque\u00f1os giros y escaramuzas, que te sacan una sonrisa en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n.\n\n[b]Sistema de juego:[/b]\nEl sistema es de un uso bastante sencillo, aunque para primerizos y si no has jugado a los anteriores, es preferible seguir los mini-tutoriales in-game, es de los que m\u00e1s me gusta, ya que es semi-activo-t\u00e1ctico y resulta muy entretenido, sobretodo a la hora de encajar el mayor n\u00famero de combos, o rompe-defensas.\n\n[b]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/b]\nEn esta versi\u00f3n de PC, est\u00e1n bastante optimizados, y aunque no van muy all\u00e1, se ve estupendamente, solo se puede achacar unas cuantas cosas, la optimizaci\u00f3n a 60fps no es demasiado buena, bajando bastante al entrar a una mazmorra y pre-cargar los monstruos en el plano, no siendo este su \u00fanico fallo, ya que tambi\u00e9n el sonido tiende a fallar en algunos momentos de la exploraci\u00f3n de mazmorras, particularmente en las que tienen lugar eventos con personajes, dejando sin sonido los pasos, saltos, men\u00fas y otros efectos SFX (b\u00e1sicamente casi cualquier sonido, excepto la m\u00fasica de escenario).\n\n[b]Sonido:[/b]\nYa he comentado los fallos de sonido, que creo que tienen que ver con la mala optimizaci\u00f3n de los 60fps, as\u00ed que solo me queda enumerar que algunos temas son bastante buenos y otros simplemente imperceptibles, en general esta bastante bien, pero posiblemente es algo que se podr\u00eda mejorar.\nAdem\u00e1s tiene otro peque\u00f1o fallo en las voces y es que cuando se juntan 2 o m\u00e1s personajes, ya sea gritando o hablando al mismo tiempo (generalmente gritando), aumentan los decibelios moment\u00e1neamente, rompiendo la armon\u00eda sonora del juego, no es excesivamente molesto, pero sinceramente, tampoco gusta.\n\n[b]Jugabilidad:[/b]\nEl juego es muy sencillo de jugar, uno se hace r\u00e1pido al control, no tiene demasiadas \"pausas\" y la historia avanza a un ritmo muy bueno, no haci\u00e9ndose pesado en ning\u00fan momento, la verdad es que es un punto a favor, adem\u00e1s la cantidad de personajes jugables, trajes y otros accesorios, lo hacen muy din\u00e1mico.\n\n[b]Conclusi\u00f3n:[/b]\nEn general el juego es divertido, no es especialmente adictivo, pero tampoco te desanima, es de esos juegos que gusta jugar en ratitos. Contiene bastantes gags relacionados con videojuegos conocidos y otros no tan conocidos, un poco de fanservice que nunca viene mal (siempre que no sea excedente) y un humor particularmente absurdo que siempre te saca una sonrisa, si estas especialmente ligado al mundo de los videojuegos y al anime (si el anime no es lo tuyo, entonces este juego seguramente no sea adecuado para ti).\n\n[h2][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32243713/]Sigue mi Mentor de

New changes include the removal of the EXE drive (SP is used instead and is generated similarly; SP potions are pretty much gone). EX Finishers are now selected one per category, which makes it easier to tell what they do and makes combat planning a lot easier.

Peashy bite me.\n\n(Review edited to point out exactly what I like and don't like about the game feel free to consruct your own opinion about the game if you don't agree with mine) \n(Edit 2 removed some point's such as my complaint about vert as i have grown to like this game's version of both Blanc and Vert aswell as some other minor edit's).", "timestamp_created": 1449507220,

"review": "59/100 (ok)\n\nTLDR\nI enjoyed it, after it lowered my expectations.\n\nOVERVIEW\nThe game can be summarized a mediocre/budget JRPG (with heavily re-used assets and monotonous gameplay) 48% of the time, and the remaining 48% being listening to character interactions 50% of which (so 24% of total) is actually voice acted by the actors, with the remaining 4%  being miscellaneous (like making your character jump while your camera is trying to look up her skirt). It was an overall peaceful and somewhat dull experience, but I did like the relatively calm story which was unprecedented/unusual, & some of the choreography of the animations as well as some of the gimmicks (though I thought the animations were bad), I felt the combat system was deeper than all other other JRPG I played (eternal sonata, quest 64) which is something I enjoyed.\n\nAfter playing through the entire game, and getting all of the steam achievements (didn't do new game+) I finally feel qualified to make this review.\n\n\nPLAYSTYLE/PERSPECTIVE\nFrom the perspective of an western gamer, who can only speak/read english.\nI played as a semi-completionist, searching through most of the dungeons as they became available, cataloging the monsters and loot drops, but not fretting too much over missed content (locked behind RNG) too much.\nI played as a binge player, who would commit entire days to this game.\nI actively avoided the free beneficial DLC content (I dislike most/all? DLC on principle) perhaps so I can experience the game as \"it was intended\" for the average (non steam) buyer.\nI came in expecting something of the quality of dota 2, tribes 2, fallout 3, deadcore, perimeter, stalker, delta force 2, halo, the total war series, serious sam, eternal sonata, ETC. Generally things that are AA or AAA quality (sometimes A).\n\nBEGINNING\nIt was an awful first impression, after even downloading the game I met technical difficulty, where I did not have the required download installed for the game, I came in expecting to be submerged into a pleasant fantasy land of anime girls in a gamey world immediately and conveniently, too bad I had to have my experience halted by this rather rude intrusion of \"reality\" (the technical problematic lens). Once I got the game to work (by downloading a somewhat vaguely described redistributable on my internet browser), and being relieved, I was met with what I thought was a shockingly bad introduction, where upon my character gets beaten down, but what was bad about it was that the animation quality was surprisingly bad (like a good quality MMD fan animation) and that my character made only 1 pain-scream when being struck, giving the impression of a bad Wii game (might sound small, but it was huge to me). Usually games like this want to leave a good impression, but this one left an awful one, heck, even the game \"chex quest\" somehow left a better first impression than this game (and that game literally came out of my cereal box). I was planning to get this game refunded during this disappointing phase, but knowing I had 2 hours to \"demo\" the game before steam refunds were disabled, I continued until I got a better look at the game. In a way, it is quite shocking that a game like this would leave such a bad impression so quickly, as if they aren't aware that there is a refund policy in place.\n\nBEGINNING 2\nIn a bit of a haze, I proceeded in the game, expecting further disappointments, which showed rather quickly when I found my first segment of storytelling that lacked voice acting, me coming from games like fallout 3, skyrim, and eternal sonata expected that all or most of the lines displayed in the chat box would be uttered by some voice actor, but rather, only about 50% of the main story is voiced, and only about 20% of sidequests (if any) were voiced, I was again further negatively surprised, but this defect was somewhat beneficial/mitigated; as the lack of the voice acting let me fill in the voice acting with my imagination (such as replacing some voices with voices from other games, usually inappropriately), and in a way this somewhat added to my experience. Though, I doubt others would rise to this \"challenge\", and is still a fault to be considered, I really would have preferred a 60-70% voice acting on the story dialog, but sadly, it was not the case.\nThere were 2 notable flaws in the game that left somewhat lasting impression which is the dominatrix's lost 3 second static pose when she \"transforms into existence\" with bad english lip-syncing, and a camera that clips through her segmented sword, and the playstation character's sometimes cringe-worthy \"tryhard\" deep voice, though I was fond of some of the defects (tryhard voice).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIDDLE/LATE\nThe middle of the game was perhaps the best enjoyed part of it, after I had my expectations passively beaten down my the overall quality, and this was a time of discovery. I really started to get into the more difficult content, and I started to notice some of the complexities of the combat system, like how one might want to align turns to initiate a guard break, and use ultimates, and typically having enough complexity to cause me to delay and think what action to do sometimes, and with enough complexity to prevent it from getting too formulaic too quickly, (though formulas are naturally developed) in fact, this would be the most tactically deep JRPG I have played, and I enjoyed it, though the system tends to degrade later on and problems started to crop up (formulas were developed), since I was playing as a semi-completionist, I would do dungeons, but most of the dungeons would only have 1 formulaic way of \"clearing them\"; 1. beat each enemy until it dropped all of it's items, 2, fight the boss 1-3 times, which typically require 1 of 3 strategies with some permutations (1. power attack spam/use ultimates, for the weakest bosses, 2. Buff your characters, break guard/weaken enemies, then kill with ultimate, 3. buff, weaken guard, buff, align turns (making it so that most of your characters will be able to attack before the bosses turn), use ultimates, then finish off.), 3. Run through the dungeon again, ignoring the enemies, and headbutting the camouflaged boxes so that you can better \"catalog\" the items that come out of them (because it tends to be random). Then rinse/repeat for every other dungeon you unlock, skipping step 1 for upgraded dungeons that recycle enemies. In a way, step 3 was relaxing, (after I got the upgrade that trivializes finding the boxes but hellish before) so it wasn't that bad. But the boss fight distinctly lacked variety in methodologies to beat, there were some helpful differences such as the 7 elite boss type, and the boss with disabling helpers, but much too rare to be really helpful (about 4% are different), which is surprising, I'd think that more exotic bosses would be easy to implement. There is also a minor concern of stats, there is no explanation of them, while some stats can largely be figured out (like strength being attack power) some can be mistaken for others, one could think that vitality is related to HP amount instead of it functioning as \"armor\" or \"men\" (mental?) having some affect on SP(mana) regeneration instead of it being \"magic armor\", this is largely irrelevant since you cannot really \"build\" characters to have extreme stat imbalances and/or character specialties, and how the game is generally very easy, (even going so far as to send some story bosses in waves, instead all at once even though it is explicit that the bosses are in a group) thus not really requiring understanding of the stats, but another rather small deficiency.\n\nDue to the character limit, you will need to search the last 3 pages of the comments to find the remainder of the review.", "timestamp_created": 1449467445, "timestamp_updated": 1449468589, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.408760905265808105", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19538674": {"recommendationid": "19538674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131421851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1322, "last_played": 1489358204}, "language": "english", "review": "Re;Birth 3, just another great game in the Neptunia series.

Along the way, she meets some new friends and very familiar faces along the way and maybe some new foes. Will she be able to return back to her home in the Hyperdimension? Or will she forever be stuck in the Ultradimension?\n\n[h1]Dungeons![/h1]\nAs much I really liked this game, most of the dungeons have been recycled from the previous games. When you unlock new dungeons, they pretty much look almost like the exact same areas from the previous games and previous dungeons you've been to, except maybe some of them would have slight changes area wise, but that's about it. There's only a few unique dungeons in this game, like the ones in the Hyperdimension Planeptune where you're in a city and such. There should be more unique dungeons like those to keep the game fresh.\n\nMost of the DLC from Victory are now free in Re;Birth 3 so that's a plus.\n\n[h1]Plans![/h1]\nAnother additional feature regarding plans is that now finding the materials to make the plan is a lot easier. It will now tell you where you can find the materials you're missing, how you can get them, and what monster you need to defeat in order to get those materials. Now that's a huge plus!\n\n[h1]Colosseum![/h1]\nThe Colosseum provides a challenge to the players that are looking for a challenge along with unique rewards. However one problem I've had was that the game would crash on me sometimes when I try to start a Colosseum battle. Other than that, everything else runs smoothly.\n\n\n\nPhew! Now that was long!\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\nAs a Neptunia fan, definitely! Looking for a good RPG?

This is indeed the best Neptunia game I have played so far compared to Re;Birth 1 and 2.\n\nMy reasons? It's because this game literally references back when Sega and Nintendo were fighting.\nIf you don't know ANY of this, you will NOT enjoy this. I repeat, if you seriously don't know about history between where Sega does what Nintendon't and when Playstation comes in to make both Sega and Nintendo's life hard, please don't say this game is bad because you simply don't understand what the creators tried to show here.\n\nThat was literally the purpose of this game. Though I'm only in chapter 3, I'm already laughing my butt off because of the references to these old consoles with their pathetic weaknesses. It also shows how old game companies used to live and die and if you did a lot of research, Neptunia references a LOT of game companies and of course other games.\n\nIf you have played the first 2, you'd love the fact that in the third installment, you don't have the SP gauge no more, in other words, no more worrying you'd run out of SP and instead, more beating up stuff. Sure it gets repetitive, but to complete the game, it's not that bad. Unless of course if you are like me who tries to 100% the game. I've 100% Neptunia 1 and 2 and trust me, it can get a little repetitive, but very worth it. I may change this review again after I finish the game, but I seriously enjoy this game too much already due to the references and better mechanics compared to the first and second.

I don't know who localized the dialogue for this entry into the Neptunia series but they really did an outstanding job here.  The banter alone really makes this game worth playing.  \n\nCombat is flashy and fun to watch.  There is a fair amount of depth to developing your characters if you so choose.  Stats are influenced by discs, shares, different armor sets but it's not really necessary to beat the main story.  If you choose to beat the extra end game bosses however min/maxing your characters even at max level is going to be required so there is some challenge there to be had.  With that said it is a JRPG so the actual combat boils down to selecting an attack and watching it happen so if thats not your cup of tea this may not be for you.\n\nThe english voice overs aren't complete as with previous games but you can switch to Japanese in the menu.\n\nMajor con is a bug that causes the game to freeze and crash.  A fix has been posted by users but unfortunately IF/Compile have not released an official patch to address the issue.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1448489259, "timestamp_updated": 1448489259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19273348": {"recommendationid": "19273348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128396659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3196, "last_played": 1519798346}, "language": "english", "review": "Nep #1", "timestamp_created": 1448487264, "timestamp_updated": 1449384020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19272411": {"recommendationid": "19272411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059798920", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1446703329}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a simple man, i see neptune i press upboat", "timestamp_created": 1448484448, "timestamp_updated": 1448484448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 96, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530455827713012695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19270595": {"recommendationid": "19270595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075746240", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1639844602}, "language": "english", "review": "Ah, that's good...", "timestamp_created": 1448479025, "timestamp_updated": 1587694354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513256490230560303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19269455": {"recommendationid": "19269455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976345467", "num_games_owned": 791, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 11220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2016, "last_played": 1471704918}, "language": "english", "review": "You can't have enough Nep.", "timestamp_created": 1448474969, "timestamp_updated": 1479928334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457142859697341919", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19269291": {"recommendationid": "19269291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072103743", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3536, "last_played": 1451245683}, "language": "english", "review": "Nepped me off. \n\nNep/10\n\nCan't wait for  Hyperdrvotion Noire and Victory II", "timestamp_created": 1448474216, "timestamp_updated": 1448474216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488456040620803833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19266797": {"recommendationid": "19266797", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998517528", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1462574043}, "language": "english", "review": "The best out of the 3.

The turn based battle system is great and even makes the minimal amount of grinding seem enjoyable. There is not a lot of strategy in the battles, which I liked since some JRPGs can be quite complex. The character animations are quite nice as well ;)\n\nFor those looking for adult images, etc, this game may not be for you. The characters are all cute (in that anime way) and you can play as Neptune in a swimsuit if you wish (hehe), but that's as far as it goes.\n\nThe story initially is very good, but unfortunately starts to get a bit boring mid-way through the game with long run-on dialogue, some of which does not move the plot forward at all. The story strongly depends on Neptune who is constantly shaking things up (in a good way) and Iris Heart for her... umm... being herself? The dialogue is certainly humorous, but there seem to be a lot of references that I ended up not understanding (perhaps from my lack of knowledge of other Japanese games?), which was mildly frustrating, but they seem to not be vital to understanding the story, just side-notes. \n\nThe dialogue is voice acted nicely, but I found that only the main dialogue scenes are voice acted, while the rest is just text. Although I suppose this makes sense from a dev point of view (less work, money), I found it strange that one scene can be voice acted while in the next scene later on, I had to read the text. Imo this takes away from the immersiveness of the game.\n\nBut really, I was surprised I could play this game at all. With the min specs of 2.66GH CPU and 1GB GPU, my laptops specs were just a bit over half of this. And it was actually playable! Unfortunately, there is no option to turn down the graphics settings that I have found (possibly due to it being a port). As many have claimed, there are infrequent crashes that WILL occur, but in my case they are bearable, they just cause me to save more often than I normally would.\n\nOverall, I would certainly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys JRPGs. It has that nice JRPG feel to it , despite the few flaws and bugs that are present. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1448381813, "timestamp_updated": 1448381813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483365952968597412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19251279": {"recommendationid": "19251279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058312077", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2500, "last_played": 1449233582}, "language": "english", "review": "Neps and even more neps!", "timestamp_created": 1448380575, "timestamp_updated": 1448380575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19246708": {"recommendationid": "19246708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056914716", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1807, "last_played": 1459899482}, "language": "english", "review": "Plutia is Satan.", "timestamp_created": 1448355153, "timestamp_updated": 1448355153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19236356": {"recommendationid": "19236356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261088969", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1448310366}, "language": "spanish", "review": "NO puedo entrar al juego -.- siempre cuando entro me sale \"neptuniaReBirth3.exe. dejo de funcionar\" con los otros dos que compre no me pasa esto, si no fuera por que lo jugu\u00e9 en otro lado no lo recomendar\u00eda...", "timestamp_created": 1448298833, "timestamp_updated": 1448305582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19235504": {"recommendationid": "19235504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183180818", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 5892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2244, "last_played": 1695237017}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is helping my recovery from the Conquest ending of the previous game.", "timestamp_created": 1448295471, "timestamp_updated": 1448295471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606389522552490234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19232812": {"recommendationid": "19232812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071504281", "num_games_owned": 814, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1351, "last_played": 1448675159}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're just looking for sweet anime tiddies, there's not much of it here.

Most of my complaints are in of a more mechanical nature, the engine or system itself. So pardon, which in itself is a good thing, most of the time. \n\nAs of 11/20/2015 these issues have not been addressed yet so a warning and heads up but don't let it deter you too much. \n\n\n-Its poorly optimized. At times you will crash due to the game not utilizing and allowing the game to allocate memory as needed. There is a workaround but this should honeslty not be necessary. \n\n-Poor framerates at times. I Have a top end GPU, a XFX DD R9 290X 4gb and I can barely get above 30 frames in some of the levels. I'm not sure what causes this one but its rather infuriating at times. You might not care but it does for me. It could be the fact taht the game itself is not utilizing all the 4 cores of my i5 2500k and what not, which is oftne the case as lot of games now a days are CPU bottlenecked rather than GPU assuming you've been keeping your comp sorta up to date. \n\n- THe game does suffer from a gradual memory leak as well. \n\n-Not enough neps\n\n\nAnd then we have the more ambigious thoughts where they don't really fall into either category.\n\n? How they handled the EXE and SP unlock is a bit convoluted and I had to look it up how to unlock stuff. This should not be needed. \n? You are pretty much playing the same game but with a new coat of paint and story, but if you bought the first two games and bought this one too? You got no one to blame but yourself. \n? Your parents may disown you.\n\n\nOverall thought: \n\nGreat game from a great series with loveable girls with delicious yuri undertone but sadly plagued with poor optmization and okay port. \n\n9/10-  I would give it a solid 10/10 but the mechanical problems docked off a point. Not a big problem but definitely something that should be addressed in the future games. \n\nI would still highly reccommend it either way. Just know what you're getting into. \n\nps.

Frankly, as far as i'm concerned, Compile Heart and Idea Factory (US)/Marvelous AQL (EU) can't pump out these games fast enough. Each is good in its own right. \n\nDo note that if you're expecting a serious plot with high drama then this is not the game for you.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 returns to the universe first introduced by Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 and sees the characters of that universe once again battling the forces of piracy in abstract form. However, where Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 tackled this basic plot in a rather anvilicious manner, R3 is altogether a better game. This is largely because of the reinclusion of Neptune as the main character and the antics she brings to the table; the Hyperdimension Series has never been about the story itself, but about the interaction with the characters that the writers bring to the table, and their interactions with each other. As such, HDN: R3 improves upon the formula introduced by the first game in almost every way but one: combat. \n\nPart of the fun, personally speaking, was being able in HDN: R1 to pull off insane attacks with little effort. R3 attempts to curb this \"abuse\" by making EXE attacks both unlockable via achievements and require most--if not all--of a character's SP. Until you get the \"drill\" disc modification in the latter stage of the game, this heavily limits tactical options, as maintaining one's SP in battle becomes a chore in its own right.\n\nan additional criticism of mine would be the game's performance even on relatively new machines. While the game is advertised as being playable at 60fps on 1080p resolutions, the reality is that the game presently locks itself into certain framerates and resolutions. with 8 gigs of ram, a dual core i7 5500U, and an AMD Radeon R9 M275--capable of getting upwards of 40 frames on fallout 4 at 720p and 50 frames on Warthunder on high settings at 1080p, I get a measly 27-30 frames on HDN;R3 at a locked resolution of 1280x720. Either due to a function of bad drivers or poor port-programming, all of the games in the HDN: R series perform poorly on systems which are well above the listed specifications. This may in part due to the games running heavily off of the CPU and not really using the GPU at full capacity.\n\nIn sum:\n\nPros:\n-more nep\n-shinier prettier graphics\n-more of the parody and cute girls doing cute things that the fans have come to expect.\n-more replayability\n\ncons\n-poor performance graphics-wise\n-combat system has been poorly revised, and fails to add tactical depth\n-annoying achievements to unlock potentially crucial character abilities\n-limited post main-plot-arc content; sequel hook seems like an afterthought\n\nOverall Score: \n8 neps out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1448059885, "timestamp_updated": 1448059952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19178263": {"recommendationid": "19178263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047022096", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5885, "last_played": 1527855680}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a niche target audience so I'll do my best to outline it below. If i have to give a rating I would give it an 8/10 and reccomend getting it on sale. I'm very aware that while I enjoy these games reccomending them is a bit dodgy as alot of people simply will not like what this game is. It does what it tries to do but that wont appeal to ALOT of people.\n\n\n\nREASONS NOT TO BUY THIS GAME:\nThis game is not mechanically deep, characters roles are pretty simple to figure, beyond buffs debuffs and manipulating the turn system theres not alot to learn, the last one is a nice touch but still not a good game for someone who wants to think hard about their strategy.\n\nStory is pretty poor in general (though not even close to as bad as rebirth 2 imo) and it has alot of repetition in monsters, dungeons etc. \n\nThe game is rated 12+ and that age level seems appropriate so if you're looking for adult images, look elsewhere. Fanservice is tame and sporadic.\n\nIt has quite alot of post game content through the free dlcs but unfortunately there is pretty much no way to progress to the last 4 areas or higher level fights in a  natural way. To do these you simply turn on the \"in-game power level hax\" and grind levels for an hour or two. This means that to keep things fun post game you have to carefully balance your levels or else you will be annihilated/untouchable.\n\nThe difficulty is a bit low for alot of the games until you reach the ultra late-game at which point it reaches stupid levels and the only way to balance is essentially to be really careful about how you break the game (see above point)\n\nThe 4th wall gets SMASHED repeatedly here. All the games broke the 4th wall but this one just completely ignores to the point where even I got annoyed in later chapters and I'm normally immune to it.\n\nREASONS TO BUY THIS GAME:\nThe games characters are the main draw. Its a mix of a visual novel with a turn based rpg and the characters keep the visual novel element highly entertaining for the most part. Having all the dlc characters active can make it a bit too much dialogue wise so I reccomend not using them for a first playthrough if you intend to do more than 1. Some of the characters might drive some people crazy and as obvious as it might sound, anime like characters and reactions are plentiful so if you like anime you probably have a higher chance of liking this though I'm sure its not necessary. [Spoiler] Having plutia and Nep as the 2 of the 3 main characters pretty much makes this game for me. [/Spoiler]\n\nIs funny.... well I think so anyway :D\n\nThe battle system while simple is fun to play and the animations are really smooth. If you have played the other games you have a good idea whats going on but this one is a step up on this front, not anything massively different just little things that make game more fun to play. The entire interface is massively improved in this game too, it still has its flaws but the menu in this game alone is enough to make it the best of the three.\n\nTheres a challenge system introduced where you get little bonuses by completing challenges and while some of them are a little painful and the higher targets in many are RIDICULOUS, its still a nice addition.\n\nThe game isnt too short at about 40-60 hours for a casual playthrough of true ending if you read everything, certainly not long by rpg standards but long enough that you wont feel ripped off.", "timestamp_created": 1448046196, "timestamp_updated": 1448063060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 231, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925641894340515137", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19170432": {"recommendationid": "19170432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176743546", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 9304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4081, "last_played": 1527285002}, "language": "english", "review": "68 hours wasted on 1 Ending\n\n10/10 will waste again", "timestamp_created": 1448004955, "timestamp_updated": 1448004955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19168027": {"recommendationid": "19168027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096057105", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 2239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1877, "last_played": 1448521648}, "language": "english", "review": "Nep is back, and become more Nep than ever.

However at the time of this writing: \n\n~Only 80% of the playerbase chose to start the game. \n~Only 52% of the playerbase completed the prologue chapter. \n~Only 47% of the playerbase completed the first chapter.\n~Only 37% finished the second chapter. \n\n~Less than 5% of the playerbase had the resolve and endurance to finish the game and actually see the ending(s).\n\nIf one knows a little bit of math, one can say that out of the people who actually have played the game (80%), of that total population....we can write 52/.8 = 65. Basically two thirds of those who started the game went through the prologue chapter at most. However, when the math is applied....by the end of Chapter 2, less than half of the people who actually started the game) actually remained playing the game passed the second chapter. \n\nThe game is really for the playerbase who actually likes a combination of Visual Novels mixed with RPG interfaces in its own game. I love the game for its humor in a time where most games are super-serious and humorless, but even I admit that when I started the game to show my fiancee how the game started...it took an hour to go through the prologue chapter because most of it were the two of us reading it. \n\nI am currently going through the New Game+ attempting to get the TRUE ENDING after getting the Good Ending. :) I am one of the few who actually went through the entire game ;) \n\nGet this game if you have the patience to read a ton for a lighthearted, lukewarm story :) This game reminds me of games like Xenogears that beat out final fantasy in acquiring the award for \"most ridiculous amount of text\" in a scene. :)", "timestamp_created": 1447705937, "timestamp_updated": 1447705937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588250219821929932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19113104": {"recommendationid": "19113104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039796033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1446341724}, "language": "english", "review": "Full review here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mg9r4fuyLHU\n\nWell that was fast, the third installment in such a short period of time, Idea Factory must put a lot of changes into there games, or do they? Here's the run down, each area of Gamindustri has it's own CPU and CPU candidate that looks over each area. This time around however, you aren't going around collecting the mascots power or anything like that, instead (Spoiler warning) Neptune gets sent to an alternate dimension that is in the 80's (Y'know, when cassets where still a big thing for games) and must find her way back to her dimension while at the same time, helping that dimension with it's problems. As always, you can expect a lot of references to the actual game industry, videos games and anime while poking fun at them. It's a series that loves to reference everything it possibly can but if that's not your thing, you may find the comedy to be a bit dull or repetitive.\n\nSimilar to the other games, it feels very JRPG esc so there is little you won't be familiar with. It leads me to think if Idea Factory will ever do anything different from the other Neptunia games since almost every aspect of this game is identical to the others that are currently available on Steam. I sometimes like to think it's a \"Stick to what you know and what you can do\" situation but that can sometimes come off as being lazy or re-using assets, since there's hardly anything different about this game compared to the others, apart from new characters and story. Briefly onto the options menu, there's hardly one again but on the plus side, the game does run at a solid 60FPS.\n\nYet again, the dungeons themselves aren't anything to write home about since they're fairly small with some consisting of several floors. They're pretty standard dungeons, as far as JRPG's go and don't have much in the way of exploration, just a small amount of enemies littering the area and random items and material dotted around. You would think that they'd do something more with the dungeons, since many JRPG's do but you gradually grow bored of exploring them since there's hardly anything to explore.\n\nMoving on to the combat, there's practically nothing different here except for one change. Previously, you had to fill a guage everytime you entered a dungeon to pull off an EX finisher at the end of your combos by fighting enemies and would empty the moment you left the dungeon. Now however, your EX finishers are tied to your overall SP guage which makes the combat more enjoyable, albiet a bit easy. The games focus is it's strategy elements while being fast passed at the same time. In each battle, each character and enemy takes there turn when it's there's (Duh) so both you and the enemy can move each of your characters around the battle arena and position them carefully to get the most out of the battle. During one characters turn, you have multiple options for what you can have her do but only specific characters can do one special thing. There's: \n\nAttack,\nEXE skills,\nDefend,\nSP skills,\nHDD on/off,\nSwitch, \nItem,\nFlee.\n\nWhichever one you pick (Apart from HDD) will consume the characters turn and move to the next one in line. If you choose attack (Which you'll do a lot of the time) you are given the option to choose between three attacks that are tide to one of three buttons. These allow you to do different attacks which will have different effect but once you pick one, it'll move onto the next attack tab. Break focuses on depleting the enemies guard which if you accomplish that, the enemy will take more damage till it's there turn. Power which focuses on dealing damage and rush focuses on filling your SP guage. It leads to you having to mix and match your attacks together to deal with an enemy faster and effectively. The rest are pretty self explanatory apart from HDD on. Characters who are CPU's or CPU candidates have the ability to transform in the middle of battle, which increases there states but use up 20% of the SP gauge. Since it doesn't have any downsides to using it, you'll more then likely use it a lot of the time. Also, characters who aren't CPU's can also do there own transformation called Awaken which does practically the same thing.\n\nAs I've previously stated many times before and the main part of these games that I love so much is the art style. I adore how the environments are done, as well as how the characters are designed. Each are just so gorgeous to look at, they're colorful, bright and the way the colors blend together is fantastic. Speaking of the characters, we are introduced to a new character who goes by the name Plutia and I have to say, I find to her to be quite enjoyable. Her naivet\u00e9 and simple minded attitude to almost everything everyone says is one of the amusing things. But, I wouldn't get on her bad side as she can also go HDD and that leads to her becoming sadistic. It can lead to some really creepy dialogue but I find it to be quite enjoyable.\n\nAt the end of it, I still find this to be quite an enjoyable experience, it's comedy focuses on referencing things from video games and anime and poking fun at them for there tropes and problems without it getting old. It's combat is very strategy focused and fast passed which is what I enjoy, leading to you blasting through each battle one at a time. Each character is unique in there own way and have there own personalities and characteristics that suit them perfectly, but also, because of who they are it can lead to a lot of mishaps and occasional funny moments to happen. It may disappoint some people though with how it is practially the same as the others with very little difference's. As some people have pointed out, it's like you're paying for the same game again just with a different story.", "timestamp_created": 1447680921, "timestamp_updated": 1447680921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522332549095153809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19110656": {"recommendationid": "19110656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089096085", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4001, "last_played": 1449923130}, "language": "english", "review": "If you played the prev games and didn't like it, then don't bother buying this one.

[/h1]\n\nFan's rejoice - the third game of Neptunia is here! Other gamers take a peak - another anime-style JRPG is here!\nBut is it a plain copy of the previous two games, or maybe it had some major improvements that makes it the best (Neptunia) game so far?\n\n[b][i] Story [/i][/b]\n\nRe;birth 3 once again places the player in the Gamindustri world, ruled by [url=http://ideafintl.com/rebirth3/#/chara]Goddesses[/url]. Each rule a nation that represent a console company (Lastation -> Playstation, Leanbox -> Xbox, and so on) All seem peaceful after [i] the events of Re;birth 2[/i], but our lazy and goofy main character just had to get herself in trouble again, didn't she?\n\n The story is of the same pace as the previous games - it doesn't take itself too seriously, with it's long-winded boobie talk just before a serious boss battle, obscure gaming references at every single corner and blunt 4th wall breakings (The main character lives just to break it). But even so, Re;birth 3 probably tells  the longest and most decent story out of the 3 so far, which I personally enjoyed greatly. But do take note, that if it's a story-driven RPG you're looking for, you might need to rethink if this is what you're after.\n\n[b][i] Gameplay [/i][/b]\n\nThe game's battle system remains mostly unchanged. It's still the typical turn based JRPG battle with the exception of being able to move the characters around for flanking and accurate special skill attacks (trust me it's much more simple than it sounds). The only change is the merge of SP bar and EXE drive bar, which is a healthy change. Before, you could just spam SP attacks and then finish it with very powerful EXE attacks. Now, you have to use SP for both specials and EXE attacks, so you have to play more smart.\n\nThe dungeon exploring remains mostly unchanged besides another very good change: the hidden treasure is no longer an invisible item in the dungeon that you had to spam a button to radar-search for it, it's now a mostly transparent Mario-type block that casts a shadow that the player can bump his head into for extra loot.\n\nThe levelling system finally feels balanced, the game doesn't suddenly throw in undefeatable mobs to get killed by, and you don't get too powerful too quickly (unless you use certain [i]Plans[/i]...)\n\nThe Chirper also returns which is a direct replacement to talking to NPCs in other RPG games. It basically has almost zero use besides getting references, funny thoughts and similiar things. Though for some players it might be something to look forward to during each chapter start.\n\nAnd the fun auto-exploring Stella's dungeon minigame returns again. This time, with more stuff to do. And with faster exploring too, which is a plus too. And this minigame also solves the problem of farming for materials as you can get a lot of them from the minigame too, while doing something else. Like reading the plot.\n\nSpeaking of plot, you will be met by a lot of it. A lot of text that is. Sometimes it really pulls the player out of the action just to read dozens of lines of text. While story is important, from time to time you may feel as the \"actual gameplay VS story reading\" balance is off. Luckily you can still choose to skip the text relatively fast, or set it on AUTO, so you can read/listen to it while eating even!\n\nOptions. There are not many. You can switch the resolution, camera sensitivity, fullscreen mode, language and there are sound sliders. Also key bindings. Other than that there is not much to choose from.\n\nAnd finally the Remake/Plan system, one of the highlights of Neptunia Re;birth's game mechanics for me. As before, it allows the player to \"alter\" how the game works. What that means is basically this is the unlock system. You want new dungeons? Unlock a plan and then gather materials to make a new dungeon. Need more items armor clothes etc.? Repeat what you did for the dungeon. And while this Remake system offers a lot of changes (Monster strength, BGM music change, Clothing, Stella's dungeon additions), it's not as hard to farm all the required materials for all the plans to unlock everything. Which is certainly nice. \n(Unless you're one of those people who need to unlock a \"My waifu\" accessory for all the girls, in which case farming is your problem, buddy!)\n\n[b][i] Graphics and Sounds[/i][/b]\n\nThe game's as colorful as before, looks beautiful in 720p and higher, the character models remain unchanged and that's fine since they do look splendid. A first time player will certainly enjoy the way they look and move, while those who played the previous games might wish for more variety or change. The dungeons and monsters are also more or less the same, with some healthy additions, but a veteran player will certainly be bothered by enemy recolorings and same dungeon re-using.\n\nAll of the cast is fully voiced, with menu and overworld included. Only a few cutscenes are text-only. Each dungeon type has it's own BGM as it should, and boss fights have their own too, though some are re-used from previous games. I personally didn't mind it, as the music is not an annoyance in Re;birth games. \n\n[b][i] Japanese versus English [/i][/b]\n\nThe game originates from Japan as you may already know. But the cast is voiced both in japanese and english, which is quite awesome. The quality of both is superb so choose whichever you fancy more - squeaky typical-anime-ish japanese, or \"dub\" english. (Please don't take the \"dub\" part seriously)\nThe only minus I had with the localization is the fact that the translated story text is still full of          *achem* memes. It's not as bad as it was in Re;birth2 where you couldn't take the story seriously due to how the translation partakes the story in the wrong way. And trust me, when somebody tells you to \"stabby stabby kill kill\" another person while dramatic music plays, the experience is ruined. Luckily as I've mentioned, the translation got better and it's not as off, as it was before.\n\n[b][i] DLC's & Bugs[/i][/b]\n\nA surprise - the game comes with all DLC's besides the Stella dungeon goodie (which is still a very useful DLC). That means you get to use up to 28 instead of 10 characters if you wish. And grind up to 999th level instead of a measly 99.\nThe DLC characters get a few sub-stories which is a nice addition. And strangely enough they get more stories than in previous games where (most of them) were already in the game without DLCs.\nYou also get extra super equipment Plans. But if you don't want none of that you can always turn off the DLC's before starting the game, which is quite helpful for those who wish to do so. And whether you'll want to grind to the max is up to the player, as the extra dungeons do not introduce any more important story additions.\n\nThe game sadly comes with some bugs that don't allow players with low amounts of RAM or with certain Intel integrated graphic cards to play the game without crashes, so beware of that. Some are easily fixable, which is a relief as I myself had to find a quick fix for my own crash issue. I suggest reading up on any other potential game breaking issues before deciding to get the game as you may or may not encounter problems along the way.\n\n[b][i]Final Verdict[/i][/b]\n\nAs a fan of the Neptunia series I was pleased by Re;birth 3: The game's performance got a boost. The story got a boost in length and quality. The gameplay was also balanced for a more enjoyable experience. And while the game still does not let go of it's habits of reusing old material, and it's grindy parts for the completionists, I feel that this game is certainly worth a try for both fans and those who enjoy a not-too-serious JRPG experience. Unless you're a very serious gamer who takes his games seriously, and you require a serious plot and seriously amazing gameplay I recommend this game.

It's so lighthearted and fun that it keeps me coming back day and day again. Over previous titles, this one follows suit with some additions to the formula. EXE gauge has been eliminated from Rebirth1, instead integrating it into the SP gauge for individual players. The tactics are much more sound and require slightly more thought than before, but then again, I've been playing with all the DLC from the first carried over to here. SO, I am barely halfway through the game, but with 20 party members. The choices are so variable.\n\nIn total, I find the humor and story to be spot-on, and the antagonists are memorable spare for a couple. I can't help but feel sympathy for Copypaste, as I really like the direction he took later on. Also, Anonydeath has been a favorite of mine since I saw the anime. I cannot ever forget his top tier line. \"My metal gear may be Solid Snake, but my heart's as maidly as they come.\" Priceless.\n\nIf you like JRPGs and graphic novels, this may hit a soft spot. Also, Neptune's constant spewing of references, whether you pick up on them all or not, kills me. No joke, I pretty much do that myself all the time. I enjoy this game thoroughly and hope to see the colisseum fixed soon.\n\nI genuinely can NOT wait for Action Unleashed to be released on Steam.

Maybe because the protag was Gear-chan (too serious), but rebirth2 lacked a lot of the humor of the first game for like 80% of the game. This game definitely takes the best of the first game's tone and adds on a revamped UI and even more fun and humor. I'm only into ch 1 but I'm already in love with the game already!\n\nI don't know if I would recommend slogging through game 2 to get all the references here, but upon doing so you'll really feel the engine improvement between this and games 1 and 2.\n\n**EDIT 1: Into chapter 3, and there's a LOT of translation freedom here. It's a little hard to tell sometimes whether some things were intentionally mispelled or not.\n\n**EDIT 2: I finished the game, and to sum it up:\n\n+ A TON of content and new stuff to play with, and more characters than you'll know what to do with (all the DLC are included with this game except the one for stella's dungeon I think, which you should definitely get)\n+ You'll definitely get all the references Rebirth1 had to this game, making it feel like you travelled in time.\n+ Neptune is best protag. Plutia is love. Plutia is Life.\n+ The UI and battle system is vastly improved. Everyone gets \"CPU form\" in a sense. Equipping a backline makes sense.\n+ Stella's dungeon makes ingredient grinding much less grindy, and it's faster too and more interesting.\n+ The difficulty curve is the smoothest of all 3 games. Haven't had any major grinding issues.\n+ The story was better than 2. The writing was worse though. YMMV.\n+ Eggplant scene.\n+ The battle system has been heavily revamped in a sense. The EXE gauge has changed to a personal SP bar, and EXE drives were nerfed quite a bit. Slightly different system to play around with.\n\n- The writing is really bad. Like, Rei-stuttering-inducing levels of bad at times. The overall plot is not bad though.\n- The game feels a LOT longer to slog through for multiple playthroughs. Probably also due to all the loading screens inbetween areas.\n- If you don't play with DLC characters you probably won't get a full party till the end of the True Ending path.\n\n\nBest game of the 3 so far.

Also Re;Birth 3 improves on several features such as an improved treasure hunting system so no longer spamming 'scan' in order to find those treasure, or reloading the same dungeon over and over to find rare or important items.   \n\nAlso, I think its a positive change but others may disagree, they significantly changed how the SP system works, so now everything from healing spells, to the typical EX attacks use SP instead of previous games where special attacks/healing used mana and the EX had a seperate meter, its all combined now so some battles require a bit more strategy instead of just spamming the same attacks over and over. \n\nAnother good point is the awakening system, which gives a large stat boost to non-CPU characters, along the same lines as a HDD transform. \n\nThe Bad;\n\nNow for the bad aspects,  unfortunately whilst the previous games mostly had limited bad points.  Victory//Re;Birth 3 does have several points which are quite negative and should be talked about, I will list these and explain them.\n\nUltra Extreme GrindFest (Worst in the Industry)\n\nThe developers incorporated new challenges into the game, by repeating the same process or achieving certain milestones, however they completely and honestly - went way over the top in terms of requirements for some of these,  such as jumping 10,000+ times... to unlock bonuses, I am not even kidding or lying how obnoxious some of these challenges can get,  luckily - no trophies are attached to them so for the most part, it unlocks stats/extra items or skills but still, it is way over the top considering these challenges are for each and every character in the game.\n\nAnother bad point is that the clothing has been priced far too high,  much much higher than the previous games so that all the unlockables and cute clothing are more or less a complete waste of time because by the time you've beaten the game, you'll still not be able to afford any of the clothing or accessories.  In fact,  getting money this time around is much harder than previous games.  In future games, I would like to see the clothing prices drastically reduced so that at least during the first cycle the player can at least purchase some clothing without skipping on upgraded gear. \n\nAnother minor point is a few boss fights, especially end of game have ultra cheap moves which can insta-kill and even immediately game over if your unlucky or not sufficiently levelled high enough to wipe her out in one turn.", "timestamp_created": 1446786375, "timestamp_updated": 1446896416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698060393333435059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18902397": {"recommendationid": "18902397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079519492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1470014871}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember enjoying myself in the luxury of my home till my dad saw me playing this game.\n\nIt's cold outside.", "timestamp_created": 1446785733, "timestamp_updated": 1446785859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18900451": {"recommendationid": "18900451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020575563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1486169438}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally we get some Plutia love with the 3rd installment of the Rebirth Series! \n\nKEEP EM COMMING IDEA FACTORY!

Sound interesting? If yes, you'll probably LOVE this game. If not, you'd better stay waaaay over there! No, a few more steps backwards ... there!\n\nBigger and better, Rebirth 3 takes the series back where it belongs.\n\n\nPros:\n* Very funny (unlike Rebirth 2)\n* UI and mechanics improvements over previous titles\n* Bigger\n* Best story in the series (so far)\n* Friendly to people new to the series\n\nCons:\n* Easy\n* Lack of new moves\n* Some 3d cutscenes still as low-res as in the previous ones\n\n\nTo me, Rebirth 2 felt lackluster after the first game. The story wasn't as funny or as long, and dialogue dragged on with neverending pointless Chirper messages. Rebirth 3 feels like it goes back to what Rebirth 1 was: hilariously funny and full of protagonist wackiness and fourth wall breaking. The story continues after Rebirth 2. It feels more developed, and thanks to its nature and Nepgear's helpfulness it's easily understood by new people to the series. All old characters in the series return as playable characters although all of them don't participate in the main story. There are also some great new additions to the cast.\n\nThere are several mechanics improvements which make me happy. EX and SP point systems have been merged which makes skill management a bit more interesting. UI in the menus have improved. Stella's Dungeon now has a friendly drop list for dungeons and monsters. The map is bigger, with multiple layers and screens, providing space for more dungeons. No more search spam for hidden treasures; they have a new mechanic and are spotted visually. Visuals are also slightly better. The gallery is big, there are plans for changing BGMs and old scenes can be reviewed.\n\nUnfortunately at the point where I'm at, the game feels a bit too easy. When I played Rebirth 1 I didn't feel bad about turning on Easier Enemies. Now I feel like I want to turn on Harder Enemies instead. The combat doesn't offer as much to old players as it could. The old characters all seem to use their familiar moves. The graphics in some 3d cutscenes are blurry and low-res, which can probably be blamed on the PS VITA original.\n\nI'm thoroughly enjoying this one! Jury is still out, but possibly the best in the series.

There are more varied and curious minigames which end up affecting gameplay in different ways. The combat system has been slightly remodeled as well. Gameplay freshness is helped quite a bit by that.\n\n+ A sizeabe amount of characters, both makers and CPUs alike. This allows for all sorts of experimentation with teams, skills and strategies. Unfortunately this experimentation relies on self-imposed limitations.\n\n\nThe meh:\n\n= The storyline is more nonsensical than usual. Then again we don't quite expect worldview changing storytelling out of a Neptunia game. That said, this is on a level of a 2ch doujinshi.\n\n= The game required some adjustements to run properly without crashes. Nothing that can't be done without a little bit of googling and looking around the discussion threads in steam, but it's still there.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Most characters have lost their personalities. Neptune suddenly stopped caring about her sister, everybody else is now a yes-(wo)man to Plutia/Iris Heart, while Iris Heart herself is the very definition of a Mary Sue.\n\n- The humor and jokes are the worst in the series. The entirety of this game's comedy revolves around a single sexual assault joke done over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over (you see where I'm going with this), and over again. Every single chapter. From start to end. Iris Heart Ex Machina removes any sort of stakes, inrigue or curiosity from the storyline. It is very samey, very basic, very one note.\n\n- There is no reason to use any character beside Peashy and Plutia. It is possible to finish the entire game by using only one of them. In comparison, the makers and other CPUs need to work together and require some strategical thinking. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion: Victory is a very weird addition to the series. It is made for a very niche audience within an already niche series. It's a power fantasy Mary Sue simulator story wise, an unbalanced mess gameplay wise and a flop comedy wise. \n\nThe only really good things I can say about this game are the new sub-systems and the variety of characters, for all the two seconds you'll be using them before going back to solo-ing everything with Peashy/Plutia. \n\nThis game is ...

(Since I can't make a funny one, hehe)\n\nI played Re;birth1 and Re;birth2, simply put Re;birth3 is by far the best one in terms of everything. Unlike Re;birth2 that almost feels like the exact same Re;birth1 but played with other characters (the CPU Candidates), Re;birth3 has quite different features than the other two such as a slightly different battle system, different dungeon hidden treasure, different GUI, different World Map, and etc.\n\nThough it is better than the previous games, Re;birth3 is back to having that same game design flaw with Re;birth1 that is having less party slot from the total of main characters. Re;birth1 mistake is that you only have 3 character slots while having 4 CPU goddesses, meaning you have to leave out 1 unfortunate CPU goddess in your party. Re;birth2 fixed this with having 4 slots for 4 CPU Candidates. But Re;birth3, while you now have 4 slots, the number of main CPU goddess is now 5 (or 6 if you want to count in [spoiler]Peashy[/spoiler]). Yes, this isn't gameplay wise, but having to leave out one main character is painful.\n\nAnother problem that I have with the game, though not fatal but still bugs me, is how the optional events works for DLC characters, I won't spoil the content of the event and which one, but just expect a chronological order failure with it. In other words, the DLC events is not in sync with the main storyline.\n\nRe;birth3 is back with CPUs as main protagonists, but with Noire, Blanc, and Vert have a slightly different personality as this game takes place in a different dimension from the previous game (while still being a direct sequel of Re;birth2). So have fun with Neptune being Neptune, Noire's arrogant tsundere, Blanc's raging attitude, and the now keep bragging about her chest, Vert. To make things better, Re;birth3 is introducing a new main character named Plutia, which personally I find it the best one from the five, play the game if you want to know why.\n\nI haven't finish the whole game, but it seems the game is no longer shares-based, which might be nice to some of you that gets really really bored doing quests to control shares to aim for a specific ending like Re;birth2. [spoiler]Interestingly, Neptune comments about this in the game.[/spoiler]\n\nThe game has a new optional feature called Challenges that basically an in-game achievements that grants additional bonuses or a Plan on completing it, for instance, jump 100 times and you get a permanent stat bonus. Though, it's too bad that the challenges are not global but attached to a single character, so you have a same bunch of the achievements that progress individually for each of the characters in the game.\n\nPlans is more neat now, as you no longer have that annoyingly item change and add enemies plans from ciphers each time a new dungeon pop up. And the dungeon change is simplified for the greater good as it is basically only change the boss monster in the dungeon, making you easier to remember where to get material items since the regular monsters stays the same.\n\nStella Dungeon mini game from Re;birth2 is back although slightly different than the previous one. But worry not as the changes is for the better, you can access Stella's Dungeon in the menu now which is very very nice, and I think it is generally takes a much less time than Re;birth2 one, especially if you buy the DLC that made the floor search only takes 1 second to complete which make 100 floors Area only takes 1 minute and 40 seconds to complete.\n\nConclusion is that Re;birth3 is the best Neptunia Re;birth series ever made. I'll happily recommend this game to someone, though it is hard to recommend this without recommend them the previous games, especially Re;birth2 since the game is often referencing the events of Re;birth2 although not really a big deal to the game's storyline.\n\nO yeah, I forgot to mention that this game is more HD than the previous games.", "timestamp_created": 1446578091, "timestamp_updated": 1446578128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18861497": {"recommendationid": "18861497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128611931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 751, "last_played": 1449111219}, "language": "english", "review": "You are going to like it.

For one, most of the DLC is already in the game so you don't need a lot of extra cash for more content.  I like the character outfits in this game more than Re;Birth1.  The story is much of the same; humorous, silly, and with plenty of video game and movie references.  Which can be the game's biggest issue if you don't get the references, since Re;Birth3 is mostly story.  Why is this a problem?  Well the game play is simplistic.  Don't get me wrong, I love Nep-Nep, but the game play could be deeper.  That being said, what's there is sufficient and isn't bad by any means (I've seen worse).  \n\nBuy this game if you want to get into this series and don't worry about it being the 3rd in the series.  Some of the characters will fill you in at a few points if you missed anything.  They're not detailed recaps, but hey they didn't have to do that.\n\nSo yeah, get this game over the other two, but the others are just as good, so get them later! :p", "timestamp_created": 1446422963, "timestamp_updated": 1447454028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18827579": {"recommendationid": "18827579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040760415", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1474155746}, "language": "english", "review": "4 party member battles\n5 actions per turn\n\nNep nep'in time exponentially increased, totally worth it!\n\n(Oh yeah let's not forget there's no bugs nor fps instability like ReBirth2, which is also a plus)", "timestamp_created": 1446421097, "timestamp_updated": 1446421097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18827304": {"recommendationid": "18827304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173132949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 612, "last_played": 1485678272}, "language": "english", "review": "Why are there negative reviews for this game.

It's more or less the same exact thing as the previous titles, with slightly upgraded visuals. The only thing it has going for it is the humor. The combat feels bland, uninspired, and dull, as it is literally the same thing as the last two, except now you can do one more attack. Whee. \n   \n   The special attacks are also all copy/pasted from the previous titles, they didn't even give neptune anything new, which is really kind of silly and lazy, since she is the main character for crying out loud. This game, much like 2, just feels lazy and is kind of an insult to the fans. To charge this much for the game when it is all literally the same thing as the previous two is BS.\n\n    The dungeons are also all the same as the last two, the maps are also literally copy/pasted. The layouts are all the same, the asthetics have not changed one bit, and the music is all the same too. How does this game company seriously get away with doing this, whereas any other game company makes one minor mistake and the fans burn them at the stake? \n\nThe music is all the fuckin same. Not much more I can say on this.\n   \n The fans seriously need to get over their obsessive love for Neptune and see this game and the previous ones for its huge flaws and not buy into this kind of stuff anymore.\n\n\n\nThere are also huge plot holes in the story as well as inconsistencies with character development.\n\n                                             ************************SPOILERS************************\n\n\nYou recuit adult IF and Child IF, as well as child Compa and Adult Compa in the same party, That's cool, I guess, for people who prefer adult over child, but they don't even give us a small story as to why they are suddenly added. It's just \"IF has Joined\" \"Compa has joined.\"\n\nOn the subject of IF and Compa, you progress into the story, you are introduced to Baby IF, Compa, and Peashy. They are babies in one scene, Children in the next, then back to being babies. Really? This is so sloppily done it is apalling. No, I did not miss previous scenes or wait til later to do certain ones, I did the events right as they appeared.\n\n Vert is introduced, declares war on the CPUs. Ok, cool plot, but hey, I have an event with MarvelousAQL talking about titty size. Suddenly vert is with us in Planeptune being all chummy with us like the main story isn't even a thing.\n\n                                       *******************************SPOILERS OVER*********************************\n\n\nThere are many other inconsistencies that I am sure that I have not come to yet, as I have not yet completed the game, as well as events I may have forgotten about.\n\nIt's just piss poor game design that really should not be excused just because you happen to like a character just because she's a loli. It's a stupid reason. So if The order 1886's main character was a loli, you would excuse it for it's shitty gameplay and story? Don't answer that. It just shows how far the gaming industry has fallen because they can get away with anything as long as it includes A) Loli B) Boobs or C) Loli with boobs.\n\nYou are much better off watching this on youtube or just reading the wiki for a quick summary for the events instead of wasting your money on this like I did, or basing your purchase choice on the positive reviews which are all \"Nep nep nep boobs nep desu loli I am lonely my friends dont talk to me hurp derp\" Bullshit, useless reviews, which pretty much makes the rule \"Never read the positive reviews\" a requirement. Those help no one, and they aren't funny or cute.\n\nNo doubt this review will be downvoted to oblivion by the fans of this game, but I spoke my opinion.\n\nThank you and have a fantastic day.\n\nSide Note: Negative/Flaming comments WILL be deleted.", "timestamp_created": 1446409560, "timestamp_updated": 1450370185, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508953332901000977", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18823528": {"recommendationid": "18823528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145481460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 101, "last_played": 1458953006}, "language": "english", "review": "More Nep for me :3 :3", "timestamp_created": 1446407744, "timestamp_updated": 1446407744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413643747568130493", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18822303": {"recommendationid": "18822303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031347508", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 3971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1410, "last_played": 1527263776}, "language": "english", "review": "My mother is ashamed of me, but I have no regrets.", "timestamp_created": 1446404225, "timestamp_updated": 1446404225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 39, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586805462837219238", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18820937": {"recommendationid": "18820937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068296977", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1241, "last_played": 1452987952}, "language": "english", "review": "If you look at this game and bother spend your time reading the review, you probably gonna buy the game in the first place anyway.

A lot of the good things about Fairy Fencer F are in this game. I do wish they didn't reuse so many dungeons. I will say that the new dungeons are a bit of fresh air, and absolutely gorgeous. However, the amount of reused dungeons is staggering. Well, they aren't reused as much as a bunch of dungeons were created / taken from Rebirth 3 / Neptunia V\n\nThey re-recorded the voices. A side-effect is that Neptune's Japanese voice has a higher pitch. Ugh. That took a while to get used to. Plutia is another paint-by-numbers character, but her interactions make up for a lot. Noire steals the spotlight though. I also like that IF and Compa aren't in the beginning of the game. I haven't gotten too far, yet\n\nI don't like Plutia that much. She was pretty good for a while, but they took her over the top. There's also improvements on item finding.

Its loosely regarded as the sequal to Mk2 or rebirth2 however you can start here and you will be fine. Honestly you can start on any of the hyperdimension games and it really wouldnt matter.\n\nAnyways this one has a lot of the similar features that you would find in the other games however there is a notable quality upgrade, all of the graphics are improved, the polys are notiably higher(aliasing is still crap) and the menus work effectively best of all the game is stable once again unless you are on intel hd 2000 or less it seems. \n\nAs always the game is hilarious and a bit over cutsy, combat is extremely addictive hence the massive success of the series and all of the partical effects seem to have been redone to be at 60fps(previously some animations ran slower then the realtime rendering and it was wierd) and to just look better.

And I'm here to tell you... \n\nShort version- YES!\n\nLong version-\nFirst off, the story focuses on just the CPUs. While the side characters can still be there, they're included as dlc when you download the game, so you can choose whether to have them in the game or not!\n\nSecond, there's changes to the gameplay. While the core gameplay exists (rush, power, and break attacks), it's a lot more different that 1&2. Now, instead of an exe drive, you know use the sp bar for exe related attacks. Meaning you can't spam the exe attacks like you use to, and you also have to plan how you use your other sp attacks. Meaning the game is a lot more strategic!\n\nThird, grinding is a lot more fun now thanks to some additions. Each character can level up by doing certain tasks. For ex. Neptune finding 10 items as a lead character can level up her luck. And this goes for EVERY character, giving you a reason to swich who you leader is. (Oh, and btw, there's leader skills too!)\n\nAnd even though there's much more, the last thing I'll say is that THIS ISN'T A BAD PORT!

Peace that I have returned to Nep Nep's dimensions from the first game with 98 hours (all achievements) and 124 hours (all achievments) from the second. Now that, the third game has finally unveiled on Steam, the nepping season has returned. To bring peace to Gameindustri and Platnium all achievements.\n\nI am currently in chapter 1 and I must say, Idea Factory and Compile Heart has never failed to impress and wow me with Neptunia games and their other titles. Even though I kind of know what's going to happen in this game due to watching the Anime Series (The anime is all 3 games combined into a whole new story). \n\nThe game has actually wowed me the minute the prologue began as Mr Narrator introduced our lovely goddess. The entire battle system layout, menus and how things are accessed have been totally revamped - it has a fresher look and feel to my eyes, as if my eyes are going to explode but in a good way *eyegasm*\n\nI undertstand how people think Neptunia games have alot of recycled monsters/maps from other games and other IF and CH titles but the game does include a fewer new maps and a more feel of exploration.\n\nPROs-\n- Our goddesses are back\n- This game features our lovely ladies, Iris Heart (Plutia) and Yellow Heart (Peashy)\n- ^ For those who have enjoyed the first game with these to as DLC characters, this is a must get if you want some more character development and know them more as characters and not OP characters.\n- New maps - one of the maps, I've encountered has stairs\n- 4 characters in the team like the last game\n- REFERENCES OF COURSE! Here's a small one - NEPULUS GRIFT 8D\n- The translation has more of a Rebirth 1 feel unlike Rebirth 2, I actually couldn't get as much humor from it (Maybe its just me)\n- 4 combos and not 3!\n- New music? There's some I've never heard before actually\n- Do you like those blocks from Mario where jump to get dah moneeyyy?  Well if you do great! Hidden items in the game aren't glowy thingies but are blocks! BUT WARNING- They might hurt your waifu... Plutia called me mean and yelled ow :V\n- Hidden treasures are easier to find, you dont need a plan like other games.\n\nCONS\n- 2 of the 3 cutscnes lagged very badly on me compared to the other games. Lagged about every few seconds but then again, I can't blame the developers at fault since my Surface Pro 3 doesn't have a high graphics card but oh well.\n\nI guess that's all I have to say really, though to some, it's not great but to some it's great but too many issues leaving to hate. Well, if you've finished and legit read this review. Purchase the game if it floats your boat! I do recommend you at least play the second game though since it's a sequel to it unlike Rebirth 1.\n\nOverall, highly neppenmend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1446291391, "timestamp_updated": 1446291391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756260454654693604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18789217": {"recommendationid": "18789217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019155068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2308, "last_played": 1494336882}, "language": "english", "review": "nep is love, nep is life.\n\nbut then there's Noire....", "timestamp_created": 1446289821, "timestamp_updated": 1446289821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515151500701904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18788573": {"recommendationid": "18788573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101435740", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1468226488}, "language": "english", "review": "I dont know what to do with my life anymore, so i will just keep playing.\n10/10 will play for ever and ever......

Can't remember what the Vita version ran at, but my awful memory doesn't remember it being as smooth as this version--and even if it was, you're probably still better off playing it on the PC for the larger resolution/display potential.\n\nSome stuff you might want to know.\n\n- All the free DLC found in the PSN store for this game is included automatically.  You don't have an option to not download it as far as I can tell.  That said, there is no DLC like the 2nd game that gives you a massively overpowered sword, so you won't have to worry about that.  The oracles are kind of strong, but the best characters are found in the base game, anyway.\n\n- There appears to be DLC (included for free) that wasn't in the PSN, or at least wasn't in the PSN when I originally bought the game there, and I haven't gone back to check to see if it was added later.  Appears to have some minor amounts of new content.\n\n- The game still does not good resolution support.  I have a 1920x1200 monitor which is not a supported resolution (max appears to be 1920x1080, although I do not know if a 1440p monitor unlocks a configuration option unavailble to me).  This forces me to play the game windowed or stretch/distort the game when playing in fullscreen.  This is not really a huge deal, but given that they've had 3 games to address this issue and still haven't bothered to, I feel it's worth mentioning at this point.\n\n- Going off the basis that everything else is the same as the Vita version, I'm going to go on and say that this is definitely the best game in the series so far.  It dramatically improves the system for ranged attacks, now allowing you to make ranged attacks at point blank range.  Every character has their own SP bar, so now you can't basically spam the hell out of EX Techniques to faceroll everything in the game (you actually can, but only with an extremely specific party composition).\n\n- Instead of tying everything to level, now, there are \"achievements\" per character that do things like unlock their EX move, leader skills, and other things.\n\n- The Chirper spam is significantly reduced.\n\n- Dungeon upgrades are more streamlines, you no longer have to worry about changing items, adding enemies, or changing dungeons.\n\n- Stella's dungeon is more interesting fun.  I recommend the DLC since some monsters apparently inflict 9999 damage if Stella can't kill them quickly enough (like an unlucky string of misses) even if she's otherwise invulnerable and easily capapble of clearing the area.  There is a way to get the DLC bonuses normally sort of, but it requires equipping/partnering with specific people for the dungeon.  The DLC allows you to get those bonuses while using completely different set ups.  It's also only 99 cents.  That's less than what most of you probably pay for garbage shovelware on Humble Bundle that you will never play.\n\n- I also buy many games from Humble Bundle that I will never play.", "timestamp_created": 1446271504, "timestamp_updated": 1446271504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562811374664306641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18784588": {"recommendationid": "18784588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232020020", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1467631886}, "language": "english", "review": "Plutia and Peashy yeee", "timestamp_created": 1446270778, "timestamp_updated": 1446270778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501979827880859375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18784480": {"recommendationid": "18784480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046183234", "num_games_owned": 1097, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 2571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1138, "last_played": 1452389060}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Menos de 10 minutos y el juego se paga solo\n\n11/10 lo volver\u00eda a comprar", "timestamp_created": 1446270253, "timestamp_updated": 1446270253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485893428325653076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18784437": {"recommendationid": "18784437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123771292", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 8635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3947, "last_played": 1579740346}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Edito el analisis debido a que ya termine el juego (Ya fue hace mucho).

It wasn't very intuitive in the older games, but is a godsend that saves you from endless experimenting, staring and numbers and checking wikis. \nI won't comment on pacing or plot because I haven't finished the game to comment on the former and the latter is irrelevant if you're playing a neptunia game not Re;birth 2.

Cut fabric after printing the doll template. Talk to Anonydeath about Noire pattern\n2. Prep skin, head, hands and feet\n3. Stitch fabric with 1/4 seam allowance or less, snip away fabric with scisssor\n4. Roll the batting. Use wool as that's highly Nepable.\n5. Make the head, hands and feet. Make neck by tying a thread around the batting ball, stitch bottom to close the stubs.\n6. Stuff the body. Make the head firmer than the body. Whipstich the head to body with double lengthed threading. Repeat for hands and feet.\n7. Make hair by using pins to mark placement on head and then sew on yarn or better yet, real CPU hair. Keep in place, make tiny stitching each loop, insert needed threaded with embroidery floss through back of the head and out at a pin, and the stitch features. \n8. Complete the hair on the head by snip looping the hair.\n9. (optional) Using the same doll template, design suitable clothing. You don't want your doll to be naked, even if the doll's quite Nepable as she is.\n10. Proceed to Nep with the doll.

Also, different sound effects like birds singing in background when you're in a forest area are nice extra details. \n\nOverall, it's more of the same and I don't think that's a bad thing. The animations are improved, and it's just fun. \n\nThough I will say, for best results...play with a controller (just like all the other Neptunia games).\n\nMy only real complaint is how long it takes after boss fights with every character having a level-up (and with all the included DLC characters....that's a LOT of level-ups).
