After seeing the rather mysterious trailer back then, i thought that i needed to try it out and it was a good decision to do so.\n\nPlaying as Senua, you will get yourself into an arduous trip full of dangers, uncertainty and the problem to keep reality and imagination apart. The protagonist you are playing as, suffers from a heavy psychosis, so you will often sit in front of your computer and will ask yourself, what is even going on here? Senua will perceive whispering voices and suffer from vivid hallucinations that turn a rather calm situation into a nightmarish one from one moment to the other. The way the story is being told is the games biggest strength. I also have to praise the great facial animations, they did a top notch job in this department. \n\nGameplay-wise you shouldn't expect something too groundbreaking. The combat mechanics are a little bit rough around the edges and can feel repetitive after some time. You will mostly fight the same enemies and there isn't much variety to it, which definitely feels a little bit uncreative and is a minus point. There are also some puzzles that you have to solve. These puzzles are not that challenging but are meant to represent a part of her psychosis and fit the narrative of the game pretty well. However, they are also going to slow down the gameplay, which some people may dislike. \n\nAll in all, a very decent title with an interesting way of storytelling. People who are into mysterious and opaque settings will surely enjoy it. \n\nHave fun!", "timestamp_created": 1700770383, "timestamp_updated": 1700770383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151376872": {"recommendationid": "151376872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066928255", "num_games_owned": 567, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 137, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1700757944}, "language": "english", "review": "Endlessly Walking, Puzzle simulator with garbage combat design.

Like Plague Tale, this game is absolutely beautiful. The character and enemy designs are some of the best I've seen. The atmosphere is also really good.\n\nSo why didn't I like this?\n\nThe puzzles took me out of the psych aspect of the game. In my opinion, the psychological condition of Senua should have been the focus. They should have made the reward for the puzzles as clues to reality since the game is 90% puzzles.\n\nI expected the voices in my head to be far more oppresive & varied. Most of the time, it felt like someone is just gossiping about me.\n\nThere's so much mention of the word \"Darkness\" that I started finding it funny/edgy/cool. The writing seems to make you want to be afraid of it or take it seriously though. They should have replaced it with another word.\n\nWhy gimp the sprint in a game where you run back and forth to solve the puzzles to progress the story? Senua can sprint during combat and in one story segment when you run away from something.\n\nThe combat also doesn't add much. It's very basic and the lock on system is annoying. Yeah you can shift focus on who you're fighting but you can't freely move the camera. Majority of the difficulty in combat is because of the camera. You will get attacked out of nowhere given how the enemies appear in this game\n\nThere's no baseline to this psychological story so you don't know what reality is. You can argue that is really set during the viking age with myths and I can argue that she is a little girl in modern times whose night light went out so she started imagining things.

From the moment I stepped into the shoes of the tormented Senua, I was utterly captivated. The game's unique blend of storytelling, combat, and psychological exploration is a true masterpiece that left an indelible mark on me.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Hellblade is its storytelling. Senua's personal journey through a world plagued by her own mental health challenges is nothing short of profound. The game tackles the subject of mental illness with incredible sensitivity and respect. I found myself empathizing with Senua's struggles, fears, and determination. The way the story unfolds, with Senua's inner voices providing both guidance and torment, adds layers of complexity to the narrative that I've rarely encountered in gaming.\n\nThe game's audio-visual design is nothing short of breathtaking. The stunningly detailed visuals, combined with a hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack, drew me deeper into Senua's troubled mind. The use of binaural audio is a stroke of genius, creating an immersive and unsettling soundscape that left me feeling truly immersed in her world.\n\nThe combat in Hellblade, while challenging, is beautifully integrated into the narrative. Every encounter felt intense, and I was constantly pushed to improve my skills. The way the game blurs the line between reality and delusion during these moments added to the sense of unease and made every victory feel incredibly rewarding.\n\nHellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is more than a game; it's a powerful and emotional experience that I won't soon forget. It takes you on a journey into the darkest recesses of the mind, exploring the complexities of mental illness in a way that's both respectful and thought-provoking. If you're looking for a game that offers a deeply personal and emotional experience, Hellblade is an absolute must-play. It's a rare gem that left me contemplating its themes long after the credits rolled, and it's an experience that I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone seeking a unique and moving gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1699313998, "timestamp_updated": 1699313998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539170503616333008", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149673819": {"recommendationid": "149673819", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168008338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 664, "last_played": 1699310518}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ESQUIZOFRENIAAAAAAAAAAAA", "timestamp_created": 1699307822, "timestamp_updated": 1699307931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149668561": {"recommendationid": "149668561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312703206", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1982, "last_played": 1699299685}, "language": "english", "review": "What a fucking masterpiece.

Los puzles en este juego son una parte esencial y me ha encantado su abstracci\u00f3n y c\u00f3mo se relacionan con el trastorno mental. Falta alg\u00fan enemigo m\u00e1s para crear un poco m\u00e1s de variedad pero eso s\u00ed, no nos podemos quejar de los jefes, los cuales son extraordinarios y muy geniales.

It is remarkable how a good design can make a linear world feel so dynamic. The state of ruin and decay is present throughout the levels. The design in each levels are much so dynamic and unique each time, it's refreshing.\n\n[u][b]Audio Design.[/b][/u] It can never be too good for sound to complement the visuals. It tells a story unseen and it can reach through the audience deeply. The audio dynamics is stunning. The placement of the sources within a three-dimensional space is well demonstrated and implemented in the game. \n\n[u][b]Theme.[/b][/u] The theme is something that I give special attention to in most cases. It shows a horrifying depiction of one's own darkness. The battle that we all have fought in our personal lives. However, some have it worst and I felt as if I was in that scenario in the game, immersive is an understatement. Mental disturbance is one of my favorite point of focus in a game or any story driven content. It can be truly scary to have one's reality become so twisted.\n\n[u][b]Humane Aspects.[/b][/u] If you value the embodiment of human expressions. This hits a bullseye.

While I was intrigued for a few hours and even completed the game, I primarily did so to justify my purchase.\n\nSeveral aspects left me disappointed. The game's attempt to offer an experience through the lens of mental illness is novel, but the charm quickly faded, resulting in moments of frustration and annoyance. I empathize with those who endure such experiences due to genuine mental challenges. However, I've come to realize that crafting an entire game around this perspective may not have been the best approach. Games should primarily provide enjoyment, and this aspect felt overlooked. \n\nThe combat mechanics showed promise but fell short in execution. The absence of a practice mode outside of combat means many players might not even discover certain features, like the melee button or specific combos. The combat's movement design was limited\u2014while it's functional in a one-on-one scenario, the inability to move laterally becomes glaringly evident when facing multiple opponents. Players are either constrained to continually switch lock-on targets, risking blindsided hits, or resort to a constant dodging tactic. With a better movement system and opportunities for out-of-combat practice, the combat could've been the game's highlight.\n\nLastly, the story felt overly pretentious.

Games rarely have good stories--even in cases where a game's main focus is its narrative. Even more rarely, games have stories that are both good and could only be told in the medium of videogames. When talking about stories in videogames, the interactivity of the medium in relation to its narratives is only explored in the lenses of branching paths leading to different narrative outcomes/different endings. It's easy to forget that even in a game with a linear narrative, the road to get to the end is still paved by the player's interactions with the game. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice understands that well. This is an entirely linear game, but its story of pain, loss and self-acceptance would have never resonated with me in the same way if I had watched it on a screen or read it on a page instead of sharing the journey with the titular character. The game is honest with its depiction of mental health. I don't suffer from psychosis but I know that it tends to be sensationalized for the sake of plot in most stories. Even when Hellblade uses Senua's mental health as a narrative tool, it does so fairly and without placing moral judgment on it, instead merely recognizing that it exists and that it affects her in many ways. The setting is Norse mythology stuff, but the truth is that it's only set dressing to Hellblade's story of loss: the gods and monsters of the Vikings are well-intertwined with the narrative, but a similar effort with any given mythology would have worked just as well. Norse mythology might have been chosen due to its eschatological narratives, since Senua often catastrophizes and her thoughts can end up veering to the idea that the world is ending, but this is only a vague parallel.\n\nOn the more \"gamey\" side of things, I went in expecting a walking simulator and I got that, kind of. There is combat in this game, with a clear FromSoftware inspiration, but in terms of difficulty the game will adapt to your ability, and there is an option to make things easier or harder if you wish to. There are puzzles and narrative sequences throughout the game, as well as some horror segments (which have some of the most terrifying moments I remember experiencing in a game). A somewhat major problem I encountered was the subtitles not working once in the 8 hours it took me to complete the game, though I will say that if you're comfortable without them, you should keep them off anyway: everything in Hellblade is completely diegetic, and subtitles might detract from immersion.\n\nI have plenty more to say, but it's better to go in knowing less than more. This game touched me deeply like only a handful others ever have.

The visual design is excellent, with near flawless presentation; I can't recall any time where I was upset or pulled out of the game thanks to a visual bug. The audio differentiates this game from many others, offering a unique, and from what I understand, well researched glimpse into what it might be like to experience psychosis. \n\nI could go on, but to keep it short: this is an audio/visual experience well worth your time if the setting seems at all appealing to you. A small disclaimer too: this game is certainly not for everyone. If you struggle to find yourself interested by the trailers, then perhaps it's not for you, and that's fine too. \n\nIf you do pick it up, absolutely wear headphones to get the most out of it and strap in for the ride.

The story setting and game type honestly didn't interest me much but the various positive reviews pushed me to try anyway. I do like story heavy games but not when it's more story than game, in that case I would get a better experience just reading a novel or book or watching some tv, movie or anything else. This game, in my opinion, would be more immersive and good in book format in my opinion, I can really see in front of me how it would play out and how moving it would be.\n\nInstead, we have an \"unique\" game that tries something not perhaps new but unusual. I respect the attempt at showing psychosis to people and that it might help some people understand more and those who have issues relate and perhaps feel some comfort, but to me, as a game, this failed pretty badly.\n\nFrom the start, we have very clunky mechanics. It's simply not fun to run around or do stuff. The \"puzzles\" aren't interesting or fun to complete, when you do complete them you just feel hollow because there's nothing special about them. There's little to no \"reward\" to our \"effort\". The combat is pretty bad, just a few boring actions where you probably end up just spamming one or two buttons and dodging like crazy, it's not as if you need to or should get good at \"fighting\" in this game, it's far too short and the combat simply doesn't matter much. The auto-lock feature was decent when you faced 1-2 enemies, but above that and it just locked onto the wrong enemies even when you were closer to other enemies. While it's meant to be that way for \"immersion\" and \"creating the mood\", it's frustrating to have no clue about her health, how many more hits she can take and so on. \n\nWe're interrupted all the time with the game rudely stealing control of our camera to do some cutscenes. It's simply bad game design overall in this game. All the while, there's no real feeling of dread or terror from losing control or facing the challenges, as you feel comfortable enough knowing that you're going to be just fine if you ignore everything around you. \n\nThe voices quickly become a nuisance, repeating themselves over and over and being disruptive. The protagonist, in my mind, is very unlikable, sad story and all that but the whining, screaming and monologue is something I dislike.\n\nIt's MEANT to be like that, yes. To show mental illness, or more specifically psychosis. Trying to get people who haven't got these issues to experience what they go through, perhaps trying to evoke feelings of sympathy. To me, that doesn't change how bad of an experience it was and not in a \"oh, I feel like I'm walking with her on this road of madness\" kind of way but rather just plain dull, boring and frustrating at best.\n\nSo... As an educational game, yeah, maybe, give it a try. But the story it tells is pretty basic, the visuals go for shock value, there's shockingly little \"game\" in this game (not only little to do but also minimal control) and everything outside the cut scenes are just overall so-so quality. I never enjoyed it or felt immersed from start to end, after an hour or two, I started to just want it to end, after finishing it I felt relief, I'm probably going to forget this game in a short while as it left little impression. The lore was pretty good though.\n\nFail as a game, kind of a pass as an educational game, good potential as a basis for a book, though it needs to be greatly fleshed out and taken step by step.", "timestamp_created": 1697762430, "timestamp_updated": 1697762430, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454700857400894165", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148512181": {"recommendationid": "148512181", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972772686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1697756332}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!", "timestamp_created": 1697756434, "timestamp_updated": 1697756434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148508170": {"recommendationid": "148508170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012876144", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1680219015}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

After spending 8.6 hours in the harrowing world of Senua, it's evident that this game is a unique and profound experience.\n\nSet in a hauntingly beautiful representation of the Viking age, Hellblade places you in the shoes of Senua, a Celtic warrior suffering from psychosis. The narrative revolves around her quest to rescue the soul of her deceased lover, Dillion, from the Norse underworld. However, it quickly becomes apparent that the real journey is into the depths of Senua's mind.\n\nThe game's portrayal of mental illness is unprecedented in the gaming world. Through the use of binaural audio, visual distortions, and intense storytelling, Hellblade provides players with a visceral understanding of Senua's struggles. As you guide her through her personal hell, you'll witness her debilitating hallucinations, inner torment, and wavering grip on reality.\n\nThe heart of Hellblade is its storytelling and character development. Senua is not merely a protagonist; she is a fully realized, empathetic character, brought to life through the remarkable performance of Melina Juergens. Senua's journey is as much an exploration of her psyche as it is a physical quest. It's a testament to the power of video games as a medium for immersive storytelling.\n\nGameplay in Hellblade balances action, puzzle-solving, and exploration. The combat, while not overly complex, is satisfying and visceral. The puzzles are cleverly integrated into the narrative, representing Senua's inner battles. The game's world is dark and foreboding, and every nook and cranny is filled with lore and atmosphere.\n\nHellblade's audio design deserves special mention. The game recommends the use of headphones, and for a good reason. The binaural audio is a masterstroke, creating an unsettling and immersive soundscape that directly contributes to the player's understanding of Senua's mental state.\n\nThe 8.6 hours you've spent playing Hellblade may feel like a mere glimpse into Senua's story, but it's a testament to the game's power that it leaves a lasting impact long after you've put down the controller. The game's poignant conclusion will stay with you, prompting introspection and discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is an exceptional work of art, transcending the boundaries of video games. It's a powerful exploration of mental illness, personal struggle, and the human spirit. With its unforgettable character, innovative audio design, and intense storytelling, Hellblade is a unique and profound experience that pushes the boundaries of what games can achieve. It's a masterpiece that will leave you with a newfound appreciation for the medium's potential as a tool for empathy and understanding.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1697696646, "timestamp_updated": 1697696646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148467547": {"recommendationid": "148467547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316766030", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 483, "last_played": 1697683605}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No lo penses, jugalo que es una locura, combate al estilo de dark souls, momentos de mucho suspenso y tensi\u00f3n, muy buena historia, mucha cinematica mega hd, dale, compralo.", "timestamp_created": 1697683692, "timestamp_updated": 1697683692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148463912": {"recommendationid": "148463912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198884554649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_at_review": 438, "last_played": 1700685014}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Realmente no escribo rese\u00f1as, pero este juego se la merece, una historia incre\u00edble, m\u00fasica genial, ambientaci\u00f3n 10 puntos, lo \u00fanico negativo que le encuentro es el combate que se vuelve repetitivo pero realmente no es tan molesto.\nEste juego es genial, de los mejores que eh jugado y tiene un final \u00e9pico", "timestamp_created": 1697676528, "timestamp_updated": 1697676528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148449574": {"recommendationid": "148449574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859818315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1697653024}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible story, phenomenal acting, fun (yet simple) gameplay, and no \"filler\" chapters.

While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, if you're looking for an unforgettable and distinct gaming experience, Hellblade is definitely worth a try.\n\nFrom the moment you step into Senua's twisted world, you are immediately captivated by the game's haunting atmosphere. The developers' attention to detail shines through, creating a stunning visual representation of the protagonist's warped perception of reality. The combination of eerie sound design and unsettling visuals creates an immersive experience that keeps you on edge throughout the entire journey.\n\nWhat sets Hellblade apart is its masterful storytelling. The game delves into themes of mental health, delusion, and inner demons with a sense of authenticity rarely seen in video games. Senua's battle with her own psychosis is depicted in a raw and emotional manner, enabling players to empathize with her struggles. The narrative unfolds gradually, weaving together a tale that's as dark and unsettling as it is thought-provoking. As players guide Senua through her own personal hell, they become invested in her journey of self-discovery and acceptance.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics perfectly complement the sinister atmosphere and the themes at hand. As players navigate through the twisted reality of Senua's mind, they encounter challenging puzzles, intense combat sequences, and mind-bending illusions. These elements are seamlessly intertwined, allowing players to experience, firsthand, the chaos and torment that Senua battles within herself. The integration of binaural audio techniques adds an extra layer of immersion, creating a deeply unsettling sensation as whispers and voices envelop your ears, contributing to the overall eerie atmosphere.\n\nIt's important to note that Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice may not be for everyone. The game's themes and presentation can be disturbing and overwhelming for some players. However, if you are willing to step outside your comfort zone and embrace a unique and unconventional experience, Hellblade offers a journey that is immensely rewarding. The storytelling and exploration of mental health issues demonstrate the potential for video games as a medium for deep emotional resonance and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is not your typical gaming experience. It's an unsettling, dark, and deeply introspective journey that explores the uncharted realms of psychosis and self-discovery. With its superb storytelling, haunting atmosphere, and thought-provoking themes, Hellblade stands as a testament to the incredible potential of video games as a means of immersive storytelling. While it may not cater to everyone's taste, those seeking a unique and unforgettable experience should not miss it.", "timestamp_created": 1697007410, "timestamp_updated": 1697007410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148007080": {"recommendationid": "148007080", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260610555", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 931, "last_played": 1696991950}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente historia, jugabilidad disfrutable... me gusto mucho", "timestamp_created": 1696992037, "timestamp_updated": 1696992037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147993337": {"recommendationid": "147993337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092671558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1696370497}, "language": "english", "review": "This game changes you.", "timestamp_created": 1696967702, "timestamp_updated": 1696967702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147987203": {"recommendationid": "147987203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842910294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1696915873}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo!!", "timestamp_created": 1696959927, "timestamp_updated": 1696959927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147986767": {"recommendationid": "147986767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089688857", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1697132955}, "language": "english", "review": "The acting and story telling are superb but the game is shallow and linear.

Bodies stay in solitude, whose shrieks fade into the breadth of a dark and foggy world. Beings in soreness, slew in a dishonourable and ignominious manner, Senua will hike a path through the winding land of Helheim.\n\nI won't expose you its whole story, nor will I give you crumbs of analysis. Just know that Senua, a Pict warrior from Scotland, Dillion was murdered. She involuntarily espoused Norse customs, so she believes her beloved is confined in Hel. She decides to make a journey to those dark lands to bring him back in exchange for a sacrifice, soul for soul. This is how the quest begins.\n\n[h1]The purification journey of a geilt[/h1]\n\nOne of the essential topics is a conception of [i]visions[/i] from a double point of view developed in the game: psychosis and Celtic-Nordic religiosity. If a person suffers a vision or outburst of ecstasy, at that time they were considered a possible aspirant for an oracle or sibyl. In our epochs, that person is understood as someone who suffers from a mental illness, whose vision is nothing more than a distortion of reality. Maybe one day I'll talk about it, for now this is the backbone for the happening of the plot.\n\nWe must comprehend the game from double point of view: a journey of purification of a mystical form and, at the same time, a path that offers a feeling from a character with a case of severe psychosis. To appreciate this, the plot script is well composed and written in the style of the Nordic sagas. Although it also has the Greek theatrical structure, where the drama in Senua is emphasized by the choirs, in this case, the voices in her head. It has a discursive duality, an external and internal sphere. The plot achieves to be complete by bringing together both spheres. In this way they\u2019re not altered worlds, or different realities, but reality itself, although amplified or dilated to the point of longsighted something more than the others. Or at least it gives me that impression.\n\nHowever, I loved their mode of speaking, voicing and expressing; the tone and rhythm of the discourses, the characters does so with a poetic tone. Furthermore, the story is revealed as the narrative layers of Senua and her journey unfold. Along the pathway she uncovers her past, context and quest. The actors behind the characters do their performance amazingly, mainly that of Melina Juergens. Her act is staggering, whose expressions manage to transfer and tense diverse feelings to the player. And with the camera shots, where sometimes she seems to dialog to the spectator, she bring about to agitate the player, also giving a feeling of stupor in the dramatic scenes of the plot.\n\n[h1]Mystical hallucination[/h1]\n\nExceptional exertion was put into finding a way to represent her visions and voices in Senua. This bring out the drama of the story, as well as connects to the gameplay. The exterior was represented through artistic and well-lit locations with a combination of nature, settlements and Celtic-Nordic art. The film events take place as a photomontage in real time, in which the game and a scene with a real image are coalesced, as happens in the game [i]Control[/i]. But when Senua experiences from visions, the scenery changes in addition to distorting the image. A good job is done with illumination and image effects, awareness and double exposure. What it does is only open paths where apparently they weren\u2019t there without altering reality. All of this will play an important role in the gameplay in addition to the plot.\n\nOn the other hand, I recommend playing it with headphones. In this way, you\u2019ll be able to appreciate its binaural sound, since the sounds have an effect as if you were hearing Senua's voices that are speaking around you. The voices are an essential detail, they concoct part of the narrative layer along with constantly nattering with the protagonist. Sometimes it is a bomb of sounds where, at least for me, they try to grab you and pull you to in the end persuade, confuse or help you out on some occasions. I didn't know who to listen to, and I wanted to say, enough, shut up! Which, the game attains its purpose of performing the effect of hearing voices in the head.\n\nAnother notable point is its delicious soundtrack. It was composed by David Garcia and Andy LaPlegua. Although I listened to most of it during moments of battle, it contains a rich theme in narrative terms. The music mainly expresses Norse mythology. It and the steles both tell us the mythology of the northerners. Since the music expresses such a northern world, it uses dark and Nordic folk music. Although sometimes the music comes with elements of electronic pieces. However, this still gives vigorous, loud scenes, but at the same time it\u2019s dark, beauty and cold. It\u2019s undoubtedly a masterpiece where it concentrates the world to which Senua seems not to belong. However, she\u2019s fighting against them towards her Ragnar\u00f6k.\n\n[h1]The skill of guiding paths[/h1]\n\nThe game frequently uses signs and symbols. Not only do they have implication to the story, but they\u2019re also considered part of the gameplay. There\u2019re three types of gameplay: exploration, battle and puzzle solving. Battle is a mode that\u2019s simple, but is enjoyable in every encounter against opponents. Although it has few combinations with the sword, it\u2019s still interesting to give a diverse rhythm to the story. These battles are important, since winning them will open the way. But if you die constantly, the game will be erased, as the darkness grows with each defeat until it reaches the head where the soul resides. So it's good to pay attention, since you\u2019ll always receive advice from Druth, the Darkness or the voices. They\u2019ll alert us when an enemy wants to attack us from behind.\n\nFurthermore, solving puzzles has been its memorable gameplay. To do this, the game will use runes, symbols or images to make your way through perspectives and optical illusions. For example, there\u2019s a locked door, I listen to the advice of a voice, I focus my attention to record the rune and look in the same scenario for an object that contains the perspective (or pareidolia) that forms the rune. There\u2019ll always be a flashing indicator informing me that something is there so I can use my focus and capture rune, symbol or image. As the game progresses, the pace also changes, so it won't be all about solving puzzles all the time.\n\n[h1]Senua\u2019s saga[/h1]\n\nI like to go through the game numerous times, the journey of which has been impressive and exciting. It's like watching a movie or reading an Edda poem or prose. The game has delightful content that\u2019s enjoyed at all times, from its narrative to its modest gameplay. It\u2019s quite lasting, especially if you die many times since the save game will be deleted if you be defeated constantly. If you haven't played it and you like games with good stories, I recommend this one. Above all, it\u2019s at a good price during sales. Without the need for DLC, the game is complete.\n\n[h1]Recommendation: 10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1695415311, "timestamp_updated": 1695415311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543012380599975586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146807029": {"recommendationid": "146807029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317741597", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 630, "last_played": 1695398385}, "language": "english", "review": "Hayat\u0131mda oynad\u0131\u011f\u0131m en etkileyici oyunlardan birisiydi... 2.

Hellblade nos narra una historia desde la perspectiva de alguien que sufre psicosis, un punto de vista totalmente original en el mundo de los videojuegos.\n\nEl punto de partida precisamente es la visi\u00f3n tanto interna desde Senua, como externa desde su propia comunidad, la psicosis, y c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 llena de estigmas y desprecio de tal forma que es desterrada por supuestamente provocar la maldici\u00f3n de su pueblo. El marco en el que nos encontramos son tierras escocesas, el pueblo picto, durante las invasiones vikingas; la mentalidad en muchos casos simple de estas sociedades hac\u00eda que el cham\u00e1n de turno se erigiera como figura onmisapiente, y era muy f\u00e1cil culpar a alguien con un padecimiento mental de los males que asolaban a los lugare\u00f1os, como si tuviera alguna culpa. A grandes rasgos, de la lucha tanto interna como externa, la culpabilidad por la muerte de las personas queridas, entre ellas su amado Dillion, y todo el universo de viaje y redenci\u00f3n por la mitolog\u00eda n\u00f3rdica trata este juego, es mejor experimentar y seguir el pilar fundamental del juego, que es su historia.\n\nComo buena parte del juego son secuencias cinem\u00e1ticas en las que veremos la reacci\u00f3n de Senua frente a todo tipo de adversidades y retos, es muy importante hacer hincapi\u00e9 en esta secci\u00f3n, el juego ha contado en todo momento con personas que sufren de psicosis y profesionales que tratan este fen\u00f3meno, siempre poniendo especial sensibilidad en no estigmatizar, pues las causas y consecuencias son muy diversas y nadie est\u00e1 indemne a sufrirlas. Senua se nos presenta como una muchacha que sufre de delirios y oye voces contradictorias, y ha sido marcada como dije antes como causante de los males de su pueblo, se siente angustia por ella cuando est\u00e1 sufriendo alg\u00fan episodio, c\u00f3mo cae presa de la desesperaci\u00f3n y el desaliento, mientras que en lev\u00edsimos momentos somos testigos de briznas de esperanza en su vida, todo ello interpretado por la actriz Melina Juergens. \n\nComo comentaba el desarrollo de la historia, su personalidad, y c\u00f3mo hace frente a su mal es el pilar fundamental del juego. Uno se siente part\u00edcipe del sufrimiento de Senua y siempre desea que pueda sobreponerse ante las adversidades tan crueles a las que se ve sometida.\n\nLa jugabilidad: nos movemos manejando a Senua por entornos lineales en tercera persona, con lugares ricos en detalles y con efectos gr\u00e1ficos espectaculares (los juegos de luces y sombras asombran as\u00ed como los efectos clim\u00e1ticos) pero demasiado lineales, con un \u00fanico camino a seguir, a veces son parajes naturales t\u00edpicos del norte, aut\u00e9nticos para\u00edsos, mientras que iremos alternando con lugares hostiles, zonas infernales y bald\u00edos e incluso las propias pesadillas y mente de Senua. El juego es bastante corto pero intenso, en unas ocho horas podremos completarlo, hay puzzles que resolver pero son f\u00e1ciles, buscar runas en las formas del entorno para abrir puertas y avanzar mediante el uso de la concentraci\u00f3n y encontrar estelas que nos relatan pasajes de la mitolog\u00eda n\u00f3rdica. En algunas ocasiones tendremos que luchar con enemigos e incluso alg\u00fan jefe final, pero los combates est\u00e1n desaprovechados, no suponen un reto incluso en la mayor dificultad y son todos iguales con los mismos enemigos.\n\nCabe rese\u00f1ar comprobado en varios equipos diferentes que la optimizaci\u00f3n no es buena, con muchas bajadas de frames y de rendimiento, en equipos que superan ampliamente los requisitos recomendados y con diferentes configuraciones.\n\nLos efectos sonoros son buenos, con un doblaje en ingl\u00e9s profesional y que realzan muy bien los momentos m\u00e1s cr\u00edticos de Senua, algunas melod\u00edas interesantes y muy relevante todos los sonidos que pueblan la mente de Senua ya sean las propias voces que la persiguen, la voz de su amado, la de sus enemigos o las de los propios dioses entre otras, resulta bastante impactante.\n\nEn definitiva lo que m\u00e1s llama la atenci\u00f3n de este t\u00edtulo y por lo que ser\u00e1 recordado no es por la jugabilidad, sino por el trasfondo que presenta, algo que en otros videojuegos ha sido planteado pero como algo sutil y sin rigor, tan solo como parte de la historia, aqu\u00ed se afronta desde un perspectiva adulta por parte tanto de personas que lo padecen como profesionales que lo estudian, teniendo en todo momento en cuenta sus opiniones, algo que puede comprobarse en un m\u00e1s que recomendable documental que acompa\u00f1a el juego; si nos salimos del planteamiento inicial tenemos pr\u00e1cticamente un corto \"walking simulator\" con puzzles sencillos y escenas de lucha mediocres, pero con buena historia y entornos espectaculares.\n\nNOTA 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1694898431, "timestamp_updated": 1694899361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580452263355255127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146424335": {"recommendationid": "146424335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163264900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1695319474}, "language": "english", "review": "good experience", "timestamp_created": 1694894491, "timestamp_updated": 1694894491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146420647": {"recommendationid": "146420647", "author": {"steamid": "76561199017452188", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 836, "last_played": 1694890361}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1694890576, "timestamp_updated": 1694890576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146416017": {"recommendationid": "146416017", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086426724", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1697822250}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than LSD", "timestamp_created": 1694885878, "timestamp_updated": 1694885878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146391224": {"recommendationid": "146391224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029229007", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 513, "last_played": 1630682119}, "language": "english", "review": "very disturbing and intense game, and the ending is even more disturbing.\nI found this game quite difficult at the beginning, the fighting mechanism is not a typical hack & slash, but it delivers once you get the hang of it.", "timestamp_created": 1694860335, "timestamp_updated": 1694860335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146382039": {"recommendationid": "146382039", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999337711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 724, "last_played": 1694847517}, "language": "english", "review": "great game!", "timestamp_created": 1694847571, "timestamp_updated": 1694847571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146381155": {"recommendationid": "146381155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103559891", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1695019116}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is good but the graphics is best.....", "timestamp_created": 1694846180, "timestamp_updated": 1694846180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146372519": {"recommendationid": "146372519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033112890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1694831767}, "language": "english", "review": "Played through this in one go: an incredibly immersive and unforgettable experience.

Got to counter balance the 'masterpiece' reviews. I don't want to be too negative because it is a well made game, the devs definitely deserve credit but..... it is tedious as hell.\n\nThe combat is atrocious, mainly consists of smashing LMB and dodging super predictable attacks. You could say it isn't a combat focused game, which I guess is true so stop throwing multiple enemies at me, especially with no target switch (i've read that mouse wheel does it subsequently but I completed before this information).\n\nPlot is unique and it has a lot of cool features like the inner voices which are useful. \n\nYou will have have to go back for the collectables... which is again, tedious. \n\nIf this was a 40+ hour story line there is no chance I would have seen it through. But it is worth a go for sure.\n\nAlso, I had serious FPS issues around water... dropping to like 15FPS at times. There isn't enough flexibility in the settings to tweak graphic settings so I had to turn it way down, which really is a shame because you can tell at high settings it would look absolutely incredible (i7 & 1080).\n\nGive it a go, it is good if not tedious at times, it is not a masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1694553149, "timestamp_updated": 1694553149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146181163": {"recommendationid": "146181163", "author": {"steamid": "76561199181202738", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1694638217}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game.", "timestamp_created": 1694541370, "timestamp_updated": 1694541370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146179573": {"recommendationid": "146179573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380064857", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 836, "last_played": 1694482574}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Los norte\u00f1os dicen que alg\u00fan d\u00eda el mundo terminar\u00e1 en lo que llaman Ragnarok, el destino de los dioses.

Perhaps this is not a good topic for an entertainment medium like computer games. Perhaps I\u2019m not the right player for such a game.

Ninja Theory has done a great job at really fleshing out the personality of their characters and drawing the player into the world, epic mythology, and Senua's struggles both within and without. I felt like I was playing a fresh telling of Dante's Inferno through a new and mythic lens. \n\nThe multiplicity of viewpoints/narratives give a true sense of Senua's inner struggle and the \"story teller's\" lore add even more to the feeling of a Dante re-telling as well as giving an overall vibe of other classic literature epics told in oral tradition.\n\nThe game-play mechanics itself were implemented very lightly in such a way to give a true realism to the adventure without any need for upgrade/crafting, skill trees, or endless item searching. This allows for full and realistic story immersion without any unnecessary added stresses. The mostly linear play-path also helps to alleviate the subconscious distractions of managing character mechanics and completionist OCD, giving full-immerse mental attention to Senua's mental state(s). I did enjoy the one \"collectible\" aspect which, although unnecessary for progression, provided and extra layer to the overall story.\n\nThe combat, though somewhat challenging at times but not truly punishing, is straightforward, realistically uncomplicated and adds the necessary edge (no pun intended) needed for the player to feel like they have a little control within the growing darkness of the overall experience. \n\nThe perspective based puzzle system is amazing! Some were easy to solve, others took a while but in all it proved to be a mystically vivid and rewarding experience!!\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing!! The depth and precision to both music, world ambiance, and \"aural effects\" are what makes the entire experience so visceral and gripping! This is definitely a game to play with headphones in the dark, it will keep you on the edge of your seat!!!\n\nIn all, this game is definitely a labor of love. The real-life development process used really captures everything the developers were hoping for and more. The actors really gave their all to this project, knowing how to pull the right heartstrings at the right time.\n\nI am still on the edge of my seat after this game, waiting with great anticipation for it's squeal. This will be one of the very few games to stay on my computer for as long as I have one as I feel it's more than just a game, this is truly an epic tale.\n\nThanks Ninja Theory, you have renewed my faith in \"good\" gaming, projects like this are the future.", "timestamp_created": 1693885864, "timestamp_updated": 1693885864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145687199": {"recommendationid": "145687199", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995398092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 891, "last_played": 1693877520}, "language": "english", "review": "I HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!! BUT ... YOU SHOULD BUY IT\n\nFIrst and foremost let's give it a 10/10 for graphics. This game is beautiful and ahead of its time when first made and even better after the enhanced patch came through for the graphics that in 2023, it holds up very well and will continue to do so for years to come. But why will you also hate this game as much as I do? Because it simply will drive you nuts with the puzzles. These are not clever puzzles but simply simple puzzles but the way they are put together is: \"Okay, here is the solution to solve this stage and open the door but now let's add a whole bunch of unuseful add ons in the scene to the puzzle itself to make it really frustratingly confusing so that you never want to play our game ever again. We already got your money so who cares.\" I never finished the game and probably never will because the puzzles are so frustrating. Then, I delete the game and wont touch it for a year or two. Then I redownload the game to realize why I hate it so much. This is a game if you do not play it constantly, you WILL forget everything. Absolutely horrible. The hours I put in is not because I love this game but simply me walking around trying to figure out the stupid puzzles. The game is a linear game but don't compare this to Tomb Raider's puzzles. Tomb Raider's puzzles are clever and designed in a way where you can always remember even if time has elapsed why I continuously play the Tomb Raider's series over the years because the games simply are fun and clever. This game, when I see other players on YouTube re-download it then I'm like gonna give it another shot to just realize myself why I play it then stop because the puzzles are horrible. Horrible as what you may ask? After you solve a puzzle you're like ... \"Ahhh how stupid now that I solved this puzzle because it was so easy then you ask yourself why were all these dumb things in the way then?\" You solve a puzzle and it doesn't make you proud, it makes you feel stupid to hate the game. And that's what I mean that these puzzles are not clever but simply not well thought through. if the graohics were horrible, I'd never recommend this game to anyone.\n\nShould you buy it? Yes. Should you play it? Only if you are ready to hate this game as much as I do and also continue to play it constantly so you don't forget anything. Other than that, skip it entirely and go play Tomb Raider. And if part II has more clever puzzles then buy part II and just play it without never playing part I because part II will reference enough, you will know part I.\n\nI am a counselor as is my profession and this game does represent well what happens to people who suffer from mental illness or trauma. The solutions are easy but it is all the unnecessary things one puts as purpuseful hurdles in their minds that they never get to the solution until they do. Or, never heal from mental illness or trauma. But, to the credit of Ninja Theory, if thatbis what they were going for then they succeeded at making me and millions of people hate their game. it's a game and not a counseling session that will be a lifetime. I just wished the puzzles were more clever and not fatigued from an individual who struggles with mental illness or trauma, and made the players fatigue with them. The graphics is amazing and the acting splendid. But, it is a game I will never complete unfortunately and that very much disappoints me as I want to play games to complete it.\n\nAll right, honest review and hopes it helps and hopes Ninja Theory reads it to go \"Damn, point taken.\"", "timestamp_created": 1693879858, "timestamp_updated": 1693879858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145681239": {"recommendationid": "145681239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045669083", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 514, "last_played": 1693869218}, "language": "english", "review": "It's totally a masterpiece, give it a try if you are mentally stable.

Let me get the rating out of the way first... an easy 10/10. \nThis game deserves so much more love and attention from the gaming community.

But beware, for your reality changes as does your perception as you slowly get consumed by the dark. This game does a masterful job at portraying some of the aspects of a psychotic mind and weaves a brilliant plot with you as the main plot thread. \n\nThe elements of Nordic and psychological horror were displayed so well, it truly makes one think twice before taking the next step. The music/soundtrack rarely suits a game so well, as it weaves itself into the experience. The combat sections are fairly straightforward in nature, but can get really difficult at times which adds caution to the wind. Every element of this game ties well with the other elements creating this seamless experience that makes one question reality and makes the gamer more aware of psychosis and their victims.\n\nI can walk away from this game saying that I am a changed man. This game leaves you with heavy, emotional and cerebral baggage as it should. I can only hope for this being the first step towards a more inclusive and exploratory gaming world, using the extremely flexible medium of games to retell stories that couldn't have been told otherwise.\n\nKudos to NinjaTheory!", "timestamp_created": 1693765048, "timestamp_updated": 1693765048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145606572": {"recommendationid": "145606572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329294019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1693853476}, "language": "english", "review": "is good", "timestamp_created": 1693761343, "timestamp_updated": 1693761343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145592286": {"recommendationid": "145592286", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989747608", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1693746905}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegardo", "timestamp_created": 1693746924, "timestamp_updated": 1693746924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145588241": {"recommendationid": "145588241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982829385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1693742332}, "language": "english", "review": "The story telling of the game is mindblowing , boss fights and other combat system is decent, and the whole plot of the game is very beautiful.

As someone who dealt with the subject myself via a loved one, I can tell how much work went into this game to portray it accurately. There is even a small \"Making Of\" documentary in the game, showing the great lengths that were taken to make this game as accurately terrifying as possible, highlighting the depths of this illness while following Senua on a quest to save her loved one from Hel.\n\nThe game's audiovisual presentation is astounding, with voices talking to you every step, from every angle. It really immerses you in the game and in the condition it is portraying. The environments are gorgeous, the voice acting is great and you can never go wrong with Norse and Celtic mythology.\n\nThe game does, however, lack a bit in the gameplay department. The game essentially consists of walking, an occasional sequence where you have to run fast, fights and rune puzzles. The rune puzzles have you find objects in the environment that look like specific runes. It's fun at first, but gets old very quickly as you have to do it a lot. There are one or two other interesting puzzles, but they are just used once and then it's back to finding runes.\n\nThe fights are very one-dimensional, and while they're never too bad or hard, they are a bit frustrating in the control department. The camera locks onto seemingly random enemies, based on whether they are attacking or not, and so the fights lack a bit of control which makes some hits unavoidable. Later on, you unlock an ability to slow down time, which makes it a lot better. The bosses mix things up a bit with their own patterns and tactics.\n\nSure, the game is primarily a walking simulator; but there is gameplay to interrupt the walking, and it's a mixed bag as mentioned. Still, it's easily looked past; Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is one of the most impressive games I've played in years when it comes to presentation, the sensible tackling of a difficult subject matter and the evolution of games as a storytelling medium.

Overall, I enjoyed this game.\n\nWhile there are many aspects of this game that I like, I can't overlook the issues that hurt my experience while playing it. My biggest issue being the bugs. Multiple bugs while completing puzzles AND during fights that forced me to restart the game and lose progress. The Beast boss fight didn't even register fully so I stood there taking hits, unable to equip my sword or dodge (or die. I had to restart the game). Very clunky fighting style and the auto combat lock-on is just straight up irritating. On top of that, the camera angles would shit itself during a fight and I would be staring at a pillar until I died. I think the combat has a lot of potential if it was properly utilized for PC and overall far less annoying.\n\nBut even with all of these issues I experienced, I think the games holds up well mostly due to the story and visuals.

In various parts of the game there is no doubling back. Combat at times can get repetitive. But at least there are two categories of attacks - standing and running which helps keeps things interesting. Block timing and knowing when to dodge is important. There are no manual game saves, just event or location triggered saves. The good news the location triggered saves can be repetitively used.\n\nGraphics are excellent. Two obvious spots will take away from the experience. Walking on puddles produces sound, but no visual effect. And on the cave level the torch can clip into the walls, which interacts in a way to remove the torchlight.

Ayudaran en combate y aportaran mucho a la historia, generaran distintas sensaciones al jugador y crearan una diferente experiencia de juego la cual sera increible.\n\nEl juego aparte de una increible banda sonora y graficos que estan muy bien optimizados para que cualquiera pueda jugar cuenta con una excelente dificultad, haciendo que algunas batallas no sean tan faciles (algo importante e increible del juego es una mecanica de permadeath, a pesar de que el juego no es tan largo y no es muy facil morir, tendremos la posibilidad de perder la partida dependiendo de la cantidad de veces que nuestro personaje muera en el juego, no solo causando el miedo a morir sino tambien un cambio fisico que se hara presente en el personaje en base a cuanto pierdas) y unos puzzles entretenidos y con su complejidad.\n\nCreo que no hay mucho de que hablar de este juego, es un trabajo impresionante para tratarse de un juego indie, fue galardonado por las criticas y gano premios bien merecidos, aunque por algun motivo no parece tener mucho valor por parte de los usuarios, si bien tiene grandes criticas por esa parte no es muy tenido en cuenta cuando se hablan de juegos indies o infravalorado al momento de hablar de juegos del estilo. Sus graficos y puzzles, ademas de un increible sistema de peleas (el cual lamentablemente no es tan aprovechado en el juego) son bastantes destacables.\n\nLa historia esta muy buena la cual queda abierta para siguientes entregas, un personaje increiblemente desarrollado y que (probablemente) sea mejor en las siguientes entregas. No tengo mucho para decir de esta joya, se convirtio de mis juegos favoritos y su duracion, graficos, historias, desarrollo, entretenimiento, etc...\n\n[quote=Hakita] 10/10 [/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1690760526, "timestamp_updated": 1690760526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143106733": {"recommendationid": "143106733", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999155882", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 981, "last_played": 1690748754}, "language": "english", "review": "Draws you right in and leaves you with your own voices in the head.\nI think this is not only a game, but with all the people that after this game will get understood.\nIt is a step into letting more know what mental problems are about.\nThank you for not only making a good game but something that actually helps people.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690749260, "timestamp_updated": 1690749260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143100281": {"recommendationid": "143100281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129224130", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1690741525}, "language": "english", "review": "the audio is superb\neverything about this game is actually\nbuy it!", "timestamp_created": 1690741896, "timestamp_updated": 1690741896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143089223": {"recommendationid": "143089223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346150323", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1690729949}, "language": "english", "review": "Good narrative game.

I usually have problems with this such that Playstation games have a tendency to just w a l k for the sake of immersion. But here walking is used to the effect of the writing, where you're often digesting and taking in the world within the complexity of Senua as a character. When it comes to combat, I enjoyed most of it. Much of the combos felt rewarding and they're nicely evened out with the narrative to make them feel fun. However, the lock-on system it uses can get more frustrating as you fight more enemies toward the end. I'm not gonna say thematically whether or not it was designed to feel that way. But it would've been nice to have more control around switching targets.\n\nStory (2/2): Story gets a 100. You feel like you never get to know Senua as she's continuously unpacking trauma, listening to ASMR voices talk all about you or history. It's interesting, and completely contrasts something of the new Marvel-esque God of War series. While those are much more active and action oriented, this is like A24. Senua is a grounded believable character with a broken world whose chasing the lost voices of her loved ones. Constantly being reminded of 'the darkness'. Turn off your lights and just take it in one night.\n\nWriting (1.75/2): The writing, while structurally felt rewarding and enthralling, did sometimes bug me. I don't have all that much to gripe. It's mostly just 'the darkness' being a narrative element that is said probably 200+ times? Eh whatever.\n\nVisuals (1.75/2): The visuals felt very mundane, hopeless, tragic, and at times terrifying. It successfully delivers on conveying this broken world. Graphics being very amazing for running on Unreal Engine 4, maybe as best as they ever would be? I ran them on the highest settings. Just find a guide and turn off motion blur- it makes the experience 10x better.\n\nAudio (2/2): Ok the score and sound effects work brilliantly. Score is sparingly used but when it happens, you feel like shit is going down. Most of the time the sound used within the story's world- posses the same hopeless theme I talk about.

Though I will say a little. It is a third-person shooter in essence, narrating the story of a viking warrior who ventures into a semi-hallucinated Nordic hellscape, seeking to rescue her dead fiance's soul; if I understood that part correctly. The game has been heavily marketed on its portrayal of psychosis in the protagonist - the character that we play as - but for me at least, it did not leave any striking or lasting impression. I forgot about the game pretty quickly after I finished playing the story. \n\nThe game-play is structured around two main elements. The first is solving visual puzzles with the help of ritualistic-looking portals that lets the player see different spaces around them, opening or closing up. One has to use these portals and the 'focus' mechanic to collect clues and open up spaces to move ahead to different areas, each of which takes the character closer to the final encounter with the Goddess Hela, in whose grasp, lies the soul of the protagonist's fiance. The second main element is the combat where the player encounters enemies of a few different kinds, all of whom have patterns of armed melee attacks that you can parry, dodge and attack back when you have the chance. It is not too difficult. Also, the 'focus' mechanic allows you to occasionally slow down time so that is a superpower of sorts to quickly dispatch off minor enemies and bosses as well. \n\nI found the voices that haunt Senua at most times helpful, funny and even annoying at times than distressing or disturbing. The brief cut-scenes of her frustration and tiredness in dealing with these voices really did not seem to match up with what they actually do and how they function in the game. I suppose that the voices are the central element of psychosis that the developers have tried to incorporate in the game but I found it neither compelling nor immersive. It is just a background annoyance for the most part. \n\nThe story is okay; nothing special in my opinion and even though they have done a great job with the voice-acting and some of the characters - such as Druth and Senua's father whose dialogues are central to the narrative - it did not really pull me in, at least in terms of sympathizing with Senua's struggle with psychosis. They do tell a story but the game is more concerned with showing how she overcomes the voices rather than going deeper into the dynamism and struggles associated with psychotic experience. Senua's mutterings, dialogues and expressions of angst in the cut-scenes are barely passable in terms of an effort at portraying psychotic experience and I feel, are nothing more than the usual Hollywood fare. Also, I was not impressed with her facial expressions. Apparently a lot of work was put into it but it is unnecessary for the purpose of showing distress, suffering or struggle. Like the voices that she hears, her expressions were inadvertently comical in parts. Nevertheless, it is clear that they did put some effort so I wouldn't really want to be too harsh in that regard but it is what it is. \n\nThe music is generic. Again, possibly more thought could have put into exemplifying her struggle than rushing to resolve it into a story of her (albeit partial I must note) triumph.\n\nOverall, the game is not bad and a reasonable experience, although worth only if you get it on sale. I would not buy this for full price. I hope the second game is an improvement and if the psychosis is ultimately only a side-narrative or a minor part of the game, I suggest they be clear about that rather than making it seem like the game is primarily about a character dealing with psychosis. It is not. I think there are horror titles that can and have done much better in that department i.e. of simulating and portraying mental illness and neuro-divergent experiences.

It is an authentic representation of the very disordered state of mental health of the character we embody. [Spoiler-free] Senua, the main character, suffers from psychosis, which is perceptible right from the start, voices accompany us on our adventure from the very first scene (main reason why it is recommended to wear headphones during the entire game). \n\nWhich brings me to the soundscape, and more specifically the voices in Senua's head, as this is one of the points that impressed me most in my playthrough: voice acting. It is like an additional immersion provided by the developers, putting yourself in the shoes of someone suffering from psychosis, hearing the voices as they would hear them, whether during combat and emotional moments, or even alone.. in the middle of apocalyptic landscapes. This adds an oppressive, distressing and uncomfortable atmosphere, in perfect harmony with the story, the characters' mentality and the scenery. \n\nThe gameplay itself is immersive, thanks to the absence of HUD, which lets the player concentrate fully on the visuals (a delight for the eyes, the graphics are amazing!), and the combat mode, which I found satisfying if slightly repetitive. Collectibles are present and bring short stories to boot - nothing to do with the main quest - but I see it as bonus lore for mythology enthusiasts. Definitely worth seeking out and taking an interest in (each of them have a nightmarish, tragic side). \n\nLast but not least, the puzzles. These little trials and tribulations have put a lot of people off the game.. Personally, I had no problem with them - I've encountered this type of mechanic before in other games, and they're not complicated to get to grips with - but I have to admit that some areas can be frustrating and even ambiguous (it's hard to find your bearings at times). \n\nIn short, Hellblade is perfect for fans of immersive, dark atmosphere games full of lore, mixing creatures referencing Norse mythology, Vikings, family ties and mental health.", "timestamp_created": 1690161641, "timestamp_updated": 1690162079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142664544": {"recommendationid": "142664544", "author": {"steamid": "76561199195537508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1131, "last_played": 1673705906}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, fantastic game!!

You probably know what this game is about reading the description, watching trailers and reading other reviews, so I'll share my personal thoughts on my experience.\n\nI was expecting a very narrative experience and this nails it. The game is beautiful to look at and hyper realistic, with just a few things here and there breaking the illusion. I liked the story, the acting is really good and overall the depiction of mental illness feels genuine and respectful even if at some points, it's hard to know for someone with little to no knowledge of mental illness that what's happening is in fact that and not an element of a fantasy game.\n\nThe gameplay is serviceable, I liked the puzzles, not really difficult and some of them barely count as puzzles and more like, find this image somewhere. The combat is a little lackluster though; although I liked a lot of it, being able to string different attacks and make some really cool looking combos, it was also frustrating at time, with the camera being so close to the character that you're unaware of your surroundings, a lot of the challenges in combat weren't even the enemies sometimes, but just trying to get a sense of your surroundings and the placement of the camera.\n\nMy final thoughts are this: I feel like I'm between liking and nearly loving the game. It does strike a really good balance between letting me progress and enjoy the story which is intriguing enough that makes you want to know it, but being kind of frustrating and not really \"fun\" to play. What I mean by \"not fun\" is mainly, if I wanted to replay it for fun, the gameplay it's not really the biggest draw, the puzzles are not going to be challenging a second time, there's not much exploration outside of the main story and the combat is not good enough to make me want to play it again, but it's also kind of scarce with some chapters having no combats at all. And with the cutscenes being unskippable, thinking about playing it just for fun just isn't the most enjoyable experience.\n\nI think if I wanted to replay it, it would have to be after a good time just if I want to go over the whole experience again, but as something I'd like to do just to have fun fighting norsemen or solving puzzles, this just isn't it.", "timestamp_created": 1690080466,

Hellblade makes excellent use of very subtle elements to immerse the player in the experience, and to provide just a small, personal glimpse of what the protagonist is experiencing.\n\n\ud83c\udfaeHellblade can be played adequately with both keyboard/mouse and controller.\ud83c\udfae\n-Gameplay-\nCombat:\nI played on the \u201cAuto\u201d difficulty setting, which made enemy and player health vary somewhat between fights.\n\nHellblade isn't really a fighting game, so combat is fairly sparse. When it does occur, I found it to be a mixed bag. Combat controls are fairly basic; you have a light attack, heavy attack, shove, block/parry, dodge and a special contextual ability. These are quite satisfying to use and have very nice animations, though the targeting system can be a burden.\n\nSenua never loses the will to fight, even when reality has twisted into her own personal hell.\u00a0\nA Screenshot of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\nBy: Spobbles\n\nThe game camera automatically locks on to whichever enemy is attacking Senua, and cannot be unlocked. Players can manually switch between targets, but it's still quite awkward sometimes, especially in confined spaces.\n\nThere are a small variety of enemies with different attacks, which is enough to keep combat interesting, though their spawning can be an issue. Enemies will spawn in set places in the combat area, even if the player is standing on that exact spot. This can lead to Senua getting whacked before the enemy has even fully spawned in, which is annoying considering she can be quite squishy.\n\nOne aspect of the game's combat I particularly liked was the hints and cues given by the voices in Senua's head. They will often yell \u201cBehind you!\u201d or \u201cHe's finished!\u201d. It's a clever bit of design, and one that fits very well.\n\nLevel Design:\nLevels in Hellblade are linear and often feature clever puzzle elements. A prominent one requires players to use aspects of the environment to form a symbol that matches the one present on a door. This can be debris viewed from the correct angle, a shadow cast on a wall, and more. I very much enjoyed it every time it appeared in the game.\n\nAt some points Senua backtracks through previously explored areas, which provides a stark contrast; where her original journey was twisted by her psychosis to make areas dark and foreboding, the return trip presents a warm and peaceful atmosphere.\n\n-Story-\nHellblade's focus is entirely on Senua's psychosis. Ever-present voices follow her, judging, scolding and encouraging, and they're all hers. Senua's goal is to save the soul of her deceased lover Dillion, and she travels through battlefields, mental and literal, to reach the goddess Hela, whom she believes holds his soul.\n\nThroughout the story, Senua suffers severe symptoms of her psychosis such as vivid hallucinations in which she witnesses everything from changes in the environment to people and events from her memories manifesting before her eyes. These provide backstory on Senua and the events of her past, offering insight into the factors influencing her severe mental illness.\n\nSubtle efforts are made to trigger an emotional response to in-game events, for example, one section of the game features darkness that will kill Senua should she stay in it for too long. To avoid this, she carries a torch. Upon entering a dark area, one of the voices shouts \u201cThe torch is going out!\u201d.\n\nThis instils a moment of panic in the player; fear of a danger, though maybe there never really was one. This reflects Senua's psychosis; her fear of the horrible experiences that aren't really happening.\n\nHellblade's story and themes are fascinating, bizarre, scary and beautiful at the same time, and make for a truly unique experience in an interesting world inspired by Celtic culture and Norse mythology. I'm left wondering if Senua's world is really a fantasy one with monsters and gods, or if it's all just her perception of it, influenced by her culture and beliefs.\n\nFumbling in the dark, while standing in the bright light of day; Senua's psychosis warps her reality.\u00a0\nA Screenshot of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\nBy: Spobbles\n\nVisuals:\nHellblade is a very pretty game, with beautifully crafted environments and great atmosphere. A particular aspect I was very impressed by was the sense of temperature; in one instance, Senua was exploring a pleasant grassy area in warm sunlight, only for it to suddenly shift to cold and overcast. The contrast almost made me shiver.\n\nSenua's character model and animations are excellent. A lot of time is spent looking at her face in cutscenes, and her expressions and facial detail are outstanding, as are the detail and physics on her hair.\n\nSenua's perception of reality can change in an instant.\u00a0\nA Screenshot of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\nBy: Spobbles\n\nDespite being very pretty, there were some aspects of the graphics I didn't like as much. Film grain and motion blur are quite heavy and do not have corresponding settings in the game options. I assume this is due to the effects being part of the artistic vision, and the way the developer intended the game to be experienced.\n\nRegarding the U.I, I took issue with the lack of button prompts; the game does not teach the player the buttons or when to use them. I realise on-screen prompts aren't good for immersion, but I missed an optional lore item in the beginning of the game because I didn't even know that I could interact with it, let alone how to do it. Only upon coming to a ladder and nothing happening did I realise I'd have to work it out myself.\n\nSome of it can be learned by looking at the keybinds in the options menu, but other aspects are more obscure. For example, when Senua is knocked down in combat, players can repeatedly press a button to make her get up and keep fighting before she is killed. I did not know this during my entire playthrough, and only discovered it when doing research for this review.\n\nPerformance:\nUsing the specs listed above, I got a stable 60fps on high settings, though something about the game's graphics often made it feel like it was running rough, as if I were only getting 40fps.\n\nAudio:\nHellblade's audio design is outstanding. Music is subtle and fits the atmosphere perfectly, voice acting is superb and the binaural audio is incredible with headphones. The voices can whisper right in your ears, creating a chilling and unsettling experience, and adding another level of immersion.\n\nIssues:\nI encountered a couple of annoying bugs during my playthrough; the first being the game not saving after I exited on one occasion, leading to me having to do a boss fight twice. The second was mechanics triggering incorrectly in said boss fight, which was fixed by a trip to the main menu and back.\n\n-Summary-\nHellblade is a unique and beautiful game. The storytelling and audio design are outstanding, and its exploration of the subject matter is fascinating and unsettling. The combat is rough around the edges, but puzzles are unique and enjoyable, and the game's length felt appropriate.\n\nThis game is work of art, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in the themes it embodies.", "timestamp_created": 1689817149, "timestamp_updated": 1689817149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594134151935577393", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142434408": {"recommendationid": "142434408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174964985", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1688524320}, "language": "english", "review": "Serious Trigger Warnings, this game is brutal;\nBitter. Horrifying. Difficult to sit through (but so much more than worth it). Heart rending and achingly beautiful. A dark tale, though not a new one. One as old as humans have been cognisant (that of the quest into the underworld to save a slain love and the redemption of truly letting go) but here told with a specific message in mind, and delivered with cold, cutting precision in an incredibly innovative way. The Dev's treatment of psychosis, childhood trauma, it's symptoms, suicide, the stages of grief, repressed memories, and the way it's all worked through a historical Norse narrative and perspective. Not for the faint of heart, or those that might struggle coping with those kinds of themes, because it is utterly unflinching in it's portrayal and it's uncomfortable to watch, even from the perspective of someone who hasn't dealt with many of the issues it looks at. \nIt was designed to show the perspective of a woman from the very north of Ireland (The \"Orkney Plains\"), a time long ago, dealing with what we would currently call psychosis, after childhood abuse and the horrific murder of the lover (that saved her) and her entire village, done at the hands of \"the Northmen\", and her subsequent journey into the underworld to try and save him. She is even guided by a Virgil like figure known as Druth, an old man with terrible burns that she saved, finding him in the wilds, who died after telling her his stories about being slave to the Northmen, and how he himself had escape Hel. \nShe has heard voices all her life, and they speak to you constantly. You HAVE to play with headphones. The first time I played it on PS4 without headphones and it was fantastic. This time, I played it on PC WITH headphones on and by all the dice gods, the experience could not be more different. The voices are an eerie, accurate, non stop and strange experience, making things incredibly intimate, and had me looking over my shoulder more than one. The intro is... Well. I got goosebumps. Chilling doesn't even come close. \nThey even had Doctors and people who had dealt with psychosis as play testers to make it as accurate as they could. It lies to you about mechanics, gives you no tutorial, and you have to learn button presses by experimentation in the original (all in order to mimic the way people with psychosis find everything alien and unfamiliar), but the PC update has the buttons in the start menu in game for accessibility, same with being able to change the fight difficulty levels. Honestly, I've never played anything like it. It is utterly unique. \nIt is absolutely art, and it's a fucking masterpiece. Everyone should play it at least once, if they can. \nAlso, the OST is incredible. And I cried a couple times.\nAnd not at the OST. \nIt's also unbearably gorgeous, with great optimisation as an added bonus. The levels are spectacularly designed and really well set out, made with obvious intent and shocking amounts of care taken to increase the enjoyment of the experience. But considering how tight the rest of the game is, this isn't that surprising.\nA Dev team that set out with a specific story to tell, and created something that was way more special than I think even they first realised.\n(Hint without spoilers: MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERY LORE STONE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO USE A SPOILER-LESS GUIDE!

Now i regret not playing it sooner.\nMany people call it a masterpiece, and i kinda agree.\n\nBefore anything, the game is made with 3D sound, so you should use headphones as the Devs intended!\nI didn't, and i felt like i was missing out. (5.1 sound system wasn't good enough)\n\nAlright, on to it.\nit is a very slow paced, story-driven game with some easy puzzles to complete before you can continue, but in a way that works very well.\nI found myself walking rather than running a lot of the time, it just feels good., But i guess you could easily shave of an hour by running, so expect 6 hours to complete it rather than my 7 if you care about such things.\n\nIt is a linear game(my preference), with some side paths if you want to find Lore stones, which i found to be worth it because Norse stories are damn awesome. (The stories are being told, you don't read yourself. very nice) - There might be a little treat in it for you if you find them all. The kind of treat you won't notice unless you know. (''true ending'' some have chosen to call it) .. It doesn't change anything, just an additional lore cutscene before the end. Don't sweat it if you don't enjoy the stories.\n\nThe combat feels super nice and smooth, but you can't change focus to other targets, which can lead to a bit of frustration in some fights, but it's not extremely horrible. (maybe you can change target and i just didn't find it.. The game doesn't tell you how to do anything)\nMaybe i should have looked and the control settings, but i enjoyed only knowing how to do things i found out myself, so i didn't. \n\nThe camera movement was a little laggy, i would guess because it was made for console, but then i got used to it (focused differently) and just enjoyed the game. (tried some different settings to fix it, was unsuccessful)\n\nI love Norse mythology, and this game did it very well.\nYou will need patience, and the ability to just enjoy the world and story, or it might be too slow for you.\nBut if you can manage the patience, it is really really good.\n\nSo sit down with a nice warm cup of Yorkshire Gold, and let it be your favorite game on the Citadel.\n\nI can't wait for Hellblade 2 now.

I was excited because I was basing my assumption of the final boss off the previous bosses which, like I said were really cool and were the highlight of the game for me, personally. What you're actually met with at the end of the game is an endless wave of the same 5 enemies that you fight throughout the game where you're actually expected to die.\nI was fine with the main character \"losing\" in the end, but there wasn't even an attempt at fighting the final boss directly. Just fighting an endless wave of cookie cutter enemies directly into an ending cutscene.

My only complaint is that some of the game mechanics can get a bit boring or repetitive ex. combat, but overall the game is super fun. While the story may seem a bit slow to some at the beginning, it picks up a lot later on and has a spectacular ending. Senua's backstory and her journey are both very compelling. I also strongly appreciate the care put into this game and the choices made in regards to how to portray the taboo topic of psychosis. Usually don't like watching extras but I would strongly recommend watching the hellblade feature when you're finished the game, I feel like it gives you a deeper appreciation for the care that went into this game :) this was such a good game and such a cool concept!

However, I personally wouldn't really recommend it as I found it quite cumbersome to play. The combat felt awkward as you cannot simply disengage from a target so you can move around the combat area freely. Also, this game does not hold your hand at all. Before playing, you should look at what the controls are in the options menu because you will get thrown into combat and have no idea what to do.  Puzzles at first were not self explanatory. At a certain point I felt defeated when I had to google some of the puzzles because I just didn't catch onto the rune concept. Once understood it wasn't an issue, but I personally felt like the game didn't really explain what it wanted the player to do. I suppose that could be part of the design as this game does enjoy messing with the player. The story overall wasn't really my taste. However psychosis isn't usually considered a pleasant form of mental illness, therefore maybe the reason I didn't enjoy the story was because I didn't like the chaos of being in the mind of one with psychosis.

I miss games that dropped you into the unknown and you had to learn and intuit your way through the game instead of a big neon sign pointing the direction where to go or which button to press.  The audio is just as fantastic as the visuals, which are unbelievably good for a game from 2017.\n\nThe combat is alright, personally I found it very easy.  Even putting combat difficulty to hard, I found you can breeze through most enemies, they are slow, telegraph their moves very blatantly and your counter + dodge will allow you to chain moves together to carve up enemies.  Ultimately it does get very repetitive, which ends up being the game's biggest weakness.  You don't really gain any new combat techniques and abilities, which you never really need to due to the simplicity of the enemies attack patterns, but as the game progresses, every fight is just an obstacle that pads out the game and doesn't add anything.  The sole exception is obtaining Gramr, which is a well timed upgrade both narrative and gameplay-wise.  You'll gain some new attacks that allow you to buzzsaw through enemies, which at this point of the game offsets the swarms of enemies the game throws your way.  You feel like you've really levelled up in the game finally, as Senua's resolve is galvanized, so are your powers.\n\nDon't come into this game expecting a DMC game, Ninja Gaiden, God of War etc, combat is the bread and butter of those games.

I'm running it on a Ryzen 3, 2200g, with 16GB ram, and it's smooth enough when roaming casually\u2014fps drops when facing multiple enemies. The Puzzles are too crap for me, sorry; You'd have to pay attention to precise details and roam around the map with focus to understand the clues and the positions of unlocking the gates. The whispering of voices while progressing the game is great, it adds a bit of depth to its dark atmosphere. The default game difficulty is set to auto, which I don't understand how it works. I think the only thing that is a big deal to me is that Senua doesn't have a HUD for her HP, stamina, and ability, including her foes; I feel like this game should really need a UI for it.

The story is very compelling, and the creators went above and beyond in creating a holistic and accurate representation of mental illness. Enough good can not be said about it on that front. If you are grading on story and story telling alone, it is a total 10/10. \nSame for the visuals - even as a somewhat \"older\" game (writing this in 2023) the the game still looks stunning. The environments are immersive and many are absolutely terrifying (in particular that one trial in the swamp, iyky). The mocap I think is particularly good for when the game was made, and in particularly I really enjoyed how they used actual live action actors in some instances of Senua's delusions/hallucinations. It was a very neat effect and heightened the sense that these are unreal visions or existing outside the \"real\" world (or that they're perhaps more real than the world Senua is existing in...however you want to see it). \nThe only weakness for me was the gameplay itself. I enjoyed the puzzles quite a bit, even if there are really only four or maybe five different types of puzzles you encounter, the way they're utilized and altered to fit the different environments keeps it interesting enough for me. The major drawback imo is the combat. The mechanics of it are a bit clunky, but ultimately it is EXTREMELY repetitive. It started to feel like a chore more than a challenge about halfway through the game, especially considering the way they decided to up the challenge is just to throw more and more enemies at you at one time for longer and longer stretches. I know you need SOME combat to keep a certain level of tension up, but for me it just got so boring that it detracted from the overall experience.\nThat said, I would 100% still recommend this game. If you are a fan of story-driven games like TLoU and things in that vein, then you will enjoy this immensely. It's emotional, deeply terrifying, and ultimately rewarding.", "timestamp_created": 1688872123, "timestamp_updated": 1688872123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141646546": {"recommendationid": "141646546", "author": {"steamid": "76561199167798935", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 513, "last_played": 1688860045}, "language": "english", "review": "STORY:\n- Amazing really had me hooked on the world and the lore something i'm not used to doing.\n- The level designs are insanely creative and I loved the puzzles they were a bit difficult to wrap my head around but once 2 hrs in i pretty much could somewhat figure it out on my own.\n- The combat is simple and not overly complex to understand and really just fits well with the pacing of the story\n\nGRAPHICS:\n- The game has a lot of potential definitely not well rounded YET, occasional stuttering and texture blur but hopefully someday all that will be fine tuned and it will be a smooth gaming experience.\n- I played the game on my desktop which has a i7 13700k and 3080  at 1440p completely maxed with ray tracing and no DLSS visually was OK definitely needed polishing but very playable and enjoyable.

The game is a scam PC port of a game made for consoles in mind from the beggining to end of development and many things just doesn't work right. In less than 2 hours of gameplay, you will have a combat where 2 enemies attack you at the same time (instead of one spawning only when you kill the first). In this scenario, what will happen is that the game automatically locks the camera onto one of the enemies and it can happens things like you're fighting against 1 of the enemies and you can't see see other enemy and this one attacks you and you receive all the damage since you couldn't have dodged or parry because you couldn't see him. AND THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM because the game tells you at the beggining that if you die too many times ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED AND YOU WILL HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN, and guess what, THAT IS ALSO A BIG ISSUE since you can't skip cinematics AND THIS GAME IS FULL OF THEM, AND EACH ONE OF THEM IS WAY TOO LONG. Imagine to have to suffer all of that just because the combat of the game is not technically well developed. Also the other 50% of the content of the game are \"puzzles\" that are so simple and easy that it's crystal clear that it's there just for FILLER, otherwise the game would be very short. The menu/ui desing it's mediocre and terrible, it's literally a low opacity black screen with white text over it with the default font. I'm pretty sure they knew this game was horrible and made just for the money and I'll tell you why; Along the game you will control Senua, our protagonist, wich suffers from schitzophrenia and it's constantly hearing voices in her head. The game puts lot of emphasis in this fact, at the point that when you open the game you see a disclaimer telling that for this game they had an expert who interviewed people who actually suffers from this psychological issue in real life. However, this is just a smoke screen to try to hide the fact that they just used something like schitzophrenia to envolve the game in a pretentious aura of deepness, but it's not, it's just another filler as the puzzles. I find pretty disrespectful that they used schitzophrenia just for selling a mediocre unfinished combat game. It's disrespectful to all the people in the world that suffers from schitzophrenia, all the suffering the had to go through converted just into a sellout piece of shit like if was nothing. As my final thought I wanna say that I don't understand why the majority of people just haven't realized about all of this. I bought the game thinking it was good because of the review state on Steam was pretty positive, however after playing it I realized how rushed for a quick buck it is and I wished that there were any review saying any of these. This is literally the first actual negative review that tells you what you will find in this game and why you should not buy it. This game is a scam, is disrespectful and no one is telling you that. I already asked for a refund and I'm truly sorry about all the console players that not only just can't get a refund but also had to pay way more for the same game, since the prices of videogames in consoles are always way more expensive that in PC, even if it's a game also released on PC, maybe that explains why this game constantly feels like it was designed for consoles in mind. Just another mediocre PC port of a mediocre videogame. Save yourself some time and money and do not buy/play this game.

The portrayal of mythological ideas in a way that feels tangible to the human experience is great too.\n\nThe entire experience can be wrapped in 10 hours or less and feels like just enough. The presentation might be AA but makes up for it in a commitment to direction. \n\nOver all, highly enjoyed the experience and think it is well worth the playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1688577381, "timestamp_updated": 1688577381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514333724975585938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141384856": {"recommendationid": "141384856", "author": {"steamid": "76561199218582597", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 456, "last_played": 1688576126}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly an amazing game, The story, the cinematics and the gameplay especially the combat i loved it, and its my first ever Psychological game, i will play the sequel.

So I go to pour some booze and drink and play. Then I decided maybe getting high would be better. So I bought an edible and about 2 hours into it I am so utterly bored by the gameplay. Finding and lining up runes? So lame. I don't mind the jogging around slowly. I think it fits well with the game cinematically. But the controls are clunky and small rocks stop you. Then there's the fighting. Looks great! But it's dull and repetitive. The trickster boss was awkward and it took me a while to figure out to use my eagle vision to slow time. Which brings me to another point. There's no tutorial at all. Anybody new to games might struggle. I only got with it because I'm familiar with controls and their general button mappings to things in game was fairly standard. And further on that, there's pop up on interactable things in the world. Like opening doors or climbing ladders. I only knew to press the A Button because I was being predictive in my movements and button mashing it. Because there is no on screen prompt, you don't know what to do as well as you maybe should. Since the devs really wanted to make this such a cinematic game with filters and grain to make things look as beautiful and realistic as it can be(see the beach at game start), they don't alter the color or lighting of some of the interactable terrain you traverse. This would be beautiful if it was closer to an on rails and linear movement in the map and your character would just interact with these spots automatically. \n\nI'm truly interested in this game.

I love being able to immerse myself and focus on what I'm playing, and become a part of it. This game enables that perfectly. The visual and auditory effects implemented to portray the effects of psychosis are both impressive and chilling. \n\nThe story telling and presentation is also amazing, I never quite felt lost and could always piece together the meanings behind events in the game, and realize what was going on. I was invested and thoroughly entertained to the end. Not to mention, this game can teach you some interesting facts about Celtic culture and mythology.\n\nThe game-play itself is fun. Puzzles aren't exactly the most difficult but they are certainly rewarding to figure out, with some fun mechanics to mess around with. Combat is a less important aspect of the game but is also surprisingly fun to engage with. Once you figure it out the fights turn into a slaughter-fest of you comboing and dancing around all of the enemies at max speed, slicing them to shreds. One boss in particular was genuinely pretty challenging to face down, which made beating them feel great.\n\nIn terms of the horror aspects of this game, its incredible. This is one of the only games I've played to have had a level that actually made me feel afraid. The aforementioned atmosphere is of course incredible and contributes to feeling uneasy and afraid at times. \n\nWhenever someone tries to tell me that video games can't be art, I won't ever forget to bring up this game.", "timestamp_created": 1688350840, "timestamp_updated": 1688350840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141176622": {"recommendationid": "141176622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162396480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1696765926}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me est\u00e1 sorprendiendo como muy pocos videojuegos.

But then it gimps all of that by artificially slowing you to a crawl, slapping invisible geometry everywhere to ensure you can't even jump off a tiny ledge where it's not absolutely intended for you to do so, creating incredibly tedious and slow puzzles and making you crawl and wade through mud for literally HOURS just to get to a supremely anti-cathartic ending.\n\nThe ending payoff is zero. It basically doesn't tell us anything we didn't know and anticipate at the beginning of the entire affair yet at certain points almost seems to \"reveal\" this information to the player as if it's supposed to be a shock. For me, this was eight hours of torturous gameplay watching a girl suffer and suffer only to get an incredibly contrived message at the end. I'm left wondering why this was even a game. It could have been an artsy psychological horror movie and wasted 1.5 hours of my time instead of 8.5 hours. \n\nIf you enjoy walking simulators and want to get a taste of psychosis along with some truly stellar acting performances, then this might be for you.

I think I'm gonna have to split it into two parts.\n\nFirstly, gameplay. It's kinda mediocre, in all fairness. There are a [i]lot[/i] of environmental puzzles, which are mostly opening runedoors by finding the rune(s) in the environment and focusing on them. It's not hard, by any means, and more busywork thatn anything else. That said, some of them are hidden in clever places, like having to light a fire and finding the rune in the shadows cast and so on. It also forces you to explore the gorgeous and well crafted levels, so not all bad. \n\nThere are other puzzles, some boil down to run a bit, but the illusory trickster god levels are a standout, with you manipulating the environment through looking through a circle and seeing an obstacle disappear, and then walking through the circle to find out your viewpoint has altered the level geometry enabling traversal. It's a lot better then I made it sound and really cool. Some of the later game trial levels are similar in scope, with you have to navigate a level by following the sound of water, or the rumble of your pad. I don't want to spoil them, but some of them are amazing and show some really good and unique gameplay ideas.\n\nThe combat is just kinda there. The parrying feels good, and you can parry a lot of enemy moves, but the overall it's not anything great. Apparently you can string a bunch of attacks together and combo off of a lot of things, but it's not really very rewarding in any way, or even necessary when you can parry -> strong attack most enemies to death. The enemies themselves look amazing and are well-crafted utter norse horrors, but there's not much variation, and you'll fight the same enemies a lot. The graphics and sound are top-notch even now. Senua looks great, the mo-cap is excellent, and the levels and environments are incredible. \n\nThe plot, lore, voicework and journey are also nothing short of excellent, with Senua having very real and well-portrayed personal development over the course of the game. Game narrative usually leaves me cold, but when Senua screams in frustration and anger at the gods that have failed her, or fondly remembers the beautiful day she met her boyfriend, you absolutely feel it deep in your heart. I'm kinda running out of superlatives here, but it's amazing all the way through.\n\nThat's the game really, kinda medicore with some excellent standout gameplay parts which put a lot of more modern games to shame.\n\nSo why is it so great? Well Senua suffers from psychosis, and is reportedly an excellent (and respectful) portrayal. Headphones are kinda a must for this game, because all through the game, you will have different voices telling you things. Sometimes helpful, warning you of enemies behind or telling you when you're near the solution to a puzzle. Most of them time though, they laugh at your hopeless efforts in your hopeless quest, telling you you're a failure and that your quest is stupid and unachievable. Sometimes they blame you for the death of your boyfriend, family and tribe, sometimes they mock Senua's apparent abusive upbringing. Sometimes enemies do it too. I've never really experienced anything like it, and it is such a daring, determined and successful attempt at something most game devs would not have the balls to attempt that I'm in awe, frankly. It really works so well in the context of the game that it's nothing short of brilliant. There are other bits too, such as the face of Senua's mother hidden all around the game or a lot of the trials that are just amazing.\n\nSo yeah, in gameplay terms, Hellblade is kinda weak with some standout parts. As an overall package or experience or whatever, it's simply one of the best games ever made. And I don't think I can really praise it more than that.

Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice tells the story of Senua, a Pict warrior who embarks on a harrowing journey to the Norse underworld, Helheim, to save the soul of her deceased lover, Dillion.\n\n[h2] Pros and cons [/h2]\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] \ud83d\udfe9 Positives [/th]\n[th] \ud83d\udfe5 Negatives [/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]\n- Innovative storytelling and game design approach, focusing on narrative and emotional depth.\n\n- Meticulously crafted environments and character design with a unique art style that combines realism and surrealism.\n\n- Visceral and intense combat system that rewards strategy and timing.\n\n- Nuanced and sensitive portrayal of mental illness, committed to accuracy and authenticity.\n\n- Haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game's visual design.\n\n- Significant cultural and social impact, raising awareness and fostering empathy for those with psychosis.\n\t[/td]\n\t[td]\n- Relatively short playtime, with a main story that can be completed in 8-10 hours.\n\n- Limited replayability, with puzzles and lore-stones that may lose their impact on subsequent playthroughs.\n[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\t\n[h2] Narrative and Characterisation [/h2]\nHellblade tells a deeply personal and emotional story, focusing on themes of mental illness, grief, and self-discovery. The game's narrative is expertly woven into its mechanics and design, creating a cohesive and engaging experience. The storytelling in Hellblade is unconventional, with much of the game's narrative conveyed through environmental storytelling, lore stones, and the voices in Senua's head. \t\n\n[h3] Exploration of Mental Illness [/h3]\nSenua is a complex and well-realised character, with her struggles with psychosis serving as the driving force behind the game's narrative. Senua's journey is not only a physical one but also a psychological one as she grapples with the voices in her head and the hallucinations that plague her. The game's portrayal of psychosis is both sensitive and accurate, with the developers consulting with mental health professionals and individuals with lived experience to ensure authenticity. This commitment to representation allows players to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges those living with mental illness face, fostering empathy and raising awareness.\n\n[h3] Symbolism and Metaphor [/h3]\nHellblade story is rich with symbolism and metaphor. Many aspects of the game's narrative serve as allegories for Senua's internal struggles. The game's environments, enemies, and puzzles reflect Senua's psychological state, with each challenge she faces representing a facet of her mental illness.\n\n[h3] Personal Growth and Self-Discovery [/h3]\nAt its core, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a story of personal growth and self-discovery. Throughout the game, Senua confronts her fears, insecurities, and traumas, ultimately learning to accept and embrace her mental illness as a part of her identity. This focus on personal growth and self-discovery resonates with players, highlighting the universal themes of resilience, perseverance, and the power of the human spirit.\n\n[h2] Mechanics and Gameplay [/h2]\nThe player controls Senua as she navigates through a dark and foreboding world inspired by Norse mythology and Celtic culture. The game's mechanics primarily focus on exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat, with each element contributing to the overall experience.\n\n[h3] Exploration [/h3]\nThe exploration aspect of Hellblade is integral to the game's narrative and atmosphere. The game's environments are meticulously crafted, with keen attention to detail that immerses the player in Senua's world. The level design encourages exploration, with hidden lore stones providing additional context and backstory for those willing to venture off the beaten path. This design choice rewards players for their curiosity and enhances the game's replayability.\n\n[h3] Puzzle-solving [/h3]\nThe player must solve various environmental puzzles to progress through the game. These puzzles often involve pattern recognition and perspective manipulation, requiring players to think critically and approach problems from multiple angles. The puzzles are well-integrated into the game's narrative, with each challenge serving as a metaphor for Senua's internal struggles.\n\n[h3] Combat [/h3]\nCombat in Hellblade is a visceral and intense experience focusing on timing, positioning, and strategy. The game's combat system is relatively simple, with light and heavy attacks, blocks, and dodges. However, it is executed with precision and fluidity. The game's difficulty scales appropriately, with enemy variety and complex attack patterns increasing as the player progresses. This ensures that combat remains engaging and challenging throughout the game.\n\n[h2] Design and Aesthetics [/h2]\nHellblade is a visually stunning game with a unique art style that combines realistic character models and environments with surreal and otherworldly elements. The game's lighting and particle effects are particularly noteworthy, creating an atmosphere of dread and unease that permeates the entire experience.\n\n[h3] Visual Design [/h3]\nThe game's environments are richly detailed and varied, with each location offering a distinct visual identity. The character design is equally impressive, with Senua's appearance reflecting her emotional state and her journey's toll on her body and mind.\n\n[h3] Sound Design [/h3]\nThe sound design in Hellblade is exceptional, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game's visual design. The game's use of binaural audio is particularly noteworthy, as it simulates the experience of hearing voices in one's head, an essential aspect of Senua's psychosis. This innovative approach to sound design enhances the game's immersion and is a powerful narrative device.\n\n[h2] Contextualisation and Cultural Impact [/h2]\nHellblade occupies a unique position within the gaming industry as a game that prioritises narrative and emotional depth over traditional gameplay elements. The game's exploration of mental illness and its innovative approach to storytelling has garnered widespread acclaim and sparked meaningful conversations about representation and inclusivity in gaming.\n\nThe game's portrayal of mental illness has had a significant cultural and social impact, raised awareness and fostered empathy for those with psychosis. Hellblade has also contributed to the ongoing conversation about representation and inclusivity in gaming, highlighting the importance of diverse perspectives and experiences.\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\nIn conclusion, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is remarkable in game design, storytelling, and representation. Its innovative approach to mechanics, design, and narrative, combined with its commitment to authenticity and inclusivity, make it a must-play experience for those seeking a unique and thought-provoking gaming experience.\n", "timestamp_created": 1688035630, "timestamp_updated": 1688035630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140897473": {"recommendationid": "140897473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090082186", "num_games_owned": 2220, "num_reviews": 154, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 747, "last_played": 1686415404}, "language": "english", "review": "Outstanding graphics.\nDeep  atmosphere.\nSpectacle fights.\nAnd mostly boring gameplay.

Senua is a psychotic mind and the way the game plays makes you feel her anguish, her sorrow, her pain. You will follow her path, her quest, her haunting vision (as the devs say) and you will discover her past, her story and even the story of the old goods along the way. \n\nI did pointed out before that the game was terrifying, but not because the game is scary or so, but because it is an overwhelming feeling to experience all these voices, all that noise, all that inner fight, it is an overwhelming experience just to imagine to live like that, that anguish, that darkness. For me it was a life lesson, to understand and feel how a psychotic mind can feel. \n\nWithout a doubt a game that I fully recommend!

At first, I expected the combat to be kinda wonky, but it turned out to be the opposite. Everything feels responsive, there's good feedback, and everything feels very well connected. Every move is well crafted enough to feel natural, and also, the enemies make you use all of the mechanics taught throughout the game, which makes combat at the end very dynamic\n\n- Graphics: I don't know know how close this games gets to photorealism but holy shit, every time I walked to a new scene I had to take a photo because the environments look astonishingly good. The animations also help a ton, the motion tracking really paid off. Though I don't know if it's just me, but sometimes I felt that some of Senua's animations had a lower framerate (at this point I'm being very nitpicky)\n\n- Voices: Don't want to spoil anything, but being the main selling point of the game, it does a great job at conveying this unusual way of narration in every way. The voices really feel like part of the player, and not just some mp3's put on top of each other.\n\n- Mechanics: Every single mechanic is introduced and taught very well without the need of some text explaining what you have to do. Everything is conveyed in a very undersandable way, which makes for a very accesible experience.\n\nOverall, great fucking game, honestly.

A mentally unstable individual is living in a world that is hard to know what is real and what is created. You play as Senua, on a task to deliver her lover's head to its final resting place. You find out through flashbacks what happened to cause Senua to be where she is now and live out her struggles against her own mind as she valiantly fights to reach the game's end. \n\nGameplay: So there is combat in this game but it is pretty minimalistic. There are only a few enemy types, and a few boss fights but most of the combat is you dodging and then learning the enemies timing to land some blows. I think it's best to describe Senua as mainly a walking simulator a la Death Stranding, which is more of an experiential type game, with the odd combat to break up the walking, and a few puzzles scattered to solve to progress. Unlike Death Stranding, I found this more immersive and the story compels you to find out what will happen to Senua and just what is real or not? The combat itself I found mostly lackluster. In particular there are battles that just go on too long, especially the shielded enemy, where you're just waiting for your openings and otherwise just bored. I give the gameplay itself a 3/5.\nStory: The story is intriguing and mysterious. You don't know what is real and what is fake. The studio designed this game through rigorous research to give an approximation of what it is like to live with psychosis and mental issues such a hearing voices, irrational fear, having delusional visions. It certainly was cinematic and drew you in, making you think about what it would be like for people to live with these conditions, especially in a time period such as when this takes place. 4/5.\nMusic: The music was appropriate and again the sound effects overall were meant to put you in the state of a person undergoing several mental trauma/delusions. While the music was mostly not memorable, it fit the experience perfectly and I have to give this a 5/5.\nGraphics: The graphics were well done, much of the in-game cinematics were acted and I have to say, kudos to the actress and supporting cast. Truly great performances that draw you in. A blend of live-action overlaid with certain in-game set pieces and areas really added to the effect of not knowing what is real and what is made up. The world itself is suitably horrific in areas and beautiful in others, making it a pleasure to view. I give this a 5/5.\nFun factor: I call this an experiential type of game. It's not meant to be fun, per se, but to draw you in and leave you with a unique experience. I definitely don't feel an urge to replay and the combat dragged for me, but I did want to finish the game and find out what Senua's ending would be. 4/5.\nOverall: If you want an unique game, an experience that shows you what life could be like for those living with mental illness, or a game that brings to life Norse myths in a horrific but amazing way, I'd highly recommend this. If you're looking for a fun combat game then I'd look elsewhere. This game really reminds me a bit of the 13th Warrior, where in that movie they took a fantastical tale and made it real by presenting the myths in a realistic way, but having you see how they could have grown in telling. But instead for Senua, the myths and legends take shape in her own mind, becoming more fantastical and terrifying driven by her own mental state. I would highly recommend everyone play this once to see the unique perspective. 4/5 overall.", "timestamp_created": 1687318114, "timestamp_updated": 1687318114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140418576": {"recommendationid": "140418576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137488176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 716, "last_played": 1687311794}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me ha parecido un juego incre\u00edble que propone toda una experiencia de juego.

She's small-framed, but tenacious, and her arms are skinny, but muscular from use. She experiences rage, fear, frustration, despair. She's vulnerable. She has no superpowers. She's just a woman who's been through some shit. The writers struck an excellent balance between strength and vulnerability.\n\nAbsolutely no focus is on Senua's looks, gender, or sexuality. She's a scrawny, tough lil thing and her face is covered in blue paint, blood, and dirt. I haven't seen a single slow-motion pan up the butt and boobs. More and more stories are being told about women these days without it being all about the male gaze, and I love every single dev who makes that choice.\n\n[b][u]History/Mythology[/u][/b]\n\nThe depiction of Norse mythology (an interest of mine) is one of the best I've seen in video games or movies. I like that there are tidbits of the Eddas interwoven with Senua's story. I also appreciate that they acknowledge how bat shit insane Norse mythology is. Lookin' at you, Au\u00f0umbla.\n\n[b][u]Combat[/u][/b]\n\nThe combat looks and feels more realistic than most games. Senua isn't acrobatic. She's not leaping five feet and somersaulting gracefully. Her body has weight. When she's hit with a strong attack, she isn't just staggered, she crashes to the ground. Her sword has weight and momentum; when she misses a big swing, the sword keeps moving and turns her body. And while some of her combat moves are a little flashy and dramatic, I've also seen some legit swordplay movements. (I took one longsword class and have watched lots of people fight with longswords in heavy armor. I'm sub-amateur level but Senua's movements ring true with what I've seen.) When Senua is injured, she moves more sluggishly, and I feel it while playing. She can't swing as fast or dodge-jump as far. It's immersive.\n\nThey also did a great job replicating the dance-like aspect of swordfighting. The back and forth, taking turns \"leading.\" The beginning, when you're studying your opponent's movements, sizing them up and devising a strategy.\n\nUnfortunately, the charm wears off before long, as combat gets repetitive. The same enemies, the same strategies. It goes from \"ooh\" to \"ehh\" pretty quickly.\n\n[b][u]Graphics[/u][/b]\n\nThe game is visually stunning. The graphics quality and animation are outstanding. The setting at least in the first area is bleak and not terribly interesting. It's a lot of greyish brown tree trunks and sticks and rocks. But they are very exquisitely rendered sticks and rocks.\n\n[b][u]Audio[/u][/b]\n\nClever use of sound as a game mechanic and storytelling device, though people who are Deaf or hard of hearing will not benefit from that as much. I have difficulties with auditory processing and it's hard to pick out any meaning from a cluster of voices. \n\nSubtitles are unfortunately unreliable; the subtitles don't exactly match the dialogue, and they're oddly timed -- like an entire paragraph of subtitles will appear on the screen at once, even though the spoken words are spread across two minutes of scenes with large stretches of silence in the middle. Because there are so many voices, many of them are not captured in the subtitles, which is understandable, but it further weakens the subtitles' effectiveness. \n\n[b][u]Puzzles?[/u][/b]\n\nUuuuugh. I'm glad I'm not the only person who hesitates to call them \"puzzles.\" There's no real challenge to figuring them out. So far, all of the puzzles have been \"Walk around the area until you're in the right place and can see the right thing.\" Or else it's \"Follow the path, and there is only one path because every other path is blocked by trees, fences, or fire.\" It's just walking around. I'm not using my brain or problem-solving skills, so it's not rewarding at all when I \"solve\" them. But I am exercising every last ounce of my patience, because Senua's fastest movement speed is a casual jog. Not even a brisk jog. \n\nAnd there is no consistency regarding what she can and can't climb over, duck under, or jump down from. She can step over a log, but not a rock. She can climb over this three-foot wall, but not that three-foot fence. She can jump down from this six-foot cliff, but not that four-foot drop, because... there are some fist-sized rocks along the edge? I guess?\n\nThe tight, low over-the-shoulder view also makes it difficult to get a good sense of the entire area. Fences, buildings, trees etc all look more or less the same, and there's not nearly enough to differentiate between this path or that path. My directional sense is terrible, but the sameness of the environment has made me walk in so many circles. \n\n[b][u]Permadeath[/u][/b]\n\nYou can only die/fail a limited number of times before it's game over, man. I guess to build tension? But when I'm dying/failing because of bad game design, I get real mad at my limited lives being taken from me. I don't like roguelikes/roguelites. Permadeath doesn't make a game more thrilling, it makes it feel more pointless and frustrating. I'm 4-5 hours in and I'm already halfway to permadeath. I don't want to continue when I'm pretty sure I'm going to permadie before I can finish the game. Which means I'd have to start from scratch, and I do NOT want to go through all of that jogging again.\n\nThere are too many frustrating ways to die in this game due to factors outside of my control, like getting stuck on something in combat, or poor game/level design, or the developers just not telling you important things that you need to know to progress. Their approach is to throw you into the lake and you'll learn to swim eventually. I don't need to be spoon fed, and I like figuring things out in games, but I do need to know the basic mechanics and concepts of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1687129015, "timestamp_updated": 1687129144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140294994": {"recommendationid": "140294994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847102642", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1684214228}, "language": "english", "review": "I have got hallucination after finishing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1687115441, "timestamp_updated": 1687115441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140294847": {"recommendationid": "140294847", "author": {"steamid": "76561199515896776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1687115095}, "language": "english", "review": "This was such a dark and emotional journey!

Este juego no es solo un juego, es una experiencia que te agarra desde lo m\u00e1s profundo y no te suelta f\u00e1cilmente.\n\nLa m\u00fasica, primero que todo, es como un abrazo a tus emociones. La manera en que cada nota se mezcla con la narrativa y el ambiente es simplemente alucinante. Despu\u00e9s de jugar, es como si las melod\u00edas se quedaran contigo, reviviendo esos momentos intensos.\n\nLos di\u00e1logos y la actuaci\u00f3n de Melina Juergens como Senua son la clave de este viaje. Puedes sentir la lucha interna de Senua en cada palabra y gesto. No es solo un juego, es una exploraci\u00f3n de la mente humana, y te sumerges en esa dualidad entre el miedo y la valent\u00eda. Es tan crudo y real que te hace cuestionar tu propia percepci\u00f3n de la realidad.\n\nVisualmente, es una obra de arte. Cada rinc\u00f3n, desde los paisajes n\u00f3rdicos hasta los oscuros reinos mentales, est\u00e1 lleno de detalles que te absorben por completo. No puedes evitar detenerte a mirar y apreciar lo que los desarrolladores lograron crear.\n\nY hablando del tema, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice toca aspectos serios como la salud mental y el trauma de una manera que pocos juegos se atreven. Es como un recordatorio de que los videojuegos pueden ser m\u00e1s que solo entretenimiento; pueden ser poderosas herramientas para contar historias impactantes y significativas.\n\nEn resumen, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice es una experiencia que se queda contigo.

However, you have to go there first, then look through something, then go here, then go there, then look through something, go back to where you were, then do this and maybe get to open the door. or not.

In this case, Psychosis and such mental disorders. Purely on it's own, the story, idea, etc... would be decent, not great, but overall ok and should work. And this type of thing is arguably best conveyed through interactive medium like a video game.\nThe problem... is the gameplay. It's bad... really bad at times. Combat is a fustercluck, with enemies able to spawn in at random seeming right next to you, and instantly start and attack while you're in the middle of an animation or other state already, not really able to respond. Sometimes there's input queueing that says you cna't dodge or block cause you're doing another attack, othertimes there is none... sometimes controls are just ignored. Sometimes they are even supposed to be when you get into the tired state. Many enemies are poorly designed to actually fight, shield holding ones especially. The camera and movement... and I say this coming from a long history of gaming in the third person, combat, exploration, platforming, etc... but this might take the cake for the worst camera and movement I've had to date. In combat it is just so ungodly awful that as soon as there's more than one enemy you probably aren't having any fun, and when there's three or more, or they spawn on different sides, you're just getting pissed dealing with it.\nThen there's bugs, plenty of bugs, performance issues, it plays really badly even on a fairly high end system at low resolutions. And most of the gameplay is other than combat puzzles, but not really that good, a few are ok but most just feel like annoying time waster types where you explore around till you spot some specific thing they want you to find, not the other things you found that looked like it, no... gotta be this one specific thing, from one specific angle. So overall, the gameplay is just... too bad, it keeps me from focusing enough on the story or experience, and often takes away from this, overall I was thinking three hours in (well at least it's a short game\" since it looked like I was almost done, it is short, thankfully.\nSadly I just can't recommend this, the idea was arguably good, but the execution was just... not...", "timestamp_created": 1686427144, "timestamp_updated": 1686427144, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470877885818481445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139851911": {"recommendationid": "139851911", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039882240", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 914, "last_played": 1686444837}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1686424876, "timestamp_updated": 1686424876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139833519": {"recommendationid": "139833519", "author": {"steamid": "76561199135160169", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 834, "last_played": 1686377992}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1686401040, "timestamp_updated": 1686401040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139807237": {"recommendationid": "139807237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306954763", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1686352020}, "language": "english", "review": "Experience I think it\u2019s worth to check it out very well made and the combat system really makes you feel like bad ass sometimes there's still room for improvements but I loved it.", "timestamp_created": 1686353062, "timestamp_updated": 1686353062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537537515163421631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139804869": {"recommendationid": "139804869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047733360", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 172, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1686414186}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn, what a Banger!", "timestamp_created": 1686348796, "timestamp_updated": 1686348796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503607332706451416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139798254": {"recommendationid": "139798254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085056115", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 415, "last_played": 1686339102}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bastante bueno, la actriz principal es 10/10, las voces excelentes y la sensacion de incomodidad que genera toda la ambientacion del juego esta bastante logrado y te deja ponerte en el lugar de la minita mientras vas avanzando.

The impression I was left with was that the game would be quite action-oriented with a hint of horror and heavily influenced by Norse themes (runes on swords etc). I must admit I put it under the radar as there have been quite a few releases which draw inspiration from Norse mythology and end up being lacklustre. How wrong my first impressions were! How lucky I was that I was not hyped! I got into the game unsuspecting of what I would witness.\n\nThere are many descriptions and tags which try to define Hellblade: \u201chorror-orientated, action game\u201d, \u201chack\u2019n\u2019slash\u201d, \u201cnarrative\u201d. They are quite wrong while being right; Hellblade is a study of its creators on a human psychosis using video games as a medium of visualisation and expression, and it\u2019s a thorough experience for whoever chooses to play it. It transcends the petty genre tags and provides its audience with an unparalleled immersive experience.\n\nOur heroine is Senua, a Celtic female warrior, her design influenced by the medieval Pict tribes in Scotland during the Roman occupation of Great Britain. She arrives in Helheim, the Norse land of the dead, to claim redemption for her lost lover. One might suggest that her tale is the Celtic take on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice with the roles reversed. Right from the start, we understand that this is far from the case. Senua is special, in the sense that you arrive as a silent observer in her head. You are welcomed by a voice, the one of many \u2013 who would resemble the ancient Greek Erinyes \u2013 as she urges you to follow Senua in her quest. Senua\u2019s aim is simple: she will reach and confront Hela, the goddess of Death, and claim Dillion \u2013 her lover \u2013 back to the world of the living.\n\nI honestly do not want to spoil the story of Senua. It relies on a very simple premise, but ultimately it is how it unfolds into an intricate webby pattern that\u2019s important. Small hints in the narrative comprise a very detailed character backstory and development, one you rarely see in the medium. The daemons Senua has to face balance between reality and fantasy. The game uses Senua as a vessel to provide just a glimpse of the hallucinations and delusions which a psychotic person may experience. Yes, Senua is psychotic as her grasp of reality is quite thin, that much is clear from the start. After all, how would it be possible to look us into the eyes, as if we were actually there? We are peering through the looking-glass, we\u2019re just non-existent observers.\n\nThe players will find themselves deeply immersed in the game\u2019s story. There are two major factors responsible for this: the approach in direction and and Ninja Theory\u2019s handling of state-of-the-art technologies to tell their story and get their message across. As far as direction goes, there are quite a few things one can say. From the frame compositions, the sequences in unveiling new locations or enemies, to the actual behaviour of Senua herself everything is there for a reason. The first 5-6 hours of Hellblade provide a constant escalation of strong emotions as we learn new ways with which Senua observes her environs. Surroundings full of Norse paganist horror and imposing landscapes. Or is it just our twisted perception?\n\nOtherworldly ambient sounds can be heard as we walk past derelict houses, the sounds of still life \u2013 or widespread death. We can listen to Viking horns in the mist, as we walk past longships, hanging chains and bones rattling against the wind. We may have the sudden urge to listen to the mystifying music of Wardruna and Forndom, but it will just as suddenly dissolve as we will listen to the ambient sounds which can only mean that new horrors need to be faced. One of the eeriest and horrifying video game experiences I\u2019ve ever had was the start of Act 2 in the original Max Payne (the dream level). It was not because of what was there or not, but of what the visual \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 the sound effects (and\u2026 younger age) forced my mind make all those unconscious connections. While Senua is not disturbing for my taste \u2013 trust me there may be people who may find it as such \u2013 it managed to match that experience.\n\nAll these artistic details are hard to miss from the start (there a few more which are much more subtle). Although the direction takes a strong stance on how to best demonstrate the major conflict happening in Senua\u2019s world, it leaves much to the player for assembly and, thus, interpretation, besides the main theme. How did Senua end up in her state is unveiled gradually, intricately, artistically, exceptionally. An average person (please note; not \u201cnormal\u201d) may find Melina Juergens\u2019 (Senua\u2019s alter real-life ego) reactions and acting grossly exaggerated. Arguably, after finishing the game I understood and sympathised in a profound way why Senua reacts the way she does. From start to finish the attention to detail is outstanding.\n\nAnother field in which Hellblade shines is in how it uses the medium\u2019s technologies. This visual novel/study pushes you on edge right from the start. You have to play this game with your headphones on no matter what. The audio is unmatched to my recent memory, and how could it not be? Ninja Theory used a binaural recording room, resulting in everything you listen to be relative in 3D space. \u201cOh, I heard a maniacal laugh from my right\u2026 wait, it moved towards the back of my head\u2026now, back to the right\u2026 another voice on the left at the same time\u2026 what is happening to me?\u201d You have suddenly become Senua herself. Special reference should be made to the voice actors who gave an outstanding performance. There were a few very unsuspecting moments where no action took place and the voices effects (eg. hisses) made my neck skin crawl out of nowhere.\n\nIn order to enforce the impact of the story, engage the players into immersion as much as possible the game has no HUD, only clues. The voices are one with another being Senua\u2019s rotten hand, an indication of a health bar; her mental health. The game follows the golden rule \u201cless is more\u201d exceptionally. The engine contributes quite a lot to that aspect. It\u2019s possibly one of the first games using Unreal Engine 4 I\u2019ve played with the exception of UT2014. I\u2019ve realised we have come a long way since the rendition of Xan\u2019s and Malcolm\u2019s faces in the original Unreal Tournament. Words cannot do justice to describe the motion capture technology that was utilised to bring Senua into digital life. I could see Senua\u2019s eyes shining or the fear drawn on her face, a whole range of emotions which I was fortunate to witness. The environments are so still, devoid of life, yet so lush and rich in themes. Hellblade\u2019s visuals are truly engrossing. Thankfully, Ninja Theory incorporated a Photo Mode (accessed by pressing the Home key) which can be used to take pictures of the game however we see fit. It\u2019s a mode which possibly entitles a second playthrough just for the sake of it.\n\nHonestly, I could drag on and on. I could emphasise how delicately Ninja Theory have dealt with a very sensitive matter such as psychosis, taking notes from established scientists in the field and actual people living in this perpetual state. How they have consulted historians to depict an accurate world. How the combat mechanics are quite fluent without being overbearing. I will not do that.\n\nHellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice is not a game. It\u2019s an example of what people with vision, scope and means-for-the-purpose can achieve without being burdened about demographics of marketing to a target audience. It\u2019s a true testament of what the combination of Art and Science can result in, using video games as a medium of expression. Forget for a moment all the trendy competitive online games. Buy Hellblade. Switch off the lights. Put on your headphones. Turn it on.

Cutscenes and scripted sequences were cinematic and incorporated a lot more horror than I had initially realized, there were lots of intense moments that also show off some really impressive graphics. Sound design is also great and the 3d audio of the voices in Senua's head were very cool to experience. Things do initially begin pretty slowly, the puzzles are a bit obtuse and you'll be asked to look at things from certain angles many times over but they do become more intuitive as you progress. Similarly, I started as pretty unimpressed by the combat as while again very cinematic, it does feel a little simple at times. That being said as I progressed, through a combination of getting more comfortable with the controls and the game having more interesting combinations of enemies, I learned to like it. I found the game difficulty is set automatically based on an early game fight which in my case set it to hard and made enemies unnecessarily tanky though, would recommend manually adjusting it to Normal as that felt much better balanced after changing. I will also warn that this game isn't incredibly polished. There were a few pretty inconvenient checkpoints, some rough looking pop-in at certain points, numerous occasions of objects clipping through things, and multiple times where I had to reload my save file due to getting stuck on bad geometry, once from getting softlocked in a small ring of rocks, and twice from just getting stuck to trees and freezing in place.\n\nHellblade: Senua's Sacrifice tonally, graphically, and cinematically is a brilliant experience with puzzles and combat ranging from serviceable to decent, so if you're still interested and can live with that balance I'd say definitely pick it up on the next sale.", "timestamp_created": 1685776670, "timestamp_updated": 1685776891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139460305": {"recommendationid": "139460305", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988608600", "num_games_owned": 560, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 687, "last_played": 1682362679}, "language": "english", "review": "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is the story of a mentally ill woman on a mission to wrest her lover's soul from the bloody, twitching entrails of hell itself.\n\nThey apparently consulted with a number of experts about psychosis and did their best to represent it accurately though dramatically.\nThe story is well-presented and engaging.\n\nThe visuals are phenomenal, although some of the screen effects are pretty overboard.\n\nThe gameplay involves solving perspective puzzles, listening to old norse audiologs about mythology, and of course stabbing dudes, while worming your way into the depths of Hel.

It's a reminder that we all have our own battles, and it's through empathy and understanding that we can find strength and resilience.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics perfectly complement the narrative, creating an intense and immersive experience. The combat sequences are visceral and satisfying, demanding precise timing and strategic thinking. But what truly sets Hellblade apart is its ability to seamlessly integrate Senua's own mental manifestations into gameplay. The voices in her head, the visual distortions, and the puzzles that reflect her internal struggles all serve to deepen the connection between the player and the protagonist. It's a masterful approach that blurs the line between reality and illusion.\n\nVisually, Hellblade is a work of art. The attention to detail is astounding, from the meticulously designed environments to the hauntingly realistic character models. The game's use of light and shadow creates an atmosphere that is both beautiful and foreboding, enhancing the sense of unease and tension. The breathtaking landscapes and the nightmarish realms that Senua traverses are a testament to the artistry of the developers.\n\nThe audio design in Hellblade is nothing short of exceptional. The haunting score perfectly captures the emotional depth of the story, evoking a wide range of feelings from fear and despair to hope and triumph. The use of binaural audio techniques is a stroke of genius, as it immerses you in Senua's world, making you feel every whisper and murmur as if it's happening inside your own mind. It's a sensory experience that heightens the emotional impact of the narrative and adds another layer of immersion.\n\nIn conclusion, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is an extraordinary and thought-provoking game that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and tackles sensitive subject matter with grace and respect. It's a deeply personal and emotional journey that resonated with me on a profound level. From its compelling narrative to its innovative gameplay mechanics and stunning visuals, every aspect of the game is a testament to the dedication and artistry of the development team. If you're looking for a game that will challenge you intellectually, emotionally, and leave a lasting impression, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is an absolute must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1685530600, "timestamp_updated": 1685530600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676041305065155029", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139297592": {"recommendationid": "139297592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388986615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3619, "last_played": 1686651919}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game", "timestamp_created": 1685502558, "timestamp_updated": 1685502558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139296196": {"recommendationid": "139296196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022517753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 190, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1685499888}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well-done.

If this game came out today, it would still be praised for how beautiful it is and that's not even counting the 2021 Enhanced patch, because that only improves shadows and reflections. The game is gorgeous even without RT. The gameplay is fine, but nothing to write home about. The game really is about immersion and atmosphere and it delivers on both fronts in a spectacular way. \n\nFrom technical standpoint it's very good as well as it has all the things you want - HDR, DLSS, super-ultrawide support and pretty good optimization. DQHD resolution (~4K) with RT without DLSS was able to bring my framerate under 100FPS on a 4090, but DLSS/FSR brings it right back up to over 150 and RT is not really super necessary, so I'm sure it will run fine on most modern PCs... Especially since it hardly needs more than 60FPS due to its slower nature. It's perfectly playable even in 30 for people that can stand it.

Even though I heard some reviews and talks about Hellblade few years ago, except the core part of the game what it revolves around, in the end it actually really blew my expectation away. Kind of hard to treat this as a video game entertainment. But regardless, it has incorporated gameplay elements in this short adventure to call it a video game and single out Pros and Cons.\n\n[h1]Presentation:[/h1]\nHellblade Senua\u2019s Sacrifice is a third person action adventure semi-open yet linear game set in a world of Norse mythology. Each part of level environment perfectly blends with Senua\u2019s story and her problems that accompany it. In some other games many will say it\u2019s empty and doesn\u2019t give you a reason to care or play it, except here. It's very fitting for the theme which capsulates the feeling of condition of being lonely, otherwise it would kill the whole vibe of collecting little items, since the whole goal is to not waste time around running here and there. Aside from being lonely, the environment often changes, based on your mental state which gives you a feeling being insane. Apart from the main quest, there is nothing else to explore besides lore stones that teach you about Norse mythology.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2982419433\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nAt first I was thinking it would be an interactive movie, with how the main character walks very slow, but glad I was wrong. First thing as a player what you greet with, is having ability to focus on the runes which are everywhere around us until you look properly and realize the right one. The game gives you hints where it should be, but you\u2019re the one who will need to look properly to find it. Later on, with focusing you can find patterns, or manipulate whole environment to open new paths. And I really liked this open new path manipulation (switching back and forth was kind of funny to see how was implemented in the game). Basically, when you watch through a specific gate, it totally changes path which can open further progression. Overall, it serves as a break from combat and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the game. Aside from this puzzle elements, which is one part of this game that surprised me, focus also helps you during a combat as a time manipulation thingy to overcome your enemies. As for the combat, I found it mixed bag, would say it\u2019s pretty basic. You have heavy attack and light attack, dodging or blocking or parry. The game camera automatically locks on to whichever enemy is attacking Senua. Timing is also important, otherwise it can punish you pretty good, not as like souls game. If you die, you\u2019re not gonna respawn far away but the pressure of near death and her illness will give you second thought before rushing in again and button mashing it. There are few types of foes. It basically comes down to light and heavy types with the same fighting technique. I'd like to see in a second game that addresses this with more types and styles of enemies.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2982419775\nOn the other side, the suggestions and cues provided by Senua's inner voices were one feature of the game's combat that I found to be very enjoyable. They frequently shout, \"Behind you!\" or \"FOCUS!\" really helped me especially with limited camera movement. It fits perfectly and is a clever design choice. Using your senses in later gameplay to move through environment was also cleverly designed. Even though there are a lot of linear games, most of them are flooded with texts and prompts, except here it\u2019s opposite. No tutorial, you will learn simply and naturally and no HUD, which gives overall cleanliness and ability to look around without to go in photo mode. Overall gameplay is good but it's not the main shine where it stands out. As others have said the main critique would be about being very slow and more of a \"walking sim\" type of game. Anxious to see how the sequel will differ.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nIt follows Senua on a journey into Helheim with hopes of rescuing her dead lover. From very beginning we learn that\u2019s more heavily focused on Senua's personal journey and her struggle with mental illness through life. The narrative of the game is intricately entwined with themes of sorrow, trauma, and her battle with psychosis. The battle manifests in a way that it feels especially extraordinary, as they are represented by untrustworthy narrators, voices who suggest contradictory concepts in order to make you doubt yourself and blurs the lines between reality and Senua's subjective experience. As a player, you\u2019re immersed in Senua's tortured psyche as you navigate the haunting landscapes and confront her inner demons, but also makes you feel fear, dread, anxiety. In my personal opinion, it would have been far better executed if we as players wouldn\u2019t have been addressed with the depictions of psychosis from very beginning, rather gradually realizing this aspect on your own. Nevertheless, you can really tell that the developers really put all of their effort to present this very complex topic in a clever, bold and respectful way which was obviously well-researched and that I found to be incredibly enlightening. Whole story and more of details around this theme is addressed in the video.\n\n[h1]Audio/Visuals:[/h1]\nHellblade's audio design is outstanding, music is perfectly blended with environment. But the main show comes from voices. My god, that was executed phenomenally (especially after seeing how it was done, in one of the videos). At one point even I started to quarrel with in game voices. Really wish more games had this 3D audio feature. As stated in the game, you must play this with headphones; otherwise, the game will not be as immersive as it should be.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2982421459\nHellblade is also a very pretty game. Beautifully crafted environments, great atmosphere and with the addition of ray tracing, it appears to be released from last year and can be screen archer's dream. Character model and animations are excellent. When you move your camera, either her head moves or whole body depending on situation, which I like when this is implemented rather to be static unless you move the character. In game photo mode is by todays standards bare-bones, doesn\u2019t offer a lot and has visual bugs like not seeing mouse. Also, camera can\u2019t be moved in 3D rather left/right or up/down. Thankfully the game comes with my personally best software implementation, NVIDIA Ansel, a powerful tool that takes your photos on a whole new level and makes you like a professional digital photographer.\n\n[h1]Performance:[/h1]\nDidn\u2019t encounter any visual glitches or game braking bugs. Ran constantly above 100 fps on ultra settings even with ray tracing elements on max, to be straight I was playing on 4070 Ti and in 1080p. I suggest you to turn off DLSS, especially if you are digital photographer because it can be seen how it shimmers around Senua\u2019s outfit and everywhere else (DLSS was on quality).\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\nVisually great looking great, awesome audio and very well storytelling which can\u2019t be seen very often in AAA video game industry. Hellblade truly transfers you to another world for a little period of time, giving you the sensation of living as someone else. To have deeper connection with or a greater understanding of the character. And that\u2019s what this game and many other remind me why I play video games to begin with. No other media achieves this quite as well as this one.\n\nRating: 8 / 10\nRecommendation: YES\n\nI suggest disregarding any negative criticisms concerning gameplay elements and immersing yourself in Senua's captivating vision quest firsthand. In my opinion, the compelling story and relatively short duration of the game outweigh any potential drawbacks.", "timestamp_created": 1685392866, "timestamp_updated": 1685393711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139231336": {"recommendationid": "139231336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048534456", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 687, "last_played": 1624987952}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Toda una experiencia de juego, es corto pero merece mucho la pena", "timestamp_created": 1685389833, "timestamp_updated": 1685389833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139222284": {"recommendationid": "139222284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034330448", "num_games_owned": 827, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1685378692}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most unique and powerful gaming experiences I've ever had.

(more of a retrospective than a review)\n\nFirst off:\nAbsolutely amazing game. I loved it. I count it as one of my favorite games (if you can't tell by my profile).\n\nI gotta say the game feels different when you first play it but I couldn't put my finger on it at first until I played other games and it suddenly clicked. I realized what this game was missing: A HUD.\nThere is no HUD and it feels like a real journey, a movie almost, no indication of your health, stamina, items, quests or whatever, just you, your sword and the voices.\nYou have to watch your surroundings and react to it like your character as it becomes slower the closer you come to dying but surprisingly and amazingly the same is said for the enemy, they also react to hits and slow down when low, have less attacks etc. which gives the fights a fair feeling throughout the game.\nYou have the focus mechanic that is indicated on the mirror you carry on the waist but nothing is really in your face or in the way, it helps you focus (no pun intented) on the game a lot more.\n\nThe puzzles which form the core gameplay are very creative at first. I really liked the looking out for the runes bit but they became a bit of a chore after a few times (maybe that's intented to represent the condition by constantly recognizing patterns or challenges that aren't there but nonetheless).\nIt felt somewhat tedious and especially if you're going for 100% like I did because either you walk around everywhere to find lorestones beforehand or play the sections again which for me was a bit annoying since I knew the story already but the bit before Valravn dragged on for so long (maybe also because I was being stupid and had to watch a walkthrough).\n\nIt's not open world which don't get me wrong is perfect for this game. It's very fitting for the theme to be confined to the story path and running around as you please would kill the whole vibe.\nYou have a goal and that goal only and there is no time to waste running around doing useless errands etc.\nThe experience was improved that way and made you feel trapped, almost claustrophobic even within a wide empty landscape like before the gates to Hela or at the tree before Odin's trials, it feels lonely, which capsulates the feeling of the condition.\nThe feeling of loneliness is reinforced even more when you realize that you're truly alone the whole time, the only living beings are the enemies you face that want to kill you and they don't really talkand the only people you trust are not even real.\n\nI really enjoyed the combat. Since there aren't many attacks you have to memorize and it's straight forward, you can work on perfecting your skills with what you have.\nThe bosses are great themewise but were relatively easy at all difficulties although the later bosses are pretty terrifying \n(I died like 20 times to the man-bear-pig boar wolf beast thing but it was the best boss fight in the game and one of the most terrifying moments along with that one Odin trial (you know which one I mean)).\nThe thing that confused me at the start from a gameplay perspective was that you got no real introduction to the controls or mechanics and had to go to the menu screen to read them first, which I immediatly did but others did not.\nThat resulted in many mechanics not learned or only very late if you didn't experiment with the controls or watched tutorials (like the focus mechanic). I kind of liked it though since it encouraged you to try out different combos and I learned that you could even stun the enemies by just running into them which (along with the kick) helped against \nshielded enemies.\nThere were no instructions, no manual for enemies, nothing to help you fight, you are alone only accompanied by your voices and since there were no indications etc., you only had those to help you in a fight by saying things like \"attack\", \"behind you\", which helped me alot.\nOf course the premise is perfect for such a mechanic since it is not out of place for the voices to help you in a realistic scenario and it doesn't feel out of place or disturb the immersion like some on screen indicators or tutorials would.\nIf I would have to give one tip it would be: Really listen to the voices, they guide and help you when you're lost or struggling against enemies. It's not just some rambling.\n\nNonetheless the story is great and makes you question just as much after beating the game as in the beginning if not more. The game forces you to come up with your own interpretations and judgement which is a refreshing take.\nThe delusions could really kill you even though you as a player knew they weren't real but since they posed a real threat (like the darkness) you were scared of it nonetheless, making you just as afraid as Senua herself and helping you understand her better. At no point did I question why Senua felt or acted a certain way since we as a player are pratically inside her mind knowing her every move and thought.\nThe player itself becomes a part of the delusions, sometimes on Senua's side where you're wondering if you're not just another voice inside her head, controlling her and sometimes on your own side where you're questioning if you're really seeing things you're supposed to see such as the search for the runes. You spend so much time looking for these runes, \nplacing yourself and other objects at just the right angle that sometimes you think you see it but really it isn't what the game intented you to find.\nYou're really adapting the mindset of the protagonist like when fighting the bosses. Things like \"Yeah, let's get them and find Dillion\" \"Where the hell is my lover?\" or \"I'll kill all of you if I must\" are what I thought even though I knew it wasn't real.\nBut the beauty in this game is you never know what part is real and what isn't. \nDid she fight real gods? Was she fighting some random people who she saw as that way? Or did she just imagine all of it in her head? \nWell, the ending confuses you more than giving you closure and frankly, we will never know which leaves every player interpreting it in their own way and having their own head canon.\nBut this exact experience is really the most memorable thing about this game.\nIt's an eery but badass experience.\n\nOh and another tip would be to play the game.

And they are right, but that's not a bad thing. The game doesn't really focus on action and combat too much, but mainly on the players experience with the game. You're put in Senua's mind and so you hear and see everything she does, which can be very intense.  She experiences psychosis, depression and grief, and those elements are heavily present in the game. Like hearing voices right up against your ear and the walls appearing as if they're melting.  \n\nI recommend walking into this game knowing that combat and even game play isn't the focus of the game, rather that it's focus is on being a part of Senua's journey through hell and the absolutely incredible story and experience you get from that. \n\nThis is a game I always recommend everyone plays at least once in their life!", "timestamp_created": 1685087026, "timestamp_updated": 1685087026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138999175": {"recommendationid": "138999175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206701832", "num_games_owned": 627, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 549, "last_played": 1685072091}, "language": "spanish", "review": "HORRIBLEMENTE ABURRIDO", "timestamp_created": 1685072109, "timestamp_updated": 1685072109, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39682537317276001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138993809": {"recommendationid": "138993809", "author": {"steamid": "76561199363462923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1685061966}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo. lo recomiendo al 100%. me lo pase bastante rapido porque no podia parar de jugarlo. \nLo bueno del juego es la historia, lo malo los puzzles repetitivos y el combate.", "timestamp_created": 1685062279, "timestamp_updated": 1685062279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138987410": {"recommendationid": "138987410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393128448", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1693671169}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1685051907, "timestamp_updated": 1685051907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138960723": {"recommendationid": "138960723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198962789852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 547, "last_played": 1670498101}, "language": "english", "review": "Very strict environment and repetitive.", "timestamp_created": 1685018156, "timestamp_updated": 1685018156, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497257798910140991", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138956369": {"recommendationid": "138956369", "author": {"steamid": "76561199035995434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1686959989}, "language": "english", "review": "*Playing this on my Steam Deck*\n\nThis game has made a pivotal impact in my life.

Developed by Ninja Theory, this dark and immersive experience is a testament to the power of gaming as an art form. With its thought-provoking narrative, breathtaking visuals, and unique gameplay mechanics, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice stands as an unforgettable testament to the potential of interactive storytelling.\n\nMind-Bending Narrative:\nAt the heart of Hellblade lies a narrative that fearlessly tackles the complex and sensitive topic of mental illness. The game follows the journey of Senua, a Celtic warrior plagued by psychosis, as she embarks on a quest through the Viking underworld of Helheim to save the soul of her beloved. The developers collaborated with neuroscientists and individuals who have firsthand experience with mental health conditions to ensure an authentic portrayal. This attention to detail shines through, resulting in a deeply empathetic and thought-provoking exploration of the human mind.\n\nIncredible Atmosphere:\nFrom the moment you step into Senua's world, you're enveloped in an atmosphere that is equal parts haunting and mesmerizing. The game's audio design deserves special recognition, as it plays a vital role in immersing players into Senua's fractured reality. Voices whisper, shout, and sometimes deceive, providing an eerie accompaniment to the unsettling visuals. The attention to detail in sound design is commendable, contributing to the overall sense of unease and anxiety that permeates the experience.\n\nVisual Poetry:\nHellblade's visual presentation is nothing short of breathtaking. The game's environments range from grim and desolate landscapes to ethereal and otherworldly realms, all meticulously crafted with an unparalleled attention to detail. The use of light and shadow is masterful, creating a chiaroscuro effect that further enhances the game's atmosphere. Moreover, the motion capture performances and facial animations are remarkably realistic, breathing life into the characters and allowing players to forge an emotional connection with them.\n\nInnovative Gameplay Mechanics:\nHellblade's gameplay mechanics are a perfect blend of exploration, puzzles, and intense combat sequences. As you traverse the game's beautifully haunting landscapes, you'll solve environmental puzzles that are seamlessly integrated into the narrative, allowing for a smooth and immersive experience. Combat, on the other hand, is brutal and unforgiving, emphasizing the weight and impact of every strike. The game strikes a perfect balance between challenge and accessibility, ensuring that players of varying skill levels can enjoy the journey.\n\nConclusion:\nHellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is an undeniable triumph, pushing the boundaries of storytelling and gaming as an art form. Its unflinching exploration of mental illness, combined with its haunting atmosphere, stunning visuals, and innovative gameplay mechanics, sets it apart as a truly exceptional experience. Ninja Theory's dedication to creating a game that resonates on an emotional level is evident in every aspect, making Hellblade an unforgettable journey into the depths of the human psyche.

I was hooked by Senua's creepy journey from the start because to its unique blend of psychological terror, furious combat, and an intensely personal story. (Yea i actually liked the combat)\nThe game's portrayal of mental health is both raw and empathetic! It delves into the mind of Senua, a Celtic warrior plagued by psychosis. The use of binaural audio techniques create an atmosphere that truly immerses you in Senua's tormented world.\nThe game's visual design is breathtaking. The landscapes are both beautiful and haunting, reflecting the duality of Senua's mind. The attention to detail, especially in the facial animations, is astonishing, further enhancing the emotional depth of the story.\nThe combat mechanisms are smooth and satisfying and they flow naturally with the story. Every interaction is intimate and difficult, as if Senua's inner demons were taking on physical shape. Every combat is an intense and thought-provoking experience because to the utilization of different perspectives and hallucinations, which adds another level of complexity to the action.\n\nBut the story of Hellblade is what really makes it stand out. The tragic and deep journey of Senua to save the soul of her deceased lover explores grief, guilt, and self-discovery.(I have to add that Dillion felt out of the place sometimes and even breaking immersion, but maybe im missing something). Melina Juergens' portrayal as Senua is nothing short of amazing! Senua's hardships drew me in on an emotional level, and I could feel her anguish, anxiety, and tenacity in every move.\nSenua's Sacrifice is more than just a game; it's a piece of art that respectfully and eloquently addresses serious issues. It serves as a reminder of the storytelling and empathetic potential of video games.

I finished it in less than 6 hours, got most of the lorestones during the story and the rest of the time I spent to get what I missed for the last achievement. So it was quite short, definitely grab it on a sale, it's not worth the full price. \nThe game is unique, I loved the art style, the mechanics were innovative, but anything else felt average. Combat is very basic - dodge, block, parry, heavy attack, light attack with no real combos, switching targets was well done and I liked that the voices are telling you when an enemy is about to strike from behind. The puzzles were also average, a little bit confusing at the beginning, but very cool designed. The forced backtracking was annoying and has no purpose other than artificially increasing the gameplay duration. Combine this with the fact that Senua can't move faster than my grandfather and it results in the game being more of a walking simulator with psychotic voices in your head that sometimes tell important story related stuff, but most of the time are useless thoughts.\nAll in all, I understand the people who say this game is overrated, but it's a good game, I had a good experience, it wasn't anything crazy.

I didn\u2019t know that much about it, but I was very impressed with the footage they\u2019ve shown of the upcoming sequel and wanted to see if the original game looked as good. And this game absolutely blew me away. Hellblade Senua\u2019s Sacrifice is one of the best games I\u2019ve played in a long time and it\u2019s a game that everyone should experience at some point. One of the best parts about it is the atmosphere. Hellblade is absolutely terrifying and one of the scariest games I have ever played. The world is horrifically beautiful and the game has a bleak and overwhelming sense of dread throughout it. The game has a lot to say, diving deep into Norse mythology, mental illness, and themes of acceptance. The story has a ton of depth to it, and it turns its relatively simple journey into a moving and powerful narrative. The acting is fantastic too, along with the sound design which is some of the best I have ever heard. The graphics are absolutely stunning, especially for such a small team. As for the gameplay, a lot of it is slow exploration, but the game never feels boring or slow. While it is pretty spaced out, the combat is incredible. The animations are insanely realistic, each hit feels impactful, and mastering the combat system was very satisfying. The enemy designs were great too, although sometimes it feels like they can have way too much health. The puzzles are the other main gameplay component and they were fun too. The game doesn\u2019t tell you anything which adds to the immersion, but can make you feel lost during these sections. You have to figure everything out on your own, which was fun, but some of the solutions were very obtuse and I had to look a few of them up. Missing something small or not finding a barely visible path can be a bit frustrating as well. This wasn\u2019t a huge issue in the grand scheme of things, and I have no problems with the game other than that. Senua\u2019s Sacrifice is a phenomenal game with beautiful visuals, a powerful narrative, and an extremely intense atmosphere that is absolutely worth playing. Definitely check this one out as soon as you can.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1683505870, "timestamp_updated": 1683505870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137971655": {"recommendationid": "137971655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120788819", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1683497345}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow... 2 hours in and I f-in' gate everything about this game.

You play as Senua, who is psychotic and hears voices in her head. These voices, dance around in the player's head, especially since the surround sound effects are really well done. The perfectly positioned sounds run through the entire game experience, allowing you to hear enemies behind you, solve puzzles or simply be harassed by the voices. \n\nOn her way to Hellblade, Senua has to solve various puzzles and fight enemies. The combat system is kept very simple and only consists of dodging, light attack, heavy attack and the special power, but it is still really fun and can also get intense as soon as you are attacked by 5 enemies at the same time. The more often you die, the harder the game becomes, especially as the shadow eats us up.\n\nThe overall atmosphere in Hellablade, which plays with light and shadow, is really spooky and very well done. It's a great way to immerse yourself in the game and enjoy the beautiful graphics and colour effects. Also the narrator's voice, which accompanies us permanently, adds to the atmosphere and makes the experience even more special.\n\nThe puzzles are relatively monotonous. Most of the time you are just looking for certain symbols that you can only recognise in certain places through special angles and viewpoints. Apart from that, there is also a labyrinth, which was particularly difficult (especially since it is not a labyrinth in the classical sense) and portals & masks - through which you travel to different worlds within a zone - to solve the puzzles.\n\nThe only annoying thing about the game was that there was a lot of backtracking in between. Apart from that, I have nothing to complain about. A really unique and exciting experience.

I recommend picking it up when it's on sale.\n\nLets start off with the Pros:\nThe graphics and effects are fantastic. The entire time I was playing I was like \"oh damn this looks amazing\". I can't stress that enough, 11/10 for graphics and effects.\nThe story is well told and engaging. I didn't pick up on a few things initially, but in hindsight it's pretty clear and really makes you think. If you're into Norse mythology at all you'll probably dig it. I won't say more than that for fear of spoilers.\n\nCons:\nPuzzles were kinda all the same; door is locked with runes, find them to unlock the door. Exploring was kinda punished in this way, because almost everywhere you might explore is where you'd have to come back to find a rune anyway.\nThe combat was pretty well done, but every encounter was basically the same after a while.\nIt's easy to get turned around and be unsure of which way is forward, especially in a certain area. The lack of any kind of tutorial cost me a few deaths as well, as I had to go into the options menu to see what keys did what in combat.\nInvisible walls. They're all over the place and I hate them. JUST STEP UP ON THAT ROCK FFS IT'S LIKE THREE INCHES TALL WHY CAN'T YOU WALK THERE.\nClipping is another issue. It feels like the game really wants you to focus on what you're looking at.. so when a texture egregiously clips through another, especially in some of the cutscenes, it really takes me out of it. It was only really bad a small handful of times, but with how beautiful and seamless the world is otherwise, it's a shame.\nAnd finally, the optimization. I have a 5900x, 32gb of 3600/CL16 RAM, and a 3080ti. At 1440p with everything on high except for Ray Tracing (which was on low) I got an average of 40fps with frequent dips to single digits. Turning DLSS on bumped that up to 150 in some areas, 80 in others, and fairly frequent dips to sub-30. DLSS made it so I didn't have to resort to lowering the resolution, but at some points I was really gritting my teeth.\nSpeaking of teeth: By the end of the game Seuna is bloody and dirty and beat to shit... but still her teeth and sciera (eyes) are this flawless white. For all the attention to detail... come on, throw some grit in those teeth, I just watched her puke black tar after being hit in the head with a mace, show some swelling and bruising, or at least put some blood vessels in her eyes! I mean really. A minor nitpick, I know, but like the clipping it's an easy thing to notice when the game is screaming at you FOCUS ON THIS SCENE IN ALL ITS DETAIL.\n\nConclusion:\nI beat it in a single session (~6 hours) and I'm happy that I had the time to do so because I feel like this game would occupy my every waking thought until I completed it.\nI paid like $8.50CAD for this game during a -75% off sale, and it was 100% worth it. I'm not sure I'd be happy with paying the full asking price of $33CAD today, but at $20CAD or less for me it's a no-brainer.\nHopefully they leraned some lessons from this and Hellblade 2 has a bit more polish, as I will almost certainly be buying Hellblade 2 the day it's released.", "timestamp_created": 1682703179, "timestamp_updated": 1682703179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137431265": {"recommendationid": "137431265", "author": {"steamid": "76561199019201807", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1686167126}, "language": "english", "review": "graphic is best. i thing story is so trash", "timestamp_created": 1682701161, "timestamp_updated": 1682701161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137418434": {"recommendationid": "137418434", "author": {"steamid": "76561199045023411", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 804, "last_played": 1692558322}, "language": "spanish", "review": "puro sexo.", "timestamp_created": 1682685536, "timestamp_updated": 1682685536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137404807": {"recommendationid": "137404807", "author": {"steamid": "76561199484991398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1682660643}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

The Unreal4 engine being used like this is absolutely beautiful.  I would recommend a system that can make use of the lighting aspects as that is a key feature of the experience the devs were going for.\n\nWonderful tale of a hero's journey but with a dark twist of mental illness.  I literally sat down and played the whole thing in one go.  Due to the nature of the development of the game it's non-linear in some aspects.  Engaging and the actress who portrays the main character really drew me in and made me believe their struggle.  Combat system is fluid and makes sense given the type of weapons she is using.  I think I only had some issues due to the limitations of my own hardware (60fps for 95% of time but I would get some moments where it would drop to 20fps and eff up my day)\n\nPuzzle solving is my only drawback of the game, kind of interrupted the flow for me a lot, but as I understand the puzzle solving is woven into the games mental illness representation.\n\nI have to say that their portrayal of psychosis is something that is about as accurate as I have ever heard it.  Being someone who does not experience psychosis I can only look to this game as the closest example.  The developers took their time and interviewed people who study and experience psychosis and really listened.  I have a family member whom (without their medication) will start experiencing the same symptoms.  One of the best mental health issue representations I have ever seen, the use of a binaural microphone with the voices really made me feel unsettled and the constant whiplash between supportive and downright cruel is..upsetting, but in a good way.\n\nAll in all I truly recommend this title as a wonderful piece of art.  I wish I could go more into the mythology of the game, but Norse and Celtic mythology is not something I am very knowledgeable on beyond surface level.  Can't wait for the sequel on the Unreal5 engine.  Gonna be fantastic.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1682577003, "timestamp_updated": 1682577003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137356957": {"recommendationid": "137356957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064947771", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1682574772}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate ASMR so this game is a big NO", "timestamp_created": 1682575419, "timestamp_updated": 1682575419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477178424596786499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137353985": {"recommendationid": "137353985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416977278", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1694926490}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Toda la experiencia del juego fue grandiosa, los paisajes muy hermosos, juega con tus sentidos, y el combate es muy bueno y hermosos de ver.", "timestamp_created": 1682568310, "timestamp_updated": 1682568310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137350182": {"recommendationid": "137350182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055145817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1682560114}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible", "timestamp_created": 1682560444, "timestamp_updated": 1682560444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137337628": {"recommendationid": "137337628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107477769", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 455, "last_played": 1682482469}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego y muy buena historia, muy recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1682537795, "timestamp_updated": 1682537795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137323879": {"recommendationid": "137323879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002316424", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1682518194}, "language": "spanish", "review": "De esos juegos que hay que jugarlos.

lacks some of the fundamental elements that standard video games are built upon.from a different point of view it may be considered an innovative action and i respect that view and to some people it may be fun to experience , but definitely not for me, when i look at it, I see a walking simulator with some added flavors like repetitive puzzles and boring combat to push it into becoming a video game,and it definitely fails at it.\nCombat at first feels nice with polished animations and sound design but quickly becomes very boring , some fights take way too long for no reason , you just mindlessly click your mouse and dodge until it's over and once it's over you don't even feel you've accomplished anything, you are just happy that it ended , like a torture and then when it comes to the puzzles , it's the same story , from the start of the game, puzzle mechanic is the same till the end of the game with one exception in one of the chapters which doesn't even add that much variety to make it worth talking about it.\nThe game is visually very appealing and sound design is adding so much to the dark atmospheric feeling of the game, but to me it's way too much , the voices in your head are just talking almost non stop throughout the entire game, sometimes they were making me feel dizzy,also there is no way to turn them off and even if you could you would be missing an important tool to fight because these voices help you in the fights telling you if you are being attacked from behind or if you should focus, ... which i it think is an interesting mechanic(a positive point) to be ruined with a boring combat.\nThe game definitely succeeds in creating a dark , hellish and brutal world with a depressed ,sad and deceived protagonist gradually falling into the darkness to then rise from it by confronting and overcoming it. hopefully this journey doesn't take too long and considering what the game is aiming to be , i think pacing is fine.\nAt the end I think this game is really overrated and definitely not for everyone but for a few game enthusiasts seeking new experiences and maybe a group of players that don't look for ''traditional video game feelings'' in a game and are open to experience something somewhat new.", "timestamp_created": 1682285981, "timestamp_updated": 1682285981, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

It transports you to a state of mind that is very subjective and overbearing. The game is a marvel to look at and listen to. Especially appreciated the soundscape and how it's interwoven to the gameplay. The characters are very well written, developed and brought to life. \n\nThe gameplay itself is fine. Nothing to write home about, but with a few core loops that have enough variation in pace to keep things fresh, interesting and moving forward. The battle is a bit repetitive, though and probably the weakest aspect of the game, which, considering this was made by Ninja Theory, says something about their priorities. I don't mind that, as much. I was here for the story and world building. It's just that gameplay frequently felt disconnected to the story or themes of the game. Inorganic. And, judged on itself, the fighting mechanics are dull. \n\nExtra kudos for the lack of a HUD, map, objectives etc, opting instead for in-world logic prompts and that excellent sound design. Even though it's a very restricted, linear path, I sometimes got lost or confused, which added to this particular experience. Due to the linearity of the level design, though, I never needed to check an online guide. With a little patience and attention, I could still figure out things. \n\nIf you are looking for a chill time, or a brutal beat 'em up, look somewhere else. This isn't pop corn entertainment. There are heavy themes explored in a way that takes a toll on you. Even though it took me 8,6 hours of gameplay to complete, I took a few weeks break in the middle, playing other stuff, because the atmosphere was a bit too overbearing to handle in one go. It started getting under my skin. \n\nHighly recommended.

It's a short experience that doesn't overstay its welcome and manages to tell a simple yet emotional story with an in-depth look at a severe mental illness. It's hard to separate truth from fiction in Senua's Sacrifice but the journey the hero takes makes sense within the confines of the story. At face value it's a classic hero's journey to the depths of hell to find and save her lover's soul but the additional layers it provides with the psychosis angle adds depth that may not have been seen previously in a video game. It could have been a walking simulator that only features puzzles that are mostly fun and intuitive but I'm thankful Ninja Theory also decided to break up the exploration with a simple but fun combat system.

The twist? Senua suffers from extreme psychosis, which alters the way in which she perceives reality, and this trait is the focal point of your journey. Hellblade is an action-adventure game with heavy focus on exploration and puzzle solving, and illusions that twist reality are fully integrated in how not only Senua perceives the world, but also as a core mechanic needed to solve puzzles and advance through the adventure.\n\nBut what makes Hellblade its own thing, is the inmersion. Right off the bat, the game tells you to use headphones while playing it, and for good reason: Senua will hear voices throughout her quest that will talk to her, and assist her both in exploration and combat.\n\nIt's incredible how central this mechanic is, and how well it is implemented in every aspect of the game - graphics, settings, sound, combat, storytelling and direction...Hellblade might not be the best game ever created, but it could be the most immersive experience a videogame has been able to create.\n\nTake for example combat - it is not focal to the adventure, it is well done and well balanced, but rather simple and enemy variety is not its strong point, but a couple of boss battles make full extent of Senua's psychosis as a mechanic, and even in normal combats, it is focal - there is no UI, no life bar, no markers showing enemy positioning, nothing. Only Senua's perception which gets bleaker as she gets closer to defeat, and the voices which assist you, telling you when you are in danger, if you're surrounded etc...\n\nThe game is rather short (7-8 hours) but given its intensity, it's the perfect lenght for it. Creators even added a 20-some minute long documentary in which they explained how they created a game as special as this and is the perfect closure for your experience with Hellblade.\n\nAs a player who always puts action over exploration and who is easily annoyed by puzzles, Hellblade was rather tough on me at first (the infamous Valrand section, which will be one fo your the first two sections you play) discouraged me at first, but the game grew on me as the story advanced and I ended up loving it.\n\nSolid 8.5/10 and a masterful piece of art", "timestamp_created": 1681758116, "timestamp_updated": 1681758116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136869215": {"recommendationid": "136869215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236538590", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 459, "last_played": 1681754337}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice to finished the game", "timestamp_created": 1681754563, "timestamp_updated": 1681754563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136835873": {"recommendationid": "136835873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039769194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1682390317}, "language": "english", "review": "Painfully accurate but somehow validating", "timestamp_created": 1681693399, "timestamp_updated": 1681693399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136831684": {"recommendationid": "136831684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202369602", "num_games_owned": 2653, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1681781393}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that tries to imitate the GoW series but there is no degree of comparison between the two, a good story although it is short, some puzzles give you a headache, but you get the hang of them quite quickly, in short I recommend it in a weekend evening if you want to pass something quickly and with a good story.", "timestamp_created": 1681686110, "timestamp_updated": 1681686110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493506491184234619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136829389": {"recommendationid": "136829389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215668501", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1681682509}, "language": "english", "review": "This is every bit the psychological thriller it is touted to be.

However, Hellblade does not feel like just any game. Hellblade is truly unique, a game of AAA quality made by just 20 developers, without a hint of the typical AAA greed I've come to expect whatsoever. Hellblade also goes beyond just a game by attempting to accurately portray psychosis and help reduce stigma surrounding mental health by allowing people without psychosis to somewhat experience what it might be like, and helping them to empathize with those who are affected. (Ninja Theory video on this for those who are interested: https://youtu.be/HM0yaCFwHDE).

I really came to care about this character over the course of the game. The actor portarying her does an amazing job the facial expressions/animations are so good. \n2.The Voices Senua hears voices these voices act as a turtorial at times but they are mostly there to second guess Senua and the players actions (though sometimes they cheer you on). In combat they warn you of enemies attacking from behind while also discouraging or encouraging you depending on the voice. This made combat feel pretty tense like I was being judged for every missed parry or dodge, I liked it it added to the paranoia and doubt the game is going for.\n3.Combat was fine, it felt sluggish at times but I enjoyed parrying and when I was in the grove it was fun but it deff won\u2019t be for everyone. I found it more engaging than 2018 God of War\u2019s combat.\n4.Puzzles mostly perspective stuff which made sense since Senua sees the world differently. Some of these puzzles are pretty clever There were also some parts that reminded me of Little Nightmares only without the wonky platforming. Looking for Runes got a bit tiring toward the end though (used a guide for some of them).\n5.The Environments or fucking gorgeous this is a damn pretty game at times and a damn scary one at others. Some of the imagery is real gnarly and I loved it (This is a horror game). \n6.Bosses are challenging and fun in this at least for me they were. Not going to say much more about them except that the bird like one was my favorite.\n7.Random other stuff the game does a great job at making Senua look dirty and bloody it really looks like she has been through/going through Hel inside and out. The other Voice actors do great in this game. I love how enemies react when you deflect their weapon back at them. The music is really good.\n8.The lack of button prompts during tutorials threw me off but the controls are right there every time you pause the game. \n9.Dillion is a silly name.\nWild that the same developers who made Kung Fu Chaos would make such an empathetic and thoughtful game.", "timestamp_created": 1680963561, "timestamp_updated": 1680963561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136347257": {"recommendationid": "136347257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008969726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1680962643}, "language": "english", "review": "About as perfect as any 30 dollar game can be. \n\nCompletely original, graphically beautiful, simple but fun combat.

I thought they were a creative way of using the idea of vision being the focus of magic in the ancient world; you find the truth by searching and literally focusing to reveal the path forward through the supernatural world of Helheim. I also liked the nods to more obscure Celtic lore (not Norse as that is there in spades, but specifically Celtic references such as the geilt). There were also very gorgeous scenes I came upon, despite my rig not being able to optimize it in Geforce.\nCombat was a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, it is serviceable hack-and-slash with entertaining combos and techniques that can be pulled off. It is also one of the few times I found the voices in Senua's head to be somewhat helpful. On the other hand, combat in a broad sense feels more tacked on in order to pad out the game time with only certain fights really progressing the story. Although there is a significant mechanic based around combat, it feels more like an afterthought for what is primarily a cinematic game.\nThis last part is where I have trouble recommending Senua's Sacrifice to most gamers as I personally do not like games that are made to feel like long, interactive, animated movies. Senua's Sacrifice feels as though it is part of the trend of AAA games (although it comes from a middle-market studio) that is made to be more of a cinematic experience than an actual game. There is no player agency in Senua's decisions and no branching paths, just one track leading from level to level. While an on-the-rails game can be perfectly executed, Senua's Sacrifice doesn't itch the same scratch as more attention seems to have been given to the story and melodrama of Senua's journey than the actual gameplay. While the effort of Ninja Theory shows in certain sections, such as ones where you are challenged to use other senses than pure \"gamer instinct\", I could not get over the feeling that I was being strung along through a melancholic mood piece with the same self-indulgence as an A24 film. The cinematics at best showcased interesting motion capture technology blended with live action superimpositions, and at worst made me roll my eyes and wait for them to be over with.\nWhile I understand that the game is meant to replicate psychosis and includes different deterrents and themes that served to present that experience, I found it to be one of the more frustrating parts of the game. The voices are one of the worst parts of this game. While I wanted to turn them off to play in peace, I felt forced to leave them on in case I needed a hint in combat or exploration or maybe to listen to tidbits of lore as they came. The self-doubt/self-encouragement dichotomy the voices engage in that becomes a theme as you continue through the game is also grating as one minute the voices are telling Senua that she's worthless but then the next they hyper her up like she's had secret powers inside her this whole time. This relates back to my gripe about this not really feeling like a game per say but a showcase of good looking graphics, interesting methods of using sight and sound in gameplay, and this particular character's journey through grief and insanity.\nBy the end of the game I was not really sure how to feel. I understood what happened but felt rather unfulfilled. I did not particularly connect with Senua although I understood her grief and story throughout the game. In fact, I found her somewhat annoying as she would switch between doubting herself and suddenly acting confident or break the fourth wall completely to make some pseudo-philosophical comment. In fact, I found myself pitying her more than empathizing with her, which oddly might be how she would be perceived in her culture as treatment for mental illnesses was almost non-existent. Still, there was some odd link that I felt in the sense that the characters used modern ways of speaking and talked about more modern concepts, which only broke immersion a few times.\nI really wanted to like Senua's Sacrifice but I can only confidently call it \"alright.\" This is best acquired on sale if you are dying to get this game.

Dunno that I'd replay it a 3rd+ time; at that point I imagine the novelty of the story & gameplay may wear off.  But that's fine -- one playthrough and checking it out in VR later's enough to say it leaves a strong positive impression.\n\nFelt all the more impressive to have played it while a psychology-field-familiar friend spectated, and hear them comment on things they noticed & I didn't, all while complimenting how well the whole game world was presented.  The entertainment industry is generally lacking in well-produced, well-executed titles featuring either non-sexualized women in leading action roles, or respectful presentation of characters facing the same kinds of internal struggles as this one did, so to see all of it done at the same time made this game seem all the more like a standout.\n\nI played the first half on a Steam Deck docked to a TV, and it ran impressively well.  But the latter half of a game really shone when played in a computer, arguably less so because of the better GPU being able to do raytracing, and more because I was using far superior audio hardware & headphones.

The entire game is built around this eerily accurate portrayal of psychosis, and what that means for both the protagonist, Senua, and her journey as a whole. Are the foes and forces she faces real or part of her repressed trauma coming to light? That line is constantly blurred, which is in and of itself an apt description of those who deal with these types of hallucinatory mental disorders; what is \"real\" takes on a whole new meaning for people with psychosis because what they experience [i]is[/i] real for them. Anyone who has interacted with someone going through psychosis, dementia, schizophrenia, or any type of reality bending disorders will resonate deeply with this game's story and characters.\n\n+ Animations, especially facial, are so well done; the animation and motion capture brings so much life into Senua's struggle. It's impossible not to connect with her on a deep emotional level and to feel every bit of confusion, anger, and sadness that boils up to the surface amidst traumatic memories and terrifying hallucinations.\n\n+ Nordic mythology acts as the backdrop to the story, which helps sell that feeling of mysticism and uncertainty surrounding Senua's condition. Throughout history mental disorders have been misunderstood, and even attributed to having been both blessed by the gods or cursed with some unholy corruption. This story leans heavily on the latter, and shows how ancient Celtic civilization would have vilified Senua due to her condition and caused tremendous trauma that would only make her worse.\n\n+ The combat is simple, cinematic, and satisfactory. It's nothing special, but it gets the job done and feels good when you get into a flow. The game does a good job at making you feel like with every strike and every dead foe, Senua is (literally) fighting her demons and conquering her trauma.\n\n+ Puzzles are clever and play into the whole hallucination factor, often seeing runes made out of normal objects or changing reality based on perspective. It all fits perfectly into the overarching story.\n\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- Combat can be too simple for some tastes. The damage you can take, even on hard difficulty, is extremely forgiving and the same can be said for the amount of times you can \"die\". This makes it so combat feels less dire and ultimately just a break between story points.\n\n- It's short, which is fine for a story-driven game, but I would love to see a fuller game built around this same character and concept. One that has a slower burn and can afford a larger level design with some limited exploration and more interaction between the character and the environment.\n\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nBase game completed:  YES\nDLC completed:  N/A\nRating:  8 / 10 - Very Good", "timestamp_created": 1680672329, "timestamp_updated": 1680672329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136119007": {"recommendationid": "136119007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004401135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1644597022}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing game.

I love the fact that the game doesn't overstay it's welcome, and effectively uses it's entire lenght to maximum without making me feel like it was getting stretched or that it was cut short. \n\nAnother (subjective) plus is that I managed to get 100% in my first playthrough. Sure, this doesn't make the game that replayable if you're an achievement hunter, but it invites replayability just through the story, the settings, and gameplay. Therefore, replaying the game is more like rewatching your favorite movie rather than experiencing the game in a new way.\n\nI love the art, the music, the atmosphere, the themes, the story everything is great. But, for the sake of not spoiling anything, I won't detail what I liked at each point in the game.\n\nThe only real downside is how the game seems to throw enemies at you at random points. Also, during certain points, you will be able to tell when you're about to enter an arena. \n\nSenua is a great character, beautifully acted and voiced. Also, the audio in general is probably the best audio I've ever heard in a game.

The voices that you hear, makes you miss them when they're gone in a strange messed up way. None of the things Senua goes through are good but you're glad that you went through them with her. That's my take on the psychological trauma she battles through.\n\nIn the end, the game is mainly a story telling one, with a few simple puzzles and a nice handful of enemies to fight along the way. A lot of players didn't think there were enough fighting but that's just an opinion, try not to focus too much on the combat and more on the battling that's going on in Senua's head.\nTotal Score = 94/100.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nSet in a dark fantasy world inspired by Norse mythology and Celtic culture, the game follows Senua, a Pict warrior who must make her way to Helheim by defeating otherworldly entities and facing their challenges, in order to rescue the soul of her dead lover from the goddess Hela.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nGod of War, Sekiro\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 9 / 10\nDon't let the shadows consume you.\n\nRECOMMEDED SPECS\nOS: Windows 10\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-4690 / AMD FX-9370\nGraphics: AMD Radeon R9 290X / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nStorage: 30 GB", "timestamp_created": 1680179458, "timestamp_updated": 1680179590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.82961505651473999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135728757": {"recommendationid": "135728757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025054625", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1680131446}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 What a blast!

It's hard to separate truth from fiction in Senua's Sacrifice but the journey the hero takes makes sense within the confines of the story. At face value it's a classic hero's journey to the depths of hell to find and save her lover's soul but the additional layers it provides with the psychosis angle adds depth that may not have been seen previously in a video game. It could have been a walking simulator that only features puzzles that are mostly fun and intuitive but I'm thankful Ninja Theory also decided to break up the exploration with a simple but fun combat system.

Artistically speaking, this game succeeds with all its intentions. I've seen someone look at the ceiling and scream \"shut up\" at absolutely nothing. After finding myself aggravated by the constant voices in the game, I can see what would bring a person to react that way. It almost felt instinctive to pull my headphones off at some points because I wanted it to stop. The narrative and messages of the game began to feel a little scattered by the end, but the idea of confronting one's inner darkness was presented very well throughout the whole game. It was interesting to see the character face the camera and speak to the player, as if the developers were using soliloquy to draw the player further into the experience. I wanted to know how and why Senua was responsible for the destruction of her village. Maybe that was explained, but it felt like the story had some details that needed more presentation to stand out. Dillian's death, and how Senua came to possess his disembodied head, were vague points for me. I especially enjoyed the first scene in which Senua spoke to her mother through the statue with a face on it. The words \"there is nothing wrong with seeing the world as you do\" stuck out to me. I was reminded of something Jean-Paul Sartre called the problem of the Other, which is a way in which people separate each other from each other through an instinctive negative reaction. When a person sees another, they do not see an individual with their own subjective reality. The person viewing the other sees only an object to be overcome and dismissed. Further, I recalled R.D. Laing's criticism of how the medical community treated schizophrenics, which seemed centred on completely dismissing their hallucinations as irrational nonsense. Ongoing and extreme hallucinations can be as valid a part of anyone's reality as anything else. Perhaps through taking time to understand the nature and sources of these hallucinations and experiences, then treatment of the individual's psychosis would become easier. By disregarding their experiences we miss out on the human element of any sort of treatment. My primary complaints with the game come from the complete lack of explanation of combat, and the nature of some of the staring puzzles. Combat feels sluggish and repetitive to players who have not been given an understanding of the game's nifty combo system, the functionality of the jumping and kicking attacks, or to the point behind staring at objects or runes. Fighting and puzzles became fun around halfway through the game after I had deduced some of these things myself. The player should have been given a mention of these things, or a quick two minute introduction of sorts to these mechanics. Some of the places and objects at which one was supposed to stare felt pretty nebulous, even for a game intended to be that way. The lore stones were nice and seemed to parallel the main story, but attaching an achievement to finding all of them made the idea feel overused and a constant disruption to the immersion. I think the game could stand some optimisation as well. I was streaming this game with a nice quality gaming laptop, but still encountered a few glitches and a blue screen at one point. The game also made my fan run unusually fast, which shouldn't happen with my current hardware and a game that is six years old. This was a wonderful experience, and I've ended up playing it at a great time for myself. Well done, Ninja Theory.

It's difficult to not recommend it either. Alas, there is no mixed option.\n\nRight, cons first;\n-For a game you spend ton of your time walking, movement truly feels ridiculously clunky and it's not uncommon to get stuck between two slight bumps on the path and have to restart the game from last checkpoint. \n-FOV is so tiny that with ease I can count Senua's individual dandruffs, buddy I played with got motion sickness and had to stop watching couple of times. \n-Puzzles are boring and Lorestones as optional objective messes with the flow of the game as instead of progressing naturally you walk, painfully slowly, back to find the ones you've missed.\n-Combat is passable, I guess, though it's inconsistent and becomes confusing in groups of enemies as there's no way to disengage to reposition so you mash dodge in hopes that maybe, just maybe, game will let you move to a spot that let's you see whatever the hell is happening.\n-Game runs bad. Not always, just one second for every twentieth second it will slow to a crawl. Disorienting to say the least (thankfully this happens less and less as you progress). \n-Lastly, the story WANTS you to put the pieces together, I really like that it doesn't shove everything in your face and you naturally come to understand things leading to the game's events. Sadly, it's underwhelming. \n\nReading all this you might say, well I should stay the hell away from this game. Maybe, maybe...but hear me out.\n\nThis game has an amazing sense of design and pacing (forgetting about Lorestones). It has a way to grip you from the start and drip-feed you context and story bites. Graphics are delight to look at and environments are so superbly made that you can't help but mess around in photo mode for every new area you step in. Sound design is fantastic and it achieves a delicious sense of dread all the way to the finish line. \n\nTons of potential to this game, lots of great things in it, but as a standalone it bleeds out from hundred little cuts. So I will definitely check out to see if the sequel addresses some of the issues I've listed, mainly the story. So this review is subject to change.\n\n**(if you like smoking a little giggle smoke, jolly green, la lechuga del diablo, dinkie dow, jazz cabbage; disregard all the cons listed and just enjoy the terrifying ride.)**", "timestamp_created": 1679653357, "timestamp_updated": 1680011172, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514229297637939453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135294382": {"recommendationid": "135294382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032038407", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1508045294}, "language": "english", "review": "over hyped, gameplay boring", "timestamp_created": 1679650355, "timestamp_updated": 1679650355, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135285512": {"recommendationid": "135285512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198858392734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 475, "last_played": 1637270266}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome first game i got all the steam awards for.", "timestamp_created": 1679637778, "timestamp_updated": 1679637778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135285466": {"recommendationid": "135285466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395977337", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 840, "last_played": 1679637600}, "language": "spanish", "review": "master class en todo", "timestamp_created": 1679637707, "timestamp_updated": 1679637707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135266034": {"recommendationid": "135266034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179074627", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 667, "last_played": 1679610236}, "language": "english", "review": "its a great game and its unique in its own way and its amazing 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1679610321, "timestamp_updated": 1679610321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135219093": {"recommendationid": "135219093", "author": {"steamid": "76561199445800036", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1129, "last_played": 1684234245}, "language": "english", "review": "Atmosphere in this game is incredible.", "timestamp_created": 1679563574, "timestamp_updated": 1679563574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135216648": {"recommendationid": "135216648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014898762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1679493561}, "language": "english", "review": "so proud of my computer for being able to run this", "timestamp_created": 1679560040, "timestamp_updated": 1679560040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135211569": {"recommendationid": "135211569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100497507", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1681608929}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La historia es incre\u00edble: la narrativa, el balance entre di\u00e1logos y acci\u00f3n, el gameplay no se siente interrumpido por la trama...

It's hard to separate truth from fiction in Senua's Sacrifice but the journey the hero takes makes sense within the confines of the story. At face value it's a classic hero's journey to the depths of hell to find and save her lover's soul but the additional layers it provides with the psychosis angle adds depth that may not have been seen previously in a video game. It could have been a walking simulator that only features puzzles that are mostly fun and intuitive but I'm thankful Ninja Theory also decided to break up the exploration with a simple but fun combat system. My only real complaint about the gameplay was that the character movement in the exploration sections is a bit stiff and traversing terrain in order to solve some puzzles took more time than it was necessary.

la cual le da dinamismo a la historia, es un estilo muy sencillo y te resultara f\u00e1cil aprender a usarlo.\n-La exploraci\u00f3n; es cierto que es limitada ya que no es un mapa abierto como tal , pero el juego te incentiva a explorar para escuchar mas historias sobre al mitolog\u00eda , las cuales si las obtienes todas , te desbloqueara un dialogo secreto.\n-El tema puzzles , en general es bueno , al principio es repetitivo, pero, conforme vas avanzando en la historia estos se vuelven mas complejos y muy originales.\n\nTambi\u00e9n me gustar\u00eda destacara que este juego tarta el tema de la psicosis, este es el tema principal de la obra, la cual padeci\u00f3 la madre de nuestra protagonista y nosotros en este juego, d\u00e1ndole trama a la historia de forma \u00fanica, a esto a\u00f1\u00e1dele el contaste parloteo de voces en nuestra mente las cuales nos ayudan ,se contradicen entre ellas , nos retrasan y da\u00f1an.\n\nEn mi opini\u00f3n ju\u00e9galo tu mismo, ya que este es un titulo el cual solo tu mismo puedes decidir si te gusta o no\n\nPARA MI 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1679343384, "timestamp_updated": 1681101224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135044510": {"recommendationid": "135044510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987704525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 490, "last_played": 1679324421}, "language": "english", "review": "I learnt the hard way to not be afraid of death, Senua.

One of the major components of the game are voices you hear due to your mental state, they often insult you, taunt you however sometimes they can be useful, suggesting a useful hint to complete a puzzle. Music is also rather enjoyable. Puzzles are by far the weakest and most annoying part of the game, some them are outright unintuitive and boring, breaking the dynamic of game. Fighting is okay-ish, although it feels smooth some might find it bland but just mind this is not your average game where you play as buffed up hero. Representation of Norse mythology is done nicely without any cringe modern takes so it all adds up to the experience. Apart from puzzles it is quite short and linear(7-8 hrs) which is another con. \n\nAt the end, would I recommended this game?

El juego te pone en la piel de Senua y te hace escuchar sus voces, que te gu\u00edan, te confunden o te critican seg\u00fan les d\u00e9. El combate es intenso y fluido, pero tambi\u00e9n tiene un riesgo: si mueres demasiadas veces, el juego se borra y tienes que empezar de nuevo. As\u00ed que m\u00e1s te vale estar atento y no distraerte con las vistas, que son espectaculares. Hellblade es un juego \u00fanico y valiente, que explora temas como la psicosis, el trauma y el amor con una sensibilidad y una calidad art\u00edstica impresionantes. Eso s\u00ed, no esperes re\u00edrte mucho con \u00e9l, porque es m\u00e1s bien una tragedia griega con vikingos.", "timestamp_created": 1679205914, "timestamp_updated": 1679205914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134937496": {"recommendationid": "134937496", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973762889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1679199376}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful.

This is gonna be a long one.\nI don't often review games nor do I often feel the need to review games. But with Senua's Sacrifice I felt like I just had no choice. I was tempted to just leave a joke review, something like, \"average day with ADHD\", but Senua's deserves more than that.\nI first bought this game three years ago on my Xbox One. Funnily enough my therapist, who's big into story games, is the one who recommended this to me. I'm a person who's dealt with schizophrenia for around 7 years at this point-- I'm 19 now, so if you can imagine a 12 year old trying to deal with that then you can try and sympathize. I wish there was more to say about it other than that I just woke up with it one day and it hasn't gone away since. It felt catastrophic at first. I felt like I could never know what was real-- like I never knew if I was still dreaming or not. That's probably the best way to put it. I was balancing my middle school and high school years with trying to cope with what felt like an undeserved punishment from God. Or that, there couldn't possibly be a God who would thrust this upon a child. But it got better. I got medicated, and with a lot of trial and error (and even more self-acceptance), I've gotten to a point in my life where I feel like it doesn't affect me. It comes in waves and now, thankfully, most of the time I'm all good. I haven't had a harmful episode in about two years, and with continued support from my psychiatrist and therapist, I know I will be able to live the rest of my (hopefully) many years on this planet. I'm at peace with myself, or at least I think.\n\nI bought Senua's Sacrifice three years ago, like I said. This was immediately following a pretty bad episode that led to a lot of discord in my family. A few of my ties with family members were really strained and they still haven't really healed yet. I had gotten on new medication and it helped tremendously. I didn't know much about Senua's when I bought it-- all I knew was that it was meant to represent what having schizophrenia was like, or something like that. My therapist thought that it might help me deal with what I was feeling at the time, knowing that games can be a good escape from reality. So, I opened the game and sat through the opening scene, where Senua is in the boat. Or at least, I tried to. After most of the way through, I had tears welling up in my eyes and I felt my heart beating out of my chest. I threw my headphones off and cried in my bed for half an hour. I couldn't stop thinking about the voices in the game: \"Go back!\", and \"What is she doing?\" kept ringing in my head. Those two lines really hit close to home. After I pulled myself back together, I shut the game off and forgot about it to play some more Overwatch. I tried my very hardest to completely forget about Senua's Sacrifice.\n\nFast forward a year later and I'm scrolling through my Xbox library and find Senua's eyes staring at me from the menu. I was hit with the memories of her voices talking to you through the screen and felt like crying again. But it had been a year, and I thought I was ready. So, I started the game back up and managed to get through the opening scene without freaking out. But that was where it stopped-- the tears came back in full effect once she got off the log raft. But that didn't stop me from playing. I kept through the tutorial area with tears in my eyes, but fully invested in the game. I knew the voices weren't mine, as much as they sounded like it. I knew they were Senua's, and I wanted to be here to experience them for her. Honestly, I played through the game with tears in my eyes for most of it. I had never in my life felt so connected to a game before. Every voice, every doubt, every encouragement-- I felt it deep in my soul. While obviously I can't speak for every schizophrenic person, and while the game certainly stylizes some things for the sake of gameplay: this game is a heart-rending masterpiece, a melancholic and beautiful representation of something I've lived with for so long. And I hope other people who live with schizophrenia will play this game, if they can get past the very triggering aspects that it certainly does have. Thank you, Ninja Theory, for creating something that so masterfully represents a thing that almost no one can explain.\n[b] And for any schizophrenic person who's reading this, whoever you are, do not forget about your support system. I know it is easy to forget them when you're having an episode, so write it down somewhere you'll see every day. There are people who love you and will treat you as a person no matter how you might sound to them. And they will be there for you, whether or not you know you need it. [/b]\n\nIn summary, please buy this game. I bought it on Steam just so I could experience it again with the new graphical update.

I mean\u2026 wow. The only similar medium that managed to present me a mental illness so well was only a book Welt im R\u00fccken by Thomas Melle where the writer describes his own experience with his own mental illness (bipolar disorder). But unlike a book, a game has much more means to deliver you the message and experience. And creators of Senua's Sacrifice used all their means to the max. The sounds, the voices \"in your head\", the visual sensations, the hellish surroundings\u2026 I just could feel all the professional counselling behind the game and the decision to stay true to it till the end. Only this new life experience, this possibility to \"live\" through such a unique life and to see and hear the world differently would be worth of buying. \n\nBut Senua's Sacrifice added more: simple yet very strong story everyone can at least partially identify themselves with, tons of emotions, Nordic myths, imaginative (and quite horrifying) settings, great dub, great sound effects and music, amazing acting. I loved the main character - a woman that is incredibly strong yet still feeling, caring, gentle. Oh, and it's the third game in my life that made me cry like a little girl. \n\n+ unique life experience which most game don't even try to deliver (and which Senua delivered excellently) \n+ story \n+ characters\n+ settings\n+ music and sounds\n+ fights\n+ puzzles\n\n- nothing. Not a single negative thing in entire game. \n\n~ one point I cannot really figure out how I feel about. It's a literally game-experience changing information, so don't read if you are not really, really sure, you don't mind super-big spoilers. \n[spoiler]The permanent death hoax the game gives you on it's beginning. On one hand, it made every fight incredibly intense and I was really proud of myself when I didn't died. I never felt like it actually matters whether I do a mistake or not in a game before and I enjoyed the fights much less after I learn the truth by mistake. On the other hand, it was the reason why I nearly didn't bought the game, postponed it for a year, and then played it for several months. Only AFTER I watched most of it on Youtube.

I usually joke around in my reviews but I can't here; I'm too impressed by the ways in which this game manages to immerse me into the experience of psychosis. By the end of the game you feel like you better understand what it's like for people with hallucination and delusion-based mental illnesses, especially as the game merges those experiences with regular video game mechanics. Finding the Nordic runes in shadows, branches, poles etc. representing the ways psychotic patients see patterns others don't is SO clever, as is the decision to have the voices both help Senua in combat and belittle or threaten her. You feel so closely with Senua and her experience/mindset by the end that seeing her realize Dillion is truly gone despite all our best efforts is as heartbreaking for you as it is for her. \n\nJudging it through the lens of a video game, it has a nice variation of beautiful locales you can pass through--it has a very linear progression so that you can't really explore, but it fits with Senua's goal (she's not there to wander). Valravn's area is particularly impressive despite him being the \"first\" boss--Hela totally pales in comparison to that creepy, twitchy floating creature who disappears when you pass around a tree trunk, and his chants as you close in are terrifying. The illusion gates and lining up the raven symbols were so cool and really emphasized his theme of nothing really being real. The other puzzles were also fun and diverse, especially the Trials (the Blind trial could have been its own horror game omfg, WHAT WERE THOSE GROWLY BLOB THINGS). I also REALLY like the [spoiler----->] decision to lie to the player by saying if you die too much, the game resets; it's just another one of the many ways the game puts you in Senua's mindset, because if she fails, everything is lost. \n\nThe only cons I could think of is that 1) it's far too short, I beat in ~8 hours, and 2) the combat system is simplistic and a bit clunky. The auto-target is a minor frustration because you can't choose which Northman Senua attacks, so she'll book it for the guy across the room when she's got a berserker to the left swinging axes at her. The bosses had some cool combat mechanics, but the Northmen started to get repetitive after a while. For some reason the Sea of Corpses (another area with incredible design) had this one fight with like 10+ enemies in a row that was harder than anywhere else in the game despite being the midpoint. Story has always been a priority over gameplay for me though so at most this is a blip on an otherwise perfect experience.\n\nI cannot recommend this highly enough.

However maybe the efforts were misdirected?\n\nMost games have long periods where the player has total control over the protagonist, interspersed with story-driving \"cut-scenes\" where the player has limited or no control. I don't mind cut-scenes as long as they are not too long and don't take over the protagonist's actions too much. Indeed cut-scenes involving a player decision for branching a game story are great because they maintain player involvement. In contrast for me Hellblade is a long cut-scene interspersed with periods of game play where the player has limited control of the protagonist.\n\nMuch of the game is a mostly linear walking simulator with puzzles which start interesting, but soon become repetitive. Then there are interludes of combat using mechanics which feel very QTE driven. In fact I soon learnt that there is a strategy to combat involving the right timing of dodge, block and attack which made the encounters become repetitive and rather boring, especially right at the end. There is a lot of Norse mythology to be listened to, although it forced a slower pace of the game to hear it all, especially with the other dialogue going on.\n\nThe \"experience\" part of Hellblade was good, but the game part was lacking, and that is why this is one of the rare times that I have to give it the thumbs down. The experience, and the story that the developers where trying to convey, would have been better delivered as 3D animated movie, something that I would have been happy to watch on Netflix. If the developers want to make more games then I suggest that they return to the style of Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.", "timestamp_created": 1676223882, "timestamp_updated": 1676223882, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491329491138458252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132716709": {"recommendationid": "132716709", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037193002", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1242, "last_played": 1676218102}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece of interactive storytelling and a must-play for any fan of the action-adventure genre.

On the one hand, its story, presentation, and voice acting are all top-notch, and can make for a gripping experience.  I'm not an expert in mental health, but from what I've heard, the game portrays psychosis very well.  On the other hand, the experience of actually playing the game is just as often fiddly, frustrating, or just plain tedious.  Overall, I'd probably recommend it, but with some reservations.\n\nFirst of all, the game makes a really interesting choice in minimizing non-diagetic elements.  It has very few UI elements, and instead delivers information through the voices in Senua's head.  This is a good decision, I think, in that it helps bring us into Senua's perspective better, but it does come at a cost.  In particular, the game often doesn't communicate certain things very clearly at all, to the point where I wasn't even aware I could do certain things until I looked up the controls in the menu.  This problem contributes to some other problems, as we'll see below.\n\nThe combat is fairly engaging at first.  Unfortunately, even though it's used fairly sparingly over this not-particularly long game, by the end I felt that it overstayed its welcome.  The problem is that there's not much enemy variety, so the only way the game can increase the challenge is by making you fight a bunch of enemies in a row, or by throwing a bunch of them at you at once.  Fighting a bunch in a row doesn't make things more difficult, but it does increase the amount you have to play through again if you do screw up, which can be pretty frustrating.  As for fighting multiple at once, usually they move slowly enough that you can fight them one at a time, so it ends up being more or less like fighting them in a row.  However, near the end, the game starts throwing so many at you that you end up fighting the camera, and its need to focus on only one enemy at all times, as much as you fight the enemies themselves.  Enemies in general also have too much health, making combat last longer than it should, IMO.  There was one boss in particular that took fooorreeevveeerrr, because beating it meant doing the same dodge-attack combo at least 50 times, and it deals quite a bit of damage itself, so if you screw up you have to start all over again.  After a few tries, I just turned the difficulty down to easy, and the fight still took way too long.\n\nAs for the puzzles, roughly 40% of them had fairly obvious solutions, 40% required actual thought to solve, and 20% made me want to strangle whoever designed them.  The main problem is that the game is fairly bad at introducing new mechanics, so whenever there's a new one it's a bit of a guessing game to figure out what the hell the game wants you to do (I could go on a long rant about how the game introduces certain gates that cause something in the environment to change, but I won't).  Overall, the best puzzles were the ones where you had to form certain symbols by looking at things int eh environment from specific angles, because they helped represent Senua's psychosis in trying to find patterns where none exist.  However, there was a problem that you could often see the symbol in multiple places, and even when you found the correct collection of objects, you could see it from a range of angles, and so you had to find the exact one that would trigger the solution (the game in general has a bad habit of requiring you to stand in a super specific place to interact with things).\n\nIt feels a bit strange to recommend a game where I only enjoyed maybe half of my time playing it.  Still, it is a kind experience that you very rarely see from games (much less from big-budget ones).  It's also fairly short, and often on sale, which helps.
