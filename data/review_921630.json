Of course i played osu and stuff before it, but Osu Mania wasnt really doing me justice at the time, so i found this game.\nAs you can see by my playtime, i have played this for a few hours, but coming back to it was... Honestly kind of underwhelming.\nAs a first rythm game this was amazing. It taught me everything i needed to know, and it's the only rythm game i've seen with 8 fingers as an option.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is good, and i've had alot of fun with it. I love what they did with the camera, it's quite unique and i haven't seen it anywhere else. The game runs smoothly, and looks amazing. The different themes are really cool, and hey! Hot anime babes.\nBut here's the thing. After i've spent around 90 hours on the game, i got kind of bored with it. The song selection is pretty big, yet it still bores me. It's probably becouse i only play the songs i actually like (at least thats what i thought). But after searching through all the songs on trinity (the hardest difficulty), they either got ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard. Now, there are a few levels i still really enjoy to this day.\nThe camera shake can be good in some levels, but there's others where it completely ruins everything. There's a level where the camera goes under the stage, and your controls basically flip. There's one where you get the standard \"bird eyes view\" that all rythm games have, but it doesn't work in this game 'couse the notes are going too fast. The character(s) you start with, disables this camera movement, but that character(s) is/are basically useless. They give you a lower score, and remove camera movement, BUT you can remove camera movement in the options menu (wich i would recommend doing). That just makes the character(s) obsolete. \nThe gameplay can sometimes get really uncomfortable, or just plain bad. If you're looking for good a rythm game to spent hours on, go for some cheaper titles like: Osu, Quaver or Muse dash.\n\u97f3\u7075 INVAXION didn't really live up to my expectations coming back to it, wich really pains me, 'couse it's litterely my first rythm game i actually spent time on.\nThe servers are also not working as i'm writing this review, i don't know if it's only for me or if it's worldwide.\nI might play it again sometimes soon, idk yet.\n\nQuick summery: Game good, camera bad, gameplay can sometimes suck and servers are currently dead (for me at least).", "timestamp_created": 1621026261, "timestamp_updated": 1621026261, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561106085777282715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91687567": {"recommendationid": "91687567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399924914", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1594, "last_played": 1632945330}, "language": "english", "review": "I can\u00b4t play online I tried a lot of things but the game doesn\u00b4t  work", "timestamp_created": 1620533964, "timestamp_updated": 1620533964, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574101924896240234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89468099": {"recommendationid": "89468099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219343843", "num_games_owned": 15920, "num_reviews": 306, "playtime_forever": 1446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 616, "last_played": 1618281473}, "language": "english", "review": "[h3]This Beatmania inspired rhythm game holds no punches, expecting you to be an arcade master for blindingly fast BPM songs varying from 4 to 8 keys at once. Though its electronic music is excellent, there's no download feature for owners, and a big chunk of its content is locked to online only. If you haven't unlocked all tracks and avatars, do it now: Slated to be decomissioned April 7th, it's unclear if you will have any access to them in its restrictive offline mode. As much as I want to like this game, the demerits outweight its strengths.[/h3]\n\n[h3]Pros[/h3]\n\u2705 Simple UI, bright neon colors, attractive visual effects\n\u2705 Avatars aren't mere cosmetics, they carry unique perks (score, exp, cover for mistakes)\n\u2705 Had a multiplayer team mode to compete for territory in monthly events\n\u2705 Dozens of great electronic tracks (JP / CHN vocals)\n\u2705 Multiple modes & difficulties breathe new life into old tracks\n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\n\u274c Virtually everything tied to online mode. While you can play arcade mode offline, it doesn't save your progress. Owners will be locked out of tracks and avatars not unlocked by shutdown, an absolutely unforgivable design\n\u274c Very hard. Not newbie friendly. No way to practice difficult segments individually. Even on lowest speed, it's easy to be drowned in a sea of inputs that confuse both eyes and fingers\n\u274c No soundtrack option to download or listen, not even as DLC\n\u274c Screen shaking is annoying, and if you disable it, then your progress isn't counted\n\u274c (As an NA player:) Frequent disconnects and downtime. It only tries to sync after you finish a song, wiping any progress you made. Sometimes you can't even log in, and have to play something else. Unacceptable\n\nIt truly felt like [b]Invaxion[/b] is by rhythm game fans, for rhythm game pros. On one hand, great music, selectable skins, and avatar perks keep things interesting. On the other, it's blind to the new player experience, throwing them into open water when they can barely float. This plays exactly like an arcade machine designed to gobble your quarters, banking on your failure until you develop muscle memory. It's easily more frustrating than fun, and sitting through the same songs over and over just to get to that segment you always fail at takes more endurance than most casual players will muster. Invaxion has a skill ceiling and doesn't make any apologies for it.\n\nBut putting difficulty aside, there's the awful issue of online-only content. Besides potential connection errors removing your progress or preventing you from even playing the game, you can't access the majority of the game's content without being online. Now that the game is shutting down, owners won't have access to certain songs, avatars, and leaderboards which serve as the game's raison d'\u00eatre. Why on earth the game didn't plan for its sunset baffles me. Make your content available offline! There's no conceivable logic for this decision.\n\nAs you can no longer purchase this, it's too late to warn against buying it. But if you own the game, try to rush the campaign ASAP. There are stage rewards and stardust-required purchases to unlock skins, characters, and songs. You'll be able to use them offline, but only in free play. But free play has no local leaderboard so what's the point? Big RIP.\n\nFarewell Invaxion, I hardly knew you.\n\n[u]Achievement Hunters[/u]: It's a trap. Impossible to complete the battlegrounds, to find 20 friends, or go for any of the arcade scores after sever shutdown. If you weren't around a year ago, it's too little, too late.\n\n[i]Disclaimer: If there are any errors in this review please post a comment so I can fix it.[/i]\n\n[i]Update: Kudos to user Stonty for [url=https://github.com/sht2017/Unlock-INVAXION-/releases]creating an app to unlock all songs[/url]. Great for owners who didn't get to experience the full content, but sadly still won't do anything for scorekeeping or achievements.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1617238032, "timestamp_updated": 1618891592, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610263049602508545", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89099766": {"recommendationid": "89099766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321912900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "playtime_at_review": 2805, "last_played": 1700520962}, "language": "english", "review": "good game but is about to shutdown soon ;-;", "timestamp_created": 1616738438, "timestamp_updated": 1616738438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533419013023376465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88467923": {"recommendationid": "88467923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008302291", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1630049797}, "language": "english", "review": "It just copy from some where", "timestamp_created": 1615794179, "timestamp_updated": 1615839307, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44508671760559082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88224407": {"recommendationid": "88224407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321849632", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1593457695}, "language": "spanish", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1615434638, "timestamp_updated": 1615434638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87960984": {"recommendationid": "87960984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077141632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1626093267}, "language": "english", "review": "recently, when I start the song it goes into instant failed eventhough I hit the correct key.

Core game mechanics are ok with the exception of long notes causing misses if you release even a fraction too early. There are a good amount of songs (118), but several are locked behind Cosmic Tour (missions) and in game currency which you earn by leveling up and Cosmic Tour. There are 3 button modes with 2-3 4K & 6K charts and only 1 8K chart per song. Easy and hard charts are ok with large sections of hold notes or just nothing. Trinity difficulty (highest difficulty) charts can be pretty difficult. There is a battlefield mode which I've never been able to try, a grading system (much like SDVX Skill Analyzer), and arcade modes (play 3 random songs in a set). All in all it's an ok game, but there are better out there. The servers for the game are shutting down soon so I can not recommend getting this game. Even if the servers stayed up, I couldn't recommend the game. Sorry for the wall of text. You can stop reading now if you want. Most of this is just rambling. And fuck you steam for having a character limit on reviews.\n\nI love rhythm games and I'm pretty good at rhythm games. I've played several PC and console games growing up such as DJMax, DDR, Guitar Hero/Rock Band, Project Diva, and osu!mania and some arcade titles such as Sound Voltex, Beatmania IIDX, Groove Coaster, GuitarFreaks, DrumMania, Museca, and Wacca.\n\nAt the very start, you can tell that this game is a port of a mobile game and looking online will confirm this. Just because it's a port doesn't automatically make it bad (just look at Musynx). The game requires an online connection to use everything besides Quick Play. When starting out the game, not all of the songs or equipment will be available. A good majority of unlocks are through the Cosmic Tour, some are rewards for leveling up, and the rest can be bought with in game currency you get completing missions in Cosmic Tour or leveling up. This wouldn't be an issue, but the game's developers are shutting down the servers to the game soon. I do not know how unlocking songs and gear is going to work when this happens, but let's hope that they will just unlock everything once that happens. Otherwise there is going to be a ton of stuff that is just locked.\n\nThe main UI is fairly simple. You can control it with either the mouse or the keyboard, but the controls aren't always intuitive. I would explain, but I had to cut the review short because of steam.\n\nThe options are pretty standard for most music games. There isn't much to complain about, but there were a couple thing I'd like to have been addressed. I would have like to seen a more traditional top down scrolling theme as opposed to the 3D effect they have, but I got used to it. Some of the buttons on the keyboard can't be used in the controls I didn't go out of my way to see what keys can or can't be used. I usually use the atl buttons for other games, but I couldn't set them in this game. I also had issues trying both shift keys. My fix was to remap the shift keys to other keys with Auto Hot Key. And turn Camera Motion off.\n\nThe unlocked song selection is pretty good with 118 songs. None of the songs are really good or bad to me. The charts on the other hand though. Each song has 2-3 4K & 6K charts and only 1 8K chart each. The easy and hard charts have large sections where there are no notes or long notes. The trinity difficulty is where the more challenging charts are. These charts don't look like they were made with controller support in mind, so I don't recommend playing with a controller.\n\nThe core game play is fairly standard most music games with one glaring exception, long notes. For whatever reason you have to hold through to the end of the long note or you will miss a note. If you release just a fraction of a second too early, you miss a note. I can't count the number of times I've missed random notes before figuring this out. In some games such as DJMax and Sound Voltex, you are graded on pressing and releasing the note and if you release a little early you get graded worse for it or if you release in the middle of the hold it's a miss. In others like Musynx and Guitar Hero, you just stop earning points. In this game, it's a miss if you release early at all. I got around this for the most part by just holding the long notes much longer than what should be necessary, but this shouldn't a problem in the first place.\n\nThe in song UI depends on what ship and sometimes what pilot you use. Each ship gives a different overall theme and most don't even include a score counter or health meter (low health can be shown by how much blood is on the screen). You can't mix and match themes such as notes, background, and lanes. Some of the themes the ships make notes extremely difficult to read such as the Trion with the outer most notes in 8K. This wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the fact that that ship is required to be used in the hardest non-DLC section of the Cosmic Tour. Those side notes are yellow with a faded yellow to pink background. The pilots give a little extra effects such as making the judgment of the notes less strict or converting certain hits into others. Each pilot has a slightly different effect so be sure to read the ones you are about to choose. I'm not a fan of this as it makes getting the best possible score obtainable with only specific characters, but I'm usually just going for full combos or all maximums rather than #1 because i know i can't get a perfect play in this game. And I'm not going to be playing this game for much longer, so why complain much about it.\n\nThe Cosmic Tour is where you can unlock some more songs and earn some more stardust to purchase more songs, pilots, and ships. It also sort of acts like a tutorial area. In order to unlock each world, you have to complete a mission in each song in the world prior. The first 3 worlds are supposed to be tutorial sections for each button mode and the first 5 songs in each do so, but with 6K & 8K they just play 4K songs after the tutorials. You don't play another 6K song until world 6 and at that they are extremely easy songs. What's worse is that they don't show you a 8K song until 8-5 and this is a 9 difficulty song. The Cosmic Tour hasn't been training players to get used to 8K at all and now it's giving them a fairly difficult 8K song. They could have fixed this by scattering in a 6K and 8K in some of the easier planets to keep players practicing those game modes instead of having such a difficulty barrier for players.\n\nThe Competition option in the main menu has two sections: Grade Challenger, and Battlefield. I can't say anything about Battlefield as i can't seem to find a team that even active any more to recruit me. I'll  have to level up to level 22 and make my own. Grade Challenger is sort of like the Skill Analyzer in Sound Voltex where you are given a set of 3 songs that you must pass in order to ear that grade. You are allowed to attempt any grade up until Moonstone where you must pass the step below in order to unlock that grade. The camera motion is turned on for all of the songs. Also the song chose for the Moonstone I difficulties weren't even the hardest songs in the game. They were difficult songs, but i was expecting the highest difficulty to feature the hardest they have to offer in the game. I managed to pass Moonstone I on all 3 modes with some trouble with 8K mode.\n\nArcade mode is just a 3 song mode to get as high of a score as possible to post on a leader board. You are restricted to the songs that you are given in each round.

So stuff them.\n\n\nMost of the reviews for this game seem to be based on it being in a sorry state at launch and don't seem to apply anymore, like one guy saying there are swipe notes you can't interact with, which certainly isn't the case now. So here's a review based on the current state of the game.\n\n[h1]The good[/h1]\n- The song list. There's at least 110 songs in the game, with about 20 needing to be unlocked through clearing goals or buying them with points from Cosmic Tour (mission mode). There are a few stinkers like any rhythm game but the song list overall is solid and there are plenty of standout great tracks in there. There isn't really a wide mix of genres like you'd see in IIDX, with Invaxion almost entirely focused on electronic music, but there's still some variety.\n\n[h1]The bad[/h1]\n- The UI. My primary complaint here is that you can't do everything on the keyboard; you need to use the mouse to mark a song as a favourite and change playlists. It's also really slow to scroll through the lists. Also, your selected character takes up a big chunk of the song list screen, and if you want to use the exp-boosting guy as I do, it means you have his feet in your face the whole time. Not my cup of tea.\n\n- Song scores aren't saved in any way between Quick Play, Arcade, and Cosmic Tour modes. So if you clear a song in Arcade, its score will be saved there, but in Quick Play it'll be as if you've never played it. This is dumb, the records should just be shared between modes.\n\n- The difficulty isn't handled very well. Ideally there would be Standard, Hard, and Trinity difficulties for each key mode, but there isn't. Most songs only have four difficulties between 4K and 6K modes, and one difficulty for 8K mode. On top of this, almost every song's 8K mode is super hard. This means it's really difficult to get into 8K mode because you aren't given easier songs to play and develop your muscle memory with. \n\n- The \"multiplayer\" mode. I haven't actually been able to try this out at all, because you need to join a Team to do so, and despite applying to teams until the game wouldn't let me anymore, none have accepted me, whether because the game is dead or some other reason I don't know. I can't create my own Team because you need to be level 22 to do that, and at 8.6 hours of gameplay in I'm only level 13. Levels don't seem to have any other purpose outside of giving you some points for the shop or a song unlock as you level up.\n\n[h1]The mixed[/h1]\n- The store trailers focus on the game's unique system of the game screen syncing with the music to jump around. It was what got me interested in it and I love the system, it's great for getting you engaged in the tracks like you'd get with Rez or Child of Eden. The problem is that it's vastly under-utilised with most tracks not having the feature at all and many others only doing the basic bounce motion instead of anything more complicated. It would've been better as a more ingrained feature. There are also a few shit effects in there, like the spin which I can't wrap my head around, and one where the entire lane section just goes completely off screen for a moment, which is idiotic. You can turn the system off entirely, but there's no disabling specific motions.\n\n-  The beatmaps. For the most part they're good, but for some songs they feel out of sync with the corresponding notes. A bigger problem is that in 6K mode there are many songs where they'll have 500 notes on the middle four keys and 20 notes on the outer two keys throughout the song. This feels like they're just cheap modifications of the 4K beatmaps for the songs, and they're awkward to play because of how little the side notes come up. I've barely touched 4K mode since I find it boring so I can't say if this is what's happening, but at least it seems almost entirely contained to the lowest 6K difficulty.\n\n- The character system. You can equip various characters as support for you, with effects like changing missed notes into hit ones a few times in a song, or making you lose health if you don't get a perfect note but giving you more score when you do. This part is fine; it's a good crutch for newer players to learn while it gives a few extra options for experienced players. The problem is that the judgement indicator (saying whether you were too early or too late when you hit a note and got anything other than perfect) is restricted to two specific characters. This is moronic; such a crucial feature should be a basic game option, not tied to using specific characters. Similarly there are two other characters that give you more exp for using them, which makes you feel punished for not using them given how grindy gaining levels is.\n\n- The spaceships, what his game calls its themes. There's a nice variety of them and they look pretty good all around, but some have certain effects that make it difficult to see the notes when using them. And only two of the themes I have unlocked so far show the player's score and combo on them; the rest are all blank. That's another thing that should be a game option instead of tied to a specific selection.\n\n- There's an offline mode but it limits you to Quick Play with none of your scores or favourites being saved. I haven't had any problems with connectivity yet though.\n\n- No key sounds. By this I mean how IIDX assigns a sound to each key for each note in the song, rather than a generic tap sound that always plays. I'm not really bothered by this but I know some people didn't like the DJ MAX RESPECT DLCs for it.\n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\nIt's mostly good with some issues that probably won't get ironed out since the devs don't seem active anymore, and the multiplayer mode is as good as unplayable. The track motions are a neat idea but underused. For the price it's definitely good for several hours of entertainment with the great song list and mostly good beatmaps.", "timestamp_created": 1605796166, "timestamp_updated": 1615522436, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458015263080596924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79244076": {"recommendationid": "79244076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967247988", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1396, "last_played": 1691440090}, "language": "english", "review": "I definitely prefer this over any other games of this type.

The game is translated from another language, so some of the English reads weird, especially on the pilot descriptions. The angle of the notes falling has been a bit of a challenge for me and I don't know why, but it's definitely something to get used to when reading notes. I have one small complaint with the arcade mode. I like the idea of playing three songs in a row, but I wish it would let you choose the skill level. Instead, you can play the first song however you want but every song after that is usually way more difficult, and it doesn't seem like there's any real incentive to the arcade mode so I'm not sure why you cant just choose the skill level of each song. I like the campaign mode, but I think its weird that the tutorial is buried in there. I try to view a game from the perspective of someone picking it up for the first time and I just think they would have a really hard time starting out since its not super clear where the tutorial is.

However I've been able to improve to the point where I can play most songs on 4K Hard, and on occasion 4K trinity. My brain is still not trained to handle 6K or 8K, but I will get there.\n\nI want Aquatrax to continue working on and improving this game, mostly by adding all the songs from Zyon onto here, as I've noticed Zyon had a much larger selection of songs.

change my banner for online stuff\n- the difficulty curve in the mode where you unlock songs by playing is ridiculously out of sorts. it asks you to go from 4key standard 2 to 4key hard 6 in the same 'world'. it's a huge jump\n- it also forces you to play the tutorial levels in each world before getting to the songs which is a waste of time :)\n\nhowever i am still playing it, and i think overall

This game does it well, but contains nothing I would say would make it better than the other ones.\n\nNow for the bad parts:\nThe campaign has some of the stupidest missions (get BETWEEN 70%-80% accuracy on a chart).\nThere's a lot of \"fancy\" effects that can't be turned off, such as lanes bouncing, zoom in and out. If you go into 2D mode to turn those effects off, you lose all of the QOL features too (e.g. middle keys are different colors than side keys) so either options are bad.\n\nBattlefield mode is a complete shitfest. Absolutely monotonous, poorly thought-out event the devs could possibly have done. Not only that, it's riddled with bugs that completely make you lose a play. You get 20 plays a week, and you hit any one of the bugs and you lose it. I was mildly bothered with Kingdom Come: Deliverance making extremely cumbersome saves/autosaves when a quest bug or game bug can make you lose hours of gameplay. I did not put a bad review for that cause it was still a great game.  However, this game, devs were out of their minds to make play count so strict when their game is such a bad mess.\n\nSupport is basically impossible. Nothing against the support staff, but unless you can speak Chinese, you aren't going to be getting help. \n\n The only reason I'm continuing to play this game is because I don't want to screw my team over by quitting mid-season.

The first thing is that it's more of an iconic, old school rhythm game excluding the 3D aspect (which makes it more like SDVX or other arcade mania games), it plays very similar to titles like Step Mania, DDR or osu!mania. The only extra features the game would have compared to those games are the 3D aspect and the cool camera effects as a result, however, with the massive increase in aesthetically 3D mobile rhythm games, this has become less special as of recent.\n\nThe game has three main ways of playing, 4K, 6K, & 8K, I would personally expect them to ditch 8K and go for a 7K, but I can see why they have done this as they would likely need to make it common to use the space bar, and that would be much different when it comes to playing 4K or 6K.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far, the game seems somewhat generic to a casual Japanese arcade rhythm game, or a mobile rhythm game, which it is to be fair. However, because all these games are so similar, I feel like I need to judge them on the quality of their similar features as well, so;\n\nThe charts in the game are decent, they all use common patterns such as stairs, streams, jump streams, rolls, ladders, pedals, and more, but besides that the charting feels fairly uncreative, they aren\u2019t too inspired and can come off as rather basic, I don\u2019t see or rarely see any trills or double stairs for example, more mechanically or speed demanding techniques like jacks, shields or any vibro-techniques are almost completely avoided as well. (If you aren\u2019t a very competitive or skilled rhythm game player, these charts could be a decent introduction) - the charting is decent and is certainly playable, but it could certainly be a bit better, I'm hoping in future maps they improve upon this.\n\nThe game has its fair amount of game modes, Quick Play, which is just your casual pick a song and play, \u201cCosmic Tour\u201d which is a mission-based game mode, however, I don't like when rhythm games force you to play very easy songs when I've played so many of them, so I've frankly avoided this game mode because I can't be asked to play through the \"Standard\" songs. \u201cCompetition\u201d which I haven't gone into the \"clan\"-style gameplay, but I've played a lot of the grade challenges in which I enjoy, and finally, \u201cArcade\u201d which I haven't properly played, but it seems similar to Cosmic Tour where you need to play fairly easy songs to progress to the harder ones, however with the grade challenge aspect with progression on a list of charts. They're all pretty engaging to an extent, and I personally get a sense of completion when I'm trying to beat my score on Quick Play, or trying not to fail harder songs on the grade challenges on Competition.\n\nThe game is quite fun, I come from an osu! and mobile rhythm game background, so besides the rhythm games I've played on my phone (Deemo, Cytus, Dynamix, etcetera), and a little bit of time I\u2019ve spent playing some other mania-based keyboard rhythm games on PC, I was a bit rusty in terms of playing a mix of doubles, stair patterns and vice versa, so learning that was quite difficult. I don't have much experience playing 6K and 8K, but I can play fairly difficult 4K maps on this game and I can play them quite well at that, yet these \u201cdifficult\u201d charts do not scratch the service of what is possible in terms of difficulty in these types of games, but besides that, I can only talk about the 4K aspect for now, if I start playing 6K and 8K I will update this with my experiences.", "timestamp_created": 1557356976, "timestamp_updated": 1679447384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587757647037506104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50310890": {"recommendationid": "50310890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160319501", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 614, "last_played": 1663243712}, "language": "english", "review": "Very poorly optimized, songs and difficulties are okay, nothing really hard, if only I could play the game without it being ridiculously laggy.", "timestamp_created": 1556165378, "timestamp_updated": 1556165378, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444874286651611328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50267534": {"recommendationid": "50267534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432639269", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3625, "last_played": 1678504665}, "language": "english", "review": "very good", "timestamp_created": 1555940990, "timestamp_updated": 1555940990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50245396": {"recommendationid": "50245396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329703468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1630212563}, "language": "english", "review": "not bad but the  game always crash", "timestamp_created": 1555827023, "timestamp_updated": 1555827023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769246816635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50140456": {"recommendationid": "50140456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073318670", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 9062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1392, "last_played": 1627653660}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this game and love all songs of it.", "timestamp_created": 1555304527, "timestamp_updated": 1555304527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520905971527099609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50093238": {"recommendationid": "50093238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409962796", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1641199086}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent!This music game is my favorite music game I have ever played,it is amazing!!!", "timestamp_created": 1555076490, "timestamp_updated": 1555076490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49946462": {"recommendationid": "49946462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138824428", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1554475399}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uy me mareo brigi2", "timestamp_created": 1554377890, "timestamp_updated": 1554377890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49913079": {"recommendationid": "49913079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154660406", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1226, "last_played": 1613139447}, "language": "english", "review": "Do it!

Specifically the UI looks much cleaner. The songs are really good and the game just all-around plays well. I only find 2 things frustrating about this game.\n1. The note patterns can be somewhat repetitive and not too challenging when you have already played songs with those similar patterns. There needs to be more variation in some songs. (Especially 4 key songs)\n2. Some of the coolest songs are only unlockable by going through the tutorial-type \"story mode\". It is not appealing as higher level players have to go through so many easy, boring levels to eventually get the songs they want to play.\n\nThese are, however, the only two real criticisms I have of the game.

I mean, yeah many games \"kinda\" copy each other but this game crossed the line by 100 miles just like other Chinese games in the market.\n\nStill, let me review the game though.\n\n\n - SCREEN IS WAAAAAY TOO FLASHY. Its too flashy that it interrupts me from playing. I sure that if I let my grandpa play this game, he will die from Photophobia. I LOVE COOL EFEECTS but this game just got huge Made in China effects which nobody can embrace.\n\n - NOTE DESIGNER IS WAYYYY TOO LAZY. (Clumsy at the same time.) When theres a hard song with sexy melody, note pattern become like a sewing machine which is pressing all buttons like a tic disorder children. Man, if I am gonna press all the button on one tempo, I will rather listen to metronome on my bed rather than playing the damn game. Most of pattern design gets really bad as it gets harder, so I am assuming that note designer cannot actually beat his pattern or he/she is new to making notes.\n\n - NO V-SYNC OPTION which is critical for music games. Deal with the time lag.\n\n - WHOLE GAME IS UNSTABLE. Game frame is damn low for some reason too. I use dual gtx1080 but frame is unstable, and maximum fps is lower than 70. I heard this is a mobile game transferred into PC, so they just did lazy job converting the game.\n\n\n\n\nNow let me write down what this game copied.\n\nBasic system of the WHOLE GAME is ripped off from DJMAX series which is Korean PC, PSP, PS4 game.\nFreestyle (freeplay), mission, arcade mode which is divided in stages with limited songs, all the equipment system, circle (lounge) and so on. Especially music loading screen in 99% same from DJ MAX Respect. Mission mode layout is 90% simillar from DJMAX series too.\n\nGame design is ripped off from Sound Voltex which is Japanese arcade game.\nIf they just copied the concept, maybe I can accept it but they copied all the camera effects and  and even added more cheesy effect which only interrupt me from playing without looking cool.\n\n\n\n\nSummary: Rip off game.\n\nI suggest musynx if you wanna play classic note-type music game.

Any bug that I find playing the game is fixed within a day without me having to report it, which is very convenient.\nThe visuals are great, both the character art and in-game things. The game runs smoothly and the customizability of everything is definitely refreshing.\n\nThis is one of the instances where I can confidently say that one should not always trust a game's overall reviews, since it is  mixed right now for unbelievable reasons. I have quickly gone from 4 key to 8 key with no issues thanks to the game's great progression and tutorials. The maps are specifically designed to be user-friendly and help in a stepping stone manner when improving at the game.\n\nWhile the song selection and such are somewhat limited right now, they are regularly updating the list, along with the playable characters that add more flavor to the game. This is described as a p2w experience by many users, but after having completed the campaign mode, I am left with so much in-game currency that I don't know what to do with it (I have purchased every single song and character in the store and am still sitting on a metric ton of money). All of this is free, the only real payment you make is for the game itself and given the amount of fun and hours it gives you for it, it's hard to say no to it. The few songs that are on this game however, are of extremely high quality, from known doujin artists such as Nhato, sky_delta, you, a remix of Akira Complex's popular album Connected, void and more. Since this game seems to be originally Chinese, it naturally has various Chinese artists featured. Thanks to this game, I have discovered great Chinese artists (both singers and producers) that I would listen to in my own time.\n\nRhythm games are popular for their steep learning curves and this game is no exception, but spending a few hours from square one to really learn the ins and outs of the game pays off massively in a short time and is sure to make the whole experience even better. \n\nI can't wait for more updates from the hard working devs (please give us more songs!). Until then, I'll be casually playing this game as stress-relief and relaxing, which these games are ideal for.\n\nI highly recommend this game and advise people to give it a go, despite the mixed reviews and rate it 9/10 as it is now and very possibly 10/10 given how active the devs are with the improvements.\n\nIt is also worth noting that most of the negative reviews with very strong opinions are written by people with sub 2-3 hour gameplay, which is self-explanatory.", "timestamp_created": 1546679463, "timestamp_updated": 1546679636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639068126678466797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48108271": {"recommendationid": "48108271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080082981", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1600564934}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: RIP.", "timestamp_created": 1546644921, "timestamp_updated": 1677617610, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592376947402954102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48071544": {"recommendationid": "48071544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072385073", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1613037213}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!", "timestamp_created": 1546527484, "timestamp_updated": 1546527484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48037324": {"recommendationid": "48037324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133502884", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1578, "last_played": 1583187828}, "language": "english", "review": "If you think Osu! is better than this game then you're rarted Du Ma.", "timestamp_created": 1546424981, "timestamp_updated": 1546424981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487810730934143066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48028079": {"recommendationid": "48028079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392782361", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 717, "last_played": 1644004552}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

Something also feels off about the way the notes scroll down the screen, I just can't put my finger on what exactly it is.\n\nSong licensing is pretty good, pulling a decent amount from known artists and mobile rhythm games. There are some relatively big names from the rhythm game scene - Akira Complex, Lunatic Sounds, Nitro Fun, etc.\n\nProgression system is grindy, again a clear product of mobile ambitions. I hate on progression systems all the time in rhythm games because they all encourage you to play songs over and over to unlock a single new song. IMO, a good progression system starts you with a ridiculous amount/variety of songs unlocked, and then every time you complete a song (or maybe an arcade mode play) you unlock another.\n\nCharts, however,  are [b]garbo[/b], especially in 8K. They treat the pinkie notes more like special notes, which means a LOT of harder patterns revolve around using your pinkies for one rhythm and the rest of your fingers for another. Gets old fast imo. I'd experiment with using my thumbs for those special notes instead since that makes more sense in my head, but key remapping is limited to alphanumeric characters. No left/right alt or so on.\n\nEDIT: been playing some more, and as a rule the charts/patterns/beatmaps (whatever the hell this particular studio calls them) just lack musicality - I can't expolain it fully, but when playing the levels I feel like I'm just noodling around on the keyboard while listening to a song, there's no cohesion. Many 6K levels feel like 4K levels where they just randomly picked parts of the level to move to the side buttons. Individual sections in each song don't have particularly interesting things to do with your hands either, at least until you hit the hardest of the 8K stuff which is when you run into the above issues. Yeah, they put out new songs and levels every couple days, but that doesn't mean much if all the levels are garbage.\n\nIf that kind of thing bothers you, pick up MUSYNX instead.", "timestamp_created": 1546324137, "timestamp_updated": 1547587012, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48005278": {"recommendationid": "48005278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046094245", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1667074067}, "language": "english", "review": "This took me away from osu.", "timestamp_created": 1546321871, "timestamp_updated": 1546321871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47988566": {"recommendationid": "47988566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102299728", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1595147646}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of people posting negative reviews, dont really understand the problems they are having.

For starters, this game is online only, given the way it records and updates players' scores and progress against a global userbase. There's currently no way to practice offline. And like most reviews have pointed out, this game seems to be developed for mobile and then ported straight to PC. It doesn't make the game unplayable, but it is a bit awkward to navigate. The good thing is that the developers are listening to feedback and actively updating the game to address issues as of writing.\n\nThat said, what I did like about the game is that it has a great collection of songs. If you like playing other rhythm games like the DJMax series, Groove Coaster, Cytus, and Arcaea, then this has a similar offering. I also had no problems with regards to timing (the most important thing in a rhythm game).\n\nAnother thing of note is the presentation. Depending on the song, the play field can shake, shift, and twist to the rhythm. Some songs have very little variation, but others like Veritas might prove irritating for some players. It could be a pro or a con depending on your preference, but I liked it. It most cases, the effect gives extra emphasis to the rhythm of the song. And you can turn it off completely in the settings if it's too distracting.\n\nOverall, the game is good and I recommend it to other rhythm game enthusiasts, especially since there's very few games of this nature here on Steam right now.", "timestamp_created": 1546143720, "timestamp_updated": 1546143720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47942705": {"recommendationid": "47942705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027686857", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 11212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1578529855}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.\n\nThe characters make it a little bit more interesting than most rhythm game. \nTiming is good, gameplay is good.

Many of the issues brought up in the earlier reviews have already been fixed, and there are other things the devs announced they are already working on. The only truly bad thing at first is that you have to spend a bit calibrating timing before the game's actually playable, but there's a nice guide detailing how to do it properly. \n\nQuick game overview:\n\nThe game is always online. The server keeps track of your scores, the rankings, mission mode progress, whatever you unlocked and the social aspects of the game.\n\nThe song selection is pretty much the standard in Asian music games, mostly electronic music and a few rock songs. Overall I found them pretty good. Charts are also generally pretty good, they managed to keep the game challenging across all key modes.\n\nGameplay is pretty standard, notes scrolling down, with 4-, 6- and 8-keys modes. There are different characters, and they have skills that provide you bonuses. There are also different ships and they are basically themes, changing the playing field. There's also exp levels, and a store to buy stuff from with money you get from missions.\n\nThe mission mode does a good job at getting you the hang of the game, they're at first tutorials that aim to get you to learn the key layout right, then they become regular songs with goals like accuracy and combo count. There are 64 missions as of this review, but it's hinted more are coming.\n\nThere are also the competitive aspect, but they're just single player with rankings. Every song and every difficulty has its own ranking. Then there's Arcade mode, where you pick 3 songs to compete for high score. There's also a course-like mode with 12 courses of increasing difficulty, and a \"capture\" mode in which there are territories with 1-3 songs each, you get points each time you play and the one with the most points claims the territory. You can also add friends and share and compare your scores.\n\nAlso, as shown in the videos, the standard game play can be annoying with camera angles changes and shaking, but you can disable them in the settings. Do note that ranking mode forces the camera on so you might want to learn the game with them on if you want to take part in that aspect later on.\n\nOverall I found it to be a pretty solid rhythm game with traditional gameplay, engaging additional modes and (as of yet) no microtransactions. It also ran surprisingly smooth on my potato computer Medium settings.

This game is pretty fun and the devs really don't deserve the mostly negative reviews now after they've fixed the bigger issues. Sure it the ui feels like a mobile game, but the gameplay is pretty solid. The game looks really nice aside from some specific low res sprites, and runs without issue for me on my mid tier laptop. There is also a pretty good variety of songs with 4k, 6k, and 8k on each.\n\nThey made accuracy more lenient and less draining on your health when hitting \"good\"s (which is the equivalent of bad - it goes max+ > max > just > good > miss) They added an option to turn off the crazy camera stuff, which is good overall. I personally like the camera movement, it's fun, it's the same everytime and I think it adds an extra layer of challenge.\n\nThey are still missing some features, but I trust the devs implement them as they have shown to care about this game, listen to feedback, and generally be on top of things so far.\n\nPS The guy who said the game is pay to win is just fucking wrong and it pisses me off. That's what happens when you only play 30 minutes. There is no option to spend money on this game other than buying it. There are some characters that give you better acc or more exp or whatever, but you unlock them by playing the game more. I don't entirely agree with this, but it's *mostly*? balanced at the moment, except for at least Mini IA. I also haven't had any server issues, except in like the first 30 minutes of the game launching, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nIn short: this game is really fun, looks nice overall, and feels great to play.

It had 1,3k on launch day and assuming those are all from Chinese players who had the game before, it's a little bit odd to have them cast an overall opinion on a release to a Western audience. I can't see what the fuzz is about obviously, but from most if not all the negative reviews that I -CAN- see, it seems nonsensical stuff like 'game too hard' or 'lul mobile game on PC' which tells me more about the reviewer than the game.\n\nIn any case, here's my own summary of the game to hope and leverage the negativity out a bit.\n\nIt's a solid and fun game, the music is stellar and the visual effects (which can be tweaked to preference) make it even more so exciting. If you're coming from similar other rhythm games, you'll probably be able to find your way around this one. However it has to be said, this game can prove quite the challenge (even for veterans of the genre) if you decide to jump right in without doing the tutorials/cosmic tour first. I advise anyone to go through that mode first because it also gives you stardust and the ability to unlock specifics songs and/or characters etc.\n\nIt has multiple game modes which you can explore at your leisure with a brief manual to explain them, with difficulties from 4-Key Standard to 4/6-Key Hard and the dreadful 8-Key Trinity. Notespeed can be adjusted to one's liking which for most is probably one to feel out which speed is just right for you. Other than that, practice makes perfect. Yes the game can seem harder than your typical rhythm game, but it should still be within doable perimeters. If nothing else, the game does feature a character system which can introduce certain unique abilities to make your life a lot easier or have your runs be a bit more forgiving.\n\nThe only minor con I can mention is that the translation might not be a 100% proper English in terms of grammar or with very small typos but it's perfectly understandable so that should be a rather trivial aspect. Well, actually there's one other major downside.. ..that being, that like half of the amazing songs in the game I can't for the life of me find online to listen to or get a hold of x3. It would be sweet if a separate soundtrack could ever be released for purchase for that matter.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a very enjoyable rhythm game with a possible 'challenging' aspect that is within reason but can be eased into with the use of in-game mechanics/characters. The fact that it may have been a mobile game before, should not really be an issue as I for one wouldn't have find out about it otherwise if it didn't get ported to PC/Steam and localized. I think the price is more than reasonable for a game of this quality. If they keep expanding onto it with more songs and a possible separate soundtrack, then all the more power to them.", "timestamp_created": 1545412006, "timestamp_updated": 1545412015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599909007549285889", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47681697": {"recommendationid": "47681697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124440969", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 672, "last_played": 1600691911}, "language": "english", "review": "+So far this game still enjoyable, \nwtf with that veritas SV\n\n-bad acc, not sure if it was me or the game acc system which need to fix\n-pls give \"just\" late / early sign, instead of using heroes skill", "timestamp_created": 1545408147, "timestamp_updated": 1545408147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502508401870727539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47680969": {"recommendationid": "47680969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139601064", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1568691501}, "language": "english", "review": "Just bought this game, and I'm instantly hooked xD\n\nDecided to still give it a go despite all the Negative reviews cuz I love rhythm games (and Steam offers refund anyway).

I want to see more proper rhythm games like this one come to PC, since i don't really enjoy those drag your song and play a random chart type of games and it seems like those are the only ones we get.[/i]\n\nAs a rhythm game enthusiast i can't recommend this game enough, it had a rough launch but the developers are working hard to fix and change all the things people have been complaining about, most of the mayor issues regarding gameplay are gone (at least for me), servers are still broken though.\n\nThe visual impact from the songs in the stages, from a little shake to literally turning the screen upside down and do crazy flips, is something i love from games like Sound Voltex, and this game takes it to the next level. It might seem like a bit too much but the effects can be turned off and play with a static screen with the 2d mode (scores won't be saved playing with this mode). The song list is also great, it includes a couple exit tunes tracks which are always welcome. You can play the game with 4K , 6K and 8K, kinda like DJMAX. I'm not a fan of the 8K mode cause basically it's 6K+ 2 side bars that, at least for me, are kinda difficult to read, but i suck at 6K already so obviously i can't read more than that.\n\nI don't know if i could take it as a competitive game since it has power ups and perks from the characters you can select that affect scoring, but to be honest from what i've seen, i'd drop the competitive aspect of this game and focus on the fun factor, i want to see new crazy and dumb charts cause from what they've shown they can do, it can only get better and crazier.\n \nI guess i'll give it an 8/10. It's nothing new but it's a fun new twist to the traditional piano formula. If you are a fan of rhythm games you'll most likely enjoy it, if you are new though, there are better ways to get into this genre, but if you give it a try, you might enjoy it once you get the hang of it. Not a perfect game by any means but it's a lot of fun and that's what videogames (specially this genre for me) are all about.\n\nLittle gameplay of one of my favourite songs to wrap up the review:\nhttps://youtu.be/_i7omIaRFvM", "timestamp_created": 1545397171, "timestamp_updated": 1545397171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540949404239654541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47676918": {"recommendationid": "47676918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029519706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1559922285}, "language": "english", "review": "Sooooo... not easy to write a review of this game in it's current state. \nThe game si good, the song selection is great, there's an EXP bar and you gain new characters/songs in the game. \nBefore each song you can chose a character that you unlocked, each of them have a different ability (if it's a strong one you get a debuff too), it's really nice, you can get all of them either by leveling up or by buying them from the shop (not with real money).\n \nAlas, the game has a lot of issues, that I hope will be addressed by the developpers. \n\nFirst of all the jugdement system feels weird, like I played music for 13 years, I love rythms games since I'm 8, I think I know how to be accurate, but in this game....

And while some of them are easy, some of them are also incredibly hard, like do no more that 20 just in this super and long hard song.... \n \nThen let's talk about controller support: \nI was pretty happy to see that you could map the button to a controller, so I mapped them like DJmax Respect (left up right X Y B LB RB for people with Xbox controller) and I was surprised to see that you simply can't perfect some song like that, since the game can ask of you that you press left and right at the same time (which is just impossible on my gamepad).

I've had no issues adjusting to the game here.\n\nPlayed this for several hours, here are my findings.  Next 3 paragraphs contain information about calibration, skip past if you want to get to gameplay.  Video for this is on Twitch at videos/351662001\n\nThis game comes down to timing, as with every other rhythm game, however the built in calibration is harsh at best.  After spending close to an hour tinkering with my settings, making small adjustments, I was able to find a good calibration.  Your mileage may vary with this, but what I did was enter the sound menu and turn off effect sounds.  This completely removes the clap noise overlay when you press a key. Why would you do this?  Simple, as you adjust the timing, the clap overlay will attempt to still line up where the game wants to think the notes are (think how in Deemo, if you calibrate outside of a certain zone, it disables the keypress noises).\n\nAfter this, you're going to want to go into your offset settings, and if your setup is anything like mine, you're going to want to adjust for a negative number.  After trial and error, for my specific hardware (GTX 1080/BenQ XL2411P/Corsair Void Pro Wireless), I had to swing my Sound value to an impressive -274 msec adjustment, with the sensitivity to a -21 msec.  I then hit preview and listened to the beat, the preview will have the note markers on every quarter note, so just tapping your assigned key to the beat in a 4/4 pattern will give you enough feedback as to your adjustments needed.  If your find you're hitting late, subtract more.  If you find you're hitting early, add more.  \n\nI'm assuming that sensitivity has something to do with the clap effect, however it seems that the function is completely broken.  As of 20 December, Turning the sound on seems to wreck your calibration from whatever you had it set at, causing you to miss notes.  Turning sound off, combined with the above calibration methods, has moved my gameplay experience up tremendously.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThere are 4 core gameplay modes at the present moment:  Quick Play, Arcade Mode, Cosmic Tour, and Competition.\n\nQuick Play:  Play the songs you have unlocked on any difficulty and key combination available.  Pretty straight forward, no unlocking process here.\n\nArcade Mode:  Your standard DJ Max-style Arcade experience,  You get 3 songs from a set list for each tier, changing for each tier.  Complete the song and move on. Fail, and restart from the beginning. No rewards for completing these.\n\nCosmic Tour:  This is where you'll be able to do most of your unlocks.  Song and Hero locks come from here.  Play the songs requested on the difficulty the game has selected, complete it, and move on.  There are several planets for you to progress through here.\n\nCompetition:  Compete in 3 song sets in a battle for a high score.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is enjoyable. It scratches the SDVX itch without having to shell out hundreds of dollars for a djDAO or a benjamin for a cheaper run model.  The music selection is great, however unlocking seems to be a bit of a pain, requiring a story mode to play through.  On one hand, it's not the standard unlock methods of either grinding a bunch of levels (DJ Max) or playing through every song on standard, then hard, then expert (Project Diva f/2nd, EBA/Ouendan), on the other hand, you've got to put some work in.\n\nI'd wholeheartedly recommend this to people, bearing that you have the time and patience to deal with adjusting timing for a good 30 minutes.  I mean, who doesn't do this with every rhythm game.  Also, turn off the sound effects.  They'll only hinder your ability to play.  Trust your keyboard sounds and your inner metronome on this, watch for the thicker measure lines, and you'll be further along in calibration than anyone else.", "timestamp_created": 1545293852, "timestamp_updated": 1545295806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648983538150787354", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47645092": {"recommendationid": "47645092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299222608", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1667575976}, "language": "english", "review": "rnm, \u9000\u94b1, CaO(\u8279\u6c27\u5316\u9499\u8279) ;", "timestamp_created": 1545293764, "timestamp_updated": 1642260421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47644500": {"recommendationid": "47644500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003349692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1640495350}, "language": "english", "review": "Great so far.

I think what this game tries to do may be mixing sensational lane performance(like SDVX) with strict and hardcore playing experience(like IIDX). But, this is really NOT a good idea. Cause you can hardly hit the notes accurately when the lane is shaking, turning or rising - and you get failed when hit many JUSTs or GOODs - as a result, I found I easily get failed when playing some songs with too many lane performance effects, though I am a skilled arcade player.(BTW, SDVX's lane performance never changes the position of the critical judge line but this game did change it and made me very uncomfortable).\nSuggestions for developer:\nTwo choice, one is to delete those charts whose lane is frequently shaked or turned, and remain strict judgement for hardcore MUG players.\nAnother one is to loose the judgement, which draws more unexperienced players to your game.\nNEVER try to please both skilled and light players, music game needs practice, otherwise it is only casual games.\n\nSome other suggestion:\n1. When a locked song is selected, tell the players how to unlock it. \n2. For the course mode, I don't think unclock class by class is a good idea. Skilled players should be able to play high rank courses directly.\n3.

This development team fixed essentially ALL the issues within a day. This game is one of the best rhythm games on steam. It does NOT deserve the DEVASTATING \"mostly negative\" label. It's good for both hardcore music gamers, and casual music gamers.\nInsanely great music choices.I hope for real-time multiplayer. Outdoes ALL rhythm games on steam to date. \n\nThey literally fixed all the game killing problems that i mentioned in the matter of a day, and are continuously adjusting the game to make the players happy. Never ever have i before seen a game development team so responsive and eager to please their player base. \n\nAfter a couple of days of playing, i'm almost convinced that this may be the best rhythm game available on steam. It's not necessarily your black and white rhythm game where you have a list of songs to play and that's pretty much it. This game adds plenty of elements to make the game feel like a hardcore game instead of a casual 3 minute arcade run. Like DJMAX you get perks but in the form of characters. There are several to choose from.\n\nThis may be a Chinese rhythm game, but there is music in multiple langauges, many consisting of Vocaloid. I'm not too fond of Vocaloid, but without my bias, the songs are very nice. But the music selection is great, with unlockables. UNLOCKABLES. Something that most games these days seem to have forgotten about. \n\nGameplay wise, the game is fantastic. You have three modes, with different gameplay mechanics. 4key, 6key which are just about the same with the ladder allowing you to play with more keys. Then there's 8 key, which is just about the same, except like i said in my old review, you have two keys floating on the side to watch out for. Combine that with the now optional dramatic camera, and you have a very challenging, but very refreshing rhythm gaming experience The game also has trial missions, which you can unlock stuff and earn in-game money from. In-game money that you can't purchase. With that said, there are no microtransactions. i love that. There are a TON of achievements to keep you playing. I can see myself playing this for hours. The look and feel of the game is fantastic.\n\nLike i said, this is by far one of the best rhythm games that you'll find on steam. But what impressed me the most about the game is the dedication of the developers. A breath of fresh air. Let's not forget the game's price, at $8 on launch sale. I'm tempteed to buy the game for friends, but they don't seem interested in music games. But this leads me to my next suggestion. \n\nSOME suggestions:\n- I'd suggest some real-time co-op or PVP features. Things that would keep the playerbase interacting with other players. \n- Seperate the key tapping sound from the rest of the effects in the game so i can mute it.\n-A less mobile-like UI. (A feature already in the making.) \n- Hopefully some DLC packs\n- Events\n-please add multiplayer if possible. We'd love it.\n\n\n___________________\n\nOLD REVIEW BELOW\n___________________\n\nTL:DR // Great looking game. Potential to be the greatest, but harsh note accuracy judgement, and unnecessary penalties make the game not so playable. \n\nI'm equally amazed as I am dissappointed. This game literally punishes you for playing it. I'm note exaggerating. \nThis game is a ton of fun. And it has potential to be one of the best Rhythm games on steam, but i have only played for 15 minutes, and i'm wow'd by the visuals and gameplay aspects, but i'm not so fond of the [a] and [;] buttons FLOATING on the sides of the screen. Just a distraction.\n\nBut that's something i can deal with. This game FAILS you and KICKS you out of the song if not all of your notes are \"MAXIMUM\" which is the game's version of 100% precise note tapping. The note judgement may be just a little too strict. You tap every note in the song, but if it's not all perfect, you will be kicked from your song before its over. TAPSONIC BOLD is a more definitive game, but this game has extremely amazing features, which sine in the viisuals. Your eyes will be taken for a ride as the camera is very dramatic. However it's a little distracting, but it works.\n\nThere's clearly a lot of thought put in the game. Regions i haven't even explored.

And for the first time in my twenty years of gaming I was told that my ID contains offensive content, so thanks for that.\nTo make things worse, the game just looks like a failed mobile port, as you can quickly notice from the in-game menu. (The Chinese government stopped reviewing new games a while ago, which makes the mobile port theory even more persuasive. ) Many visual components still feel blurry even when I chose 2K and Ultra in Graphics Options. Input delay is worse than my grandma's response time and the accuracy judgement system is a joke.

There is a PVP mode, and you have premium characters which could boost your abilities like score/accuracy and that kind of stuff.
