se siente esa sensaci\u00f3n de estar investigando en su historia, por cierto una historia muy convincente a mi parecer en donde trabajar en sus \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos se convierte en algo m\u00e1s \u00edntimo y adulto, y junto a juegos como the cat leady, downfall,lorelei o apocalipsis es uno de los mejores juegos point and click que he jugado.\n\nNuestra protagonista llamada kathy estudiante de periodismo, sarc\u00e1stica, adicta a los cigarrillos y afinidad por las motocicletas con su estilo particular de chica grunge regresa a Conwell Springs para el funeral de su abuelo, quien muri\u00f3 en circunstancias sospechosas despu\u00e9s de estar 10 a\u00f1os en estado vegetativo, luego de esta exposici\u00f3n inicial,kahty se encargara de resolver el misterio de la condici\u00f3n de su abuelo que la llevara a descubrir sucesos m\u00e1s profundos personales de la vida y pasado de ella , adem\u00e1s el evento desvelara oscuros sucesos de la ciudad tejido por un suicidio de una adolescente en 1981.\n\nEl juego es una aventura de apuntar y hacer click retro, posee muchos di\u00e1logos y va lento, me refiero a que deber\u00e1s prestar atenci\u00f3n a los di\u00e1logos y observar tu entorno para la investigaci\u00f3n, aunque no tiene nada preocupante y enroscado, tendr\u00e1s que resolver como funcionan los acertijos y armar algunas combinaciones.\nLa narraci\u00f3n es el fuerte del juego, con un personaje principal bastante carism\u00e1tico, sarc\u00e1stico y duro, khaty no se endureci\u00f3 por casualidad, todo proviene de un lugar da\u00f1ado, cubriendo algunas cicatrices y gran parte de la narrativa se preocupa por descubrir las razones de su naturaleza.\nkhaty rain en su totalidad es un juego pixel Art (son la clase de juegos que m\u00e1s amo y disfruto personalmente), por lo que gran parte del viaje se tratara de buscar pistas, como nombres, direcciones o n\u00fameros de tel\u00e9fono y anotarlos en una libreta peque\u00f1a que guardamos en nuestra mochila, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n fotos, disquetes de computadoras y dem\u00e1s accesorios, para usarlos con las personas o el entorno para recopilar m\u00e1s pistas que nos hagan avanzar, los sprites de los personajes son bien detallados los escenarios son bien trabajados y, a veces incre\u00edblemente hermosos, la m\u00fasica es misteriosa e intensa como para coincidir el estado de \u00e1nimo de la narraci\u00f3n, mientras que las voces son acertadas especialmente la de khaty <3\n\nEl juego es fascinante, la historia, las voces, las actuaciones son bastante espl\u00e9ndidas, pero como dije el juego es lento, se ajusta perfectamente al arquetipo cl\u00e1sico de apuntar y hacer click, no est\u00e1 centrado en la acci\u00f3n directa, as\u00ed que es recomendable para aquellos que les guste leer mucho, se sumerjan en lo narrativo, las historias profunda y adultas sobre el dolor, la transici\u00f3n, la religi\u00f3n y las decisiones personales que

Taking particular tonal, story, and thematic influence from Gabriel Knight, Broken Sword, along with subtle nods to Full Throttle, Kathy Rain tells the story of a family mystery surrounding the disappearance of the protagonist's grandfather. The setting of the very mature story is very intimate by taking place in a small rural community which adds to the story's haunting atmosphere. Additionally, the low-fi synth infused Darkseed style soundtrack further enriches the environment with its 70s radiophonic tinge. \n\nMuch like its visuals, the gameplay of Kathy Rain is very faithful to the 1990s point and click adventure games by offering puzzles, combining of items within the inventory, and character conversations. All of the games technical elements (gameplay, soundtrack, and look) mostly adhere to its retro premise with success. The lesser elements of Kathy Rain are to be found in the hit and miss voice acting, some repetition in the gameplay, and a disappointing plot development and resolution in its final chapter. The final chapter does suspend belief in its logic, reveal, and overall resolution of the story. But, Kathy is a very likeable protagonist while the throwback to 90s pop culture was well handled by avoiding a Stranger Things style of hammering of the premise. \n\nA solid game, with potential to develop into a series. Although the story does take some disappointing, not to mention sudden turns that raise more questions than answers, Kathy Rain is a very solid point and click. \n\n3.5 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1653726831, "timestamp_updated": 1653726831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116092816": {"recommendationid": "116092816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005326994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1462645248}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting I totally recommend it if you are into dark indie games.", "timestamp_created": 1653666612, "timestamp_updated": 1653666612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428571432828903198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116030180": {"recommendationid": "116030180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054549060", "num_games_owned": 845, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1653557572}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just nor for me.

I only had to look up answers on one or two occasions, although I got slightly frustrated once or twice as well.

[spoiler]I have yet to play a video game that properly represents Christianity or Christians, which itself is common throughout the world and media. However when it comes to a mystery game, the trope of \"seeming good religious person is actually evil\" is just very overdone. It's not [i]bad[/i] so much as it's predictable and I personally wish it was less so, or atleast far less obvious hahah.[/spoiler]\n2. [spoiler]As the game goes on it starts to lose itself a little or feel like it goes off the rails a bit. Very minor, but I mean it in the sense that as you begin to climax you are of course going to get a lot of exposition quickly so games will have crazy things taking place. However when finishing the game it leaves a couple of questions left unanswered, or questions that would be nice to answer. \n\nYou can understand the story and infer enough, but it might be a case of the developer wanting the interpretation to be up to the player or left a mystery which in this case is fine. It's just not as satisfying given the narrative from the start as you progress, since part of the mystery and setup seemed to take a 'supernatural vs reasonable cause' dichotomy, yet it never allows that to be resolved. \nPerhaps a sequel will expound more on this, in which case I would not mind how this game left things at all. ^^[/spoiler]\n\nThank you! <3", "timestamp_created": 1638563064, "timestamp_updated": 1638563064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104788083": {"recommendationid": "104788083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056980805", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1638243556}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greats.", "timestamp_created": 1638243584, "timestamp_updated": 1638243584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104736959": {"recommendationid": "104736959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123959323", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1700677496}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un d\u00eda lo regalaban, no daba un duro por \u00e9l y la verdad es que me est\u00e1 gustando bastante.", "timestamp_created": 1638210887, "timestamp_updated": 1638210887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104575006": {"recommendationid": "104575006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004027741", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1638118338}, "language": "english", "review": "The pixel graphics are a matter of taste.

The ending failed to leave and impact on me; I was expecting something deeper, more interesting from a philosophical standpoint (and it really seemed like it was headed that way for the most part, it just failed to deliver). Also, I was expecting the main character to grow a bit more. It's like the growth is supposedly there, but at the same time you don't really see the character change in any significant way. You don't see any sort of emotional consequence on her, you just see the process she supposedly went through. I think you actually see more of a change on ||E, the \"sidekick\" according to the game||, but it also could have been shown in a deeper way (e.g. ||have her views on religion changed at all after what she went through?||). Many of these plot points could potentially be explored in a sequel, but since there were no original plans to make one, nor have they been announced since then, I can't judge it for what it could become, but for what it is now. There are also a few messages that are at the very least questionable from an ethical stand point, and some violent scenes that are pretty much gratuitous and could have been avoided. And so, in spite of the good voice-acting, and the addictive story, I think the game ultimately failed to deliver what it could have, and so I can't truly recommend it (these weren't the only reasons, but I think they are the most relevant for prospective buyers to know).\n\nP.D.: I also encountered an audio bug I couldn't fix.

These may seem like trivial things, but I seriously think the devs/writers \"played with fire\" in making this game and didn't take things as serious as they ought to in terms of thinking about the implications of the ideas presented in this game.", "timestamp_created": 1629577010, "timestamp_updated": 1629577457, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.332649260759353638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97981543": {"recommendationid": "97981543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142498230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1629557856}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sencillo y emocionante.\nLa historia est\u00e1 bastante chula, buena m\u00fasica y personajes con feeling", "timestamp_created": 1629557950, "timestamp_updated": 1629557950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97875547": {"recommendationid": "97875547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041504979", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1629410859}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very enjoyable, looking forward to the director's cut!", "timestamp_created": 1629398532, "timestamp_updated": 1629398532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97783479": {"recommendationid": "97783479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108329767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1555844191}, "language": "english", "review": "While the ending wasn't to my personal liking, and your mileage may vary considerably, the rest of the experience was captivating and fun.

It surpasses expectations, makes no excuses and captures your attention \u2013 nothing more, nothing less. In other words, it's a good time and a safe bet.\n\nBut what does it do differently? Well, firstly, it's well-balanced without being boring. When having supernatural elements, I think there is a risk for a story to either be overwhelmed by it or not doing enough with it. It's easy for one element to get lost when realising the concept. Kathy Rain avoids this, managing to have a focus on the detective/mystery mechanics while having the supernatural lend weight to the story. It's good craftmanship, something that isn't praised enough in general.\n\nSecondly, this game has very good pacing. The tempo is good, never loses focus but still finds time for both light-heartedness and gravitas when needed. As a character, Kathy Rain gets straight to the point in all of her interactions and it reflects in how the story flows. It's entertaining, as simple as that. It doesn't exactly play your heartstrings like a fiddle, to be fair, but it's not without impact either. Good, not great, but that's far from a bad thing.\n\nIf you would ask me the one thing that would be my takeaway, however, I would bring attention to the way that the characters are designed. While Kathy herself is pretty damn good as a character, the people around her aren't exactly deep. More deep puddles than vast oceans, if you catch my meaning. With that said, what they do have is, well, [b]character[/b]. In reality, one does not have to show a lot of depth to be interesting, no matter what writing schools and/or literature critics might want to tell you. A little is most often enough, which is something Kathy Rain grasps very well. There are stereotypes in this game, but they avoid being harmful and instead make the characters have edge, adding colour to the picture without making it garish. It's Kathy Rain's best quality, in my opinion, and something I personally learned from.\n\nKathy Rain isn't a game that you should play. It's not a game I would expect to see in any top 10 lists or anything like that. Nonetheless, it's an easy game to recommend, simply because it does everything it promises and more. In the end, it makes for a satisfying game.

And lots of it.\nAs games needed to be minimalistic back then, there was a lost of re-use of locations. So you basically did different missions on the same set of locations, going back-and-forth between locations. Which also prolonged the game time (you both needed to find the right location, which took time.

But I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it despite the protagonist.\n\n\nPros:\nThe game is a massive nostalgia trip with almost every other line of dialogue including an old school adventure reference. And it\u2019s glorious.\nThe voice acting and casting is expertly done. Everyone is believable and seems to be enjoying and enthusiastic about their roles.\nThe mood and setting of the game is fantastic, the old school pixel art has been done extremely well and is strongly reminiscent of actual 90\u2019s adventure games.\nThe puzzles are very well done. I\u2019d say they lean towards overly simple, but at the same time they fit the theme and are laid out in such a way as to keep the pace of the game going with almost no points where you have to resort to rubbing things on other things. \n\nCons:\nI hate the protagonist. She\u2019s an abuser, physically and psychologically, and proud of it. She\u2019d petty, vindictive, cruel, and her veneer of \u2018reasons\u2019 are nothing more than excuses to continue to choose to act in a disgusting way and her vile behaviour begins right out of the gate. (Which I guess means she was very well written.)\nThe story goes weird. It starts out as an intriguing mystery but it feels like the writer was getting progressively more baked as the game goes on. This could easily be a positive too, the signs are all there foreshadowing from the start. It just feels a bit out. I\u2019d have liked some ambiguity.\nThe game goes out of its way to investigate trauma later on in a particularly uninspired way. The protagonist seems insincere at every point of the experience, though that could be my extreme dislike of them speaking.\n\nSuggested improvements:\nApparently there is a remake/extended edition on the horizon for this game. Hopefully they develop everything a little more without killing pace. I would be interested in knowing more about literally everyone one of the side characters. \nThere is ample room here for some side plots intertwined with the main story, and even some optional bits that aren\u2019t. (Dave vs Clyde, More about the base and gramp\u2019s history, etc.)\n\nI think closing off areas the player doesn\u2019t need to go to was a nice idea, but for me it detracted from red herrings I\u2019d created for myself. I\u2019d reopen those places and allow the player to roam, but I acknowledge that runs the risk of damaging the snappy pacing of the game. \n\nOverall recommendation:\nOverall I recommend this game. It isn\u2019t an old school adventure, but it\u2019s a damn good tribute. I suspect most people will actually enjoy it more than me because they won\u2019t hate the protagonist. So I give it a thumbs up, even if I don\u2019t particularly want to. \n", "timestamp_created": 1626126568, "timestamp_updated": 1626126568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618462681770324707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95626164": {"recommendationid": "95626164", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982719961", "num_games_owned": 2056, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1626048266}, "language": "english", "review": "When Kathy Rain\u2019s grandfather dies, the sassy, devil-may-care student reluctantly returns to her hometown for the funeral. There\u2019s not much in the way of happy memories for Kathy here; her father disappeared when she was young and she was forced to commit her own mother to an asylum.\n\nTrue to Kathy's recollection of Conwell Springs, the town's harbouring plenty dark shadows. So when it quickly becomes apparent there was more to her grandfather\u2019s death than meets the eye, Kathy starts an investigation of her own \u2013 asking questions that lead to increasingly disturbing answers.\n\nIt took a little while for [i]Kathy Rain[/i] to hook me.

The more Kathy digs, the darker the town becomes, forcing her to confront multiple of her own traumas. It\u2019s potent adventure game stuff, with well-written lines spoken by rather good voice actors.\n\nThere\u2019s a director\u2019s cut coming, but my hope is for many more adventures with Kathy and her unlikely sidekick Eileen \u2013 a pious but savvy college roommate.

Despite it coming out a few years ago, I'd never heard of it before, which is annoying, because it was excellent! I don't believe I've ever posted a review for a game before, even games that I've spent hundreds to thousands of hours on, so that should tell you how much I enjoyed 'Kathy Rain'! This will be a spoiler-free review. Something I want to say straight away is that a director's cut of the game will be released soon, so rather than buying this version of the game, you should wait and buy that to get what I assume will be the best possible experience!\n\nThe story was so much fun - I LOVED the setting and all the different characters. I was a little worried in the beginning that I'd ended up purchasing a Chick tract in the form of a game, but thankfully, this turned out not to be the case! I like Kathy a lot, although her 'I'm not most girls' line straight up left me cringing; I understand she's meant to be a tough-talking, leather-jacket wearing cool rebel type, but... come on lmao. She can be all those things without resorting to that - and both her story and personality are so interesting that that kind of worn-out cliche risks weakening what is a genuinely solid, funny, likeable character whom I really connected with. Arielle Siegel, who voices Kathy, did a fantastic job and I'm delighted to hear that she's returning for the director's cut version of the game.\n\nHonestly, the voice actors really make this game, which I'm not writing to diminish the strength of the story, but to emphasise how great they are! The whole voice cast really knocked it out of the park, and I was tickled pink by Goober! The characters are very well-written, although I was left with the feeling of wanting a little bit more. However, given that Kathy's running around trying to solve this mystery over the course of a few days, I do understand that she wouldn't exactly be standing around trying to get every single person's life story! So that's not really a criticism, more a testament to how interesting and well-written the characters were. There were a few moments during the game where the English seemed a bit off and it seemed something had been written (or perhaps translated?) inaccurately - but by 'a few', I really do mean that - no more than two or three times, and it didn't affect my understanding of what was being said. \n\nI thought the story was highly enjoyable and enjoyed the classic sci-fi-esque vibes. There are a bunch of different references to various other works in the game, and the creators make their influences pretty clear, but the story is by no means derivative or unoriginal. You'll recognise a lot of narrative tropes and character archetypes, however, they're very well done and so feel nostalgic and not remotely dull. The 90s setting was very cool - the last time I saw a floppy disk in any setting must have been over 15 years ago, so all of that older tech made me oddly sentimental.\n\nI didn't find most of the puzzles difficult other than the very early one in the attic (which I needlessly over-complicated for myself and had to look up - it's actually so simple that you, like me, will think you've missed something major: you haven't!), and the one involving the poem. I don't think there's any shame at all in looking any of the solutions up, especially if it's been a while and you're getting frustrated; games are supposed to be fun, after all! That being said, please don't use a walk-through: the game is a lot of fun and the story is fantastic, it would be a shame to spoil them.\n\nThe art style is lovely! I feel like the lighting was especially well done - whether it was sunlight coming in through blinds in a window or coming from a lamp, I was struck by how good it looked and it's clear that a lot of care and attention to detail was paid to making it all look just right. I also really loved the soundtrack. In fact, it reminded me a lot of the game 'Bully', though the themes of these two games are worlds apart! \n\nWith regards to the ending, I agree with 'purpledragon42' that it's evident early on that the story is going somewhere weird, haha. I really wasn't expecting how it turned out though, and I'm guessing there's a lot more to come, not just from the director's cut, but from possible sequels or perhaps games set in the same universe. The ending makes it very clear that 'it's not over yet',  and there seemed to be a lot more lore/world-building than you might expect for this kind of game. I noticed other reviewers felt that there were a lot of unanswered questions etc, and I do agree with that, but I think my reasoning above is why the game is like that. So I'm excited to see what happens in the future! \n\nAll in all, I'd give 'Kathy Rain' a solid 8 or even 9 out of 10! It was hugely enjoyable and the ending was very touching and meaningful. As I wrote at the beginning, I'd recommend waiting until the director's cut comes out before spending any money, but I am definitely going to be purchasing that myself and am looking forward to its release!", "timestamp_created": 1625609743, "timestamp_updated": 1625609743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95054034": {"recommendationid": "95054034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025142170", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1625423840}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1625423870, "timestamp_updated": 1625423870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95027473": {"recommendationid": "95027473", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975055219", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 801, "last_played": 1625382758}, "language": "english", "review": "a specimen of a standard-issue, old-school, VGA point-and-click of early 1990s ... no hard puzzles, no frustrating pixel-hunting, a moderately interesting story...

I must have clicked on everything that could be interacted with because I enjoyed the cultural references. \n\nThis game reminds me of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/merrychristmasknight/recommended/1220930][b]Metaphobia[/b][/url]. Their stories and themes are also quite similar. They both have pretty good voice acting: some characters who sound different also turned out to be voiced by the same people! If you don't count the 2 hours where I fell asleep while stuck on a puzzle in Metaphobia, I actually have similar playtimes for both games. I did find Metaphobia's puzzles more challenging.\n\nGoing back to [b]Kathy Rain[/b], I have two technical problems with this game. The first one is with the volume and speech box. Whenever I load a save file, the master volume goes all the way up, and the speech box becomes unchecked. The second one is the lack of a scroll bar for the saves. I saved many times through the course of this game (even though it was probably unnecessary), but there wasn't a bar to indicate whether I was in the middle of my save files or at the end. These aren't a big deal, but I think they could be improved, especially in the upcoming [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395030/Kathy_Rain_Directors_Cut/][b]Director's Cut[/b][/url]. \n\nThese technical issues aren't necessarily dealbreakers, so why am I not recommending this game? \n[list]\n[*]I find the protagonist very unrelatable. I know this is personal preference, but in every game, I hope to at least be able to relate to the main character on some level. I can understand where she's coming from, and I can see where some of the humour comes from, but it's just not my style of humour and not my preference to choose between bad, worse, and worst for her dialogue options. \n[*]While I liked some of the Easter egg achievements, I found that some of them were not in good taste. Again, I know this is a personal preference. I considered listing some of them out here, but I'll refrain from doing so since some of them are hidden achievements. \n[*]I agree with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145439976/recommended/370910/]another reviewer[/url] who said that this is more of a sentimental, coming-of-age story with supernatural vibes. The way this story was set up, Kathy didn't seem to be on her path to becoming a detective. Her roommate Eileen seemed more like it to me. My favourite characters in this game were probably Eileen and Goober.\n[/list] \n\nFrom my experience with this game, I think it's highly unlikely that I'll check out the Director's Cut when it's released. I know it will be available at a good discount for those who own this game, but getting this at a deep discount (80% off for 2.99 USD) doesn't alleviate my issues with the game's achievements, dialogue options, and not-quite-detective story. That is not to say that I didn't enjoy this game at all. There were parts that I enjoyed, but I'm not recommending this due to my personal preference. I do appreciate the developer's engagement in the forums and that they're creating a new game to hopefully give a more satisfying ending, so I'm not completely closing the door to trying out the Director's Cut someday.

It starts right off with a decent mystery, has resonable voice acting, good art, and a solid old-school gameplay. The puzzles are also really darn good, there's no moon logic, except for that time you need to tase discount Phill Colins (mostly because up until that point, you never did any action even remotely similar to it, and I wasn't even aware I could do it).\n\nThe bad: Somewhere at around 1/3rd of the game, it switches into being X-Files lite, and it goes quickly downhill from there. Instead of exploring a story of human tragedy, or tragedies, the writers decided to take this into supernatural lovecraftian territory. Now, this decision seems to me like they thought this would allow them to create a deeper story, and explore the undertones more effectively, but it feels rather cheap and poorly thought out. Here's how poorly they handled this: if you're going to do narrative interpretation, you can easily read this as a really dumb anti-drug game, or something so much worse.

Kathy Rain does a good job of avoiding that by using a notebook system and other event-specific gameplay elements (listening to tapes, using computers etc.) to pivot you towards interacting with the world in a more realistic way, which felt really natural to me. The downside of this is that the puzzles end up being pretty easy but because Kathy Rain's story was paced so well, just playing through it was satisfying enough without needing massively challenging puzzles to keep my interest. Although the story isn't anything mind-blowingly clever or original, it's told very well and the way the puzzles are interspersed and the twists and turns are revealed is pretty much perfect. It gets a bit sloppier towards the end (pretty common problem with point-and-clicks, which struggle a bit with action and tension) but overall very engaging.\n\nMy only major complaint is the character art. It's all fine and well animated enough but the designs themselves felt pretty uninspired. The game is set in the 90s but there's very little in the fashion or aesthetics that give that impression and a lot of the characters just look kind of generic.

Its story takes place over the course of five days, during which you uncover the mystery of an incident involving your grandfather and the people he knew. This game draws quite heavily from the famous 90's TV show \"Twin Peaks\", by David Lynch & Mark Frost, and features many parallels and direct references to it. By the end of the game, I'd argue maybe it draws too much.\n\nI think I got this game for free from some other website a year or two back. I was interested in it exactly because of the above connection to Twin Peaks, which I am a big fan of. Just when I decided to play the game I saw news that there would be a new edition of this game coming out, so I was unsure if I should have waited or not. But I figure that the game has been out for 5 years now and that's fair enough to just enjoy it for what it is.\n\nThe game took me about 6 hours to complete and I missed just one achievement. To gripe about that real quick, the very first achievement in the game rewards you by saying \"You missed the funeral\". Most people playing will probably get this one as soon as they start playing it, and it concerned me because it led me to believe you can miss events in this game, or that there was some sort of day-night cycle I would have to play around. I looked into it briefly and the achievement lies to you really, it's just triggered by inspecting a set number of items in the first room in the game. Don't worry about getting into this and feeling like you will miss out if you play it your way.\n\nPoint-and-click adventures aren't usually my genre, but I've always been interested in them. I haven't played enough personally to hold this up to others. It seems like pretty standard fare, however. 99% of the objects you inspect or interact with are meaningless. Click on a lamp? \"It's a lamp,\" You have a lot of options to interact with things, only for Kathy to say \"No, I don't want to\". There were many instances of inspecting photos and paintings, but there were no close-up models of these made. I would have liked to see the things my character is actually inspecting for clues, so that maybe I would have been able to see them myself. No such case in this title.\n\nOn the subject of minor gripes, there is no way to review past dialogue trees (you have a journal which would have been perfect for this), nor any way to pause during dialogue. I also noticed no in-game resolution options which would have been handy since I had to relaunch the game a few times to get it to look how I wanted, but perhaps that's a limitation of the engine the developers used. I noticed no bugs aside from the music cutting out randomly and restarting 10 seconds later rather than smoothly looping. On 2 or 3 occasions, the end of a dialogue tree forced me to leave a location before I was finished exploring it. Normally this would be a big no-no, but as mentioned in the previous paragraph, there was nothing for me to explore anyway.\n\nGraphically the game looks nice, but some of the sprites do a really bad job of representing their character portraits, namely the sheriff, who looks nothing like his sprite suggested to me. The music is decent, a small assortment of indie rock and dark synth music, maybe another influence of the 90's drama the game loves so much. Not any one track stands out as particularly memorable, but the soundscapes were best when it was most quiet and synths most jarring.\n\nI did like the voice acting of the game, and appreciate any game where you play as an angsty young woman. There are plenty of moments where you can curse people out and threaten them which is always great. I enjoyed a couple of the characters in the game, but really there's more people to talk to than there are characters, and there's not that many to talk to in this game. Many of them and their stories are abandoned entirely after their usefulness to you is done, which is not all that surprising considering how selfish your character is. I don't even recall being able to check on Goober after his \"accident\" which is just cold.\n\nThere are a few different kinds of puzzles in this game, and the one at the hospital was my favorite just for how evocative it was of its goofy 80s-90s gaming roots. That said, the game thankfully lacks many of the illogical puzzles those games used as well, with all of the few puzzles being fairly quick to solve, though they do not trick you into feeling very clever. One stands out as pretty bad, and this is where you lie about your identity on the phone. You get called out for this right off the bat because of your caller ID. So sounds like you have to figure out a new way to get this info, right? No. You just call again from the right phone, with the exact same voice and exact same question, to the exact same person, and he falls for it. Also Day 2 was a pointless slog which could have been cut entirely.\n\nThe elephant in the room is this games obsession with Twin Peaks. spoiler warning for the genre this game shifts towards. In the first hour of the game it hits you over the head pretty hard with a pretty bold name drop, and the more you learn about the mystery the more parallels you find. Some are just innocent references and that's totally cool. The setting, the owl, the bikers, cryptic speech, the connections to the local air force base and ufology, the.... dreams, ...the man in the red suit?? the mending?! The hole! Literally the entire ending sequence.\n\nThe red plants are even another strange connection, this one to the game Deadly Premonition, which is an even bolder rip-off of Twin Peaks than Kathy Rain is. The difference with Deadly Premonition is that the game is set up as a loving and goofy satire of the show and of video games in general, which it uses as a base to create its own mysteries and crazy train of a story that ends up nowhere near where it started.  Another good example of a successful Twin Peaks inspired game would be Life is Strange 1. It wears its wide range influences on its sleeves but uses their better parts to intuit its own story, own set of rules and imagery, and gives its main characters time to grow for a somewhat similar ending to really pay off.\n\nKathy Rain on the other hand seems so obsessed with its influences that it practically turns into an unabashed fanfic rather than using that inspiration for its own stories. It is essentially a remix of the Twin Peaks mythology with a tiny sprinkle of Cthulu mythos thrown in (which it does nothing with), just in case you thought they were running out of ideas. I was sure as soon as we got to the final day that the game would really start to pick up, and while some character points finally paid off, it did not shine when it needed to the most, and overall I do not feel like it earned its ending where Twin Peaks or Life is Strange did.\n\nThis makes me question why I criticize this game when normally I enjoy tropey things. Perhaps it is the specificity of what this game borrows that really bothers me, while genre-broad strokes I just take for granted in most games.\n\nI don't wish to be misconstrued. I enjoyed my time with Kathy Rain the more time I spent in it, it has a good atmosphere, good voice acting, good protagonist, isn't frustrating to play, and the mystery is engaging. But gripes about the originality aside, it is ultimately is filled to the brim with backtracking, missing characters, ideas not followed up on, and a lukewarm payoff. There is a lot holding this title back from being Great, it seems more like a proof of concept or resume piece for future projects. I also mentioned before that this review is written before the Director's Cut edition of Kathy Rain comes out, its changes seem significant.

Aunque hay que decir que a fecha de la realizaci\u00f3n de esta rese\u00f1a ya esta anunciada una versi\u00f3n Director\u00b4s Cut que ampliar\u00e1 la duraci\u00f3n del juego con nuevos escenarios, personajes y acertijos.\n\nUna nueva versi\u00f3n que no dudar\u00e9 en jugar a la menor oportunidad. \n\nAlgunos pueden cuestionar tambi\u00e9n el cr\u00edptico final del juego, muy abierto a diferentes interpretaciones.

Especial atenci\u00f3n al futuro del estudio desarrollador y a lo que podr\u00eda convertirse en una estupenda saga protagonizada por Kathy Rain. \n\nAbstenerse los m\u00e1s impacientes, los intolerantes del pixel y los detractores de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas. Simplemente estamos hablando de deportes diferentes. \n\n\n8/10.\n\n\n\n[h2]\u00a1M\u00c1S AN\u00c1LISIS EN MI [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38736533/]MENTOR\u00cdA[/", "timestamp_created": 1621190844, "timestamp_updated": 1621197001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71188431978225708", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91958071": {"recommendationid": "91958071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082311561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1620778214}, "language": "english", "review": "The story was fun and it reminded my a lot of my days playing Sierra games back in the 90's.

Retro fanciers will enjoy the nostalgic charm of the game's pixellated sprites and painted backgrounds, which are nicely done and will not torture the player with the need to waste time pixel hunting, although the simplicity of the gameplay felt to me a little like an overcorrection of 90s Sierra's sometimes notoriously convoluted puzzles.  Veteran adventure games will breeze right through this game for the most part as there are actually very few difficult  obstacles in their way here, and the game's snarky protagonist chooses her words carefully, dropping little hints to guide the player along.\n\nSpeaking of our Main Character, she felt to me like the end product of someone in development saying, \"Okay, so what if we took a smart-ass adventure game style protagonist and MADE THEM EDGY????\"  The writing just sort of bonks you over the head with Kathy's damage and makes her all sharp angles, especially in contrast with her Okily-dokily Flandersesque roommate/sidekick, Eileen.  I'm sorry, I get that unlikely friendships do happen, especially when you have to share cramped accommodations like a dorm room, but for the life of me, I could not for the life of me buy this partnership with the way the characters are written.  It just seemed to me that Kathy's big pile of accumulated trauma combined with her general abrasiveness would be a volatile combo with Eileen's cheerfully creepy intrusiveness and total lack of boundaries.  Which I guess sort of sums up the game's tonal problem.  Is this a small town mystery with a scrappy gal reporter unafraid to break the rules?  Is this a heartfelt exploration of generational trauma? Is this a psychotropic, supernatural, Jungian Hero's Journey?  Who knows!  It has elements of all three, sure, but falls short of really committing to any of them and just sort of skips across the surface on all counts, which is a little underwhelming.  You get the feeling that Kathy Rain doesn't quite know what it wants to be when it grows up, which is a little concerning for the possible sequel it teases. \n\nThe sound design is fine. The English voice cast play their parts well.  The music is just sort of there. It does its job of providing atmosphere but is otherwise unmemorable.\n\n Overall, Kathy Rain is a pleasant enough diversion, though it probably won't stick around in your head for very long afterwards.  It looks good, it sounds good, it plays smoothly.   It's just sort of regrettable, though, that like the sad final years of Kathy's Grandfather, Joseph Rain, the spark at this game's core is MIA.\n\nI guess a 6/10 sums it up.", "timestamp_created": 1619378704, "timestamp_updated": 1619378704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90872472": {"recommendationid": "90872472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052922416", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 543, "last_played": 1619881466}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome Story, i think this game is Hidden Gem from Indies Developer, Iam Surprise the game had FULL VOICES on the dialog, and everything, very Solid Game, the Voice Actor really Good too, the Comedy, the Mystery, The Horror Feels Just Very Amazing, this game had Pixel Art but the Detail on this Game really Amazing, So Beautiful, like i can Feels what Kathy the Protagonist Feel on her Journeys.

The story unfolds around Kathy's Grandpa' passing away, and Kathy digging into the mystery behind his death. You get your way around on your motorcycle, and you get information by talking to people, or clues by searching different places. This works like any other point and click game, very well. When you start a new point and click game there will always be alot of dialogue to get you started, and you have to get to know the different people and their personality before you get into the story, and into the game.\n\nMy patience for this game has been going up and down as I've played. Most of the time I could figure things out by myself, but when I was truly stuck, I felt I would rather get to know how to get further, than sitting for a very long time to figure it out myself. Normally figuring things out myself is how I do, but for this game I didn't feel it was worth spending so much time on it. The reason for that is the crazy story, mixed humour and things that are weird. The way you get around in the game is actually pretty good, and how you interact with people and objects are great, but I did feel I missed some more excitement. There are alot of good jokes in the game, but sometimes you're just sitting there cringing. The characters are pretty dramatic aswell. Maybe a bit too much. I did like doing the achievements though. They were hilarious, and are worth doing!\n\nTo sum up the game. If we ignore the weird story, the cheesy humour (which could be both good and bad), I would say that my biggest problem was patience. As I said earlier, I did finish most myself, but I felt that there were few puzzles that were really good, and sometimes, especially if you were stuck, it could get really boring fast. Most of the time you know where you wanna go next, but sometimes you have to guess stuff, that makes no sense. I know a few of the puzzles were all about guessing more or less, with some logic too, but I realised fast that it was better to check what to do, rather than being stuck for a long time.\n\nIn the end, I have been thinking alot about if I would recommend this game or not, but I have to choose one, so I give it a thumbs up. It's a good game as long as you keep progressing.\n\nP.S. If you wanna do all the achievements, without having to do a new full playthrough, save at every different location, or at least before doing important stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1616343572, "timestamp_updated": 1616348654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88801136": {"recommendationid": "88801136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148017781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1616290480}, "language": "spanish", "review": "grat detective game, it pulls you in into the story 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1616290718, "timestamp_updated": 1616290718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88796533": {"recommendationid": "88796533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872391733", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 8476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8476, "last_played": 1585925214}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fine, played it a little", "timestamp_created": 1616283465, "timestamp_updated": 1616283465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502810418605804443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88761806": {"recommendationid": "88761806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022854959", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 375, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1557189755}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid point-and-click adventure game with pixel graphics.

The controls are clunky, with the old-school point-and-click system in play. Every item has a Think-about-it,See-it and Combine option, Combine also meaning \"Use on someone\", which took me far too long to understand. For 80% of them the See-it is just the same thing with different dialogue.\nThe graphics are pleasant and the sound and music are nice. The puzzles were not bad, but 2-3 times I had to look them up because it seemed they make no sense.

Hf <3\n\n\n[h1]Story and Protagonist[/h1]\n   The Story follows Kathy Rain, a journalism student, who gets confronted with her childhood and family struggles after attending her grandfather's funeral whom she hasn't seen for years.\n\nIn the beginning I was a tad bit concerned about Kathy as a protagonist because even tho I liked her from the start she also felt intentionally edgy and \"not like other girls\". This concern was unneccessary tho and she as well as her friendship with Eileen grew on me. Especially near the end you can truly understand why Kathy became such a sarcastic and sometimes harsh person. (Not that she isn't funny or compassionate.)\n\nOverall the plot was weird but I liked it.\nI can totally see why some may be disappointed by the ending. It wasn't outright illogical or anything but too open for my taste. A lot of things were left without proper explanation and I wanted to know more.\nAt least there was somewhat of emotional closure for Kathy tho.\n\n[h1]Praise[/h1]\n   The thing that really stuck out to me - besides the pretty pixel graphics and the good voice acting - was the functionality of the interface and dialogue. It really makes the game so much more enjoyable that Kathy has her notebook where she writes down dialogue options and she remembers for herself what she already asked so most of the time you won't need to ask a greyed out option twice. She also updates it when getting new information not only crossing out stuff but also tweaking it a bit. This gives you a satisfying feeling of progression in your work as a detective.\n\n[h1]Difficulty and Achievements[/h1]\n   Difficulty is okay. I got stuck and had to look up a few things but I wasn't tryharding most of the time. So if you have some experience with Point & Click Adventures (I don't really), a bit of patience and are focused on the game I doubt you'll have any troubles. Otherwise you can always either try everything until something works (Calling E. for advice is also very helpful in the beginning) or look up your next step in some neat guide on steam.\n\nAchievements are also doable. Fun and not too outlandish. I got the missing ones after my first playthrough with a guide but I feel like you could get them just by paying attention.\nAlso be sure to save a few different times in your playthrough so that you don't have to do another full one to get to 100%.

This game borrows from GK1 very visibly, quite directly and by the truckloads. Which isn't a bad thing, GK was one of strongest titles of genre, technology and era.\n\n[u]The graphics[/u]\n\nEverything about graphics in this game is quite [i]professional[/i]. Professional as \"I am solo indie dev and I need to make a game by deadline, and everything has to work and look good\". Not someone's Artstation portfolio with 120 hours dumped into a single image just to squeeze as much out of pixels as possible or whatever. It's a clearly mission-oriented level of effort.\n\nThus it takes no risks. Everything looks as it should, character sprites have functional animations, doors open with according animations and so on. But there's no apparent attempt to \"wow\" the player or any serious extra effort, luxury animations with way more frames than needed or whatever. It's a decent-looking game, with some scenes looking quite good, others barely functional. Same goes for character sprites and animations. Not great, not terrible. They just do what they're supposed to do. So it's hard to either praise or criticise anything. If anything, it looks like game has used photos (or 3D renderings?) here and there for scene elements. They're really well obfuscated to fit in with overall style, but a pixel art purist would still easily notice them.\n\n[u]The sound[/u]\n\nThe sounds are quite basic, as it's usual for this genre, voiceacting is most for good part. Worst offender in voiceacting is the priest character, because he sounds way too much like actor reading script from paper. And his sound mix doesn't have effects to the environment he's in, be it church or talking to a bunch of people in a cemetery. It all just sounds like dude in a studio reading lines to himself.\n\n[u]The music[/u]\n\nKathy Rain has quite minimalistic music, but if you take a moment to notice it, it's pretty good in most places. I especially like the track at the clinic ward, which greatly reminds of me of Jesper Kyd and his Hitman: Codename 47 soundtrack. Pity this track is limited to this very briefly used scene.\n\n[u]The mechanics[/u]\n\nThe notebook system, very elegantly solved inventory and fast travel system are excellent. You can highlight interactible items with spacebar, which is also must-have in such titles.\n\nThing to pick on here is quite pointless addition of verb coin - this game's need could have been solved easily by just using two mouse buttons, since there's rarely any need for 3 or 4 actions per scene element. Kathy Rain also suffers from common problems of the genre; main character moves very slowly and since there's a ton of backtracking despite quite few scenes, it just gets grindy. You cannot skip animations, either, so strap in to see Kathy Rain putting on and taking off her bike helmet for 500 times or slowly stroll into a police station/cemetery.\n\n[u]The gameplay and puzzles[/u]\n\nMain problem is that game is super strictly linear, you'll be backtracking everything to find that hidden trigger you missed. Puzzles are definitely on very easy side, with just 4 or 5 more clever ones peppered in. Puzzle-wise, game is very suitable to people new to the genre, Point-and-click veterans will just breeze through.\nLuckily, there's no annoying puzzles with math or sliding elements or some other stupid filler stuff. Everything serves the story and mostly makes perfect logical sense.\n\n[u]The characters and plot[/u]\n\nThe writing, in general, is pretty weak. There's no character development, no ulterior motives, nothing like that. Just your basic episode of a TV show, more or less. Grumpy Sheriff will stay grumpy, nerdy roommate will stay nerdy.\n\nThe plot starts from dull family mystery, tries to get more serious with message about forgiveness, but spoils it all with supernatural angle. So despite few \"serious\" keywords, entire thing is pretty light as a package. Which isn't really a bad thing, but don't expect to have deep emotional connection with anything in this game, during or after.\n\nThere isn't much humor in this game, either. Plot follows pretty narrow tone and mood, and stays on that.\n\n[u]The verdict[/u]\n\nKathy Rain is a point and click adventure game with mostly everything functioning as it should. It's light enough to play through in an evening, easy enough for newbies in the genre, neutral and forgettable enough to suit all tastes and well-done enough to be one of modern staples of the genre.

No tendr\u00e1s problemas en entender todo aunque he de decir que al cerrar el juego y volver a entrar el juego estaba en ingles, por ende tuve que volver a ir a opciones para ponerlo en espa\u00f1ol nuevamente. \n\nsegundo, no encontr\u00e9 ning\u00fan tipo de bug o error o problema con el juego. \n\ntercero, la m\u00fasica del juego es bastante agradable y se adapta bastante bien a cada lugar que visitas. Me atrevo a decir que incluso ciertas m\u00fasicas me recordaron un poquito a algunas de Life is Strange. Los efectos de sonidos tambien son bastante apropiados para cada objeto. \n\ncuarto. cada escenario es relativamente peque\u00f1o por lo que recorrerlos no te tomara nada de tiempo y presionando la barra espaciadora puedes resaltar todos los objetos y personajes con quienes puedes interactuar. \n\nquinto. sobre la historia: bastante interesante. al principio no pensaba que seria llamativa pero poquito a poquito el juego te da incentivos para averiguar mas y entre mas averiguas mas grande se vuelve el inter\u00e9s por saber m\u00e1s. cada misterio que resuelves entrega nuevos y te dan ganas de avanzar y avanzar y no parar o al menos ese fue mi caso. \n\nsexto. sobre gr\u00e1ficos, realmente pedir\u00eda que no juzgues el juego por ellos. En mi caso me acostumbre r\u00e1pido a ellos y terminaron siendo agradables a la vista. Si realmente juzgas el juego por los gr\u00e1ficos entonces recomiendo que te enfoques en jugar para descubrir la historia y no te enfoques en intentar descubrir alguna belleza visual.\n\ns\u00e9ptimo. sobre la historia pues podr\u00edas quedar mas que sorprendid@ y de seguro se ganara un buen puesto en tu lista de recomendados. Puedo a\u00f1adir que cada personaje se adapta tambi\u00e9n bastante a su personalidad, no sientes que ning\u00fan personaje act\u00fae de manera falsa u obligada y lo mismo con las voces.  hay juegos de compa\u00f1\u00edas enormes cuyos personajes y como act\u00faan han dejado mucho que desear, en el caso de Kathy Rain, eso no sucede. \n\noctavo. sobre el precio pues . . . soy una persona algo pobretona y preferir\u00eda gastar semejante cantidad en otra cosa. Compre este juego por que estaba en rebaja y vali\u00f3 la pena. Recomiendo pagar el precio completo si eres realmente fan de los point and click y no tienes ni idea de que juego de dicho genero comprar. Tu dinero no sera mal gastado, pero si no ere tan fan y buscas un juego para relajarte por unas horas y disfrutar de una historia muy muy decente e interesante pues espera a que este en rebaja. \n\nSea como sea que adquieras el juego, realmente lo recomiendo a quien sea. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1610326389, "timestamp_updated": 1610326389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84444588": {"recommendationid": "84444588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127243277", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 603, "last_played": 1610241187}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La historia es interesante.

Whispers of a Machine is far superior in story telling, plot, characters, and pacing. Had I not played it first I might have liked this one a bit more. \n\nThe protagonist Kathy Rain is a \"not your typical girl\" tomboy who rides a motorcycle, drinks, smokes, and always has a witty comeback. She came off as pandering and way too much of a caricature to be relatable or likable. Eileen your chipper nerd girl christian sidekick isn't any better. Her entire substance as a character is that she is a mildly obsessed stalker who knows way too much about you (she knows your ssn? wtf...) and does not respect boundaries. Every time she crosses a line the game writes it off like it's nothing which bothered me a bit. \n\nThe plot itself was confusing at best and predictable and corny at worst. It started off as a regular murder mystery only to take a lazy turn into the supernatural around the middle. The puzzles themselves weren't all that difficult and just required going back and forth until you had all of the info. Some points of the game required you to make weird intuitive leaps that meant minutes upon minutes of frustrated clicking and just eliminating all your options until you did the right thing. \n\nThat being said the art is really nice and evokes that classic 90's point and click vibe and the voice acting is decent if not good for most of the game. The soundtrack is also fairly solid and sets the tone well. Is this an award winning game that everyone should buy? Nope. But if it's on sale and you like point and clicks you probably won't regret picking it up for an afternoon. \n\nAlso the abortion bit near the end was seriously messed up.

But after restarting, I set the game to windowed mode and played it through.\n\nDO NOT RUN THIS GAME IN FULL SCREEN MODE OR YOU MIGHT LOSE EVERYTHING ELSE RUNNING IN YOUR CURRENT WINDOWS SESSION.\n\nI thought this was an old game, they did well convincing me that it was retro. One reason I legitimately thought it was an actual old game was the config uses DirectX9, which was released initially in 2002. The other option is DirectDraw 5, which is a long discontinued API. The game refused to load using DirectX9, so I had to select DirectDraw 5 to get the game to work.\n\nUpon learning this game was released in 2016, I'm quite miffed that they didn't make this more compatible with modern computers, and for that alone I'm still tempted to keep a negative review.\n\nSo, to repeat what I yelled above, do not use fullscreen mode. I did so, and tried to switch to the Windows desktop via Alt-Tab and the game immediately caused a Black Screen of Death. I had open a couple database files, a development IDE, and many browser tabs.\n\nI could not even break out of the BSOD by hitting Ctrl-Alt-Del or Ctrl-Shift-Esc, I also couldn't use the Windows hotkeys to switch to another desktop (which I've done on other misbehaving games like FarCry 2 which seem to like to BSOD).\n\nAs a result, I may have lost some things I was working on, all to play this game for a break from work. I do not consider that acceptable, given the year this was released, and that Windows 10 is fairly standard. As such, I can not recommend this game.\n\nAll that aside, this game is a point and click adventure the likes of The Secret of Monkey Island. It does have some humor to it, but it's got more of a Life is Strange feel.\n\nThe opening was quite heavy with religious narratives, and that put me off as an atheist that doesn't want to have some game attempt to be a morality play encouraging one to find salvation.

They are planning a new version of this game, so I cannot recommend buying this old edition. Original review follows...\n\nTLDR: It's quite fun... I'd likely rate it about 6.5. If you want a little point and click diversion you could do far worse, just don't expect the earth in terms of puzzles or story.\n\nA good homage to the old point and click adventures with plenty of nods to various influences. \n\nPuzzles are not too complicated, and only a couple I had to Google as they seemed rather abstract or not clear. And indeed if there is one fault it's sometimes clear what you're meant to do next.\n\nIt merges various plots - and goes certainly weirder than I expected. If was surprised to see this came out just before Stranger Things, as you'd certainly think Stranger Things was an influence.\n \nThe separate elements each are good but I'm not sure if there's enough cohesion to really tie them together in a truly satisfying way. Indeed the plot seems to stumble about towards the end and I felt many characters felt abandoned. I would have preferred more of a cohesive end.\n\nThe main character herself is a little stereotypical at times. Clearly a bit Buffy Summers, but tries a little *too* hard to be edgy. I suspect it was written by a man, as a lot of is a kind of male view of what a cool woman should be. She swears, she rides motorbikes, she smokes! She has no time for dodgy men or their nonsense! \n\nBut really all in all, it's a fun little game.

Artwork, soundtrack, and voice acting is all great. Puzzles are fine overall - nothing too obtuse. The mainline story in the first half of the game is interesting too. It starts off as a nice little mystery and slowly builds bit by bit.\n\nNow the bad. To start with, Kathy Rain herself. She seems to have been written as a cool rebel with an attitude - she smokes, rides a motorcycle, her side of her dorm room is a mess, and she can pick locks with paper clips - but she also has a messy past and is a afraid to open up! Unfortunately she just comes across as unlikeable. She's quite rude to a lot of the NPCs (not in a cool way, in a \"No need for that.\" way), and it becomes difficult to really care or root for her as the story progresses. In fact I'm struggling to think of many reasons to like her as a character.\n\nAs for the second half of the story *SPOILERS* [spoiler] at first I thought it was maybe going to go down the route of some weird cosmic horror, which at first I was on board for, \"Cool I suppose. I wasn't expecting this, but I'm up for the ride.\", then it just seemed to get massively bogged down focusing on the unlikeable Kathy, the main story line just unravelled and stopped making sense, and it certainly didn't wrap up the story in a satisfying matter.

If you like classic or retro style Point & Click Adventure games you\u2019ll likely enjoy and appreciate this game.  I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for those under 13 though simply because of the frequent cursing.  It does touch on some darker topics such as suicide and abortion but, doesn\u2019t show much gore or anything regarding murders and deaths.\n\nThe story is pretty good, very interesting but could have been fleshed out a little more.  For example, they introduce a boy early on but the story around him is underdeveloped.  He seems like he should play a more important role but you seem him only briefly in a short cut scene and then as a minor plot device to move the ending forward.  The ending feels a little rushed and seems to be somewhat underdeveloped.\n\nThe premise of the story is that you find out your grandfather (who you\u2019ve not seen for like 15 years) dies and you go his funeral and become interested in the mysterious cause of his long-term illness and eventual death.  As a journalism major you start investigating and it leads you to find out about several other deaths and illnesses and eventually leads you to some supernatural causes.  There are several intended plot twists but much of it was actually kind of predictable or at least partially predictable.  However, even if you can see what\u2019s coming the story itself is interesting as it unfolds.\n\nThe characters in the story are for the most part well done.  I think there could have been a little more time fleshing out some of the characters and giving them more of a story arc.  Kathy Rain feels like she\u2019s meant to have some major character development happening but it doesn\u2019t feel like after everything happens that she\u2019s actually worked through her past issues or shown much growth just accepted it enough to get through some tests and come out feeling largely unchanged.  I guess that this aspect of character development could have been much further developed and maybe it was intended to do so but the whole end feels a little rushed and maybe some of that was pared down to reach deadlines, budgets, or something along that line.  Some of the characters seem highly stereotyped but most I\u2019d say are kind forgettable besides our main character.\n\nThe graphics of this game are done in a retro pixelated style common for 90\u2019s games and retro styled games from the adventure games renaissance.  The pixelated graphics for the most part, are good.  Some odd sizing issues when the sprite has to move forward and backward on a scene but the left right mechanics are good.  The sprites are well drawn for their graphic size and the animations in general are smooth and have reasonably good walkpaths.  The backgrounds are well done and sufficiently display the environments and set the tone of the scenes.\n\nThe sound was good for this game.  Though the music is largely forgettable it did a good enough job of matching the tone and scene so that I never felt pulled out of the game by it.  It blended well to the setting; it just didn\u2019t stand out as noticeable.  The voice recordings were well recorded, very professional sounding.  The voice acting was also really well done.  I was surprised by how well the voice actors did.  The conversations didn\u2019t sound awkward or overly scripted and the actors were able to easily create natural sounding conversations.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many puzzles in this game but, the few that are there are fairly logical and straightforward.  I did find the second part of the tomb puzzle near the end to be a little confusing and struggled with that for a while but most of the puzzles were moderately easy in my opinion.  Not so easy you don\u2019t feel challenged at all but not so tough that you get overly frustrated with the game either.\n\nThe UI in this game is bare bones.  They tried to make the UI very simplistic.  This works in some ways but is frustrating (to me anyway) in others.  For example, in a typical P&C Adventure game you can select an item from your inventory the you see you\u2019ve picked it up and you click it on something to try different reactions with various things in the inventory/environment.  Often you have multiple choices on your cursor to look, get, use, talk, etc\u2026  which you then click on the item.  In this game however, you  click on the inventory item and then options appear around the item to look at it, think about it, use it, or combine it.  To use it in the environment around you, you must select combine and then click on the thing you want to use it with/on.  This feels like an extra step to me and I found that method of interacting to be a little annoying but, I think it\u2019s just a personal preference.  It works fine but, it\u2019s not my preference for interacting with the game.  The other thing I don\u2019t really like is there is no access to the menu for saving, loading, changing options, etc\u2026 right in the screen or with a mouse-over spot somewhere on the screen.  You can access that menu by pressing esc but, I prefer to have access to it a little more obvious.  There is not worry about pixel hunting with this game as it shows hotspots by pressing the spacebar so if you hate pixel hunting then you\u2019ll love this feature.\n\nThere are 20 achievements in this game.  5 of those unlock through story completion but the rest require special actions, repeated actions, or in some cases \u2026 alack of action.  All of the achievements are obtainable in 1 playthrough but unless you are using a guide I\u2019m guessing many people would be missing a good half of the remaining 15 achievements.  Many are not something you would come across naturally.  Do pay attention to what Kathy says about things when she looks at or thinks about them.  Sometime she gives clues that indicate something you could do for an achievement.\n\nI did my first playthrough in about 4.5 hours and then played half way through for a missing achievement in about 1.5 hours.  I\u2019d say this game probably is a 4-6 hr game depending on your familiarity with P&C games and how long certain puzzles take you.  At. 4.5 hours it\u2019s about $3.33/hr of gameplay.  I don\u2019t think it has a huge amount of replay value though.  At that price point it is a little too pricey.  If however you can get it on sale, it\u2019s well worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1604954495, "timestamp_updated": 1604992551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686616301536560059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78918362": {"recommendationid": "78918362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306942316", "num_games_owned": 622, "num_reviews": 224, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1604804125}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple, and easy point and click adventure.

Although a little on the short side, every step pulls players further into the story. \n\nIt does have its drawbacks. Kathy herself - sarcastic, cynical, even \"edgy\" - is not a heroine for everyone, although she does become more endearing as we learn more about her. The puzzles are, for the most part, fairly straightforward for seasoned adventurers, with solutions frequently telegraphed, but this does serve to keep the plot moving and interest alive for those less interested in point-and-click nostalgia. There is no moon logic, thankfully - that would be a nostalgic step too far - although you are asked to do some eyebrow-raisingly amoral things to progress.\n\n Like a lot of games which set up an impossible premise, it also struggles to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the mystery it creates. Faced with the choice between over-explaining  or remaining frustratingly cryptic, Kathy Rain leans slightly towards the latter and rushes through the ending, seemingly realising it has an unsolvable mystery on its hands and dealing with this by leaning heavily into the surreal. It's something of a cop-out, but the eerie atmosphere and experience as a whole outshine the hasty finish.\n\nTechnically speaking, the voicework is remarkably good for an independent developer. The art design is both beautiful, especially in the backgrounds, and a nice homage to old school adventure games of the 80s and 90s, a perfect choice for the game's setting. The aspect ratio is an unusual choice but not one which causes any issues.\n\nKathy Rain has its flaws, that much is undeniable. Personally, I find them excusable both for its atmosphere and as a first outing from the developer - a slightly longer game from a more experienced developer, with more time spent exploring the characters and resolving plot threads, would solve most of the issues it has. Approach it with that in mind and Kathy Rain is a compelling little game which will leave you wanting more.", "timestamp_created": 1602450637, "timestamp_updated": 1602450637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77340876": {"recommendationid": "77340876", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994008150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1603039890}, "language": "english", "review": "As a young gamer I was a huge fan of the genre.

Considering that the game is the first attempt of a  small team of developers, I was suitably impressed and I recommend it  if you are a fan of point-click adventures with beautiful pixel graphics especially if it's on sale.\nPROS\n------\nGameplay: Gameplay was good. Story progression and buildup was well executed. Though I read some reviews complaining it was boring, I think on the contrary that the slow buildup is what creates the intriguing atmosphere of the game and gives it a nice 'twin peaks' vibe. I found the puzzles well thought out and neither too easy nor difficult. \n\nSetting: Kathy Rain goes back to her childhood town to find out more about her recently deceased grandfather. Major twin peaks vibe and I really liked the atmosphere of the game. So if you are a fan of the small-town mystery genre you will like this game\n\nBuildup: The story is a mixed bag. The buildup was really good so I decided to put that in the pros but the ending was kind of anticlimactic. I would say the first 2/3 of the game really gets you hooked into the story and I found myself genuinely intrigued to find out more.\n\nKathy: I really liked the main character. Her voice acting was really good and I digged her snarky biker girl vibe (could say its bit of a 90s cliche but i personally liked the character). Her unlikely friendship with innocent christian girl eileen was fun to watch. I read some reviews saying that there isn't much character development but how much character development can you actually put when all the events in the game takes place in 4 days.\n\nMusic: The music is excellent! Really simple and has that 90's vibe with a modern feeling. Kudos to the music designer.\n\nArtwork: I love pixel graphics and the artwork in this game looks and feels nice.\n\nCons\n____\nEnding: The ending could have better. Don't get me wrong its not garbage but after the excellent buildup of the first 2/3 of the game, the ending kind of putters out. Felt like there was a nice potential for lovecraftian element but its never fully explored as the game ends before Kathy can find out more about the lore.

It was a long, lazy summer where the world was pretty okay, but folks still had plenty of small troubles to handle. Kathy Rain really captures that sense of small drama and big impact. \n\nKathy Rain herself is a troublemaker with a leather jacket, a zippo lighter, and a devil-may-care attitude. While she's got plenty to do in solving the mysteries which hide in Conwell Springs, I really appreciated how Kathy Rain (the game) does not shy away from confronting the traumas of Kathy Rain (the character). While she's got plenty of humor, attitude, wit, charm, and all the clever can-do spunk you'd expect, she's a character with depth, just as capable of being angry, confused, scared, or sad. She's neither strong nor weak. She's just a person who somehow keeps moving forward as best she can. Turns out, her best is pretty damn good. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, the game hits a sweet spot in point-and-click adventures. Any number of games create fake difficulty by simply keeping you ignorant. Not so in Kathy Rain. Most of the puzzles make sense. You usually have a pretty clear idea of where you want to go and what you want to do, while still having to think about how you're going to get there.\n\nThe music, sound, and art are all pretty solid for what they're trying to achieve. They really nail the bit where you're on your bike, just cruising between zones and watching the countryside roll by. \n\nI won't say much about the plot, since I enjoyed it but don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that when your game is subtitled \"A Detective is Born,\" your spunky 90's rebel chick is going to find a mystery.

The rest of the game is a slow walk and talk through a town to solve a mystery about an incident that happened to your late grandfather. The game isn't nearly long enough to create a compelling narrative and it is hard to feel any attachment to characters you talk to once or twice. There is a horror(or science fiction? I really didn't know what they were going for) element, that to me comes out of nowhere after the beginning of the game. Again, this element isn't explained in depth and the conclusion at the end of the game is very underwhelming. \n\nAs far as the gameplay is concerned there aren't any bugs and I was never really confused on what to do or where to go. The gameworld is incredibly small and sparse of objects, usually you can get by with examining each object and then talking to a relevant person about it. That usually opens up a new place to go and then you repeat the process.\n\nI give it a solid 5/10. I bought it on sale for a couple bucks and it was worth that price. The story is mediocre at best and doesn't stand with any of the fantastic indie point and clicks released in recent years or even close to the titans of the genre. Money and time could be much better spent trying those. However the game makes sense for the most part and the voice acting was fine. Music was well made and fit the atmosphere of the areas almost all of the time. It took me 5 hours to complete the game at a snails pace with a little bit of a replay to see if dialogue choices matter.[spoiler] It doesn't, all choices lead to same thing.

Which, i suppose, is an authentic 90s experience. And while i was in the target market for this sort of game back in the days where this is set, i am not nostalgic for the teen angst that smothers this game. I can't speak for everyone, obviously, since this game is overall well reviewed, but Kathy's constant MTV-era snark and the overall edginess\u2122 of the story and setting is stuff i grew out of years ago, and is more cringe-inducing than charming nowadays. It's like Daria without the self-awareness or social commentary.\n\nPerhaps most annoying, though, were the points where i had the little mysteries figured out long before Kathy did, but couldn't follow through on the correct course of action without completing a few more fetch quests first, to make sure she gets it.\n\nI also didn't think the conclusion was a satisfying wrap-up to the plot, or the character arcs. [SPOILERS] In particular Kathy's friend E, whose full name is escaping me right now. There seemed to be a lot of foreshadowing to that character either betraying Kathy, or becoming an integral part of her ultimate victory. In the end she was neither. She shows up at Grandma's house, causes another bit of character conflict, and is swiftly put into a coma to motivate our hero to...do what she was already going to do anyway. In the end, Kathy defeats the evil (FOR NOW, ELLIPSIS QUESTION MARK), her friend returns to normal, and Kathy is happy to have saved her. Literally none of their character conflicts mattered in any way.\n\nAlso, just a quick note as a personal defense of my pride in a matter that's largely irrelevant. Steam says i played this game for 18 hours, but it was probably more like five. I accidentally left it running all day while i was cleaning the house this weekend.\n\nTL;DR: i'm not sure who this is for. Nostalgic 90s kids will (probably) find the tone cringey, and current edgy teens are (probably) not looking for 90s nostalgia.

Thank God (the crimson one or the other as you like) this game is faithful to its roots. It has - almost - everything that a point and click adventure has to have.\n\nMost of all, the game has a great story. It starts very normal, then turns into a psychological-supernatural adventure. In a good way, I had flashes of The X-Files, Twin Peaks, Sanitarium at certain points of the story. But these are under the surface, nothing is pushed down to our throat by force. I enjoyed playing this through from the beginning till the end of the credits. And I'd easily watch it as a feature film or animated movie.\n\nLiked\n- Captivating story from the beginning to the end\n- Believable and living characters\n- Great, sometimes funny, sometimes suspense dialogues\n- Easy to use inventory\n- Easy and meaningful way of travelling \n- Not only the actions that make the story go forward are handled. As we try to do everything with everything and on everything, we can get some very funny reactions. And Kathy has a though on all items.\n- The puns, and references, or just slight resemblances of books, movies, series, games, etc.\n- The adult motif in the game (and I'm not talking about swearing or sexism)\n- The subtle, blink-and-miss moments, e.g. the Crimson Man outside the house at he beginning of Day 4.\n\nCould have been better\n- Missing \"double click on exit for fast pass\" option\n- The contrast between the portraits (during the discussions) and the pixelated version of the characters. Sometimes they seem to be a different person.\n- The elderly character's portraits don't seem to be old.\n- Despite using paint thinner in the chapel office picture make sense, this action has no unique reaction.\n- Pretty much linear close to the end. There is only one possible thing to do, but it has to be done in two screens away all the time. Game design like this always drags me out from the story, as it is tiring and makes me start worrying about my time.\n\nNot liked\n- Promoting smoking (even with an achievement) Fair play to the warnings though.", "timestamp_created": 1596385100, "timestamp_updated": 1596385100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700770854949951172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73627369": {"recommendationid": "73627369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129936651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 454, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1596311230}, "language": "english", "review": "Kathy Rain is a great Adventure, Point and Click game, but now it\u2019s time for the story.\n\nIt has been a long time since being in her home town, since Kathy rain saw her grandparents.

Well the story is really good with not just a lot of twists and turns, but a lot of heartfelt, touching and some scary moments in it. The mystery is really good with plenty of clues to keep you guessing.\n\nThe pixel Graphics/backgrounds were very nice and well detailed. The levels in the game were also fun to see and explore with some beautiful scenery you can look at. \n\nThe characters in the game were very interesting especially the main character Kathy Rain who comes off as snarky and sassy but feels very human with the trauma she has to deal with.\n\nThe puzzles in the game were okay some could be a pain others not so much. The music in the game was good and some of the humor in the game was kind of funny. The voice acting is pretty solid like Kathy and her friend Eileen and the Grandma being one of the best acted.\n\nSo what is to dislike about the game, well honestly nothing it's pretty perfect. Well maybe some of the puzzles could get very annoying sometimes, but that is just a nitpick besides that this game is pretty perfect.\n\nSo Kathy Rain is a great Adventure, Point and Click game, with a really good story, very nice and well detailed the pixel Graphics/backgrounds, and very interesting characters.

Kathy herself is a very interesting character, at first somewhat unlikeable, with attitude problems, yet so wonderfully written, a different protagonist than the usual goody-two-shoes, and as you uncover more of her past and her personal demons that haunt her it makes for a very intricate and believable, flawed but relatable character. The writing and narrative remains strong for most of the game, although because of the more surreal elements the story contains, with the most obvious inspirations being David Lynch and the cult show Twin Peaks it might not be for everyone.\n\nGameplay is another excellent aspect, with very interesting puzzles, that can range from simplistic to a couple of more complex head-scratchers , but never requiring \"moon-logic\", always clever and making sense (and I really loved the idea of the journalism notebook that adds one more layer of clues besides your traditional inventory) Overall, it's your typical point&click fare, with clear view of the environments, no need for pixel hunting.\n\nRegarding the... pixels, be aware that this game is running in a specific older engine and has the aesthetic of an old-school adventure game. Do not go in expecting high fidelity/high res graphics and in all honesty, for most fans of the genre, little does it matter. What matters is that even in their low res glory, characters and environments look beautiful and vibrant, with a nice variety of locations and characters to talk to. \nMusic is quite nice but perhaps a mixed bag, with the more \"normal\" tracks being serviceable, nice to lsiten to though not anything special, but I really loved the tracks when the story was taking a more mysterious and horror-esque approach, with distorted or slow atmospheric synth music (very reminiscent of the previously mentioned Twin Peaks for example).\nIt is also fully voiced with most of the actors giving a pretty good performance, and snarky Kathy herself being really fun to listen to. \n\nKathy Rain is a really great addition for your point&click library and I was really happy to see that more studios besides fan-favorite Wadjet-Eye can deliver some high quality games that keep the genre alive and move forward.

It plays like a classic point and click adventure but doesn\u2019t have any on the normal downsides. You won\u2019t find any pixel hunting or nonsensical puzzles in this game. The tooltips that appear with items and the game's way of interacting with objects allows you to interact with a lot of things on the screen but helps the most important ones stand out. None of the puzzles that you\u2019ll encounter require any sort of off the wall thinking either. They can all be solved with a little attention and perseverance, and if you seem to be stuck Kathy will help by dropping hint.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nThe game\u2019s graphics are its second strong point. Taking cues from classic 90s point-and-click games like Full Throttle and Gabriel Knight the game boasts an impressive pixel art style. The locations in the game all look excellent and the dreary gloominess of the outdoor areas plays great against the more brightly lit and colorful indoor areas. Even the large character portraits shown during dialogue look great.\n\n[b] Music/Sound [/b]\nMusic is one area that I feel that game falls short. It isn\u2019t bad, just not very memorable or helpful in adding to the atmosphere of the game at all. There is even an achievement you get for letting the travel music loop and I still couldn\u2019t hum that song for you. The voiceovers on the other hand are fantastic! I went into this game as I do with most games from smaller studios expecting the voice acting to not be well done, however, Kathy Rain does an excellent job. Kathy\u2019s interactions with other characters and the dialogue she has with herself while examining and using items sound great and natural.\n\n[b] Story/Writing [/b]\nThe story in Kathy Rain is a great mix of paranormal and mystery and handles them both very well. The way the paranormal aspects intertwines with the \u201creal-life\u201d mystery aspect is handled very well. It falls short in the last chapter however and leans too heavily into the paranormal aspect of the tale. I think it would have benefited from an extra chapter to help tie up both sides a little more smoothly. The writing on the other hand is great and all the interactions with Kathy and the other characters are fun and interesting. Every character has their own unique personality and Kathy herself is very memorable.\n\n\n\n[b] Final Thoughts [/b]\nOverall, I thought Kathy Rain was an excellent game and is exactly what the more current generation of point-and-click games should strive to be. With only a small handful of flaws that are easily ignored this game is a must-play for any point-and-click adventure fan. If this is what Clifftop Games gives us on their first outing, I look forward to seeing what they can do in the future.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2116842064\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7nh1RXKwUX2CA7XWZyxqTg/]The Adventure Game Enthusiast[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1591116459, "timestamp_updated": 1591116459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70171321": {"recommendationid": "70171321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040495503", "num_games_owned": 2176, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 477, "last_played": 1591055399}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall a yes, this was a beautiful 90s-inspired retro P&C detective game with great writing and an interesting (albeit pretty weird) plot. I enjoyed the main character, who is smart and takes no shit from anybody. Sass for miles. Smokes like a chimney and rides a hog. The pixel art itself was fantastic and the voiceovers are quality. I don't feel like the puzzles were too obscure as far as P&Cs go, but there is no hint system in-game if you do get stuck. It's suggested during the game that a sequel may be in the future, which I would be interested in. I understand that there is also a mobile version.\n\nI will put a minor warning label for anyone who is extremely sensitive about family trauma, Christian religion, and [spoiler]abortion[/spoiler] as the plot features all of this prominently.\n\nThe only trouble I had was with the technical aspects of the game.

This isn't a deal breaker because earlier scenes in Day 4 do touch on some of the other uncovered character's mysteries but overall there are noticeable areas of the plot left aside such as [b]Nathan[/b] who [spoiler]disappears after Day 3[/spoiler]. \n\nThe pixel art works brilliantly at reflecting the time period of the 90's with a lot of nostalgic, retro items being used in the detective work such as: a dictaphone, landline phones with no signs of Mobiles, retro computers alongside typewriters, gramophones instead of stereos, Aerial TV boxes and many more including reference to board games like Scrabble. Posters in their dorm room were also a great touch showing classic movies from the mid-late 90's.\nI was surprised no music references were used but I appreciate licencing would've been an issue though the synthetic retro sound was excellent BGM as it wasn't too overpowering and helped prevent from distracting the game-play.\nAdding to the sounds, there were good use of Sound Effects and I loved the VA as I find that always helps massively when it comes to immersion, every Voice Actor was equally superb which truly made the experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe puzzles are all varied and started off being not too challenging for the first 3 days then come the final 2 days they upped the ante and the puzzles got a lot more trickier to solve involving date manipulation & number coding. \nThere were also moments where items would be required to help [i]Kathy Rain[/i] get out of predicaments which, again, started off straight forward for the first 3 days yet come the final two days it became more a case of thinking outside the box or a tedious case of elimination. \n\nThere are a good variety of locations to travel to throughout the 5 days that are all easily accessible through selecting a thumbnail image of the location while [i]Kathy Rain[/i] is hitting the road on her Chopper. When all locations are exhausted they show as greyed out making it a much easier experience if you're caught up in where to go/what to do next. \nDuring the locations there are familiar welcomes from characters alongside changing scripts as the plot progresses while a lot of [i]Kathy Rain's[/i] humour is clear throughout it also wonderfully portrays other characters personalities too making them easy to invest in when seeing their reactions to [i]Kathy Rain's[/i] multi-choice options for character interaction.\n\nThere are achievements throughout though I found, again spot the recurring theme, more was involved within the 3 days compared to the final 2 days; there were a variety of interactions to discover through the 3 days that unlocked Achievements yet the final 2 days had none only the completion of that day. This was a bit surprising as I felt there could've been Achievements used in the last 2 days particularly to unlock when you solve the tougher puzzles so I get the vibe that the final 2 days were centred around rounding up the story when it couldn't hurt to have continued the involvements being seen in the 3 days prior.  It kind of left a bad taste of feeling rushed towards the ending and wanting to get it all over & done with for the Devs as it was unbalanced compared to the other 3/5 of the game. \n\nThe price can seem a bit high for a PnC pixelated mystery so it may be worth looking out for a discount if you can't justify the price tag compared to other games on your wish-list but I think it is fair to say this is done to a high standard and is a very enjoyable game full of nostalgia, mystery and edgy humour.\n\n~~~Liked what you see?

Mechanically, it is typical of its genre -- largely devoid of mechanics that might considered unique. However, I felt that its use of the standard conceits was very respectable, and I think I'd say the same for its bounty of nods to its inspirational source material (Twin Peaks, if it hadn't passed in front of yours yet). Art and voice-acting are better than average across the board, but I feel like the real beauty of both elements is that they match the time period so well -- it really looks and feels like a game I would have played back in '95, in a positive sense. Very good for helping set the tone.\nWhen it comes to point-and-click adventure games, though, the thing that most separates the good from the mediocre for me are the puzzles. It is very tricky to design puzzles in such a way that they are both sufficiently hinted in the context of the game itself and still challenging enough that the hints don't make the solution immediately obvious. I'm happy to say that a handful of puzzles actually took me a few attempts or traveling around to find the solution, and I only needed to check online for spoilers a few times (twice were just because I completely forgot about certain mechanics, which was my bad. Only once was a puzzle obscure enough that I needed the solution reasoning explained, and even then I just felt like an idiot because it was kind of obvious in retrospect).\nPlot-wise, I think the intro was nice and interesting and the middle portion was great while the final portion was actually very impressive right up until it was finished, almost abruptly. The story flows well, I think, and most of the characters were quite likable. There were a few instances of controversial subject matter, but I feel that they were handled quite tastefully.\nI know that it's been a while and the developer has made Whispers of a Machine since then, but I can definitely say that I would love a Kathy Rain sequel if they ever get around to it!

Returning to the town of Conwell Springs where she grew up so many years ago, she attends the funeral, after which she rekindles a relationship with her grandmother. There is much to catch up on after a decade and a half away; with everything she learns her inner detective is enticed by the mystery of what happened to her grandfather. She begins her own investigation.  As she explores the town and meets its residents you will uncover your grandfather's past and the town's hidden secrets. There are ominous forces at play, and piecing the truth will be an adventure you will not soon forget.\n\nReleased on May 5, 2015, by the developer Clifftop Games and Published by Raw Fury, it is tagged as Point & Click, Adventure, Pixel Graphics, Detective; I have added no additional tags. It features an incredible story that is not easy to piece together; you will be challenged to think outside the box. The voice acting is nothing short of exceptional and very enjoyable with over 4000 lines of dialogue. The gorgeous pixel art is top-notch; meticulous work went into its design and this shines through as you play with 40 hand-drawn environments to explore as you piece together the clues. An original soundtrack also accompanies the title.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about the title was the hint system; it really didn't work much as a hint system and was not very useful. I would have liked to have more options to control the graphic and volume settings.\n\nI must say this has been quite an impressive title, and I have had a blast so far in gameplay. As I near the end of the game I kind of hate to see it end, and have been savoring it trying to prolong it as much as I can. The Atmosphere in the game has kept me locked to my screen hours at a time. The dynamics of the title are unique for a point and click, and I have had a riot figuring them out as I play. I think I loved the cut scenes of her riding her motorcycle the most; a very different way to approach moving between levels. I have enjoyed every aspect of the game; the artwork is just OMG, and I often found myself just exploring the scenes. The voice acting - what can I say, I had to yell at the family to hush a couple of times because they were too loud. I would instantly buy a part two, just to be able to spend a little more time with Kathy Rain.

It is also the first video game developed by Clifftop Games, and one that has been on my radar for a long time since it won lots of accolades at The Aggie Awards 2016 and my peers praised it a lot.\n\nThe story is set in the \u201890s and follows, you guessed it, Kathy Rain, a journalism student with a rebellious attitude who travels to her hometown to witness her grandfather put to rest. On this special occasion, Kathy reunites with her widowed grandmother who informs her that her grandfather was in a vegetative state for almost all of her time away after he investigated the suspicious drowning of a teenage girl back in the day. Loaded by guilt and a desire to fix the past, Kathy takes it upon herself to close this unsolved case. \n\nWith this premise, one of the first things that surprised me was how quickly the story picks up and unfolds along the way. Some adventure games tend to be a slow burner with their exposition dump in the beginning, but the same cannot be said about Kathy Rain. This is not a praise nor a criticism, but rather an observation. Kathy jumps on the case straightaway, without hesitations nor any external distractions. Off she goes! Nonetheless, the overall story should keep you invested until the end, with some very good plot twists, but there is a stark change in its tone and atmosphere near the end as events turn supernatural, bleak and a tad metaphorical with its religious undertones. However, the justification of this change is in the eye of the beholder since, without any spoilers, I personally thought it went in the direction foreshadowed early on in the game, for the most part.\n\nWhilst the narrative holds up strongly throughout the game, I do have some criticisms directed at it, though. Firstly, it is very predictable who one of the main culprits is in the story, almost right from the first encounter. Additionally, to my disappointment, some explanations in the final two acts remain vague at best and some mysteries are still left unsolved, especially since the story features an enigmatic boogieman character who is clearly pulling the strings. Lastly, there is a hot topic which the game touches upon very briefly regarding Kathy\u2019s past which I feel it does not add much to the story and probably should have been left out as it might rub some people the wrong way. Ultimately, Kathy does close the case regarding her grandfather successfully (and thus a detective is born!), but the game concludes with an open-ending for that sequel bait. Gratefully, I am actually in favour for more Kathy Rain adventures. When will we see them, no one knows at this point.\n\nThe general gameplay in Kathy Rain uses traditional point-and-click mechanics where you talk to characters to unlock new topics of discussion, obtain and use items found in environments, and solve brain teasing puzzles, to advance the plot. In all fairness, Gabriel Knight and Cognition were a lot on my mind whilst playing Kathy Rain, since both gave similar detective vibes and most likely were inspirations to this game. Heck, even the Blackwell series. Depending how fast you solve the puzzles, Kathy Rain is more or less a short game, clocking somewhere between four to seven hours. Since the story did keep me hooked, this might have the side effect of making you want more, thus making its short length a letdown in someone\u2019s books; which, sadly, it did for me. Thankfully, the puzzles, which are not abundant, are fairly straightforward and logical in most instances, give or take one or two. Some are fairly clever I must add, whilst others are a bit of a trial-and-error.\n\nVisually, Kathy Rain\u2019s stylised retro look, akin to point-and-click adventure games built on the AGS engine, is solid and consistent, to a point where you might even mistaken it for a recent WadjetEye game. The environments are vivid and aesthetically pleasing, even if they become quite sombre near the end. Whilst there is not a huge lot of interactivity with said environments, they pack a good amount detail without leading to the dreadful pixel-hunting. Personally, I felt there is a fair bit of backtracking between its nine available locations in the story for my tastes, which is why to some it might feel like the world is very confined, which it is to some degree.\n\nAnother thing that feels somewhat confined is the cast of characters, which frankly is not immense, but they sure are fun and have distinctive personalities. I will not be dissecting each one of them for this review, but I can say that Kathy, as the main protagonist, is undoubtedly memorable. To me, her dialogues feel natural, as I recall, and I am full of joy to see she did not fall in the trap of feeling forced just because she is a female protagonist. In spite of her tough attitude, mixed with some rudeness for good measure, and a somewhat edgy, trademark-ish, appearance for her time period, she does show her human side enough to sympathise with her. There is also clear character development when she starts questioning her past and life choices in the second half of the game. Given more time to grow, Kathy has the potential to rank up to the greats such as April Ryan (The Longest Journey), Kate Walker (Syberia), Rosa Blackwell (Blackwell) and Erica Reed (Cognition), to name a few.\n\nSometimes the voice acting can be shoddy in certain adventure games due to their budget, but rest assure that Kathy Rain\u2019s is definitely in the good tier. My experience and immersion were not ruined by anyone as far as I remember, but, of course, your mileage may vary. Initially, I thought the soundtrack is decent at best, but after a second thought, the soundtrack is unfortunately forgettable. It hardly grabbed my attention, but I will say that it fit certain scenes fine when setting up the atmosphere at least.\n\nIn conclusion, I admit that I went in with very high expectations due to the hype surrounding it, and I am thankful to report that Kathy Rain is a very good and enjoyable game for its genre, so fans of this genre should definitely pick it up at some point. I would not go as far as calling it one of the greatest point-and-click adventure games ever made as some may suggest, but I definitely look forward to seeing more adventures with Kathy in the near future. For their first game, Clifftop Games did a fantastic job in building a solid foundation for a potentially new amazing franchise in the point-and-click adventure genre, which is why I may let some of its flaws that I mentioned slide this time around.", "timestamp_created": 1588731013, "timestamp_updated": 1588732760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796567201614379883", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68626459": {"recommendationid": "68626459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377186652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1168, "last_played": 1588698286}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una aventura gr\u00e1fica de las de siempre.

The story is separated into 5 in-game days.\n\nPros:\n- Voice dubbing in all dialogues\n- Some dialogue choices give a different response to the conversations\n\nCons:\n- No hints in case you're stuck\n- Some mysteries aren't fully explained\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]It's a decent point-and-click game that can last for ~5 hours. If you like point-and-click games, you can buy this at a discount.[/i]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game uses a mix of 2D sprite graphics with an over zoomed background and portrait images that make them look pixelated. It might be annoying at first because the background might look better in full resolution, but you'll get used to it.\n\nLeaving the backgrounds aside, the sprites look fine. I like how the sprite animations aren't just limited to walking; they also cover some parts when the character is expressing her emotions such as crying and smoking.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nJust like other point-and-click games, this game focuses on its story. You'll mostly ask people around to gather clues and unlock more conversations. There are even times when you'll have to choose between several options. I'm not sure if there is an option that will change the storyline that much, but all of the options that I chose only change the responses a bit and add a bit of information about the characters.\n\nHowever, despite all that, most of the mystery remains unsolved. I'm not sure if the game is doing it on purpose for a sequel material, but it bugs me because I still have a lot of questions unanswered after I finished the game, especially in the last 2 days where more questions are popping out.\n\nThere are also times when most of the things are unexplained and people are talking as if I'm supposed to know it beforehand. I even thought that this game is a sequel to another game because of this.\n\n[h1]The game[/h1]\n[b]Exploration[/b]\nThe game has several areas to explore that can be done by clicking through the images in the \"overworld\" screen. You can hover your cursor around to see any interactable objects and there will be an option to look, think, and take action with the item if it's possible to do so. Actually, looking and thinking isn't that different; they just give a different text for you to read.\n\nSometimes, there is an important dialogue that I accidentally skipped because I clicked somewhere in the map to inspect an item when the dialogue suddenly popped out. There is also no hint button or whatsoever that can help you with this. The game also never tells you what to do next so it can be troublesome if you don't play the game in one sitting since you'll have no idea what to do.\n\n[b]Items[/b]\nThere are a lot of items that you can pick up. It's obvious as to what items to use in the first few days although I can't say the same for the last few days. Luckily, the game helps a bit by discarding unused items from your inventory as the story progresses.\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nThis game doesn't have a lot of puzzles. However, I could never solve it whenever one showed up. I ended up reading a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=670789337]guide[/url] a lot just to solve this.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's an okay point-and-click game with no hints and difficult puzzles. It's mostly focused on its story even though some parts are a bit vague. If you're into making theories, you'll have a blast with it.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through Curator Connect[/quote]\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/23741321]Follow our curator page[b] Alexander's Club Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1588482646, "timestamp_updated": 1589089293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673211991786956787", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68459235": {"recommendationid": "68459235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198959829370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1587263699}, "language": "english", "review": "I think the game was good I just don't like the religious undertones and the fact that it was semi anti-abortion?

Getting it at an at least 50% sale price would seem fair since the creators only seem to have put half effort in it. \n\nThe first half of the game is AMAZING. I love the 90's feel of it. The computer in the dorm, the landline phones, the tape player. The voice-acting is mostly pretty good (not you, grandma) and I love the way it sets up the mystery and how you investigate. Good old point-and-click humour too.  But halfway through the story the writers just... Seemed to have given up.\n\nThe ending feels incredibly rushed. It completely changes the whole feeling of the game DRASTICALLY with the supernatural touch. [spoiler] I was half hoping we would end up debunking it. The whole game sets up Kathy to be very atheistic so it would fit with her character. [/spoiler]\n\nNot gonna lie, I don't find Kathy a likable protagonist even. She's rude and a clich\u00e9 hard-ass. The times where they would make her emotional felt forced. [spoiler] The abandoning dad thing is alright, but the fact that she seems to be a clone of him with the whole tough bikerthing also seems clich\u00e9. The abortion business was absolutely unnecessary. And for a subject that loaded it was as quickly brushed aside as the whole pregnancy itself. [/spoiler] I also find it hard to put an age on her. She is in college, but rides a motorbike and behaves like an adult?\n\nI also played the other game from this creator and story-wise it ended the same. Amazing introduction, made me excited to explore the world, only for it to be finished as if they ran out of time or inspiration. It's a shame, because there is immense potential.\n\nStill I wouldn't recommend skipping this game as it definitely gave me a good 3,5 hours of fun and hopefully if we buy more of this creator they get the chance to make more like this (but with improved storywriting).\n", "timestamp_created": 1588417068, "timestamp_updated": 1588417068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519566595554351807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68412029": {"recommendationid": "68412029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208227643", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 713, "last_played": 1588401250}, "language": "english", "review": "The plot was weird, but good weird.

It doesn't embrace the many sins of the genre: the game is not hardcore pixel-hunting, and all the puzzles are logical (with only one exception - the mausoleum puzzle was a bit too vague).\nThe graphics are amazing and I loved how smooth the 3D parts (the backgrounds' base) were, and how well they blended with 2D ones (character sprites, some elements of the backround). Better than in the actual 90s! It helped to create that special 90s feel, though. The atmosphere here is thick as well as the mysteries we have to encounter.\nThe voice acting was on point, it depicted the characters very well, so did their amazing detailed portraits. The music was eerie when needed to be and relaxing when needed to be. It matched the graphics perfectly. The embodiment of said perfection is the riding scene. I do want to watch it for 10 hours straight, it's SO good.\nSassy Kathy is a likable protagonist and snark isn't all the character she has. She is imperfect, like any person, and she is very humane and human in her behavior. I liked the fact that we could choose some of her reacions and replies and thus tweak her a little.\nThe plot was well-structured and spiraled into climax towards the end like every good drama should. The ending hasn't answered all the questions but it didn't feel frustrating. It left the player wanting for more.

The story plods along and is occasionally broken up by simple puzzles which usually means do the thing you were told to do or do the thing you said you would do.\n\nSomething that seriously irritates me is that every time someone talks there is a close up of their face but it has obviously been made by a different artist as it looks like a completely different person just with the same hair colour. As an example look at the pictures above and tell me if Kathy is a tiny anorexic emo white girl with small dark eyes and a piercing or is full figured, strong with big pouty lips and has bright blue eye makeup? I cannot believe two artists working on the same game were not allowed to look at each others work in order to give characters consistency, for me it just shows a lack of love or care.\n\nMetaphobia is a free game and easily as good as Kathy Rain as it is incredibly similar in terms of game play, metaphobia is less cheesy 90's but Kathy Rain is longer and has a better ending.

Indeed it has a very nice and comfy VGA look to it and it's very pleasant.\nIt's the only pleasant thing because the game itself isn't very good.\n\nMost of the time the game plays itself. It asks you to perform a couple very basic actions then bombards you with a ton of non-interactive cutscenes, it feels like watching a movie most of the time. It would be ok if the story was nice but it's not.\nIt's like somebody was   big fan of twin peaks and tried to do something similar in the most boring and uninspired way possible.\nIf that was not enough the story is peppered with SJW politics. Listen, I know the game is aimed at females primarily, but do we really have to make every male character either dumb, inefficient or just evil?\n\nThere are a rather limited number of  locations in the game and the back and forth between them (on the bike) becomes very tedious after a while.\n\nLike I said most of the time, the gameplay just consists in going through all the topics in your notebook with every character youcan speak to. Except toward the end of the game where you're faced with puzzles that you can absolutely not solve without the help of a walkthrough.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1583548966, "timestamp_updated": 1583549028, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46863865852355957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64566506": {"recommendationid": "64566506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089970165", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 625, "last_played": 1578070874}, "language": "english", "review": "Good and funny mystery game.", "timestamp_created": 1583441924, "timestamp_updated": 1583441924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64527767": {"recommendationid": "64527767", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976237743", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 1260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1260, "last_played": 1583266893}, "language": "english", "review": "The puzzles were always logical and I didn't need to look up a walkthrough at any point, which is always a pleasant surprise for an adventure game.", "timestamp_created": 1583372697, "timestamp_updated": 1583372697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64520390": {"recommendationid": "64520390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000671579", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1583356266}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1583356482, "timestamp_updated": 1583356482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64520331": {"recommendationid": "64520331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053761524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1583355688}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting but a tad short story which leaves some questions unanswered.

KR gets a bit hefty on the moon logic toward the second half of the game, but this is standard fare for the titles of the time that this is referencing.

The theme and ending are just a mess, everything happens too quickly and things aren't even explained well. Art is nice, but often inconsistent, there are so few locations, and almost all the puzzle-solve payoff animations/action are skipped. Gameplay is decent, but it has some of that clunky early p&c feel. The religious themes also put me off a lot, even if there wasn't much of them. There was a lot of cool stuff, but that's mostly what it is -- a string of cool stuff. Grab it on a sale if you are a die-hard p&c fan and have to play all the decent ones. But this just didn't quite strike it with me. It didn't go all the way on many concepts, even if it boldly stepped in the right directions. I feel sad giving this a negative review, but it just barely misses the recommendation mark. There are a lot of superior pixely p&c games out there, so this one's really there if you have run out of games to play.\n\nAlso, it's not 2000 and the game should really have proper resolution support and stretching instead of messing with full screen.

This game tries very hard to be story and character driven, and it really doesn't work. \n\nLet's start with Kathy. She is your typical \"I'm the bad girl/Not like other girls\" trope, with an extra side of mean. Which made her super uninteresting. I was more interested in Eileen(Kathy's roommate)  who had way more of a real personality than Kathy did. I also felt awful for Goober, who seemed to constantly be getting the short end of the stick, even getting stun-gunned by Kathy herself at one point in the game. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point, the story. Good god...Um. In a story driven game, you think the main focus would have been story? You get to the final day, you play through it and the game just kind of ends? This whole thing with her mom and dad was set up, briefly touched upon and then never talked about again. She was literally in the same mental institution as her mom, and didn't even bother to say hi..Also, we never learned about what happened to her father? He's in Mexico! Probably! Maybe? I dunno. If it wasn't so important to Kathy's character I wouldn't bring it up. \n\nNow, finally..the puzzles. They're way too easy? I really only got stuck on the one in the cemetery towards the end. I was expecting zany puzzles with zany solutions? And the puzzles were pretty tame and the solutions (Besides literally tazing someone) were even tamer. \n\nI recommend Kathy Rain if you're looking for easy achievements and a game that you only really play once and  then uninstall, forever doomed to your steam library.", "timestamp_created": 1579237527, "timestamp_updated": 1579237527, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49403873085975647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61765977": {"recommendationid": "61765977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115996598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1578861993}, "language": "english", "review": "A well-executed, engaging point-and-click adventure with kind of a Twin Peaks / X-Files mood going on.

I personally like the main character a lot, Kathy Rain is an example of a well-written female protagonist. And also she's cool, you know, the thing an edgy goof like me appreciate on a deeply spiritual level. \nSo at first, I thought the only thing I would nag about would be not so great voice acting. Like it's not a Phantasmagoria level of bad acting, but it's still pretty far from ideal. There is only one character whos voice acting I think is pretty good and it's the Crimson Ones. Others are not so great, and Kathy's grandma sounds like she doesn't give a single f. about her deceased husband. \nBut unfortunately, the game has one more flaw, and this one is pretty big. The ending is kinda... meh, whatever.  And it's not about the mystical part of the game, I personally loved the atmosphere of David Lynch's films surrounding it, it's just the ending feels bland. Another thing is there are so many subplots and plot-twists that appeared alongside the main story, that in the end, they all feel rushed and underdeveloped.

Playing it as someone who loves adventure games, I'd give it a 3/5. The game started great, and I found Kathy just the right mixture of badass, Daria and mystery to get me invested. The puzzles I found uneven. I would say that most were fairly easy, and the story went along at a brisk pace. However the hardest puzzle in the game, was frankly ridiculously difficult, and not in keeping with the straightforward and more simplistic nature of the rest of the game. I admit I had to use a walkthrough for each 3 parts of that puzzle. I had no clue at all what I was supposed to do, and I have played many adventure games over the years and would consider myself very familiar with the genre and game puzzles in general. Story-wise I found it was far too supernatural for me. Personally as a Christian, I am not keen on that sort of thing, and this game really went in for it, and church and Christianity in general seemed to be snubbed and poked fun at. I understand that it became something else, and wasn't actually Christianity but some sort of weird cult-esque thing, but I still found it not only unsettling, but bordering on disrespectful, which I didn't appreciate. Lastly, SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS I was disappointed that you never actually really found out any answers, and the key questions that we spent the entire game searching for, remain questions. We are simply told, 'that's not important now'. In summary, too dark and supernatural for me with the demonic allegory and influences, and with the story itself unsatisfying, I personally don't think I would recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1577995365, "timestamp_updated": 1577995365, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427624046802520752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61158017": {"recommendationid": "61158017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032984372", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1577886515}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041d\u0435 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u043b\u043e. \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0442, \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1577990124, "timestamp_updated": 1577990124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61091396": {"recommendationid": "61091396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354208059", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 565, "last_played": 1577826359}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome story, great and lovable characters, beautiful art-style.

It took me 7 hours to complete the story without any guidance. Once you start the story, you won't be able to put this game down for sure. Music in this game is one of the two negative things about it. However, the game does have some interesting sound effects to build the suspense. Also, the fact that every character in this game is voiced and well acted is a big plus in my books, especially because of it being a point-click game.\nNow, about that 2nd negative thing about it. This game builds up towards a big reveal at the end. However, you will be disappointed that the game does not pay off some of the main driving force of the plot at the end.

Our goal is to solve the mystery of the death of the main character's grandfather. To do that, we will have to conduct an investigation... \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nKathy Rain is a classic point&click adventure game played in the 90s.. All we need in the game is a mouse. At our disposal is a bag of equipment, which is a bag with various things. At the beginning we only get a notebook, lighter and cigarettes. In addition, during the game, along with the progress we unlock new locations. There is no level or skill system in the game.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are pixel-shaped. It is not a disadvantage of the game, of course, but on the contrary, it is an advantage. The graphics introduce an interesting atmosphere and remind the times of the first games, which looked similar. The locations are neatly made, although they are too small for me.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nThe music in the game is calm, but in some situations it changes dramatically depending on the situation our character is in. The vocal actors are also worth praising, as they have done a good job and all the dialogues are nice to listen to.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nIn general, Kathy Rain is a good game, pleasant, but I think it's too short. The disadvantages of the game are also small locations and puzzles, which are logical but extremely simple. Of course there are more difficult puzzles that require a moment's thinking, but there are few of them. Moreover, the storyline is really good until the end, which is a bit weak. Nevertheless, I recommend buying this game to anyone who likes adventure games and has little time to play.

One big caveat: things get pretty dark and traumatic towards the end the game, so it may not be for everyone, and it's [b]definitely not for kids[/b]. This isn't a slightly edgy ghost story, it's messed up.\n\nAbout ~5h of gameplay if you know your way around the P&C genre. The game is split into 5 \"days,\" and some are more complicated than others. Basic gameplay focuses not so much on combining items to solve puzzles (though there is that) but more on detective work in the style of the [i]Blackwell[/i] series: collect topics in your notebook, talk to folks, work out stuff, go back to talk to folks again, etc. The game makes good use of travel, phone calls, and some 90s-era \"high-tech\" stuff to add some variety, and it all adds up to a well-built and unique title, with good logic behind all the puzzles.\n\nThe overall story got  pretty weird and convoluted, but (a) as a whole it sets up an interesting world that I wouldn't mind revisiting if a sequel came around, and (b) once you get through Day 1 the story is relatively fast-paced. It ain't entirely family friendly, with some morbid themes that approach \"psychological horror\" vibes, some cusses, etc. Some characters are a bit one-dimensional, and some figure in plot-points in ways that probably aren't entirely PC by today's standards. \n\nVoicework, pixel art, soundtrack are all swell. Everything ran smoothly on Windows 10.\n\n[quote]For more puzzle game reviews, news & everything puzzle-related, follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25928931-Puzzle-Lovers/]Puzzle Lovers[/url] & check out our [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/puzzlelovers]Steam group[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1576441688, "timestamp_updated": 1641049623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59701428": {"recommendationid": "59701428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141169096", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 540, "last_played": 1576075283}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice little game.

The pixel graphics look nice enough, especially the character portraits and the different locations look nice.\n\nThe sounds of the game are fairly limited, but you don't really need many sound effects in a game like this. They do their job just fine - nothing to complain here.\n\nAll conversations are voice acted, but the voice acting quality isn't consistent. \n\nSome voice actors are great, some not so great - the quality can even differ between lines, the same characters voice can be good at times and bad at other times.\n\nThe music of the game is good. It fits the detective theme well and creates a nice atmosphere - nothing exceptional, but it works well.\n\n============\n\nI found the story of the game very interesting. Basically Kathy returns to her home town after her grandfather passes away.\n\nShe learns things about the past and begins to investigate what led to her grandfathers death. At first it feels relatively realistic, but later on some fantasy elements will appear. Overall, it's a very interesting detective story.\n\nThe characters of the game are well designed - there aren't too many of them, but those few that are in the game are quite memorable. I especially liked Kathy's character design - she's a bit of a bad girl but still sensible.\n\nThe puzzles of the game are challenging - as they should be. The whole point of games of this genre are the puzzles and the story. Honestly I had to spoil one puzzle because I got stuck for much longer than I expected. =D\n\n============\n\nThe game length is about what you expect from a point and click game. I suppose it could be doable in maybe 6 hours if you skip some conversations and don't get stuck and all. But I listened to every conversation and got stuck pretty bad a few times so it took me around 9 hours to finish the game.\n\nI think the length is great - honestly I wouldn't want to spend 20+ hours in a point and click game anyway - so it's pretty close to optimal in my opinion.\n\nBut the price does not match the length. It's probably not worth the full price, which is 15\u20ac while I'm writing this review. It's a bit too steep price for such a short game in my opinion.\n\nBut I bought it for a few euros during a sale - and it's definitely worth that.\n\nIt's a good game - so if you like point and click games, grab it from a sale. \n\n============\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Good \ud83d\udc4d\n+ Nice pixel graphics\n+ Very interesting story\n+ Memorable characters\n+ Challenging puzzles\n\nThe Bad \ud83d\udc4e\n- Inconsistent voice acting quality\n- Price/Length (when not on sale)", "timestamp_created": 1574892296, "timestamp_updated": 1574892296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58283710": {"recommendationid": "58283710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094170126", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1398, "last_played": 1571006791}, "language": "english", "review": "A compelling story with added surrealism and mystery.\nIf you plan on playing the entire game make sure you have a walkthrough on hand.", "timestamp_created": 1574885318, "timestamp_updated": 1574885318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58253385": {"recommendationid": "58253385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397732447", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1574877643}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_created": 1574877625, "timestamp_updated": 1574877625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58251269": {"recommendationid": "58251269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427312325", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1574876186}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game but its story is all over the place.

Something happened to him before he died that placed him in a catatonic state and you need to figure out what.\n\nThe thing that stood out to me is that the game is fully voice acted which is something we don\u2019t see all too often in point and click games. The voice actors for the most part do a really good job. The main character Kathy Rain is actually pretty likable. She\u2019s playfully sarcastic but never so much that she seems like a passive aggressive bitch.\n\nThe puzzles are also fun and never feel too hard. I would put Kathy Rain\u2019s puzzles on the easy side but none of the answers ever felt absurd when I figured them out. Something the point and click genre is known for. I did need to look at a guide to find the solution to one puzzle but I say that was more on me then the game. As soon as I understood what the answer was I thought \u201cOh yea! That makes sense!\u201d\n\nI do have a few negatives.\n\nThe default audio balancing is bad. The games music (while fine) is louder than the voice acting which sometimes causes certain scenes to be a mish mash of noise. You can change the voice and music volume in the options menu. Some games have more dynamic audio options with a master volume slider. So that way the music can sit comfortably in the background in certain quieter moments to help set a tone and swell during others to underscore the moment. Kathy Rain could benefit from this.\n\nI do have some problems with the story as well. The game has a pretty interesting 90s detective story with a kind of disjointed feeling ending. The description of the game says that the main character Kathy is quote \u201ca strong-willed journalism major who has to come to terms with her own troubled past\u201d She has not \u201ccome to terms with her troubled past\u201d because she spends the ending of the game doing exactly that. The ending of the game felt way to supernatural for the mostly down to earth tone of the game, making it feel disjointed from the rest of the experience. It feels as though the ending was only there as a way to give players more last minute character development from Kathy and to quickly resolve the games plot because of how disjointed it feels. The supernatural elements are also never properly explained. So it almost feels like the game ended on a cliffhanger to hopefully continue the story in a sequel of some kind.\n\nThe game was ultimately fun despite its poorly set up ending. It took me about 7hrs to beat and I recommend it. If your not a big fan of point and click games I recommend getting it on a sale.

For example, the inventory puzzles are logical and easy to comprehend. For the vast majority of the game, it's very easy to figure out how to progress. I never felt like the game tried to artificially prolong its length. You keep finding new content, new characters, new areas, new parts of the grander story. It stays fresh, maybe a bit short, but sweet. \n\nAnother, a bit more subjective improvement, is the dialogue system. From time to time, you have a traditional dialogue tree, enriched by occasional opportunities to express your character's feeling in a way that you find most suitable, but there's also a new system, which works great - it involves a notepad with a list of important \"topics\", and having an option to present many items from your inventory to the NPCs. Thanks to these mechanisms, the less important dialogues or dialogue branches are played through very fast. And if you feel stuck, you can click through everything, just in case.\n\nThere are many objects that you can interact with just for the sake of it. In some adventure games it can get annoying, since a character tends to just name an object which you've clicked, without expanding your knowledge. But again, not in Kathy Rain! The \"unimportant\" items add to worldbuilding, or allow you to better understand how your character perceives her surroundings.\n\nThe visuals are imitating pixel art, but as far as I can tell, it's only a costume. Character portraits and backgrounds often use thousands of colors at once, a chaotic soup of pixels, which blend with each other in a sometimes jarring way. I'm not sure if that was the best combination of choices, but if the screenshots look fine to you, you won't be bothered. The music can get a bit dark, but usually stays in the background, and while fine, it isn't that memorable. Even if a couple of areas use the same theme, it's not distracting.\n\nI'm not a great voice acting judge, but as far as I can tell, it was fantastic. Arielle Siegel is a great lead, and can definitely sell an edgy teen from the 90s. I'm surprised that pretty much the entire cast of characters was white, and I must admit that their portraits, while great, blend together in my memory. \n\nI have only two issues with the game. The first one, I believe, is a significant problem - there's no button that would allow you to skip through animations. CTRL, space, escape, mouse buttons... Nothing does anything. Sometimes, your character walks like a turtle, and if you don't know where to look for another clue, you'll have to see how Kathy walks around, closes doors, knocks, leaves or enters a scene, sits down... I've played adventure games that allow you to skip such annoyances, and I'd love to have at least an option to do it here. Especially since there are cutscenes which you can't pause, and you know, sometimes you have to open the door to the mailman.\n\nThe second one is very subjective - I'm not a great fan of the story structure, the (IMO) very tired \"we start in our world, but slowly spin into the land of symbols, and let the protagonist face their traumas through metaphorical events.\" While the Kathy's personality and personal background are very well-developed and theme-heavy, it's very difficult for me to care about the plot when the game starts introducing dream sequences, visions, \"yes, it doesn't make logical sense, but it's a dream!\" encounters, spiritual themes without fair exploration, magical plants and illnesses. I much prefer the opening chapters of the story, which are mostly based in reality and even involve using retro-technology, like phones and an anachronistically powerful computer, with silly hacking software.\n\nWhen the game stops making use of research, detective work and reasoning, and instead offers you a realm of wonder and supernatural threats (and Kathy just goes with it, I mean, who cares that gods and magic exists!), I just can't help but think... I've been here, done that. So many, many times. \n\nPlaying this game as a teen must be absolutely awesome, though. And the dialogues often feel natural, giving you exposition in a very respectable manner, allowing you to process information through visuals and hints, rather than making avalanches of \"let me tell you all the entire story of my life.\" Also, I'm not a big fan of full-comedy games, and unlike many adventure tittles, this one keeps the puns rather short. The humor adds to the characters and supports pacing, but doesn't try to overtake the spotlight.\n\nVery strong 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1572540832, "timestamp_updated": 1572540832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56028470": {"recommendationid": "56028470", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995142343", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1572536703}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyed the story and characters.\nPuzzles are not too hard but have a nice flow.\n\n(the subtitle may be a bit misleading, but if you liked Gabriel Knight etc. this should be great!)", "timestamp_created": 1572538765, "timestamp_updated": 1572538765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55991012": {"recommendationid": "55991012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411500860", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1572555689}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting game with brilliant main character and tragic story behind.

The puzzles are quite easy on most occasions, and they almost always make logical sense, meaning that my trips to a walkthrough were extremely infrequent. Granted, they can occasionally dip into being too easy, with too many hints as to what you're supposed to do, but that's a nitpick. The visuals are an excellent upgrade from the look of many Sierra games of the mid to late 90's, and the game looks gorgeous. Using the UI is smooth as butter, with clear commands and very easy access to your inventory. The music is also fantastic, each track having its own identity, ranging from creepy, to comforting, to calming, to beautifully sad. The voice acting is all and all solid, as well, if a bit cheesy at times.\n\nThe story, probably the game's main draw outside of its throwback point and click stylings, is all and all also pretty good, with some exceptions. It's an intriguing mystery, however, some of the details are a bit hard to follow, and the resolution feels sudden, as if the game's buildup up to that point was abruptly cut off. However, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Kathy Rain, and for anyone who wants to get into point and click games without having to keep a walkthrough grafted to their eyes, this is a great choice.

She\u2019s in university, acting out as a goth chain smoker, in a dorm with a more conservative religious type. Anyway, Miss Religious is apparently Miss socialite, and comes across a news articles about a dead person, Joseph Rain. Turns out, it\u2019s Kathy\u2019s grandad, so off she goes on her motorbike back to her hometown to attend the funeral and re-connect with her estranged family. (I wouldn't mind being able to afford a motorbike, chain smoking and University fees in this day and age... >_>)\n\nFrom there, she dives down the rabbit hole investigating events from many years back surrounding her father, the local community and the war.\n\nI have to say, initially I was rather weary of the game, the initial dialogue was a bit cringy and the art style has Kathy, our resident goth as a bit 1980\u2019s with the hair to match despite being in 1995. Still, once the investigation got under way I actually got into the game and started enjoying some of the conversations going on.\n\nThe game is short and very snappy for a point and click adventure and the base mystery is interesting enough that I wanted to know what happened and how it happened.

The music is very nice, and the voices are very well done. The puzzles are also well designed, not being too difficult but you'll feel pleasure when you can solve most of them. The story is ok and the characters enhance it a long away. It's a bit dark, and involve things like murder, suicide, and facing your inner demons. Basically, a game for an older audience. The game is not too short, but you can easily finish it in a week and it's easy to unlock every achievement (just save at the beginning of each game day: in case you miss one you won't need to start all over again).\n\nSo, I strongly recommend this to any fan of the old point and click games (from Sierra or Lucas Arts, this actually reminds me a lot of Full Throttle).

The artstyle is very nice, the music is great, gameplay-wise it's a very typical point'n'click story-based puzzle game the likes of Broken Sword and others. And I'm really glad the game has a bunch of decently cast voice actors for once, I've stumbled on too many indie titles where the recording's been done with a low quality mic by three dudes trying to imitate three voices each, none of which having any voice acting experience whatsoever.\n\nThe setting has initially been a little bit on the unwanted side if I'm completely honest. The main character feels incredibly angsty, self-oriented and hypocritical. Over time the focus drops from Kathy being fed up with everyone around her having a different lifestyle than her and whatever else she could be fed up with and you get to the good part of the game where mysteries keep unfolding and questions arise. The edge of Kathy's character eventually dulls and she becomes a bit more of a real and interesting person as the investigation progresses. The game itself is not scary, but there has been an eerie feeling hovering over my head all the time throughout the experience, as if something were to completely turn things around at any moment. The few moments it did, however, were not very impactful, at least in the horror sense, but for better or worse it's not the focus of the game and it doesn't happen often, so you're mostly left with the feeling of tension and anticipation, which is good.\n\nThe story goes places I surely did not expect at first, and having finished the game I want to say I'm unsatisfied how little was actually explained at the end of the day with the ever complex plot lines intertwining in this more and more surreal experience.  You could argue that the unpredictable elements might actually hamper the experience of the investigation based game where you can't get rewarded for paying attention because everything you learn goes out the window at some point. Nothing is set in stone, most of the game's ending is left in the air for the player to interpret, and I've seen some pretty crazy and, as per usual in those circumstances, unfortunately inacurrate and, sadly, easily debunkable theories as to whether or not the whole story was a metaphor of Kathy's mental health problems and not the actual set of events, blah, blah, blah, but it's very contradicting to what we see in the game. I just wish the game left the playerbase a bit less directionless.\n\nThat being said, the game is still intruiging through and through, and uncovering the secrets and answering the questions, even if they lead to more questions at the end of the day, is still very enjoyable. As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure the actual events of the game are well set in place, it's just the game ends before you get to truly understand what happens, as we're restricted in our perspective to Kathy's character. The plot makes sense for sure, it's just the sense is hidden by characters we know little about.\n\nDespite a very surreal ending, the story begins as a very predictable chain of tropes. While some characters are believable, many of them fit into a very predictable archetype, all the way down to their speech patterns. And let me just say I was not at all surprised with the revelation of certain character's dark secrets, even from practically the very start of the game already feeling like the game is trying way too much to hint at something being wrong with certain people.\n\nThe good and the bad of the \"gameplay\" part of the experience all comes down to the multiinteractivity with the clues and objects, and the need to backtrack constantly between locations because of it. Every time something gets uncovered as a clue to the next step, you can, and often you should, go back to every place of interest and discuss the new item/clue with all the NPCs in the game. On one hand it's awesome, because it shows how nicely everything intertwines in the story and how many things can be uncovered not by one NPC having the answer, but about 3 other people hinting at something with different pieces of information they have depending on their perspective. On the other, the game requires a significant amount of time in-between the NPCs to be spent looking for this information among them, leading you to visit every location MORE than 5 times a day, and almost always just to gather scraps and backtrack again in a minute once you uncover a newly found object of interest. Technically it's not super awful, especially with as few locations as you have in the game, but a thought did cross my mind that I'm spending most of the day  on my harley passing by the grandma's house to say hi to her and ask about one person or the other that she might recall a little and so on and so forth. It also doesn't help that sometimes a couple of the interactible elements are barely discernible or very easy to ignore on the map, so you might skip them the first way around.\n\nAs far as the puzzle elements go, most of them were fine, some of them were interesting or clever, but I did stumble upon a few puzzles that were a bit of a stretch in logic, or were pretty unintuitive. That especially applies to the surreal ending. And yeah, it was to be expected - it's surreal after all, but I think it's a pretty bad idea to put surreal/supernatural elements in puzzle games that are to be based on the foundations of logic and expected consequences, because most of the time the problem-solving puzzle becomes more of a gameplay-extending trial and error, where you have nothing to base the results on so you just have to try everything available.\n\nIn the end, I'll give this a 7/10. The game plays nicely, has a cool vibe, the audio and visual elements are fine, the characters are neatly developed and the story is really intruiging all the way through. Although I'd say the game loses itself a bit in its overtly convoluted mystery and there are definitely things to get frustrated with here and there, at the end of the day it wasn't a bad experience, and it was, in fact, a game worth playing. I only wish that there was a better explanation of the story, as it deserves more than to be left as an open-ended \"make up your own answer\" kind of mystery.", "timestamp_created": 1567357263, "timestamp_updated": 1567357263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54918771": {"recommendationid": "54918771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118131858", "num_games_owned": 860, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1565267785}, "language": "english", "review": "Adventure point&click with an interesting detective story, great pixel graphics and very nice voice acting.

I liked a lot about it. Kathy herself is fun to play up to a point. Her roommate is also a solid character, and the interplay between the two of them could have been a lot better than it was. There are strong hints that this is the first game in a series, and that Kathy and Eileen will be a team. I think that could be really cool.\n\nUltimately, though, there just wasn't all that much to recommend the game. The puzzle design isn't stellar, at all, and there are a lot of places where you can easily get stuck while the game waits for you to do some specific thing to trigger the end of the day or some other event that doesn't seem directly related. There's a lot of gating to the puzzles that feels arbitrary and which you can easily get hung up on. There are a lot of times when, as a player, I wanted to pursue lead X, but the game doesn't want you to look at that until tomorrow, so you have to do unrelated tasks Y, Z, A, and B in order to get access to that. \n\nPerhaps most disappointing for the experience, though, is that there's very little latitude to role-play Kathy. On several occasions you have to do things that I just plain didn't want to do, and which felt optional -- a different approach to a puzzle, say. Upon looking up a walkthrough it always turned out that, no, you have to do that or the game won't move forward.\n\nThe final sequence has a satisfying set of not-too-hard but reasonable and logical puzzles that wind it up on a positive note, gameplay wise, but it's all marred by some weird moral messages right at the end. Also, there are elements to the story that really don't seem to hang together well, or which seemed tacked on at the last moment.\n\nI love point-and-click adventure games, and point-and-click detective/mystery games with a snarky woman lead are pretty much the best. But this fell short. (Not to mention that it really did 'fall short' time-wise as well.) I can't really say I'm left feeling like I need to recommend this to my friends.

A point-and-click adventure game that looks and sounds like those of the late 90s, and that sometimes feels like a middle ground between David Lynch's works and Silent Hill, even with the soundtrack sometimes reminding me of the works of Akira Yamaoka and Angelo Badalamenti.

At 5 hours play time for me, it's quite short though.\n\nThe characters are interesting and relateable. The story is ok for the length, but the motivations and nature of the antagonists remains somewhat unclear. I wasn't a big fan of the art (it's fine as pixel art goes), but the voice acting is outstanding for a work of this type. The puzzles are mostly simple enough to figure out, but if you do get stumped, there's no in-game way to recover and you may need to consult a guide. There was only one instance where I knew what to do but it took some fiddling to figure out the specific way the game wanted me do it. For the curious, it involves chains and is about the last thing you do in the game.\n\nA small criticism would be that the 90's motif is handled roughly at times. For example, there's a section where voice and image analysis software is used. Having a computer automatically spot a pattern in a scanned image would be quite unusual though at least plausible, but automated voice analysis was virtually impossible at a home level in that era. Also, having been a computer-oriented nerdy student at the time myself, it stretches credulity a bit that a punk-rock motorcycle-riding journalism major in 1995 would have been at all comfortable using that software by herself the first time she saw it while not describing herself as a geek. Keep in mind, Windows '95 had only just launched so anyone knowing their way around x86s would have had to be proficient in Windows 3.x and probably DOS, and Macs weren't much more user friendly.\n\nBeyond that, it's not clear how and why the police conveniently show up at a particular time in the story. This would be the one thing I'd call an actual plot hole, but it's minor and not at all plot-critical.\n\nFinally, the devs have made politics an issue in interviews saying this is intended to be a feminist game. I'm not a fan of devs operating with political agendas, but this is about as well as I've seen it done. The main character is a bit of a Mary Sue, but not much more than most adventure game protagonists. The only scene which suffered from it is where she lays out a biker with a stun gun as it's neither plot-relevant nor necessary for character development. It's just a chance to show off that she's a strong woman who don't need no man. On the other hand, at least she didn't lay him out with her bare hands.\n\nMy beef here isn't that she's a strong female character. It's that creators seem to think women can only be strong if they are in physical conflict with men and it's both overdone and lacks verisimilitude. If the devs felt the confrontation necessary at all (which it's not), I'd rather have seen it handled the way one might like their real life daughter to handle it, which I doubt means with physical violence if there are other means at hand. In this case, she could have asked the man if he regularly assaults the daughters of his fellow gang members, or called for assistance from other members. It's intelligence, not weakness, for a 140 lb woman to avoid physical conflict with a 250 lb man.", "timestamp_created": 1563815709, "timestamp_updated": 1563815709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54228336": {"recommendationid": "54228336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023339248", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1564507217}, "language": "english", "review": "I kinda like the game.

That being said, I didn't like it and I don't think it appeals to a wide audience at all.\n\nThe game's fairly short (only took me 6 hours to beat), there's no moon logic and all the actions are fairly clear, so if you're new to the genre, this one is as good an introduction as any other. The plot positions itself as a detective story, and sure enough things start that way. The game even has a promising line \"A Detective is Born\" right there in the title! Which just makes the consequent emergence of mystic elements and inexplicable occult rites all the weirder, if not utterly out of place. Kathy Rain could've easily maintained the strict and grounded investigative tone throughout its entire brief story, but apparently it just wasn't good enough.\n\nBut the biggest offender that put me off was the protagonist herself. On the Steam forums I stumbled upon a rhetoric that Kathy Rain is a \"girly\" quest (whatever that might mean), and while I don't know exactly how to interpret that statement, it makes me believe that there's a grain of truth in it - maybe those who share certain qualities and characteristics with the main heroine will find it more to their liking. As for me... I could overlook the disgusting habit of incessant smoking - after all, Solid Snake never leaves the base without a pack of his trusty slug repellents, so who am I to judge? Could probably forgive the unnecessarily sassy attitude - even though it teeters on the brink of turning into an asshole to perfect strangers. Could maybe find a place in my heart for the whole \"rebellious young woman with daddy issues behaves like a silly teen\" shtick, even though any reasonable adult should honestly know better than that. \n\nBut when Kathy wilfully misses her University classes, that's where I draw the line. How can one be so entitled as to skip a whole week of studies for no good reason or explanation other than \"Nah!,\" especially considering that to become a true journalist is her current major goal in life? How can one be so arrogant when there are thousands and millions of other people who would love to get an education, a breakthrough in their otherwise hopeless lives, but can't, because an immature, self-important (wo)man-child Kathy Rain took the only spot in the academic roster? I cannot bring myself to respect her character, and the more I played, the harder it became to stay interested.\n\nI suppose that the little rant above actually speaks volumes of the game's portrayal of characters - if it managed to evoke genuine disgust, then the writers did something right. And of course, your mileage may vary and maybe you'll find more positive traits in Kathy than I could. After all, it's not like she's an evil person or a criminal - in fact, vice versa, when it comes to friends, she shows herself to be selfless, decisive and more courageous than I could ever be. Still, clearly our values lie in different dimensions entirely.\n\nEither way, I got the game for free as part of a giveaway, so I can't complain about the money spent. Time, however, is a different beast, and if you really enjoy point & click quests and maybe look for an awesome female protagonist, look no further than Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok on Steam. It's free, it's awesome, it's replayable and, frankly, despite being set in a fantasy world, it makes more sense than Kathy Rain. Or, if mystery and cosmic horrors are more up your alley, play Fran Bow - it's about as difficult as Kathy Rain, but also more intriguing and incomparably \"higher-tier\" in terms of production value.", "timestamp_created": 1562439895, "timestamp_updated": 1562574110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554485142230987549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53805735": {"recommendationid": "53805735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283476376", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1561699426}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1562427091, "timestamp_updated": 1562427091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53786642": {"recommendationid": "53786642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048668312", "num_games_owned": 10727, "num_reviews": 306, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1562376409}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]More interesting reviews on [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33843777//] Fenol Baron Approves Curator Page[/url] [/h1]\n\nA good story is the basis of any good adventure quest, something that builds on all the other components. And with great confidence I can say that the story told in the game \u201cKathy Rain\u201d is very informative and fascinating. A large share of the detective, oppressive mysterious mystical atmosphere against the background of the pastoral serenity of a small town, the tangible influence of David Lynch and his Twin Peaks, the understanding of the correct disclosure of the internal component of the characters - all this is mixed into something very interesting and nontrivial. The journalist Kathy Rain arrives in his grandfather's funeral hometown and almost immediately finds evidence that some strange unexplainable things happened in his past that led him to a wheelchair for 15 years, and almost all residents can hear the sound of bones skeletons of the closets. Kathy's personality is also very ambiguous, it is plagued by internal demons, tearing it from the inside, constantly poisoning its present existence. History perfectly conveys the feeling of an impending threat, which is still somewhere beyond the horizon, but inexorably approaching; competently playing with plot nuances, without revealing all of their cards, but constantly throwing new and new hints to the player. This scheme works fine to the very end credits, at the sight of which you get the feeling that you have read a good book.\n\nIn addition to the story, it is worth noting the work with the characters. They look and sound so human, that you believe in their emotions and actions. In situational dialogues, some minor spiritual things are constantly flashed that make them as close to reality as possible, humanize the figures on the screen, make them even relatives to some extent, and the roommate Cathy in the room is an incredible redhead charm. Puzzles as much as possible tied to the story and look very relevant in those situations where you are faced with them. Although there are few of them, but their complexity is VERY decent, so you have to seriously work on their solution. I didn\u2019t really like the riddle with the poem (although usually I love the decoding of the messages), but here it was too wise and foggy, as it seems to me. The picture is also quite normal for this game engine, there are some incredibly beautiful locations (mostly related to nature), but in general there are no surprises in this regard, and the game is not about graphics, but about the plot and involvement in it.\n\n\u201cKathy Rain\u201d is a great example of the fact that high-quality history and the ability to work with the emotions of a player mean much more than a picture for millions of dollars and an incredible promotion. Very delicate, lively and exciting adventure, long-lasting in memory, a wonderful job.\n", "timestamp_created": 1562416489, "timestamp_updated": 1562416489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599910438060760498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53659053": {"recommendationid": "53659053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198435520048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1561561422}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego simple pero a la vez maravilloso; te hace interesarte cada vez m\u00e1s por el caso a resolver y necesitas saber m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s sobre lo sucedido.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1562332342, "timestamp_updated": 1562332342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53617545": {"recommendationid": "53617545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245637036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1562141051}, "language": "english", "review": "A remarkable achievement from a first-time developer, Kathy Rain is an unexpectedly personal gem about a heroine who proves she belongs with the genre\u2019s other big names.\nAdventure Games.com", "timestamp_created": 1562304756, "timestamp_updated": 1562304756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53601594": {"recommendationid": "53601594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066179106", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1561813506}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice but sad", "timestamp_created": 1562291822, "timestamp_updated": 1562291822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53587530": {"recommendationid": "53587530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045804836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1562280654}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommended.\n\nVery interesting story.\nFun and clever puzzles.\n(had to use google only once or twice as i got impatient and just couldn't wait on the story to progress)\n\nWish the choices you make in dialogues had a bit more variety.\nApart from that - i'm going to look at what else this developer has made.\nHungry for more.", "timestamp_created": 1562280914, "timestamp_updated": 1562280914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53566019": {"recommendationid": "53566019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095893430", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 928, "last_played": 1562106245}, "language": "english", "review": "A great mystery, point & click game, where you act as an investigator.\nI really enjoyed the atmosphere of this game and it's 90's vibes.

So it might be a little bit biased\n\nThe synopsis of the game is basically, you start as Kathy Rain, an apathetic college girl that have to solve the mystery of her grandfather disappearance before her grandfather died.\n\nFirstly I want to point that this game initial puzzle and story is really tight-gripping. Everything starts very smoothly, the pacing, the plot points, the puzzle solving, everything is really good, until near the end of the final chapter, the story suddenly takes a huge blow. All of the logical and immersive story suddenly mixed up with some supernatural plots nonsense that introduced later by nearly at the end of the story. \n\nIt can be my fault if I don't really understand the plots fully or don't understand the underlying psychological metaphors of this game, but again the way the plot changing is kind of breaking the immersive story that this game build early in the first three chapters.\n\nAside from my mixed feeling about the game story. The other aspects of the game is a top notch. While the plots is unsatisfying, the writing of the game dialogue is really damn good, I really enjoy all of the game characters dialogue (or monologue).\n\nAnother points go for engaging puzzle solving, good-looking pixel art, atmospheric soundtrack, and damn the voice acting in this game is really good. \n\nAlso, this game is kind of short around 3-5 hours of playtime, so it's either good or bad for some players\n\nStory : 6/10 Could be better\nGraphic : 8/10 pixelated graphics done right\nMusic : 8/10 very atmospheric\n\nVerdict:\nThe game is still fun and enjoyable if you don't take the story seriously.", "timestamp_created": 1562211074, "timestamp_updated": 1562211647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577908337116241455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53440035": {"recommendationid": "53440035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090648510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1562196770}, "language": "english", "review": "4/5 stars - I loved the puzzles, and I only needed a hint twice so everything is pretty logical to figure out.

Armed with a stun gun, pack of cigarettes, and a Zippo lighter from her dad, Kathy starts investigating the mysterious circumstances around the last years of her grandfather\u2019s life.\n\nAs a main character, Kathy Rain is an awesome female protagonist who is totally bad-ass, with a take-no-shit, too cool for school attitude. I instantly liked her and was happy to share her journey into small town mystery.\n\nWhile attending her grandfather\u2019s funeral, Kathy reunites with her grandmother who she hasn\u2019t seen since she was a child. Her grandmother isn\u2019t surprised in the least by her reappearance after all these years and welcomes her with open arms. The two reminisce and catch up on the last 15 years.\n\nKathy learns that her grandfather hadn\u2019t been the same since being found in the forest over a decade earlier, barely speaking a word to anyone. And she believes that something happened to him in the forest and is determined to find out what.\n\nHer investigation begins with the only clues her grandmother can offer \u2013 checking out the old Air Force base her grandfather was stationed at in his youth.\n\nKathy Rain\u2019s mystery hooked me and I wanted to know what was happening in this small town with crazy occurrences, disappearances, and an eccentric billionaire.\n\nWhy were people heading into the forest and coming back affected as they were? Or not coming back at all? What significance was the tragic life of the young artist who drowned herself? And who was buying \u2013 and stealing \u2013 her artwork?\n\nThis was a really enjoyable indie game that had me hooked from the word go. Plus, it was challenging enough that I had to keep exploring to figure out the right path to continue\u2026 it wasn\u2019t always obvious what you had to do.\n\nHonestly, I do think that the story let the game down a little bit. Surface level was fine, but I want more. Deeper answers and explanations to everything alluded to throughout the game.\n\nRead my full review: https://geekherring.com/2019/06/09/kathy-rain-review/", "timestamp_created": 1561916257, "timestamp_updated": 1561916257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52491679": {"recommendationid": "52491679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189832298", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1564529104}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice.", "timestamp_created": 1561913544, "timestamp_updated": 1561913544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52474639": {"recommendationid": "52474639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128840555", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 5403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3632, "last_played": 1626028442}, "language": "english", "review": "Good music, nice humor and sadness to the story.

The quality of the recording and the skill of the actors, to the inflection of emotions and direction, can be felt. The puzzles don't feel contrived to add content nor are they overtly difficult. I only got partially stuck a few times but it didn't slow the pace down very much. Puzzles were well thought out and spaced between investigation segments appropriately. The characters are well written, most with a deep background, and everyone you meet has a purpose to the story. or your goals You feel like a rookie journalist, not a random protagonist thrown in to fill a story gap, and you have ties to the core plot. The length was appropriate, not adding fluff to extend the duration, and everything you do felt like it fit the situation.\n\nThe down side? I thought that the story falls off midway. I was absolutely engrossed in the story line from the get go and I wanted to know so much about her relationship with her grandfather and the rest of her family. I found myself losing interest once things move from discovering/understanding past events to dealing with the unusual sci-fi backstory. I commend the creator for writing and programming, so maybe expectations shouldn't be so grand. There wasn't a lot of 'item combination', possibly only twice, so this feature felt shoehorned in to meet genre requirements. The soundtrack was repetitive and some tracks do not fit the atmosphere. Also, the game doesn't appear to run in 4k resolution, even after tweaking all the config settings.

It's been a long time since I've played any point-and-click games. I recall playing the genre when I was younger and Kathy Rain was such a nice game to recall old times. The oldish, 90's graphics and atmosphere sure help with that too.\n\nIt took me about 5-6 hours to finish the game in total although I admit I walked by a walkthrough for most of the playtime. This is mainly because I didn't want to miss the achievements along the way (which are pretty difficult to get on your own really. They are all hidden and some of them require strange actions that you might miss on your own.) I speculate that it would take longer to finish the game without the walkthrough, and definitely more time if you try to complete the achievements on your own.\n\nThe story was okay. It had enough suspense to make me want to keep playing to know what's next, but in the end when all was revealed, it didn't feel very satisfying. It has a dark, religious theme to it so maybe that's it. But it was alright. On another hand, I loved the characters and dialogue. The characters felt very real and the dialogues were quite well-written. I definitely liked Kathy. She's not your usual main character and she's definitely an interesting MC.\n\nSo yup, I definitely recommend this game although it's best that you wait for a sale.

Weird trying-hard-to-be-disturbing type of storyline is actually just pointless. Meaningless, forced and hollow is how it felt to me. The 'detective' element of the game is weak, most things you find out are predictable.\nAs for the main hero, Kathy Rain is trying to be the steriotypical 'rebelios' character as hard as the plot is trying to seem interesting and surprise you or something. As annoying as she is, they actually give you achievements if you manage to make her act even more annoying.\nAnd yet, there is no serious difference between the replies you choose - you can't change main character's attitude drastically, it's just all shades of annoying - and what they result in.  Dialogue options are useless, because you get everything you need no matter what you choose to say.\nThe whole world of this game is shaped to give one Nancy Drew-wannabe appreciation [spoiler] she doesn't deserve [/spoiler], that's what the plot and the dialogs come down to. The game's 'message' seems to be both about [spoiler]responsibility for your own actions and choises, not blaming others for everything and not letting past rule your life and make you a jerk[/spoiler] and [spoiler]still getting your way no matter how much of a jerk you choose to be[/spoiler]. Those two conflict, and such a mixed message is usually a result of saying something when you have nothing to say.\n\nKathy Rain is an easy game, but it takes too long.

I was worried for a while that it might be anti-Christian but after playing the entirety, that doesn't seem to be the case.  It seems to be sufficiently neutral about Christians, which makes sense to me.  \n\nThe idea that when someone who is guilty of a serious offense commits suicide, it shows that the person has a conscience, seems a bit erroneous since suicide itself is unethical.  HOWEVER, I had to consider the character who made the comment since that character probably cannot be depended heavily on to know this real well.\n\nExtremely good in certain parts.  Good puzzles but maybe sometimes a little too time-consuming to figure out, sometimes maybe even way too difficult to know how to allow our character to proceed.  Perhaps a few more hints from the mind of our character (we can hear what she is thinking sometimes) would be much better.  One time I couldn't determine a code and even after finding the code with youtube searches I still didn't know HOW they got the code, only what the code was.  I ended out having to do even more searching to figure it out.  Yes, too difficult sometimes to follow that narrow path to reaching the end.\n\nFun traits differing from character to character, adequate amount of thinking involved and some of it involved computing efforts which was really fun for me.  Overall I think a good game.  A few adjustments and I really think it could easily be a great game.  Then again, maybe others will like what I did not?

[i]Clifftop Games[/i] had just released their next game so I assume making their first adventure game free had promotional purposes. \n\nYou immediately notice the low resolution KR employs - this was made with the use of the so-called [i]Adventure Game Studio[/i]. This is a development tool to design adventure games that are akin to those classic [i]LusasArts[/i] games we used to play back in the '90s. Although the resolution is very low, music and voice acting are top-notch - both help with the immersion, a lot.\n\nThe story revolves around a college girl who just learns her grandfather passed away. She attends the funeral and after a long conversation with her grandmother she finds out that he was, for many years, bound to a wheelchair following some sort of an accident. Nobody really knows what happened so Kathy starts investigating. In the 5 days (or chapters) we have we learn a lot not just about grandfather but the entire Rain family.\n\nThis is a [i]point-and-click[/i] game, all right. We interact with a lot of items, gradually increase our inventory and we can combine the objects we picked up with others whenever we see it logical. This is something I liked about the game -  solutions to certain puzzles were interesting and at the same time very logical. The only letdown for me was the ending which simply borrowed too much from [i]Twin Peaks[/i].\n\nThroughout the game I felt a [i]Wadjet Eye Games[/i] vibe - in fact, one of the voice-actors was none other than [i]Dave Gilbert[/i].

On one hand there is certainly a lot to like about this game: I like the classic adventure game vibe - the game obviously draws some influences from games like Gabriel Knight. The characters and the story are interesting (even though the story gets wrapped a bit to quickly for my taste).\n\nHowever, if like me, you play adventure games at least in part for the puzzles (challenge), you will probably be disappointed. There aren't really a lot of puzzles in the game, but the even bigger problem is that the puzzles that are there tend to solve themselves. The way this works (without going into spoilers) is that the game provides hints that are unnecessary or just too strong - in several instances, Kathy outright tells you how you are supposed to solve a puzzle. This leaves the impression that Kathy (the character) was the one to solve the puzzle and not the player. The end result is that any sense of accomplishment a player would normally get from solving a puzzle is absent.\n\nThis is especially disappointing considering difficult puzzles were a major part of classic adventure games from which Kathy draws so many influences. I get that a lot of gamers nowdays play adventure games only for the story, but there are ways to reconcile those worlds. For example, I wish that the game offered a \"hard\" mode with more puzzles and less hints, or even just an explicit \"hints\" button that gamers who wanted to salve puzzles themselves could safely ignore.", "timestamp_created": 1559309438, "timestamp_updated": 1559309438, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50970101": {"recommendationid": "50970101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075230907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1559291083}, "language": "english", "review": "Good, but short and cliche.

It's eerie, funny, and enthralling. If anything has ever come close to a Veronica Mars/Nancy Drew crossover, this would be it. Kathy is cheeky, daring, and she knows how to get what she wants. The puzzles are fun and satisfying, and the story pulls you in and never lets you go. I ended up bingeing the entire game in just two days (it would have been less if I didn't start playing so late). I wanted more of the mystery, and I knew I wouldn't be satisfied until I finished it. I do wish that the game would've been longer. It feels too short for a $14.99 retail game. And the ending was a little disappointing. With the tension being so high in the beginning, the reveal fell a little flat. Still, I enjoyed this game. It reminded me what good detective puzzle games should be - and as someone who has played every single Nancy Drew PC game, I know what I like. The pixel art was also a nice nostalgic trip.

Kathy Rain is an amazing character. I loved her. There are probably people out there like her, or people out there that can relate to her in some way, whether it be a personality trait or her relationships with her family and the other characters in the game. She's smart, confident, quick-witted and straight up cool af. She's a bad a**. The characters in general are great. \n\nI loved the dialogue and voice acting. The game shared a lot of similarities to the Blackwell series by Wadjet Eye Games, which is one of my favorites. The same things that made those games great were present here. Each character has so much personality and it's hard not to get invested. It felt like a Wadjet Eye Game, honestly. \n\nThe puzzles were, for the most part, pretty straight forward and simple. There really wasn't anything that was too far fetched or unreasonable. However, I'm extremely sad, upset and embarrassed to say that I needed a walkthrough to do a few of the ones towards the end, specifically the riddle one and cracking the pad lock code at the end of the game. It was on me. They weren't difficult in retrospect, I'm just dumb and couldn't figure them out. Sad. \n\nI'm also a big fan of the soundtrack. They were simple tracks, but they all fit extremely well with the ambiance of the game. \n\nAs for flaws... Like I mentioned before, the game shared a lot of similarities to the Blackwell series by Wadjet Eye Games. Dave Gilbert, the head of Wadjet Eye Games, was involved with this game, so that shouldn't be too surprising. However, some aspects of the game are eerily similar in a lot of different ways. There are certain locations, game mechanics and aspects of the story that are almost taken directly out of Blackwell. I love the Blackwell series, so I personally didn't mind, but I could see how that can be seen as a flaw. You probably don't want to be this similar to another game. \n\nThe story was a tad bit convoluted at times and difficult to understand. I've seen some people complain about this, but I didn't find it to be that bad. It didn't really ruin the experience. It was fun to play through regardless, despite being confused about what exactly was taking place for the majority of the game. I'm sure a lot of people who finished this game are still confused by the story to some degree. For me, it's a little muddy. I feel like I have questions, but I'm honestly not even sure what they are. I'd say this is probably the biggest flaw in the game. \n\nThat's pretty much it. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably like this. Also, the ending hinted that there could potentially be a sequel, which is cool. I'd love to play another Kathy Rain game.

Technicly the game is somewhat limited, there isn't a ton of screens, cutscenes or crazy setpieces.\nBut the game is dripping with atmossphere. The music and the voiceover are a true bliss. The developer paid very close attention to details regarding the 90ies setting, people that remember those days and stuff like the dictaphone will know what I mean. \nThe setting is very intimate, there is basicly (almost) no filler or cheese in the game. Everything that is there, serves the purpose of telling the story. None of the puzzles were obtuse or in place to fluff up the playtime and there was a sense of direction at all times. Unlike other adventure games Kathy Rain doesn't do the typical pixel hunting, mememing or whacky humour of point and click games.(tho there are some  veiled nods to Lucasfilm games).  The  characters act natural and the tasks at hand are rather mundane. Progression is intuitive, so i'd say even newcomers to the genre will find their way around in no time.\nThere is something about this type of games that is timeless. I 'd take a point and click adventure over the next best FPS gubbins any day by now. \n\nI'd love to elaborate on the story, but it would spoil the fun.\n\nMy verdict: I am glad i played this one. It's a true gem. \n\nWoulda bought it on sale anyday....but that is just because I am a scrooge.

The graphics look a bit dated, a bit  like something that  my dad  used to play on his computer. but the story makes it up for that.\n In the end there is a cliffhanger that there might be a second game coming.

Just a standard point and click, nothing innovative. Characters are at least unique and aren't boring to talk to. Main character can be sort of funny from time to time. Several puzzles stretched over the 5 chapters that aren't necessarily hard. Although some of the time you might not exactly know where you're supposed to go to continue the story as you'll lose track of your objective, and sometimes you might get stumped at certain sections. Honestly, I'd say you could probably figure it out without cheating if you're patient, but I'm not patient and simply just wanted to finish the story. So in those cases I just popped open one of the dozens of 100% walkthrough guides to get a sense of direction.\nSince the story is completely linear and the combinations for everything except one puzzle remains the same. The replay-ability of this game is practically zero. The music is pretty unnerving in certain zones and the Nature Reserve in particular put me a little on edge the first time I went there. Mostly because of the event that unfolds there after the first time you visit it. So I guess I could say this game has some decent 'atmosphere.' \n\nOverall, the game's pretty good. It was pretty entertaining all the way through. Almost nothing is predictable, although there is some foreshadowing. I can't recall ever being bored at any point throughout and it's a shame that more events aren't randomized, because then you could actually replay the game without getting bored. Only reason it stays fun is because of the suspense created by different unsolved questions throughout the game.\nWhich becomes absent once you've played the game one time.

It really nails the old-school point-and-click adventure game aesthetic while having a much better, much more modern UI. I love the pixel art -- the stormy horizons in the background are particularly beautiful -- and the voice acting is good (as you might expect with Dave Gilbert in charge of it). This game has a thoughtful, well-polished production.\n\nThe writing is pretty darn good. While the main character doesn't do much for me -- I feel like snarky main characters, [i]especially[/i] in adventure games, are old hat by now, and Kathy sometimes seems like she's trying a little too hard -- she nevertheless has those moments where I just have to smile. By and large, the dialogue is naturalistic, and I quite enjoyed the overall tone of impending Lovecraftian doom. I'd like to draw special attention to the character named Goober. It isn't too often that I see such a charmingly well-written character! His voice actor also deserves special praise. [spoiler]His \"movie buff\" sequence was frankly some of the most fun I've had in a Steam game in a while.[/spoiler] A true delight to listen to. Well done!\n\nSome of the puzzles near the end of the game may be challenging. [spoiler]I found the mausoleum-related puzzles difficult, personally.[/spoiler] But everything else, so far as I can tell, makes perfect sense. No moon logic here: everything works exactly as you would expect it to, and investigation is extremely logical. Some of the hints are cleverly built into the dialogue itself. [spoiler]The \"electrifying performance\" hint is a truly inspired example of that![/spoiler]\n\nIf you're a fan of point-and-click adventure games, or if you like well-told stories, give [i]Kathy Rain[/i] a shot.

At first, it seemed like it would be another one of those games that just pushes a female protagonist and makes it a Mary Sue, but this was done quite tastefully and her personality didnt feel forced.\n7.5 out of 10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1556562713, "timestamp_updated": 1556562713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50377806": {"recommendationid": "50377806", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998887445", "num_games_owned": 1042, "num_reviews": 164, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1680855263}, "language": "english", "review": "Supernatural detective point and click adventure.

The investigation lasts for 5 days, each day Kathy learns things about her grandfather past and the mysterious deaths and disappearances been going on in the area. Along with these, you'll learn about the hardship she's been through with her parents. The story is well written and you'll get the chance to choose Kathy's responses in some of the scenes. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1719615731\n\nThe artwork is splendid! The retro feel of the pixel art brings back the nostalgic feeling of good old Point&Click games. The characters style, environments, and even the music are all blended together nicely.

Rushing to reach the conclusion. It's something I've seen many times before and I will probably continue encountering it in games (not just of this genre). \n\nThe premise of the game seems simple at first. You are Kathy Rain, a young woman with a troubled past that learns that her grand father that hasn't seen for years is dead. Reluctantly she decides to attend the funeral and also visit her grandmother. From her she learns of the weird accident that left her grandfather in a vegetative state up until his death. From here, Kathy decides to discover what happened to him, something that will also shed more light to the various events that took place while she was gone. It's a pretty compelling story that slowly expands into something way bigger that our protagonist could ever imagine. But just as things start becoming clear and things go into the supernatural, the game rushes the final act and it fails to do anything disturbing or thought provoking. I won't spoil the story, but the protagonist is called to face her past and she is barely affected to things that should shock her and us as well. Again, as I said it was really close to something great, but the final part of the game feels rushed. \n\nVisually the game is solid using an art style pretty common with 90s adventure games. Given the game also takes place in the 90s, it feels nostalgic and familiar at least for me who grew up playing every game of the genre I could get my hands on. Some may find it a bit too pixely, but everything is well drawn and with pretty solid animations. \n\nRegarding the puzzles, almost every one of the ones in the game are on the easy side and won't really trouble a seasoned adventure game player. To be honest the only times I got stuck was because I thought way too out of the box, but if you don't overestimate the puzzles, you will never have any issue with them. Items you can pick or use are very limited, you can't pick or use them before their time, in the more intricate puzzles the protagonist kinda points you to the right direction even when it's not really needed, dialogues are usually just for exposition and furthering the plot (except in a couple of scenes). It's on the (very) easy side, without insulting the players intelligence. \n\nSound-wise, kudos for the voice actors, all of them did a great job. I liked the protagonist and her friend, as well as the various NPCs you meet along the way. It doesn't feel cheap, in fact I would even say it is better than most classic adventures out there. Sound effects are serviceable and the music even though is fine doesn't really take advantage of the era the story takes place in.\n\nWith the game only lasting around 6 hours (add a couple more if you want to chase all achievements since most of them are hidden and require experimentation), the puzzles being on the easy side and the plot, even though intriguing, slightly missing the ball, I find it hard to recommend the game to the hardcore adventure gamer. Still if you want a more casual adventure with a likable protagonist, interesting premise, decent visuals, without being too puzzle heavy, then it's a solid choice especially if you find it heavily discounted like I did.

The quality of the story and gameplay negates this to a significant degree but I would recommend looking for a sale.\n-Story ending leaves a little to be desired in terms of closure.

With its strong and personable, albeit tough, protagonist the game offers a good helping of logical point and click puzzling and an interesting narrative. It\u2019s a little short, but the overall quality is very high and aside from being a little easy at times (which is no bad thing!) earns a definite recommendation in the annals of point and click adventures.[/quote]\n\nWas Scooby Doo a detective show? Did the Mystery Machine randomly breaking down somewhere where strange things were happening show that the gang actively sought out the unexplained? Or were they just nosey? It\u2019s a question that I wondered as I played Kathy Rain, the Scooby Doo\u2019iest of point and clicks, as Kathy found herself involved in a mystery that came out of nowhere\u2026attending the funeral of her grandfather she gets drawn into a mystery that has had a multigenerational impact upon the town in which he lived. \n\nKathy Rain, an AGS point and click adventure from indie developer Clifftop Games, could be mistaken for being a Wadjet Eye release at times. With its lovely pixel artwork, character portraits that require a bit of imagination to match up with the lo-res faces, and somewhat sombre tone it bears all the hallmarks of what we\u2019ve come to expect from those masters of the point and click revival. The real question is whether something so deceptively retro is worth your time today. And with no prior expectations the answer is most resoundingly yes.\n\nAs mentioned above, Kathy Rain has all the characteristic traits of a typical AGS adventure. Its pixel artwork is lovely however, with bright colours and distinctive character and location work that bring the game to life. Kathy is a distinctive protagonist, and despite the potential lack of detail that can come from pixel art, is a nice change from the typical main characters we see in these more sombre games. In fact every aspect of the game seems lovingly rendered, environments, inventory items and puzzles included, and it\u2019s a rare case of a point and click where the dreaded pixel hunt doesn\u2019t become a common occurrence. \n\nPerhaps the UI is part of the reason for this, with a large cursor that readily picks out objects of interest and indicates how they can be utilised by the player. It\u2019s refreshing to feel unhampered in this regard and with the dynamic interactivity options (if an item has special properties a small tab appears in its display) interacting with puzzles and the environment itself is never a sticking point. Of course Kathy has a standard inventory bar that expands and contracts as required, and you\u2019ll often find yourself combining objects or showing them to people, but the novel controls are easy use and self-explanatory in their operation, never hindering gameplay.\n\nPuzzle difficulty is something that can be a contentious issue. Kathy Rain has some original conundrums that are enjoyable in their novelty, and of course the typical combine and use problems. On the whole this is not a particularly challenging experience, although there are one or two chokepoints that most will run into towards the end of the game (I bruteforced a somewhat cryptic puzzle involving a poem, which seems to be a common problem). The puzzles are logical in their application, taking a refreshing real world approach which may be in part why the game feels slightly easier than some of its fellows. Of course many will play these games to enjoy the story, and as a result I personally felt the difficulty was perfectly pitched, never requiring a guide but still having some head scratching moments that required Kathy\u2019s assistance to solve.\n\nAnd hearing Kathy speak was a wonderful experience, largely matched by the entire cast. Of special note is Arielle Siegel, Kathy\u2019s voice actor, who is once again brilliant. She brings Kathy\u2019s dialogue to life and creates an attachment that can be difficult for some protagonists to achieve. Of course the dialogue has to be of an equally high standard to allow the voice work to shine, and thankfully there are no clunkers although a particularly zealous priest can get a little annoying. If asked I\u2019d have trouble recalling any of the game\u2019s themes or musical motif\u2019s, but whilst playing I wasn\u2019t troubled by a poor atmosphere or misuse of music, so whilst not memorable it plays a more than adequate role in fleshing out the tale.\n\nSo with an interesting cast and good puzzling, can the narrative match the standard and elevate the game to something special? It\u2019s here that I feel Kathy Rain stumbles a little, and whilst it\u2019s a shame that it does so, it certainly isn\u2019t ruinous. For the first half or perhaps two-thirds of the adventure the plot has a slightly chilling effect, with hints of mystery which could veer off in almost any direction. There are leads and questions posed that seem to indicate the direction of the story, and this serves as a brilliant spur to push the story on. However, the exploration of character\u2019s pasts, and the resolution of all the loose ends is unfortunately unsatisfying and somewhat vague. It\u2019s not an open ended disaster, which would indeed be frustrating, but equally the wrap up ends with a fizzle and not a bang.\n\nThat being said, Kathy Rain is a very enjoyable point and click game that I\u2019d recommend to anyone without hesitation, with a quality that easily surpasses some of the output of more experienced publishers. The \u201cDetective is Born\u201d subtitle can go some way to explain away loose ends, with potential revelations to follow, but sometimes it\u2019s nice to have the potential options for explanation a little less vague. As it is the denouement becomes somewhat forgettable which isn\u2019t a tragedy but is a little disappointing. With its 5 to 8 hour play time it\u2019s not the longest game (I finished in two sessions) but it doesn\u2019t feel overly short and there\u2019s definitely room for more of Kathy\u2019s adventures in the future. Play it. Enjoy it. Then watch Twin Peaks.\n\n(...and if you already own the game what are you waiting for?!!)", "timestamp_created": 1551963884, "timestamp_updated": 1669167746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644916296005249023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49364906": {"recommendationid": "49364906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000918877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1551754154}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing", "timestamp_created": 1551754172, "timestamp_updated": 1551754172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49360705": {"recommendationid": "49360705", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978984728", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1551266184}, "language": "english", "review": "A great little adventure Point-n-Click, the story was rich enough to keep me going and experience the conclusion; the puzzles made sense and the voice acting was top notch, the only VO that felt \"off\" was [spoiler]Beau[/spoiler], it was just a sound level issue but all in all not something to write home about and the issue could easily have been on my end.\n\nHopefully there is a sequel and even if not, this game made me that much more excited for the release of Whispers of a Machine and to experience other future titles from Clifftop Games.", "timestamp_created": 1551730034, "timestamp_updated": 1551730034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49352302": {"recommendationid": "49352302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086135593", "num_games_owned": 523, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1551694186}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Would totally recommend [/h1]\n\nGood game, about 5 hours long with a good plot.

This game has a deep and rich story which I found to be very captivating.[/h1]\n\n[h1][u]STORY[/u][/h1]\nThis game is about a rebellious, aspiring journalist named Kathy Rain who is in search of what happened to her grandfather before he died. You play as her digging through clues and interviewing people you find, to unsolve this mystery.\n\nThis game has many elements such as supernatural, horror, badass punk-ish female lead, nerdy sidecick, \"cool\" hackermen, and many more which I found to evoke the mainstream components of 90s era entertainment very captivatingly. While the story wasn't anything mindblowing, it kept me engrossed enough to finish the game within a day.\n\n[h1][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/h1]\nThis game plays out as your usual point and click games. You have a number of locations (which gets expanded as you progress through the game) that you can visit anytime. You have an inventory in which you can keep and meaningfully combine the valuable items you collect throughout the game.\n\nThere isn't a clear hint system which you can use to progress easily if you're stuck on a specific part, and I do wish there was one. While I found the puzzles to be fun and logical, some players may not enjoy spending a lot of time on them, and if you do not want to spend a lot of time on them, you will have to look for an external guide or walkthrough.\n\n[h1][u]GRAPHICS[/u][/h1]\nThe pixel art style is perfect for this game. It made me very nostlgic of the games I played when I was very young, most of which had pixel graphics. However, this game is locked at 4:3 aspect ratio, therefore playing it in a widescreen monitor will make the screen have two black bars on the sides.\n\n[h1][u]SOUND[/u][/h1]\nI didn't find the soundtrack to be anything special. It was mild, but I think it suited the game as it didn't intrude the gameplay much. However, I found the voice acting to be pretty good. Every line of the game was voice acted and almost all of it was done in a good way. Although I do have to say Eileen's \"Okie-Dokie\" started to get annoying real fast.\n\n[h1][u]CONCLUSION[/u][/h1]\nHighly reccommend this game if you're a fan of old school point and click games.

Basically if you acsidently skip a crucial information in a dialog, though luck, you are likely not gonna hear it again. Kathy also has a notebook where she keeps important information but the information updates are few in far between so it is also not a great way to remmember things with.

The story isn't what I expected, which was also another pleasant surprise and took some strange twists and turns. Some of the mysteries/puzzles felt fairly satisfying to figure out. It was a good length of time, and it kept me invested enough that I played the entire game in one sitting without realizing how much time had gone by, something I rarely do as I start to lose attention playing a game for more than 2-3 hours at a time. \n\nSome of my only complaints regarding this game would be the pacing, and the illusion of choice. The story is actually quite interesting, but the pacing of which it is laid out feels a little off. It doesn't feel like there's a gradual or tense transition, you go from normal to abnormal almost without really batting and eye or drawing attention to it. There doesn't seem to be any stress or disbelief in the characters. So, some of the suspense is lost as you just jump straight into it. \nThe second problem is, as far as I'm aware the game only has one ending. There are often multiple dialogue options, but as far as I can tell they don't actually affect the outcome of anything. In the few instances where I tried different dialogue options, they seem to just offer different voice lines, and then take you back to the initial selection to have you try a different one...Or in some cases result in similar conversation regardless of the option you pick. This didn't really detract from the over all game though.\n\n[b][i][u] Difficulty Running Game [/u][/i][/b]\nInitially it took some tinkering and research to get the game to work properly. I have a fairly high end, three month old PC, running Windows 10...And initially could not launch the game. It would tell me the default resolution was not available etc. To solve this, the options were to run the game in an extremely tiny windowed mode, or have it grossly stretched and disproportionate. If you are encountering certain issues, the fix I found was this: In your Steam directory on your C drive, find the game folder and settings file within that folder. Lower the graphic filter to x2, run in full screen with black side bars enabled for wide screen. I'd found some suggestions saying to change one of the settings to Direct Draw 5 but found this unnecessary as long as you lower the graphic filter to x2.", "timestamp_created": 1546892768, "timestamp_updated": 1546893018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53214716911315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48174237": {"recommendationid": "48174237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346721769", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 509, "last_played": 1515889527}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Genial.

Combined with my reservations below about the story, I personally don't think I would recommend this to anyone with my tastes without a small discount. That being said, this is an indie developer, and I always say it is worth supporting them, especially when they do put effort into their craft. Plus, many other people will no doubt enjoy the narrative.\n\nA silhouetted city lit up by a crack of lighting against a neon teal night sky. To the casual viewer, this would suggest a dark, neo-noir world, brimming with crime, decay, and civil rot. It's no place for any sane human being, let alone a young woman wanting to make it as a private eye. She calls herself Kathy Rain, a catchy name for a hardboiled detective set on trying to make her town a better place, one small step at a time.\n\nAlas, that's nothing close to the actual result. Kathy Rain is a point-and-click adventure title rendered in the same old-school, early-PC style as other games like Clock Tower, King's Quest, and early-Lucas Arts' products. Our protagonist is no hardened veteran, instead being a journalism major still attending colllege at Conwell Springs. Springs is a bright place, full of a shrewd vibrancy in spite of its small population. Or so one would think.\n\nDespite my disappointment at this sharp contrast between the title graphic and the actual game, I wasn't entirely disappointed with Kathy Rain. For starters, I've always been a fan of unconventional detectives- people who seemed to sort of fall into the line of work, despite being in that general career path. Easy Rawlins, Matt Scudder, and even Nate the Great. And Kathy joins that line-up quite well. While I did feel her interest in finding out what happened to her grandfather was a bit sudden, her characterization more than makes up for it. She has that sardonic style of humor typical of the \"bad girl\" archetype, but there's enough depth to her revealed over the course of the game that expands her beyond those parameters.\n\nVisually, the game looks good enough. It's hard not to perceive the whole set-up as low budget given the 16-bit graphics, but developer Raw Fury packs every setting with lots of props and details, providing plenty of eye candy and showcasing the artists were far from lazy. There is no set color pallete either, meaning you get a surprising amount of variety from the different locales. I also liked how there were several character boxes a character when speaking that showed different emotoinal states. There wasn't much there, but it was a nice touch.\n\nVoice acting was mostly positive. I wasn't a big fan of Arielle Siegel's Kathy at first, as I felt she was trying too hard to do a Daria/Raven impression. But you get used to her voice, and her performance overall was good. All the supporting performances were top notch, showing that the developers were committed to providing a quality experience for prospective buyers (and proving a point I made about To the Moon losing something without having any actual voice acting). There was one exception, however, and that was Shelly Shenoy's Eileen. It was clear she was trying to go for \"cute badass,\" but ended up coming off as borderline sociopathic ala Lily Aldrin in Karma.\n\nI liked the diversity of dialogue options, especially when examing stuff or trying to combine stuff. It shows the developers were prepared for the crazy things players would try to do (like drinking booze in front of Kathy's grandma, or tasering someone, or smoking in front of someone).\n\nSound/music not particularly memorable. Seemed like there was only one tune that played for each area.\n\nThe story is where the game gets a mixed rep from me. As I said, was admittedly expecting something grounded ala Se7en or those classic noir movies, but Kathy Rain is much more in the vain of Twin Peaks. There are a lot of subtle supernatural elements that go on behind-the-scenes, and to me it hurt the potential the narrative of this game had. There could have been a deep tale about drug abuse, cults, small town cover-ups, and so forth, but by having these fantasy facets, it makes it more akin to the X-Files. Some people will like this regardless, and it was overall enjoyable. But be warned it's not grounded.\n\nI didn't feel Kathy really got proper character development either. There are two narratives at play here- Kathy becoming more into her journalism career and letting go of her morbid past. The first one doesn't really work because, outside of skipping classes, we never get a sense that she's reluctant to pursue journalism, meaning her ultimate decision to go through with it is blatantly expected. The second doesn't work because we don't get enough on her backstory or her inner feelings, only glimpses. And that would have been fine for an introduction into her, but a big part of the final act is about Kathy confronting her past actions, and it doesn't have much weight to it because we weren't given enough info about it and how they affected her.\n\nBut the game never gets tear jerky, and it has a nice maturity to it, never caving into the bad young adult writing tropes that, at times, hit Life is Strange.\n\nDidn't like how entering a new area meant repeating the same animations. It was obviously okay when there was no animation for entering, but coming to places like the Cemetery or the Lake House meant seeing Kathy stop her motorcycle, get off it, remove her helmet, and finally enter. It got annoying.\n\nKathy also moves too slow ala Clock Tower. It's tolerable since the areas themselves are small, but I would have liked for her to move faster than this Morrowind pace.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles in the game with a good amount of variety. None of them are particularly hard, but that isn't a bad thing in the slightest as their variations make up for that. I would have liked for the developers to make environmental interactions a little bigger as there were times where I got stuck because I missed something ala the Water Temple keys in Ocarina of Time (okay, not that bad, but my point stands).\n\nAlso didn't like that you had to click twice to interact an object in your inventory with another object. They should've just had left click allow you to drag/drop and right click to open up the other options of examining/thinking about an object.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the game that kills immersion for me is the lack of consequences for making the wrong choices. There are times where you have to give the right dialogue options, and if you fail there is no consequence- you just restart the cycle. Having the deputy fall for the same \"hobo is sick\" routine or redoing the same conversation with the Air Force guy, for instance, seems strange considering you're talking to authority figures who should be smart.", "timestamp_created": 1545071646, "timestamp_updated": 1698548627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47579112": {"recommendationid": "47579112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016151783", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 459, "last_played": 1544999728}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but ok", "timestamp_created": 1544999775, "timestamp_updated": 1544999775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47516804": {"recommendationid": "47516804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276918540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1463976986}, "language": "english", "review": "an absolutely phenomenal game", "timestamp_created": 1544764872, "timestamp_updated": 1544764872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47470527": {"recommendationid": "47470527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178390774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 378, "last_played": 1544565979}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ahora mismo he acabado el juego y que decir...aun estoy nerviosa con el papa-zombie persiguiendonos, pero con muy buen sabor de boca.

All too often have I come across rather frustrating moments which seem stilted in other examples of this kind of games, but not in \"Kathy Rain\". I can only remember one riddle which was a bit confusing, but still acceptable. That has been very refreshing.\n\nThe pixel art of this title is very charming, and the world is brimming with nice and often funny details, just take a look at the operating system of the computers! In general, different emotions and topics are dealt with: I sometimes laughed very hard, and sometimes the game touched on very serious and sad sides of life. This makes for a manifold experience.\n\nAs said in the beginning, the sound is another, if not the most, positive point about \"Kathy Rain\". Not only the voice acting, but also the music, helps a lot in creating an exciting atmosphere. It increases that storyline and feel of the 90s. There are also some influences of \"Twin Peaks\" and other pop culture delights of that era in this game.\n\nApart from the above-mentioned puzzle whose design leaves some room for improvement, I could only find a second minor flaw: the game settings were not saved, so I had to adjust these every time I started the game, but that was not too bad.\n\nSo, all in all, I would give this game an 85 % rating.

The music, while nice, isn't very memorable. There is voice acting for all the characters in the game which is sometimes a bit rough, but mostly okay.\n\nGameplay is a bit irritating overall. There are a few puzzles which aren't too hard and actually logical which is nice, but most of the gameplay consists of asking questions and finding clues. The problem is that, as seems to be the standard for these kinds of games, the player character walks really slowly, and you can't even double click to speed her up. With most  environments being small, this is not much of a problem, but you also have to go back and forth between locations a lot - often times to only do, get or ask one single thing before you have to leave again. All this is also very logical in context, yet still feels somewhat like padding.\n\nYou play as Kathy Rain, a journalism student whose grandfather just died. Kathy is an insufferable, edgy, special kind of gal who is basically a prick to everyone she meets. She drives a motorcycle, dyes her hair, smokes, drinks, and has an attitude. At one point in the game she uses the phrase, \"I'm not most girls.\"\nIt should be obvious that I do not like the protagonist, which made it a bit hard to feel empathetic when she finally started acting like a human being and showed emotions over her dead grandpa and her lunatic of a mother; typical badass bitch who hides her emotions behind sarcasm and a \"cool\" facade. Cliches can work - this one does not.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, the story starts off very intriguing. A few years before the game is set, Kathy's grandfather was involved in a strange incident and he has never been the same since. While in town for his funeral, Kathy lives up to her future career and starts investigating. Eventually she unravels some sort of religious cult conspiracy thing, and that is where it all goes downhill. Sideways. In multiple random directions.\n\nThe last chapter (or day, as the game's plot happens over five days) [spoiler]is more akin to a bizarre fever dream than anything to do with a mystery and it's really hard to tell whether what happens in the last half an hour or so - or even the entire game - was real. The thing about that is, there's a scene after everything went down in which Kathy talks to her annoying friend Eileen and even [i]they[/i] aren't sure whether what happened really happened. My guess is they all ate too many of those fancy flowers and tripped out for a couple of days.[/spoiler]\nThe last bit of the game is also when Kathy comes to terms with her own past and ... one part of it comes out of nowhere and is pretty much glossed over within a minute. It is not a topic to just bring up like that and then forget about; if there were any hints other than a seemingly tacked-on scene at the start suggesting this particular part of Kathy's past, I must have missed them.\n[spoiler]Contrary to that, at least the fact that Kathy had her mother commited to a mental institution comes up often enough but not in an \"in your face\" manner, so that is actually handled fairly well.[/spoiler]\n\nI [i]would[/i] recommend this game since it is mostly well-done and interesting, but the characters - especially Kathy - were not likeable enough to carry anything and the story was too convoluted to be enjoyable in the end.", "timestamp_created": 1534788562, "timestamp_updated": 1534805857, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517281591892242432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44246826": {"recommendationid": "44246826", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969749884", "num_games_owned": 2420, "num_reviews": 1422, "playtime_forever": 10246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10246, "last_played": 1534666157}, "language": "english", "review": "Kathy Rain feels like a mix of Full Throttle and the Blackwell series, in a good way.

To track down the facts and truth about the mysterious death of her grandfather, the player embarks on a quest. Through interrogation and clues that can be found, and occasionally some puzzle-solving, the storyline grows more immersive and compelling, progressing through the game. With a rather sinister moral undertone towards the end. Are you prepared to fight Kathy's (and also maybe your own) demons?\n\nIf so, this game might be your cup of tea. \n\nWith somewhat 10 hours of gameplay, despite having virtually no replayability, the game can be catalogued into genres such as hidden-object and/or shorter adventure games.\n\nGraphics are pixelated. It feels more like the devs wanted to take the easy route, rather than to contribute to the gameplay, opting for pixel-graphics. There are some scenes where i'd rather have seen graphics like in Sam & Max or Day of the Tentacle, instead of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or the first Leisure Suit Larry's. Sometimes this is an issue when playing, simply because the lack of details in items and environment adds difficulty.\n\nAnd hard this game can be. More than once i had to resort to walkthrough guides to find the solution. These are the sort of games where one has to find the one and only solution, to be able to progess the storyline. Don't expect any sidequests either, there are some small things that can be done, that have nothing to do with the main storyline, but unlock an achievement or invoke a joke or something. Having to turn to walkthroughs however, tend to suck out the fun, for me at least. Therefor i can conclude that Kathy Rain is a bit too hard at given points.\n\nVoice acting is done superb, especially Kathy's voice is appealling and sexy. All of the character encountered have their own speech, which can be more uncommon in games nowadays. Thumbs up to Clifftop Games for this.\n\nThe music is rather soothing and relaxing, tuned in to resemble the right atmosphere at the right time. Nothing too spectacular, but well done.\n\nTo my own personal taste, it should have been a bit less heavy on the detective, interrogation style, and somewhat more adventurous.\n\nExperiencing some sort of love-hate relationship with this game, sometimes not playing for 2-3 weeks, then coming back to it, to let it rest again for some weeks after playing half an hour or so. Took me 5 months to complete, and perfect it. Really strange, it seems like Kathy's personality channeled through the program, right onto myself.\n\nAll in all, Kathy Rain was an enjoyable experience. Would only recommend it to someone who is specifically into these kind of games, though. If you're new to the genre, or not an oldskool gamer (like myself), you may experience a bumpy ride.

Graphics are amazing. I didn't like the ending, I felt it was trying to make people become emotional and for me it backfired into eyerolling. \n\nLong version from here on!\n\nGraphics : 10/10! I love this pixellated style of graphics and the game looks great. The scenarios and characters are varied and the backgrounds are pretty and easy to see and click on. \n\nCharacters: I can understand why some people might not like Kathy, but personally I liked her. I tend to hate many of the female characters in games, so this was a good change for me. She is cynical and angsty, but she has a difficult past (as we learn in the game), so her behavior is understandable. Even her super religious friend was fun and likable. In general, I found all the characters to likable enough and quite different from each other in design. The voice acting was also good.  However, I thought the ending was a bit out of character (see below). \n\nGameplay: this game is not very hard, and the puzzles are quite easy. The only thing I found difficult were the achievements, as some of the actions necessary to get them didn't make much sense. If you like adventures with difficult puzzles, this might not be the game for you - I personally got stuck only in a couple of places and just trying out all the objects in my inventory solved the problem. It's also quite easy to understand what you have to do next, as the main character gives you suggestion.  \n\nPlot: This was the only weak point of the game, that prevented it from becoming one of my favorite games of this year. The premise is great and for a good 50% of the game I was hooked and wanted to understand what happened to grandpa. Then the [spoiler] abortion scene came and I figured out right away about the kid at the funeral [/spoiler], and I started realizing the plot would not get better - on the contrary, the more the story continued the more I was confused about some things. For example,  [spoiler] why was the kid visible at the cemetery while there were no flowers around? Maybe there were some on the tomb, but it should have been made clear. What happens to the bodies of people who go in the hole? Do they physically get lost there, since they are not found? Then shouldn't Kathy see them when she goes down? Who arranged the flowers and got rid of them after (since Kathy still hadn't inhaled the flowers, she wasn't under their effect, so the writing was real)? [/spoiler] \nOkay, maybe the solution to these questions is somewhere in the game and I missed it, but even then, the ending still felt shallow to me. \nLet me recap the story: Kathy [spoiler] discovers by chance through her roommate that her grandfather is dead and decides to go to the funeral. We learn that she wanted to visit her grandparents many times but because her mom had lied to her about them being bad etc., in the end she never went - I don't buy it. She just didn't care enough or she would have gone after committing her mother, and please don't tell me otherwise - she didn't even bother regularly checking if the grandparents were still alive! If people really want to do something, they will. But no blame here, it would make sense for her not to visit them given her history. She then learns her grandfather had a mysterious incident and wants to know more - that's understandable, I would be curious too because the circumstances are weird, not necessary because I care about my grandfather I barely remember. Then one day she finds out her grandfather actually tried to get custody of her before his accident - and all of a sudden grandfather is the best person on planet Earth and half an hour later she meets him in spirit and there's a lot of drama and we are supposed to feel something. B*tch you didn't even care about him being alive or dead a week ago! I understand discovering that he actually cared about her was heartwarming and all, but from there to all this drama - no. It's out of character. If she is really cynical and strong as we are supposed to believe for the whole game, the drama is unnecessary. Otherwise she is just yet another forgettable emo teenage character.  Also, I would like to remind you Kathy, that of course your grandma was busy with grandpa being sick, but he was sick for a million years and your grandma didn't bother looking for you AT ALL in all this time. Just some food for thought.  \nThe whole abortion story line also bothered me. I felt the writer of the game was trying to force on us the view that a fetus is a person and Kathy should feel something, which is something people might not necessarily agree with. We also don't know the circumstances of the abortion - what is she was raped? Why should she feel bad in that case, if it was not something she wanted in the first place? One of the answers even hints at the fact that she doesn't care - the one I chose, \"I didn't do anything wrong\" - so why would the kid be in the hole in the first place if she doesn't feel guilty about it? I was eye-rolling through the whole kid part, while thinking \"just get out of my fucking way so I can go save my friend\". I personally didn't feel anything in that part of the game, and that's a risk with that kind of plot point if it's not well-developed.  [/spoiler]\nSo in conclusion, while I liked the [spoiler] supernatural [/spoiler] turn the story took, I felt that the final scenes were yelling at me \"FEEL SOMETHING!!! CRY!!!\" while I'm just sitting there stuffing my face with food, eyerolling and being \"b*tch please\".  I also feel part of the plot was not 100% explained, but some explanation might come in other games, if there's any, so it's a smaller flaw to me. \n\nIn conclusion, I didn't like the ending at all but overall the game was pleasant, was a steal on discount and I can see that a lot of work went into this, so I would recommend it to my friends who like adventure and I will check the sequel if there's one in the future!", "timestamp_created": 1530701131, "timestamp_updated": 1530701171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43280872": {"recommendationid": "43280872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038753547", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 232, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1527046453}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't get the high reviews.

The puzzles are well-constructed, the characters are fun and engaging, the art is really pretty, and I enjoyed the whole game. That's all you really need to know from a review, right? Because I'm going to address something that a few reviews and forum posts have picked out, but it might be a bit spoilery, so be warned.\n\nStill here? Okay: some folks, including one reviewer at the top of the reviews page, think it's a shame that Kathy Rain delves into matters supernatural, and that the climax of the story is a weird/creepy psychological horror confrontation. And I understand, I think there's a game in here that could have been *even better* if it had just been a small, personal tale about a girl with a damaged family trying to make sense of things. But it isn't; it's a tale about a girl with a damaged family that links into a weird, Lovecraftian cult masquerading as a local evangelical church. And I think it's the \"weird, Lovecraftian\" bit that saves Kathy Rain from being just a Blackwell knock-off. Blackwell is never weird, not in the sense of the genre of \"weird fiction\". It's spooky, and ghostly, and melancholy, but also cuddly and familiar, and we always know what's going on and what we're seeing. Kathy Rain on the other hand quite deliberately does not explain what you see in the final chapter; it's not ghosts, exactly. She's not in hell, she can come back to to normal world, and we never really find out why the final puzzle is what it is. For me, the creator of Kathy Rain has deployed weirdness as a tool of storytelling. The supernatural that you understand is inherently less creepy than the supernatural you do not understand, and that's why the finale of Kathy Rain works so well; I have no idea why those damn flowers had to burn, but that's because Kathy's small, mortal brain cannot encompass the reality that she touched when she went down that escalator. She's alive, her friend is alive, and the eldritch thing that was breaking the townsfolk has gone away.

Every time a new piece of music or sound was put forth, it made sense and set the mood for what was happening or you would, correct or not, expect to happen. \n\nPuzzles and Riddles (5 of 5): \nEvery single puzzle and riddle made sense in the whole scheme of things and like any great adventure game, past or present, put you on the spot to make sense of them. Some times I spent a good bit of time to figure it out and some puzzles were really difficult to figure out, but at the same time non of them seemed, at any point, impossible, a difficult tightrope to walk for a developer but Clifftop Games was able to do so. \nTop notch work. \n\nSummary: \nAn adventure game with a great story, awesome music, difficult but no impossible puzzles and almost flawless gameplay, what else could you ask from an Adventure Game. \nIf you haven't played Kathy Rain, it should surely be on your \"to play list\", I'd put it right up there with the best P&C games I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1530347093, "timestamp_updated": 1530347093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550233662128448486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43167467": {"recommendationid": "43167467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132127424", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 570, "last_played": 1531599234}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved this game! the writing is very good, the acting well done, music is fun.

It starts out as an atmospheric small-town mystery. and Kathy herself is obviously trying a bit too hard to be a \"tough girl\" protagonist, but you get the continuous sense that she's intentionally overdoing it in order to hide the emotional problems she very clearly has, and for the most part I'm on board with that. The relationship with her roommate feels genuine underneath all the snark. The atmosphere is palpable, there were several moments that made me smile, and some of the puzzles are remarkable - in that they're challenging, clever and fitting for what you're trying to do without falling into the loop-de-loop bizarro logic normally employed by point and click adventure games.\n\nThose are the good bits. \n\nThe game goes off the rails - and it goes off the rails HARD - when it tries to take a leaf out of the playbook of the much better established Blackwell series and decides to take a turn for the supernatural. Nothing in the plot adds up satisfyingly, everything piles incomprehensibly on top of each other, and you get the growing sense that the supernatural twist was added simply because the developer thought \"This worked for Blackwell, right?!\" and an \"ordinary\" murder mystery wouldn't sell well enough. Which is sad.\n\nAnd for a final, damning nail in the coffin, the game then tries to do the whole \"disturbing psychological HORRORRRRR/protagonist's CREEPY confrontation with herself\" thing as established by Silent Hill and (particularly) American McGee's Alice, and it just doesn't *work* because the buildup of those games isn't there. It's about as jarring a tonal shift as you can imagine - the low point being the protagonist's father imagined as a zombie-like bogeyman chasing her - and just feels like a desperate attempt to grab attention because \"look how distuuuuuurrrrbiiiiiiing.\"\n\nThe less I say about the game's handling of the topic of abortion, the better.\n\nJust so much: No, dude. Just no. Not cool. Not deep. Not even in the slightest relevant.

The pixel art is lovely to look at and the writing is...serviceable. \n\nKathy herself comes across as a bit angsty, but is at least tolerable. The story itself is decent but wholly unoriginal. The game borrows heavily form Twin peaks but lacks the kind of meta-awareness and (by nature of being a pixel-based adventure game) the visual panache and artistry that taps into primal human fear that is characteristic of David Lynch.\n\nKathy Rain instead seeks to get by on tickling your nostalgia while being as unoffensive as possible. Kathy Rain knows you love Twin Peaks, knows you love classic adventure games like full throttle, and knows you feel an inordinate amount of retro love for floppy disks. And it dutifully serves those moments up to you, albeit bereft of anything resembling a fresh take or a cogent realization of theme. \n\nThat's not to say that Kathy Rain is cynical or overtly exploitative. Rather it is simply the passion project of someone with a lot of love for the 90's (and a lot of technical awareness of the typical pitfalls of adventure games) and nothing terribly new to say. \n\nKathy Rain is the B- of video games.

(Parece redundante siempre aclarar al \"estilo LucasArts\" pero la verdad es que no, viendo como de a poco empezaron a salir nuevas aventuras gr\u00e1ficas estilo \"Sierra\" con la posibilidad de \"perder\" y sus injusticias asemejadas a Dark Souls o plataformeros injustos.) \n\nEn cuanto lo que es no hay mas que agregar, ya que el fuerte de estos juegos son su historia, ambientancion y personajes que adornan la historia.\n\nElla es Kathy Rain, una inconformista estudiante de periodismo en el segundo a\u00f1o de la carrera durante la decada de los 90' (mas precisamente 1995), la cual se entera que su abuelo paterno fallecio y que su muerte esta rodeada de situaciones sospechosas e inquietantes. \n\nDecir mas seria hacer spoiler de todo lo que podemos descubrir en un pueblo tan chiquito como lo es Conwell Springs. La trama oscila constantemente entre la realidad y lo surrealista, lo cual para algunos puede confundir un poco y perderse algo importante de la trama... pero en definitiva se entiende que es un thriller policial con surrealismo, y como tal, todos los elementos del juego acompa\u00f1an esta trama, incluso a la protagonista, la cual es una chica ruda, de mal genio, pragm\u00e1tica, tiene un mech\u00f3n de pelo te\u00f1ido, piercing y maneja una moto... en conclusi\u00f3n: un personaje sombr\u00edo y duro que va a hacer juego con los escenarios, igual de sombr\u00edos y crudos, que a veces pueden resultar reconfortantes y otras veces inquietantes.\n\nLa m\u00fasica esta mas que bien, aunque no varia mas all\u00e1 del escenario donde se est\u00e8, lo que da a entender muchas veces algo como \"uh, esta m\u00fasica significa que va a pasar algo malo, raro o que va a dar un poco de miedo\". No se si es aprop\u00f3sito que la m\u00fasica cobre este rol de \"vidente\" el cual te vaticina lo que podr\u00eda llegar a pasar en el lugar donde te encontras.\n\nEl resto... delicias para los que amamos el pixelart: Detallados retratos, escenarios hermosos, generalmente buenas actuaciones de voz, la protagonista es solida y su historia tambi\u00e9n. Los puzzles son justos, nada imposible o fuera de la l\u00f3gica. Deben haber 3 o 4 que son de dificultad superior al resto.\n\nKathy Rain es un solido comienzo para alguna futura secuela.

Curses. Flawless point and clicking that's penned by a ridiculously attractive script and has great art to boot. My heart longs for the full version, which I will no doubt spoil myself with in the future.\n\nComplete review:\n\nI stand by all my previous comments. When you're raised on LucasArts games you develop a very high standard for graphic adventures, and until now, only Wadjet Eye Games (Technobabylon) and Amanita Design (Samorost 3) had really dared to reach that peak. I'm happy to say Clifftop Games is a wonderful new addition. Kathy Rain has sophisticated puzzles, well defined characters, effortless UI and a convincing plot that briefly veers into supernatural territory towards the end. Like Thimbleweed Park, there's a tender backdrop to the overarching detective story, and I love how Clifftop isn't afraid to explore those more emotional moments; they aren't cheesy or overdone and add extra layers of depth. \n\nKathy Rain's difficulty level is well calibrated, too. I struggled a bit during the latter puzzles but somehow resisted looking up walkthroughs. That's testament to the game's design, which made me genuinely care about pushing through unassisted, and I feel much more satisfied as a result. Kathy herself deserves major protag credit; she's original, fantastically written, and full of wickedly good humour that could so easily sustain a sequel. I hope Clifftop reads the last part of that sentence.\n\nNothing really sticks out musically in Kathy Rain, save perhaps for the excellent post rock menu theme, but the art style will be a hit with lovers of classic pixel art backgrounds and profiles, as it was with me. Voice acting can be a dangerous gamble in the most popular of titles (audiences are quite subjective, after all) however I found Kathy Rain's cast to be well selected. There's a nice variety of accents, performers are self-aware, and they hit all the right dramatic notes. So while Kathy Rain might be a short playthrough, its combination of fantastic sleuthing, great writing and well-balanced voice acting make it a point 'n' click I won't hesitate to recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1529758587, "timestamp_updated": 1529892961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550123631954193115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42957082": {"recommendationid": "42957082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060126725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1529668210}, "language": "english", "review": "The game starts off with a lot intrigue and a promise of an interesting plot yet in the end the writing fails to deliver on any of the early game promises.

It made me think of a time when we did not have social media and cellphones were just for wealthy citizens and calling other people. The 90's easter eggs itself range from Titanic posters and the famously used yellow pages are what of a small detail that makes the setting of the game really come to life in those times. \n\nOne of the strongest points of the game was how you are taken along Kathy's story right from the get go and as things start to unravel little by little, you become more engrossed in her quest. The issue I had with the story itself was how it changed its genre by the end. It felt like the writers weren't sure of what exactly they wanted to do by the time it finished. Regardless, I thought the overall arc leading to the conclusion was very solid.\n\nYou can say the gameplay is pretty simple. It is your typical point and click adventure and you have to logically solve the puzzels as you go along the storyline. Some were harder than others but none made me want to stop playing the game as I gave up with trying to solve the puzzles that were thrown at me. \n\nKathy rain is a gem of a story and adventure game that is ready to be explored.

Totally worth the $15 and if you like story driven games it\u2019s a must buy especially if you like classic feeling point and click adventure games.\n\nI bought this game in the humble bundle sale. After playing it I can say I officially would have considered the game a fair purchase at its full price. The story is very well written and compelling. Although the game is a little short the amazing writing and excellent voice acting made it impossible to walk away from and I completed the game in two long sittings.\n\nI do have a couple minor nitpicks about the game, however. The game only really worked well for me in windowed mode which was mildly annoying but easy to overlook after about 5 minutes of getting sucked in. Another minor imperfection that did stand out to me was a relatively limited number of specific situational dialogs when attempting to use items incorrectly. For example, sometimes attempting to use a key in a door that it wasn't meant for would yield a response to the effect of \"That action wouldn't be helpful\" instead of a more specific \"It must be the wrong key for this door\". The only time it really stands out though is in emotionally tense moments when Kathy's voice is more intense and emotional to match the current tone. At those points the generic place holder responses for attempting to use an item incorrectly stand out, because she will momentarily slip out of the tone of the situation to give a generic calm or sarcastic response to an attempted incorrect action. \n\nThose are admittedly some pretty fine-grained complaints that most people probably wouldn't even notice, but I think it helps illustrate how good the game is, that after ~8 hours and 1 playthrough and that's all I have to complain about.\n\nI played the game with my girlfriend and we had different opinions about the ending. Without wanting to give any spoilers I really enjoyed it and was very satisfied with the conclusion, but she felt it got a little to surreal in the last quarter of the game. She did say that the ending wasn't necessarily bad, just not as grounded as she would have liked and that overall the game was still quite good.\n\nI sincerely hope that this review gets at least 1 other person to buy this game and support the developers.

It was an interesting point and click adventure which provided the humor, puzzles and intricate hidden details that make the genre enjoyable.\n\nPositives:\n\n+ The art style and VA was excellent. The art is not quite as good as you might see in other games such as Thimble weed Park but its stylized acts more as a homage to the LucasArts style Point-and-Click games.\n\n+ The dialogue was interesting and at times quite humorous. Especially with the character Goober\n\n+The protagonist Kathy Rain is an interesting character, she comes off as this bad ass sarcastic anti-hero  but at the same time the trauma and problems in her life make her a flawed character. While this Characterization has been done before, (Kate Beckett, Anaksha) Kathy problems and stories are interesting enough to keep this story going. \n\n+ While brief, the game does touch on some sensitive topics such as [spoiler] Mental Illness and Abortion [/spoiler]\n\nNegatives\n\n-The leads can sputter out at times leading one to crawl around the map reading descriptions and trying to reconnect to the story line. A basic hint system might help players who are seeing the forest for the trees. \n\n- the characterization of the other characters can be a bit week at times. You can get a general sense of what they're about but besides that they don't receive the level of expansion that Kathy does. \n\n- the fifth day to me felt a bit forced in terms of emotional impact. While the way that Kathy dealt with her trauma was interesting and evocative. the time dealt actually spent dealing with her problems felt rushed. giving more time as a whole to this part of the game could help develop her character and the story more. one suggestion would be to utilize flashbacks or at least expand the sections where she deals with each individual trauma into their own sections or areas instead of some minorly symbolic wonderland backgrounds. Also [spoiler] Kathy Mirror Self [/spoiler] would be a wonderful way to act as a foil to Kathy instead of just the casual white rabbit antagonist that she is currently.\n\nKathy Rain is a pretty good Point and Click Adventure with an interesting story and a decent amount of polish.

I did notice that the game had some political vibes to it and was a little worried.  While there are some poorly executed moments, I would still encourage people to try and play through them anyways.  They're usually brief and don't linger too long.\n\nI struggled more with the lack of humour as I'm very accustomed to Monkey Island / Indiana Jones / King's Quest games and the sort, so playing a Point & Click game in a thriller/mystery context took me some adjusting (no fault on the game, just something to expect if you're in the same boat).  While I felt like stopping at times, I was also motivated to continue.  I don't know if it was the mystery setting or what, but there was definitely something unique in what the developers made here that made you curious to push ahead (good job!).\n\nThe puzzles are done well enough and very logical.  I never felt like the answer didn't make sense or was so abstract that you'd never figure it out (except for one).  Having said that, it did feel like some of the puzzles were too logical.

I must sound like an abused person that can't decide if to stay or go.\n\nIn terms of feedback, I would encourage the developer to avoid trying to label \"right\" and \"wrong\" issues and simply let them play out.  Most people would admit that they're not interested in playing a pro or anti *insert political theme here* game.  At most, they'd much rather play a game that explores the themes of said *insert political theme here* and let the audience experience the events from different perspectives or contexts without judgement.  Funny enough, there is one topic the game tackles this way through a character flashback and I was really worried it was going to be handled poorly, yet it was handled very well by simply showing the character's struggle rather than trying to state whether it was the \"right\" or \"wrong\" thing.\n\nOverall, good game, definitely worth getting for ~$5 and looking forward to a sequel or another point & click adventure from this team.", "timestamp_created": 1523197463, "timestamp_updated": 1523197463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595985054969787598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41315491": {"recommendationid": "41315491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014237611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1522951047}, "language": "english", "review": "Very competent and easy on the eyes nostalgia trip, conjuring up Gabriel Knight, Twin Peaks and the 90s in general.

The writing is good, voice acting is also good.\n\nIf I had to find something to complain about, it's that the puzzles are not very difficult, but that's just me. On the other hand, the puzzles are *real* adventure game puzzles. You're not presented with chess puzzles, sliding tiles mini-games, or anything like that. Puzzles are purely environmental, and solved by observing your surroundings, and/or using information you gathered so far. The only exception I found is lock picking, but it's a very easy version of the Splinter Cell lock picking mechanic, and it doesn't actually feel out of place at all. Basically, it's just there to make you feel like you're actually picking a lock rather than having the door open automatically just because you used a lock pick on it.\n\nAnd I'm happy to say, there's exactly *zero* pixel hunting in this game. By pressing the space bar, you always know what's in the current location without having to scan over every pixel with your mouse. Also, when examining objects, your character doesn't have to walk up to the object first before describing it; you can just examine things from afar.\n\nFinally, I've seem reviews describing the protagonist as \"goth\" or \"emo\", and I'm not sure where that comes from.

A point & click adventure that I'm sorry I missed out on and am glad to have finally experienced.\n\nThe gameplay is about what you'd expect from a point & click adventure game, but Kathy Rain has a twist on the formula that I loved the hell out of. With \"A Detective is Born\" being the subtitle, you get a lot of moments in the game where you are more or less interviewing people, going down a checklist of relevant things to ask trying to gleam any useful information out of them so that you can find out where to head next. While linear for most of the beginning parts of the game, I felt like I had a lot of ground to cover and no particular order in which to pursue leads. Maybe having more things to investigate at once would be cool. However, that might be overwhelming for some but I would have liked more times in the story to have multiple objectives. I did get very stumped a few times...Okay, maybe a lot. One puzzle requires knowledge of the rules of Scrabble, I'm pretty sure, kinda gave up on most of the hardest parts and just looked up a guide. But that's just me, I hate getting my progression blocked in games, but maybe others would like to take it easy and try to figure it out on their own. You'd certainly be more patient than me (read: Smarter).\n\nMostly what was compelling me to move forward so quickly though was the narrative. Every character felt like a real, living breathing person, thanks in large part to a combination of high-quality writing and voice acting. Characters acted in believable ways and answered questions to reveal just enough info to point you where to go next without outright telling you whats coming next. Kathy Rain the titular character is also great, which is good because there isn't a point in the game where she's not on screen, being the main character kinda does that. She's witty, funny, and has enough darkness and characters flaws that no one could get away with calling her a Mary Sue.\n\nI don't wanna say more because that might start entering spoiler territory, so let me tell you that I loved this game and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in a good story and quality voice acting.", "timestamp_created": 1521404188, "timestamp_updated": 1521500371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445103853940963745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40895262": {"recommendationid": "40895262", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987290797", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 848, "last_played": 1521371043}, "language": "english", "review": "I was not expecting this game to go in the direction it did and I was pleasantly surprised.

She displays her coolness by dismissing everything that might seem feminin. Like: \u201eReading women\u2018s magazines gives me headache.\u201c Because clearly being a woman, doing stuff that is associated with femininity is despicable. \n\nShe\u2018s proud on beeing \u201enot like most girls\u201c as if there really was somthing like \u201emost girls\u201c and if \u201emost girls\u201c would just not be cool. She is comlimented for this by men.\n\nReally harmful is how the game adresses sexism. Kathy solves a problem by calling her opponent sexist which is not the truth. As a result the opponent immediately excuses himself and gives Kathy the information she otherwise would not have gotten. Calling someone sexist without reason is displayed as a female superpower which opens doors straightaway.\n\nIn real life women are confronted with sexual behavior all the time and it is really hard to address this especially to the perpetrator himself. That would be a story worth telling. \n\nAlso annoying is the trope that women who had an abortion later are haunted by nightmares about their unborn child because of the guilt they feel.\n\nAlso: The evil antagonist seems gay by the way he talks and the eccentric way he dresses himself. A homophobic trope repeated again and again in media. As a player you can choose between the options to shame him for wearing make up or to tell him he\u2018s looking like he had escaped a circus.\n\nAnd why is it important, that Kathy got her guitar from a lesbian? The information is irrelevant for the plot. It is nice to have gay characters in media but we don\u2018t learn anything more about this person than her sexual orientation. It\u2018s added to the game to proof the edgy side of Kathy who has met a lesbian once. \n\nAlthough it is nice to have video games with female main characters, when they just repeat sexist stereotypes, it is better to not write them in the first place.", "timestamp_created": 1521287502, "timestamp_updated": 1521326356, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451120138168334961", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40869899": {"recommendationid": "40869899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008549198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 568, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1521375548}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice point & click adventure game\n\nPositive:\n+ Feels like playing an old point & click game\n+ Nice retro graphics\n+ Decent story and gameplay for a game from the '90s\n\nNegative:\n- It's apparently not a game from the '90s but a game from 2016.

One which Kathyhas fantastic memories, and moderately the only good ones, since her father disappeared, and her mother became mentally unstable.\nKathy grew, but she left her childhood in Conwell Springs, and now only nostalgia remains. She hasn't even heard of the tragic episode from 1981, when her grandfather had an accident... A strange circumstance, where Joseph became catatonic, one of many strange incidents occurring in such a small town, where missing reports are away over the charts.\n\n[b]Kathy Rain[/b] involves the player into a plot surrounding the events behind Joseph accident, and goes deep, deeper anyone would ever imagine, to a point of defying Kathy's own beliefs. Her investigation starts as merely a curiosity in hope to close the matter so her grandmother can have some rest, but clues all over town start to pop-up and our main protagonist can't ignore them.\nBeing a journalist is apparently in her blood since Joseph himself was conducting a private investigation regarding a very specific event, where three bright lights irradiate from the woods. Around them is a deep fog of questionable reports, events and a mist of frightening reactions. \nThe plot will take Kathy to uncover different locations, all related somehow to the story.\nLocations across Conwell Springs are simple, but camouflaged in a web of lies, such as the strange church aiming to deliver divine guidance, with an obvious tainted intent regarding its purest. Or even your typical police station holding an alien-believer homeless, and a deputy who's a childhood friend.\nUndisclosed matters are present everywhere, in particular with Lily Myers, a young girl who committed suicide, leaving behind secrets within her passion for painting. WMuch, much more mystery and secrets are present in this contemporary community. But on the outskirts of town, the enigmatic and obscure woods stand immaculate, with strange clues being held by a bald man dressed in red. Kathy has to discover the truth, not only about Conwell Springs, but about her as well. Her past decisions, are very much still alive within her.\n\n[b]Kathy Rain[/b] would benifit strongly with a resolution update, ther current one (320x240), is small, and considering how everyone plays in full-screen, the whole resolutions just ends stretched, making it feel wierd, although not unconforteble. This is probably due to the game being developed for mobile, or just poor-development decision.Resolutions aside, the game is fantastically well design with pixel art that will leave the old-school fans both impressive and nostalgic. [i]Clifftop Games[/i] made sure to fulfill every area with details not only to interact but to spoil the player, as we walk across a very distinct handful of areas resembling a small town in America. Pixel art is always a challenge to accomplish, when done correctly, that is, and since this is such a good case, I can easily stare at how nice even little objects look, such as computers, or phones, even at stretched resolution when playing in Fullscreen.\nMuch later in the story, one can easily see inspirations from Silent Hill, where the beautiful landscapes of American's heart become replaced with gears grinding memories, and saws going trough the flesh, seeking answers.\nThe characters are very distinct and well designed based on their personality, presented in a western style, losing quality only because (once again) of such resolution limitations.\n\nGameplay goes as simple as [i]Point & Click[/i] means, bringing back the classic, with style. Object interaction is made gracefully, with dialogues for at least 60% of the displayed objects on screen! Kathy can Think, Look and Interact with gadgets and people, giving a wide variety of opinions and hints regarding the specific event. Puzzles demand the player to be focused on the story, in particular names and dates. Everything that becomes relevant is noted in our notebook, such as questions and hints. As for objects, they are kept in a nice brown-backpack that resembles one used by a famous tomb raider! Kathy can combine objects, like tapes in a dictaphones, or showing a photograph to a specific character, hoping for more answers. We can move Kathy by clicking the desired position with our mouse, and we can freely explore every area, and once in a while, crack the traditional puzzles, which are very well constructed and smart, playing with words and numbers.\n\n[b]Kathy Rain[/b] audio works go behind your traditional indie game. The voices are done extremely professionally, with a dedicated director who made sure every single character sounds, and feels exactly as they need to. Each one suits the profile, from the accent, age, personality and even state of mind. It's a work of art, and probably the biggest factor that will attach players into the game for the very first hour.\u00a0\nWordplay comes into the show, with 90's references, sarcasm, smart humour, and even with interactions with the player, creating amusing moments!\nThe soundtrack becomes one with the game, for every mood, and situation. The soft, deep drums, the distant guitar notes, or the piano tracking each footstep creates the perfect atmosphere! The soundtrack is smooth and easily becomes pleasant, worthy of being listened outside the game! It's not for sale though, but it's included with the game, and nowadays, that's always a a pleasant surprise.\n\n[b]Kathy Rain[/b] is a fantastic adventure of a young woman, who fight her own inner demons while discovering what happened to her beloved grandfather. She has to save more than just herself, while dealing with her own problems.\u00a0Her lost relationship with her mother, her guilt for one less live in her life, all the anger towards her father... Everything becomes a whole, and once you fall into a [w]hole, everything becomes raw, true, transparent, except lucid. It's up to Kathy and the player to overcome everything, uncover the real facts, and becoming a detective!\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1520485677, "timestamp_updated": 1520621220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610434353351593018", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40642485": {"recommendationid": "40642485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009870718", "num_games_owned": 1366, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 789, "last_played": 1519883998}, "language": "english", "review": "After a short hiatus on gaming, I decided to start back by playing something that was short, not too texty and funny as well.

I caught a glimpse of piece of art featuring a leather-clad lady riding a mean chopper. My interest picked up when I realized she was the main character of a videogame, so obviously I went to the steam page and bought it preemptively.\n\nI\u2019m not accustomed to adventure games and I have little experience with point-and-click interactive media but not only did I have a soft spot for ladies operating mean-machines but I was in the mood for a relaxing mystery for a change. And you know what? I have no regrets!\n\nKathy Rain puts us into the literal tough leather boots of none other then Kathy Rain herself, a tenacious, sarcastic chain-smoking rebel drinking her way through college, rebounding wit and dry cracks off her bubbly Christian roommate until she is brought to a small town in the country following the sudden death of her grandfather. It doesn\u2019t take the player nor Kathy too long to realize something ain\u2019t all what it seems in the town nor were the circumstances of her grandfathers death anything but circumstantial.\n\nRight off the bat, I was sucked into the atmosphere of the game with it\u2019s slick art-style and quick-witted dialogue. I am normally jaded by quick-wit in media (anything by Joss Whedon comes to mind) but I simply fell in love with Kathy\u2019s cracks and observations. She\u2019s snide and a trouble-maker, but is observant, determined, knows when not to go too far and has a bit if a heart under her tough biker jacket. Other characters you meet are well-written and offer entertaining dialogue and confrontations between clashing personalities.\n\nOf course, it being a point-and-click adventure game, the environments you find yourself in will have to be searched for any means to continue Kathy\u2019s investigation and serve logic puzzles for the player to solve. I had a good time rummaging through the environment and getting those \u201cEUREKA\u201d moments as I cracked the codes and rummaged through my clues for the answer, and as someone who very rarely plays games like these, it\u2019s either a positive highlight or just an example of me being a newbie to such a genre.\n\nOf course, no game is perfect. There were a couple of moments where I gave up and rummaged for a (Thankfully spoiler free) walkthrough, judging from several comments, I feel many people got stuck on the Phone-call segment back in the Dorm-portion of the game. There are also a (admittedly) very small number of animation glitches that occurred during dialogue here and there but thankfully it did not detract from the overall experience. And while the voice-acting was pretty damn good and engaging for the most part, there are a handful of voices that clash with the mood and tone.\n\nAll and all, I greatly enjoyed my time with Kathy Rain and route it went. I\u2019m not accustomed to this genre, but I am seriously looking forward to whatever the creative team behind this cooks up next!\n\nI sincerely hope we get a Kathy Rain 2!", "timestamp_created": 1518159732, "timestamp_updated": 1523978480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39876977": {"recommendationid": "39876977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041636869", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 170, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 700, "last_played": 1517873175}, "language": "english", "review": "A point and click adventure where you play as Kathy Rain, a college student who goes home for the first time in a long time for the funeral of her grandfather.

The eponymous Kathy Rain is a punk sophomore in college for journalism when her plucky, polar-opposite roommate Eileen lets her know that her estranged grandfather had just died. When Kathy goes to the funeral and reconnects with part of her family she hadn\u2019t seen since she was a young child, she begins to follow the story of what, exactly, happened to not just her grandfather, but to a number of missing and insane people of the town.\n\nI don\u2019t want to spoil more of the story, because the way it\u2019s unraveled is really fun. The pixel art is gorgeous from the incredible backgrounds to the satisfying and fluid animated sprites. The writing is cool, and Kathy is able to be both at once annoying and likable, like a lot of college students can be. The voice acting in particular was great - it was produced by Dave Gilbert, of Wadjet Eye fame, and ol\u2019 Davie even made an appearance as a minor character.\n\nPoint-n-clicks are often criticized for really obtuse puzzles, and Kathy Rain avoids this in a wonderful way. The game is set in 1995, and the best, most satisfying, crunchiest bits of gameplay is just\u2026 acting like it\u2019s 1995 again. Using a phonebook, tapping in phone numbers, and dealing with an old timey-ass computer was just so fun for me, for some god damn reason.

I've seen a lot of people throwing Twin Peaks around as a comparison, and even though I've never seen that show, it seems like an appropriate point of reference. In any case, be warned - there is a lot more here than the marketing is letting on. \n\nAlso be warned: the plot ends without answering half of the (VERY) weird questions that it provokes. It gets wrapped up in its own metaphors in the last hour and becomes one of those \"MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS!!!\" kind of things, which I usually hate, but in this instance... I still felt oddly satisfied at the end of my 10 hours? I think it's because the writing is solid, the puzzles are mostly enjoyable (especially some clever ones involving a computer) and Kathy herself turns out to be a very endearing protagonist that I would like to see more of. \n\nSo, a tad rough around the edges, but if you're in the mood for a suspenseful adventure game and don't mind some ambiguity this is pretty good.

Atmosphere is good, a lot really captures that '90s feel. I however have a few (perhaps unconventional) quirks:\n\n1.) Controller support.\n   - Now I know, it's a point-and-click, but simply mapping ESC to start, cursor to a thumbstick, left-click to 'A', right-click to 'X' goes a long way.\n\n2.) Fixed aspect ratio\n   - I know a lot of people don't agree with this, but to have the option would be great to me. I use an HTPC on a 60 inch so cropped screens just don't work for me. I think games look just as great stretched to the edge of the screen. Hell, I used to record television to VHS tapes, a little quality downgrade wouldn't be all that bad. 'As long as it works', as they say.\n\n3.) Launching game in Direct Draw mode does not allow for achievements pop up window. They register sometimes but you have no idea they happened. \n   - Edit: They're still not registering in Direct3D mode. I don't know what's going on here.\n\n4.) Better walking animations\n   - Kathy looks too much like a cardbord cutout while walking.\n\n5.) A recap option. I have started the game up and quit quickly because I don't know where I'm at.\n\n6.)

Bueno, sigue leyendo y saldr\u00e1s de dudas en un momento:\n\nPodr\u00edamos decir que Kathy Rain es una aventura gr\u00e1fica notable, con grandes particularidades que en cierto modo la hacen \u00fanica en ciertos aspectos. No hablo por hablar, he encontrado puzles bastantes originales que no hab\u00eda encontrado en otras aventuras graficas, y he jugado a cientos de ellas.\n\nLo primero que debes saber es que este juego tiene toda la esencia de los cl\u00e1sicos de los a\u00f1os 90, y muy particularmente a mi me record\u00f3 a dos t\u00edtulos imprescindibles: Laura Bow y la Daga de Amon Ra, y Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father. No es debido a que el argumento sea similar a estos juegos, sino por la esencia de los mismos. \n\nPor un lado me record\u00f3 a Laura Bow por el papel de investigadora de la protagonista, recabando pruebas e investigando su entorno mientras todo se volv\u00eda m\u00e1s enrevesado a cada paso que daba. La fuerte personalidad de la protagonista y su modo de afrontar los acontecimientos es algo a destacar como muy positivo.\n\nPor otro lado, me record\u00f3 a Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father por ese halo de misterio que embarga la aventura desde el primer momento. Misterio que te llevar\u00e1 de la mano y no te soltar\u00e1 hasta que no veas los cr\u00e9ditos finales. Sin duda, eso no es f\u00e1cil de lograr, y Kathy Rain lo consigue con una aparente facilidad y naturalidad encantadora.\n\nSi eres fan de este tipo de aventuras, Kathy Rain te encantar\u00e1. Eso seguro. Tanto los personajes, como las situaciones que va viviendo la protagonista, el argumento que va deshilach\u00e1ndose de su madeja de misterio, o los maravillosos gr\u00e1ficos estilo pixel art, son un aut\u00e9ntico canto y tributo a la \u00e9poca dorada de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas.\n\nPorque lo mejor de todo es que no tienes la sensaci\u00f3n de estar jugando a una aventura de 2016 que tiene aspecto gr\u00e1fico de los 90. La sensaci\u00f3n que tienes es que est\u00e1s jugando a una gran aventura gr\u00e1fica de los 90. Punto.\n\nNo quiero contarte demasiado sobre el argumento para que lo disfrutes como se merece. Tan solo mencionar que la aventura se sit\u00faa en los a\u00f1os 90 y que tomar\u00e1s el papel de Kathy Rain, una estudiante universitaria de periodismo de 2\u00ba curso, que marcha a un pueblo perdido de EEUU para asistir al funeral de su abuelo, el cual a partir de un momento determinado sufri\u00f3 un ataque que lo dej\u00f3 en estado casi vegetativo al volver de un paseo por los bosques que rodeaban la zona. A partir de ah\u00ed, nuestra protagonista comenzar\u00e1 a investigar qu\u00e9 sucedi\u00f3, y para ello deber\u00e1 remover el pasado de su abuelo, y el suyo propio.\n\nEl juego solo cuenta con un peque\u00f1o inconveniente, y es que no est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol a d\u00eda de realizar este an\u00e1lisis, pero seg\u00fan parece saldr\u00e1 una traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol antes de acabar el a\u00f1o. As\u00ed que si no eres una persona con demasiado nivel de ingl\u00e9s, pronto podr\u00e1s disfrutar de esta gran aventura en nuestro idioma y ya no habr\u00e1 ning\u00fan impedimento.\n\nComo tal el nivel de ingl\u00e9s no es para nada complejo, pero s\u00ed hay ciertos puzles directamente relacionados con el idioma. As\u00ed que si no controlas esta lengua, s\u00ed que podr\u00e1s encontrar algunas dificultades a la hora de resolverlos.\n\nY hablando de puzles, decir que el juego no es para nada dif\u00edcil, no presenta de manera general puzles enrevesados o il\u00f3gicos, y si habitualmente juegas aventuras gr\u00e1ficas, pr\u00e1cticamente ir\u00e1s avanzando por la historia sin mayores dificultades. Aunque si es cierto que en determinados momentos hay puzles de encontrar c\u00f3digos o similares que pueden presentar un reto bastante significativo. Lo cual es muy bueno, y adem\u00e1s son bastante imaginativos.\n\nOtra de las cosas que me ha impresionado, ha sido su doblaje. Es realmente bueno. Las voces son de una gran calidad y encajan perfectamente con todos y cada uno de los personajes. En este aspecto, el juego es de diez.\n\nLa m\u00fasica por otra parte, es bastante agradable, y se ajusta perfectamente a cada situaci\u00f3n. Aunque no es algo que recordar\u00e1s en el tiempo, cumple con gran soltura su papel.\n\nParticularmente me ha parecido una gran experiencia, y no solo dir\u00eda que \"ha nacido una nueva detective\" como reza el t\u00edtulo, sino que ha nacido una empresa desarrolladora que sabe hacer su trabajo y ha captado a la perfecci\u00f3n c\u00f3mo deben ser las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas y el camino que debe seguirse para ofrecer t\u00edtulos con gran calidad. Un diez para ellos por el trabajo realizado.\n\nPues con esto finaliza este analisis, espero que despu\u00e9s de haberte le\u00eddo est\u00e1s l\u00edneas tengas claro si este t\u00edtulo es o no es lo que estabas buscando. :)", "timestamp_created": 1512734088, "timestamp_updated": 1545169188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703069746494293213", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38112169": {"recommendationid": "38112169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040467880", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1512482875}, "language": "english", "review": "Picked it up as part of a bundle.

The game is very well produced: the voice acting and dialogue stand out in particular, which really helps the player connect with the main character. It really has the look and feel of a mid-nineties product, which I imagine is what the developers intend.\n\nThe puzzles are fun - they never feel arbitrary and all the solutions obey the game's internal logic so there's always a good sense of reward on completion. However, for a seasoned veteran of old-school adventure games, they never really get too far into headscratcher territory, and some of them seem a little too easy. Sometimes this is because the character will drop hints during her narration. This does stop the puzzles from being unduly frustrating, but it does also mean you will solve them a lot quicker than you otherwise might. Part of the fun of the old classics were the gordion knots you had to unpick over a few days (or weeks). There aren't really any complex puzzle chains of the sort you'd find in Lucasarts classics either.\n\nThis does keep the story moving though, and here the game is fairly strong too. Without giving away any spoilers, Kathy Rain keeps just on the right side of cliche and touches some very adult themes.

Do you remember how, after Lost became the new hot thing on TV, a lot of shows sorta tried copying its thing of seven-layered mysteries the audience was supposed to try to figure out, but it was all smoke and mirrors to hide the fact that the writers and producers themselves were lost (pun not intended) on what their show was about? Hell, do you remember watching Lost's finale and figuring out its producers and writers didn't figure out what their show should be about?

I appreciate the nostalgia, as I was a teenager in 1995 (when the game is set) and I played a lot of games back then that employed the same pixelated style Kathy Rain does. I love a good point and click as well, and this game did entertain me. However, I felt that much like Oxenfree, Kathy Rain leads up to a conclusion that's just not much of a conclusion. \n\nFor example, I spent the entire game very suspicious of Kathy's grandparents. Her grandmother just seemed too sweet, and at one point you hear a phone message from Kathy's mom about how they're sick people and they need to stay away. Maybe, I thought, that indicated a second story taking place underneath the more obvious narrative, Maybe we would glean something from Kathy's mother, or find a clue that would alert us to the fact that something shady was going on. Indeed in the last act when she meets her grandfather in her hallucination, the picture of him on the wall keeps turning to a corpse's grinning face. \n\nBut no. Everything is exactly as it seems, and things like Kathy being pissed at her dad and forced to commit her mom are just there to appear for like half a second in the final act. Also the pixelated nature of the game, while charming, does make certain scenes that are meant to be poignant or horrifying seem comical. I mean, can you really take a hanging seriously when it's in pixels? How about an aborted child holding DNC equipment to his neck? Some characters you've come to care for never appear again after a certain point, either. Where the hell is Sue, in the last couple of chapters? I had come to care about her, and yet I never saw her again for no discernable reason. \n\nAlso, the puzzles are at once too restrictive, and too difficult. There is a point in one of the chapters where you have to get a washed up bum to act out a scene for the nurse on duty at the local clinic. You're then supposed to come up behind him and shock him with the taser, so you can pass it off as a seizure and get the nurse to leave her post. Who the hell thinks of doing something like that? Not me, apparently, since I had to go for a guide over that one. The easier puzzles sometimes have a lot of hand holding (Kathy can't ask about or show certain things at many points in the story) and yet the difficult ones have almost none. \n\nThat said I think the voice acting was generally good, though the grandmother does approach chewing scenery once or twice. It's fun and it did draw me in for the duration.

It's not necessarily about the characters' different personalities, but more about the way in which the player can choose their dialogue. If I want Rosa to be sassy, I can make her say sassy things. If I want her to be mean, I can make her say mean things. If I want her to be kind, I can do that too: Rosa is a more more well-rounded character. Kathy felt more flat in comparison. \nKathy can be unnecessary brutal towards people. Sometimes you can choose between being nice and being savage, however, there are many times that you'll get a dialogue \"choice\", but all the choices are the same. (For example: when [spoiler]Lenny asks Kathy out[/spoiler], not only does the player not have the option to accept, but all of Kathy's rejections are mean as well.) Why do I have to be mean all the time? I wanna be able to choose which characters to be mean to according to my likes and dislikes. Having the ability to choose makes me feel more connected to the player character.\n\nI'm not saying I wanted more choice-and-consequence or a branching narrative in conjunction with my choices. Going back to the Blackwell series: none of Rosa's answers in those situations will change the way NPCs behave towards the player character. But they did change how I felt towards Rosa, made me feel closer to her. These choices are not about furthering the narrative, but about conveying different emotions.\n\nLook, I don't know how to end this rant. I literally just finished the game half an hour ago. I'll have to think about it a bit more and come back to this.\nSuffice it to say: I liked the game, but I wish it were a bit... more. Maybe in the next installment. eh?\n\n\nOther thoughts: \n- The visuals are stunning. Clearly the best part about this game.\n- The voice acting is pretty good; however, some VAs clearly have not had a lot of training/experience when it comes to unnecessary mouth noises (lip smacking and such), which I found pretty distracting. Especially when it comes to the priest, cause he talks a lot, and I don't need to hear his saliva, thank you very much.\n- Sometimes has a case of the Adventure Game Logic when it comes to puzzles.

The comparisons to Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father are unavoidable, and both excel at different aspects. \n\nOverall, the characters are better and the story is much more \u201chuman\u201d. The \u201cmystery\u201d and supernatural elements aren\u2019t quite as good, though; GK was about Voodoo and had lots of freaky, unnerving experiences (the nightmares, the symbolism, the professor incident, the man outside the window, the burial wheel, etc.). KR\u2019s supernatural elements are a peculiar blend of Christianity and Paganism, and the antagonists are comparatively drab. The more human dramatics are much more compelling, though, and that's where KR excels. \n\nExcluding the antagonists (Malia and Tetelo are more interesting antagonists than their KR counterparts), every other character is on par or more interesting. Gabriel Knight is a standard hero plus witty and lascivious plus Southern accent, but not much else, while Kathy Rain is similarly witty and fun, but also deeply wounded in real ways. E is comparable to Grace in being the research assistant, but Grace is too much of a Mary Sue. KR\u2019s grandmother is more emotionally complex as well, where as GK\u2019s grandmother was solely generic sweetness tinged with sadness.  \n\nStrangely, there don\u2019t appear to be any failures. Far as I can tell, it\u2019s impossible to die or progress in a way that makes the game unwinnable (for better or worse). The worst that can happen is that you might be temporarily stalled before figuring something out, which only seems possible if completely not paying attention. This isn't overtly obvious until the end, but it does take some tension out of the game. A few times I tried to induce a failure condition only to find Kathy wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\nLike any similar games, there\u2019s going to be a few puzzles that are absolute fuckery. This game has two; the audio editing portion and the safe/mausoleum. Both are doable, but tedious enough to ruin the flow of the story; might as well look up the walkthrough for just those two incidents and you won\u2019t lose anything. The rest of the time, Kathy is dropping almost too many hints; makes for a shorter game experience, and the occasional feeling of the game just telling you what to do. \n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1506309691, "timestamp_updated": 1506309691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35175632": {"recommendationid": "35175632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161107554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1506244992}, "language": "english", "review": "The game play was so simplistic but the story line and the puzzles made it a challenge.

What follows is the typical point & click process of investigating locations, talking to everyone, picking up items, and solving puzzles. What sets Kathy Rain apart is the pretty pixel art, interesting story, solid writing, good voice acting, and intelligent puzzles that naturally lead into the next.\n\nThe pixel art is very well done, particularly given the AGS engine's 320x240 resolution. My favorite part, and a very pleasant surprise, is that the far more detailed character portraits change to reflect the people's emotions. Characters will smile, or smirk, or frown, or roll their eyes during conversations, and it really serves to bring already detailed characters to life. The good voice acting helps a lot with that as well.\n\nThe story was slow to get started, but interesting, and had me guessing as to where it was going and what was going to happen next. The characters were likewise interesting. The protagonist, Kathy Rain, was particularly enjoyable to play as, with tons of personality - I loved her comments, observations, and dialog choices. The writing was good, and ranged competantly from funny to sad. This is one of the few games that made me laugh, and I laughed often due to the sharp and witty writing.\n\nThe puzzles are logical, and well connected, such that the solution to one puzzle intelligently leads you to the next. The game helps keep you on track with notes / conversation topics in your notebook, and by keeping the inventory largely limited to useful items and greying out locations that you are finished with. There's no pixel hunting due to being able to highlight objects of interest, and there's a clever \"Think about\" function that serves to both provide backstory and hints as to what the item might be used for. The puzzles are pleasantly on the easy side, though there is a noticeble difficulty spike about 75% of the way through.\n\nI did get stuck three times, about 75-80% of the way through where the difficulty spiked. One code puzzle I just needed a hint for, one I missed that an object had a gained new interaction ability that it didn't previously have, and the third was a poem / riddle that were so vague as to leave me completely stumped and reaching for a walkthrough.\n\nI also encountered some initial technical issues due to the AGS engine. It failed to start when set to automatic resolution as it tried a resolution that was way too big. When manually setting the resolution, fullscreen would stretch the game out even though I had black bars enabled in the launcher.

The graphics were effective within their artificially dated limitations - although rather nostalgic some people might well question the overall design aesthetic.\n\nThat said though - there was plenty of nice voice acting with dialogue options to explore for the full story, as well as plenty of secrets and extra achievements throughout the game to pad it out somewhat.

Jung[/b]\n\nAs Clifftop Games' first project, [i]Kathy Rains[/i] is an intriguing work, which carries much promise for a future series, with invaluable psychoanalytical depth. When I picked this game, two things shined out as brilliant references: the 90s atmosphere displayed with the same engine used in [i]Blackwell[/i] series - another masterpiece of the adventure genre - and Dave Gilbert's name on voice direction department for the game, the creator of Rosa Blackwell himself. So it would be fair to assume Kathy would be an unexpected successor for Rosa. After I've completed the game, I sensed a completely different direction, yet I am much pleased with the outcome anyhow. Where [i]Blackwell[/i] was paranormal, [i]Kathy Rain[/i] could be described as psychoanalytical. Here, paranormal is a cosmetic layer rather than being context specific.\n\nKathy is a rebellious, snarky biker girl and an aspiring journalist major with a truckload of traumas, mainly concerning her family. Her good girl dorm mate Eileen brings into her attention that a certain \"Joseph Rain\" just passed away and whether he may be related to Kathy or not. He sure was - no other than Kathy's grandfather to be precise. Taking the news, Kathy takes off to attend the funeral, which opens a gate to her troubled past at the same time. As she investigates the recent demise and prior ailment of her grandfather which left him confided to a wheelchair, Kathy comes in contact with an uncanny mystery engulfing each and every corner of the silent, sleepy town of Conwell.\n\nThe storyline begins as an interesting enough detective mystery, yet quickly deviates from that context to take a seemingly supernatural path. Yet, under the layer of the supernatural, the game is - in my humble opinion - is a brilliant example for a psychoanalytical concept: the self and the shadow. According to Jungian psychology, every person bears an archetypal unconscious aspect that would be instinctual, illogical and wrapped in darkness; a mirroring opposite to our light, our self and the consciousness. This part is completely speculative on my behalf, and may contain spoilers, so feel free to skip to the next paragraph. [spoiler]Kathy's journey and her experiences throughout the game, are majorly symbolic acts of self-confrontation. The fictional red scythe flowers serve as hallucinogens which may be used for many psychedelic experiences of transcendence or self-discovery journeys - which explains most of Kathy's \"supernatural\" experiences. Thus, her main antagonist is herself all along, and all other figures are the ones that try to take similar journeys like her, yet failing to make peace with their own shadows. The antagonistic \"Crimson One\" is the personification for the hallucinogen flower itself. We already know that both Kathy's parents were somewhat into the consumption of the same drug also. Other characters involved, and their experiences may be explained in a similar manner. Yet, these are all my own speculations and interpretations. In the end, Kathy faces all her demons - her father's departure, her mother's insanity and her guilt driven from committing her into an asylum, the abortion, even not being able to be a part of her grandfather's life - and prevails. Thus, she leaves the hole and destroys the source of these symbolic drugs, preventing anyone who wouldn't be willful enough to face their own demons coming into harm.[/spoiler]\n\nKathy surely is not the most interesting of protagonists as we start, but as the game progresses, the storyline delivers. There are layers under her seemingly embittered and sarcastic personality, which makes her a realistic, even relatable character. Her relationship with Eileen is especially admirable, since she tries to protect her as if she is trying to protect her own extracted innocence. I regret that other characters were not as fleshed out as I would like, but they all serve their purpose within the plot.\n\nWe are familiar with the AGS engine already, and it is spectacular to see that the pixelated texture can present such admirable environment artwork and character designs. The game world itself was somewhat limited and the game time was short here, yet it is a great demonstration for the capabilities of the developer team. Voice acting, is really wondrous, with sincere emotions and character appropriate toning too, but since Dave Gilbert himself was responsible of that department, no less could be expected.\n\nThe gameplay? Well, it does not contain the most brilliant of puzzles, and sure has its logical impossibilities - like a scanner capable of copying sound files from cassette tapes, during 90s nonetheless - but I'd say it is quite alright as a whole. If you listen to the narrative itself and remarks made by characters all around, I'd say that you wouldn't have a hard time overall. It would probably take no longer than 5 hours or so to go through a complete playthrough, 6 if you'd go back for the achievements you've missed.\n\nAt the end of the day, sure, I'd recommend Kathy Rain but I'd also advise to take a %50 discount. The game is lovely, but it doesn't contain any replay value and quite short of an experience for the full price. I sincerely hope that we'd see a new adventure from Kathy in the future, which may explain various plot details that never see the light of day in this one.

Its wittiness, style, humor, main characters, dialogues and pacing is exemplary and make Kathy Rain a good game, while the overall story, puzzles and side characters and cliffhanger / episodic nature have a lot of problems, which drags the game down a bit.\n \nIt all starts with a mystery, when Kathy Rain, a likeably cynical, suspicious young woman that is difficult to connect with others, goes back to her small hometown to witness the burial of her grandfather, who was paralyzed and died under strange circumstances. Kathy decides to put a fedora on and pursue her own investigation into what happened with her grandfather and the hidden history of her hometown.\n\nMade in AGS engine, pixel graphics are highly detailed and made with a lot of care that you\u2019ll regularly stop to enjoy the scenery. It does have a widescreen support, but due to the age of AGS engine, it looks unnaturally stretched out, which might irk some players. The animations are basic; they definitely don\u2019t have the same amount of details as the graphical presentation does. Kathy and her trusty sidekick, Elaine are well-developed and unique characters, both narratively and visually. Kathy is of course the star of the show, with a lot of character layers and quirks, as well as buried secrets that are both the source of her strength and weakness. Kathy\u2019s family that plays a prominent role in the story is also made of likeable individuals with their own traits and shortcomings. And last but not the least: Goober is such a great character that he deserves his own spin-off adventure game. Developers, make it happen :) The banter between these characters is a joy to listen/read and the voice acting is for the most part amazing, with special mentions going to actors of Kathy and Goober. Did I mention we need a Goober adventure game already :D The game is short and holds attentions throughout the entire playthrough and it will take you about 4-6 hours to complete it. And it is another reason to make a Goober adventure!\n\nOn the other side, Kathy Rain\u2019s biggest drawback is the lackluster story that builds up until the last 30 minutes and then it ends without answering most of the questions you\u2019ll have during Kathy\u2019s investigation. The supernatural aspect and its lore is not compelling and well-introduced enough to be interesting, and the story just abruptly deflates without any meaningful payoff. If you look at the whole thing metaphorically, you could say that the story is simple and complete, but if you are like me, and you chase for the \u201cthe devil lies in the details\u201d aspect, you\u2019ll find the screenplay is just not good enough and self-contained, especially since this was not meant to be an episodic experience that can allow to cut its story to little pieces for future instalments. I am sure an adventure with Goober would solve all this issues, though. Except the first, mausoleum and the last puzzle that are excellent, all other puzzles are quite basic and aren\u2019t fun, especially the hacker puzzle :( but this is not a huge minus since even adventure game legends suffer from this. Let\u2019s make that Goober game already!!\n\nAs a game made by a single developer, Kathy Rain turned out to be a good and fun adventure and dev deserves congratulations for it. Some shortcomings with its story prevent Kathy Rain to be a memorable game, but there is a lot of potential for improvement and greatness, if the dev decides to make Kathy Rain 2. But \u201cGoober\u2019s Hollywood exploits\u201d adventure game must come first, naturally :) :) :)", "timestamp_created": 1500026268, "timestamp_updated": 1500026268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526375293731689453", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33473230": {"recommendationid": "33473230", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970818404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1499804339}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little adventure game.

At the same time, the third season of Twin Peaks is on and I have suffered some withdrawal symptoms waiting for new episodes. So, a game that combines elements from Lynchian mysteries and classic point-and-click games seemed like a gift from heavens and I definitely wasn't disappointed. This is one of the best written small games I remember playing and that's saying a lot, because I'm a huge consumer of this genre. The voice cast is great, pixel graphics are beautiful and there's just enough music to create the right kind of atmosphere to each scene. If you are used to playing the earlier LucasArts games you might find the puzzles in this game to be relatively easy, but I was positively suprised to find that finally someone might have found a good balance between annoyingly straightforward puzzles (newer Telltale Games...) and stumpers that almost force rookies to google for some hints. In my opinion, even extremely story-driven games should provide at least some challenge.\n\nOnly some very minor things to whine about like annoyingly slow walking animations (that you have to watch every single time you arrive or leave a location!) and some pointless loose ends in the narrative.

And when it is, you feel so connected to Kathy it hurts to leave. Because, in addition to being a highly-likeable, witty, rebellious character packed with some charming and cunning foul language, she has some deep background and progresses as a person enormously along the storyline.\n\nAnother point this game nailed is the riddles: they are diverse, they make you think and leave you with a comfy satisfying feeling once solved, and, on top of it, all of them ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE. During the playthrough I could barely even once feel the irritation of being lost or unaware of what to do or where to go at that point.\n\nThere is one detail about the plot I feel uncertain of though. It is the fair portion of supernatural being involved into a seemingly-at-first detective story. The further you're in, the more plot swerves off into some eerie and fairly grim as-s s-hit (the darkest moments even reminded me of The Cat Lady, despite the two games being stylistically light years apart).\nAs long as it contributes to the intrigue, it's not a bad thing per se, but the lack of explanation leaves a mild taste of incompleteness, which, however, fails to spoil the overall satisfaction.

Calling this game \"A Detective is Born\" does not do it justice.\n\nFor those who grew up loving LucasArts and those who enjoy the games of WadjetEye, this is a no brainer. I marvel at how refined pixel games are starting to look. When the game goes for pretty....it's really nice. When it wants to be creepy...it is possibly the most disturbing thing I have every seen...and I thought The Last Door was creepy. The game plays as a standard point and click, with easy controls. The soundtrack is very fitting to the game.\n\nKathy is a strong, irreverant, foul-mouthed, bitter young 20 something year old, and I love her to death. I have seen other anti-heroes who have bad attitutes for the sake of the game, and I HATE that; but Kathy has good reason for being the way she is. Life has happened to her, and it hasn't always been kind. In fact it never really has. Kathy feels like a real person, thanks to the incredible vocal performance. She can be funny, tough as nails, and genuinely concerned. She grows TREMENDOUSLY through the game. I don't want to tell how because of major story spoilers. She is just a well written character who, along with how great the game looks, make this game work.\n\nKathy is surrounded by some great side characters who give good performances. All round, I really liked the voice acting and the script. Apart from the sci-fi/religion conspiracy gamey plot, the personal relationships between the people of this game felt very genuine. The family drama in this game had me in tears, since it can be extremely relatable. \n\nThis is no point and click for the kiddos, or even the teens for that matter. This game deals in some very serious subject matter: teen suicide, teen abortion, abandonment, and being ostracized from loving familly members. The consequences of these choices are fleshed out, and at times it was hard to sit through. The language is extremely colorful. Kathy has got a mouth on her (lot of f-bombs), but what bothered me was the c**t bomb. That I felt was the writers wanting to be edgy so they gave a bad acting NPC a line with that word. It was only a moment, but it was a moment wasted trying to be edgy, and it stuck with me long enough that I felt I had to write about, so there.\n\nOverall, this game was very enjoyable, in a reflective kind of way. To call it a detective story to me doesn't do it justice. It's more of a \"solve a family mystery that is affecting the whole town while dealing with personal demons\" kind of game.

The heroine is likeable enough for player-identification, but has enough of a personality to be memorable on her own, a balance many games fail to strike.  Voice actors range from decent to very good.  The comic relief homeless guy is annoying and overdrawn, but he is the exception that proves the rule of a sympathetic and believable cast.\n\nOne nice feature is the game's tendency to clean up after itself.  Once an inventory item or conversation topic has been exhausted, it often disappears.  Some clutter persists to the end game, but it could have been much worse.\n\nGame is about 8 hours, which ran a little long for my taste.

Turns out it was her grandpa. She goes to the funeral and talks with her grandma. She learns that her grandpa was in vegetative state since an accident in 1981 (game's current year is 1995), but something was odd: medical exams showed his brain was totally fine, despite his symptoms of brain damage. Then the game actually starts: Kathy wants to discover what actually happened to her grandpa.\n\nKathy begins as your standard misfit that smokes, drinks and drives an older-than-her bike that looks like she's part of a biker gang. As the game develops, you see her kind and worried side.\n\nGame mechanics:\nIt's a pretty standard point and click. You have a bag with items, a notebook with \"things you want to talk about with people\" and a list of contacts whom you can call to. You can combine items (like a tape and a tape recorder/player to listen to it, or your cigarete with your lighter to smoke), as well as use items on objects (key on door).\n\nReview:\nPros:\n- It touches some heavy subjects, like a teenager aborting, suicides, kathy's parents (you'll get it) and some other dark sh*t\n- The game hasn't an autoplay mode, meaning you either think about the clues you have until now and do what you have to do or just try everything (which would be exhaustive, don't). Some point & click have too many clues that make the game being all about \"Click this place. Now click this. Now this.\"\n- The mystery goes really far and touches religious subjects. I'm a fan of these approachs.\n- The MC is actually charismatic and has many fun dialogues and rude answers, including to priests and the sheriff. Oh and she carries a taser.\n\nCons:\n- In a lazy gameplay, I ended the story in 7 hours. That means most of the story and character development is actually made in your mind, not by the game itself. The touches in heavy subjects are mostly shallow due this lack of time.\n- Even though it doesn't have clues every freaking moment, the puzzles are pretty easy and the course of actions is rather obvious most of the time. \n- Again, the 7h gameplay doesn't let the game have a great character development. Although you see Kathy growing as the game moves and see her sides, it's too fast.\n- (SPOILER OF ONE \"PUZZLE\") You put a TAPE on a SCANNER to get the audio sound into your computer.

Don't try finding a challenging puzzle-investigative game nor a master piece character development. It's a casual point and click game to spend time. It's worth it with at least 33% off, imo.

The graphics, sound, music and voice acting are all top notch. The animation is a bit clunky at times, but that's really just a very minor observation. \n\nThe story progresses nicely, and while the game holds your hand a little bit through the puzzles, I think the developers have walked the line pretty well here in keeping things intuitive and letting you know when you're on the right track. \n\nOne thing the game really nails is tone. I was drawn in from the very beginning and really got a feel for the setting of game and the people who inhabit it. I actually cared about the characters, and they really all did seem quite fleshed out, from the protagonist Kathy to her roommate Eileen, Goober the homeles man and even Hacker Dave, who's only spoken to on the phone. \n\nPossible spoilers (really just about the feel of the game):\nSome people have complained in reviews that the game takes a turn and devolves into \"magic/supersition/supernatural\" themes, but really the story can be read however you want to read it. The game deals with serious themes from mental illness to drug use and suicide, and any allusions to the supernatural could easily be read as forming some allegory to traumatic struggles in life. \n\nOverall, this is a great adventure game with strong writing and a real Twin Peaks / Stranger Things / 90s nostalgia vibe. It's pretty short, and can be finished in under 5 hours, but I got it for $4 on sale and it was certainly worth all of that. \n\n7.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1498920262, "timestamp_updated": 1498920262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487540245056152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33081969": {"recommendationid": "33081969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124777326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1498912153}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent point and click game that feels straight out of the 90's.

We play as Kathy Rain, a slightly stereotypical biker with an attitude and no-nonsense personality, who must figure out the event that unfolded up to her grandfather's death. The puzzles range in difficulty, from pretty easy to slightly out-of-the-box. I wouldn't say any puzzle is especially difficult, but I did find myself stumped for a little while on two or three of them. One puzzle, which should have been easy, was difficult because I didn't pick up the required item earlier in the game... which then lead me to visit every location and try clicking on everything until I found the necessary item (this was a bit tedious). Overall, puzzles aren't difficult. As for the story: it begins reasonable enough but, in my personal opinion, goes off in a direction that I wasn't expecting and (honestly) I wasn't that impressed with. I won't spoil anything, but I imagine the story will be amazing to half the audience and will land flat to the other half. Unfortunately, it felt like the latter to me.

I don't usually write reviews, so this could be a little janky, but bear with me 'cause I think this is worthwhile to say.\n\n--Characters and World\n\nThis game shines in characterbuilding. Not a single person (except one who is meant to be) feels out of place or annoying to encounter, and Kathy as a character both suits the position she's found herself in and has a personality you immediately recognize (Jerk with a Heart of Gold). She makes for an excellent protagonist, equally intelligent and witty with a personality that not only shows through her dialogue, but also through the solutions to some of the more impromptu puzzles you face. Rarely does she overstep believable bounds, and even the clues she gives you about objects you find do not come off as patronizing.\n\nIn other words, the voice acting and writing is spot-on, just as it needs to be for a story-driven point'n'click puzzler.\n\nNot much needs to be said about the world, as it is for all intents and purposes semi-rural America, before cellphones were invented. Nothing noteworthy is changed, a few things are added (related to the plot), but otherwise it is entirely vanilla and well-represented. \n\n--Puzzles and Difficulty\n\nDifficulty curve is notoriously hard to judge when it comes to puzzles, and often one individual will find some easier than others regardless of the intent. Despite that, Kathy Rain seems to have taken that a step further with puzzles that are far easier than the one that came before it found late in the game, and the hardest puzzles taking place in the second few hours. Thankfully, Kathy herself will at least let you know if you are on the right track with the harder puzzles, and stays silent when her suggestions aren't solicited. Most solutions (all but one, if I recall correctly) use a 'the easiest answer is the correct answer' policy, and (again, all but one) operate within the bounds of logic- even when reaching an area of the game where logic seems to have no meaning.\n\nPuzzles can invariably be solved just by using the mouse- there is no keyboard usage save for where it makes obvious sense to do so (such as when typing), and even that is extremely rare. If you can't click it, you don't need to worry about it. There is no 'hunt the pixel' gameplay, either- all the items you interact with are well-lampshaded and easy to see, to the point where some of them might as well be draped in neon lights.\n\nOverall, I found Kathy Rain very easy to get through, only having to consult a walkthrough once when I was missing a crucial item. Long-standing lovers of point and clicks will find this a walk in the park, whereas newcomers (are there any?) will find it a wading pool for the harder stuff. Most of these puzzles are character-driven as well, stemming from dialogue choices and showing the personalities and natures of those around Kathy (as well as Kathy herself), making them an integral part of the game rather than 'solve the soup can'-style pointlessness.\n\n---Story and Pacing (no spoilers)\n\nThis is the one point where Kathy Rain falls a little short, and it isn't for lack of trying. The story begins excellently and at a medium burn, with the catalyst to adventure occuring soon after you start and with little backstory off the bat. Most of the backstory, in fact, is discovered over the course of the game with notes, dialogue and recorded messages, all of which (save one) is inevitably used in one way or another.\n\nThis persists throughout the game's middle in a way that never reaches a white-knuckle grip, but rather a leisurely jog with occasional rests that involve quick humor and fun characters (Goober, I'm looking at you). While there are the occasional twists, they never feel particularly jarring because of the slow speed with which you reach them, lessening their impact and dulling the edge- an edge that I think Kathy Rain sorely needed. Despite that, said twists and developments do grant a desire to keep playing, to remedy the events that go wrong and to wrap up the story. Players are pushed on, also, through small snippets of Kathy's past that she isn't particularly open about, but these have less of an effect both because of the ending and the way they are delivered.\n\nAs for the ending, this is where Kathy Rain loses much of its characters and world, instead making it solely about Kathy as a person- and unfortunately proving that she cannot stand on her own as an interesting protagonist. Kathy is at her best when interacting with others, but this last stretch involved only her and her own feelings amidst puzzles that are mostly 'placed' rather than 'organic', and without any of the witty dialogue or charm you find in earlier parts of the game (with a couple notable exceptions). The ending comes and goes, and it left me with a 'well, that happened' feeling that can only be described as mediocre- a sad thing for a game that had me interested and invested up until that point. Despite that, I can say that the more personal details of Kathy's choices earlier in life are handled well and intelligently (at least, on my playthrough. A different dialogue choice may yield a different result), without insulting individuals who have chosen to do the same in her place.\n\n---End result\n\nFor a game with a new protagonist never seen before? Not half bad. Not half bad at all. For a point and clicker? Pretty frickin' decent. Is it worth fifteen bucks? That's harder to say. It is a short game, and depending on how quickly you burn through the puzzles at hand you may feel like you did not get your money's worth- especially considering the easy difficulty at hand. So since the puzzles are largely simple, lets judge it on characters and story alone. Would I hand Kathy and E fifteen bucks again, to help fund another investigation?\n\nFuck yeah, I would.", "timestamp_created": 1496170715, "timestamp_updated": 1496170715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878110766410827637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32018705": {"recommendationid": "32018705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229715796", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1495974072}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Story and Dialogues...

There is absolutely no comparison. \n\nI love adventure games. My father got me hooked on them when I was little....I remember as a kid I would help him (or try to) solve the old sierra games. I feel like a veteran in this genre...with that being said..........\n\n Kathy Rain does not live up to my personal standards of what I believe an adventure game should be. Its not terrible......but its not good either. Those that have different standards than me will obviously disagree.\n\nOne of the main problems is the story and lets be honest, thats what makes or breaks an adventure game. The story feels forced.....like the writers raped the story into this game. As the story progressed I found myself becoming more disappointed than excited. It is supposed to be set in the 90's and other than the story telling me it was 1995. I didn't feel any connection to that decade whatsoever. The protagonist, Kathy Rain, is a cardboard cut out of the classic 90's rebellious edgy teen with a bleeding heart. Kathy didn't feel like a real character but more of a stereotype of what some idiot writer had in mind for the story. \n\nThe story starts off with Kathy coming into her dorm drunk and wanting to sleep it off.  Then Emily, her little stereotypical Christian roommate, tells her she has been doing research on Kathy's hometown because..the writers needed the story to advance and tells her she found out that a man, Joseph Rain had died recently. This is her grandfather and despite being gone for 15 years she decides to attend the funeral and start doing investigations......because the writers needed the story to advance. The games handles story progression this way.... ALL......THE..... FUCK**G..... TIME.....\n\nThe puzzles are even worse than the story.....If you are looking for challenging puzzles....Try grabbing a brick and smashing it to your head about 5 times before you play this game. The swelling of your brain might make them more difficult to solve. \n\nAll of the characters in this game are cardboard cutouts of stereotypes. This is why you don't get shitty writers to make your game. \n\nI won't reveal any spoilers but....the ending didnt answer any questions......fortunatly the story sucked so badly that I didnt care. \n\nNote: I fell asleep playing this game...so the hours spent on this game can be misleading. The game can be completed in 6-7 hours.

A game that is supposed to be following in the footsteps of Laura Bow, at least I\u2019m pretty sure I read that somewhere.  Like Laura Bow you start out in College as a journalism major, unlike Laura Bow you seem to be a punk biker who is a sociopath.  At the end of the day though I quite liked the character of Kathy Rain and the other major character Eileen.  Their voice acting, what little there is, is good.  Whoever voices Kathy does a good job and the same goes for Eileen.  Since you do hear their voices the most, it\u2019s pretty important for them to be pleasing.  That was one of the big problems with games like Gabriel Knight, Knight\u2019s voice drove me nuts.  It was just awful.  The same goes for Laura Bow.  However, I can\u2019t recommend this game too much is simply bad in it.  \n\nLike that\u2019s probably all the good stuff.  If a lot of stuff was good, I\u2019d recommend the game, but most of it is quite bad.  So lets go with puzzles.  The game basically has very very very easy puzzles.  Which I guess would be fine, except I think they are also bad.  One puzzle required me to pick up a thermometer, which I attempted already pick up earlier in the game and couldn\u2019t.  No dialogue or really anything lead me to think that later in the game I could now pick it up.  It\u2019s the one puzzle I had to look online for a solution to.  Adventure games need to stop this, either let me pick up every single item I need when I see it, or I guess maybe MAYBE if you heavily stress the fact by the character saying something like, \u201coh I really need to get a thermometer, I think I saw one earlier I need to go back and get it.\u201d  Then that MIGHT be acceptable.  Otherwise, never do this ever!  Almost every puzzle in this game can be solved in the area you are in, normally I would say this is fine, the problem here is that the areas are so small that it takes seconds to figure out puzzles.  That being said I guess I should give props to the game for having all the puzzles basically be logic puzzles as opposed to random math puzzles like a lot of adventure games do and which I hate.\n\nBefore getting into the story, I have to just add that one major problem with the game is the length.  It\u2019s a big problem.  There are so few areas to explore.  Each area, might only have one or two screens to it.  You don\u2019t really feel like you are exploring at all, which imo is critical in an adventure game.  The game also simply ends way too fast.  I suppose it\u2019s possible to tell a short story, this game however fails at it.  There wasn\u2019t any real time to get to know characters or have any feel for the town or even really to ponder what is going on in the game.  I\u2019d say it feels more like watching a movie then playing a game, which I know a lot of games do these days, but I don\u2019t like that.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem is the story and I\u2019m just going to count everything after this as spoilers.  [spoiler] The simple fact is this story makes no sense at all.  First of all I feel like it was a bait and switch.  I bought the game thinking it was going to be an epic murder mystery like a Laura Bow game.  Instead, I guess it\u2019s a horror game? That\u2019s really not the right word for it, it is a mystery, it\u2019s just that the mystery is so terrible I can\u2019t even really call it that.  I would say it\u2019s a very poor version of an HP Lovecraft story.  Yup, that sounds about right.  \n\nSo for starters characters act in ways no one ever would.  Kathy is a sophomore in college majoring in journalism.  Her roommate Eileen is super Christian and I guess loves reading obituaries, because the game starts with her finding out that Kathy\u2019s grandfather is dead and demands Kathy attend the funeral.  Even though Kathy hasn\u2019t seen her grandfather in 15 years nor talked to her grandparents she ends up going.  I found it hard enough to believe that your roommate loves reading obituaries and felt it was appropriate to talk to you about it when it certainly felt like at the start of the game that Kathy is super abrasive and doesn\u2019t get along much with Eileen.\n\nWhatever, I got passed that.  Then you get to the funeral though and hear from your grandmother that after a strange incident in the woods your grandfather entered a catatonic state 15 years ago and medical professionals were baffled.  This leads Kathy to \u201ctake the case.\u201d  No person would ever act this way, maybe some weird robot would, but no actual human ever.  For one, the incident happened 15 years ago, two no evidence really convinced Kathy this was anything other than a weird medical issue, three she didn\u2019t feel the need to even talk to her grandparents before and now that her grandfather is dead shes going to investigate his medical problems? She literally storms off to the chief of police to interrogate him and then steal evidence to look into this issue? Maybe a sociopath would do this, but even that seems far fetched.\n\nAfter Kathy learns her grandfather was investigating a woman\u2019s suicide 16 years ago, Kathy seems to decide to investigate that as well? Shes a punk biker sophomore in college, shes a journalism major, but unlike Laura Bow she isn\u2019t studious.  She apparently never attends class, and nothing leads me to suspect shes even a good journalism major, it\u2019s not like she thinks, \u201coh what a scoop, I\u2019m going to look into this.\u201d  Her chief motivation seems to be guilt that her grandfather died and she didn\u2019t know him so shes going to investigate this for some type of closure.  I just can\u2019t accept that the way she attempts to find closure is to break a variety of laws to investigate what by all appearances is a medical issue. \n\nThere are plenty of ways you could have written this story to work.  How about Kathy is a young detective on the police force in charge of a cold cases unit and is told to look into this girls suicide 16 years ago and through that discovers her grandfather who she was estranged from Kathy also was investigating it and then arrives to speak to her grandfather only to discover he just died?  Or how about Kathy gets a note from her grandmother telling her about how her grandfather was murdered days ago, not years, and Kathy rushes home and is sparked by this to investigate.  See that would make sense, what doesn\u2019t make sense is finding out a medical issue 15 years ago put your grandfather in a catatonic state and you decide to \u201cinvestigate\u201d it when you have supposedly class the next day and you almost decide not to even bother going to the funeral.\n\nEven then I could look passed allllllll of that if the rest of the story was good, but it\u2019s not!  You can\u2019t build a murder mystery without things like a cast of characters/suspects, dialogue/evidence, suspense, actual mystery.  The mystery is literally resolved in this game before it begins.  You learn people are disappearing a second later you discover the priest in the town is a serial killer murdering people.  I certainly suspected him, because he was literally the only character to really suspect other than either your roommate or your grandmother.  You don\u2019t find much evidence pointing to him, but that doesn\u2019t matter since he just straight up kidnaps and attempts to murder Eileen and you immediately know its him.  \n\nThen there is the whole weird HP lovecraft old God thing, where a weird guy has been I guess taking souls to feed on?  It never really goes anywhere, you defeat his weird puzzle game at the end and burn down his weird old god ceremony seemingly defeating a God and the game ends.  If that sounds abrupt, it\u2019s because it is, you know very little about him. You meet him throughout the game, but again the game is so short you don\u2019t really get any feel for what he\u2019s doing other than being evil [/spoiler]\n\nSigh, I was really hoping for a new Laura Bow style murder mystery, instead I got a mediocre horror story.  If you want to make a 10-12 hour Kathy Rain murder mystery with Eileen as her partner/girlfriend I would be up for that.

First off, the graphic is really good. The pixel art is nice and full of detail. The protagonist is charming even if she suffers from the I'm-a-woman-hear me-roar and I-don't-need-no-man attitude from time to time. The voice acting is excellent, and so is the music. The music together with the 90s setting sets the atmosphere - Twin Peaks anyone?\n\nThe gameplay is also fun. It has the traditional point & click gameplay in which you combine different objects to eventually pass a puzzle and advance the story. It also has this intriguing detective mechanic to the game that is fun. You have to find clues in any way possible, then you use these clues that you have collected to ask other characters about the case. It works well, and most of the time the people you talk to will have something interesting to say about the things you ask about. At times it feels like you are doing true detective work. Though, the game isn't too hard. Most of the puzzles have a logical solution, but it requires you to pay attention to the details.\n\nBut... adventure games live and die on their story. The story in Kathy Rain is really good, well, at least 75% of the game. I don't want to go into spoilers here, but right from the start, you get that whatever went down in this small town is not natural. I have no problem with that, it enhances the story since I love that out-of-this-world stuff. The problem comes at the end, or near to it. The game and story have an actual finish, but it feels unsatisfying. As I said, I don't want to spoil anything, but there are way too many loose ends, and nothing about the story is explained. Sure, stuff can be left up to the consumer to draw his conclusions, but there is nothing to draw from here. Stuff just seems to happen at random and then it ends. Disappointing since the road up to that point was great. Maybe, I'm just stupid though, and didn't get it :)\n\nAnyway. I still recommend the game because it's a nice experience, it's just that the story suffers, to me at least.

The puzzles in the game are excellent: not only inventory puzzles, but also logic puzzles, words and some number puzzles, lots of variety. Most importantly though the solutions can be found with logic and the balancing is perfect; I never felt lost or needed to hunt down a walkthrough.

It's not a very long game and the puzzles aren't particularly difficult, but I found them enjoyable nonetheless. Not every puzzle was solved by \"use object with object\", there were some mini riddles that I personally enjoyed solving, and they felt varied too.\n\nKathy is a great character and I'd love to see more of her in future. She's ballsy, sarcastic, independent, but as you come to learn more about her you see some of whats underneath that too.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game was excellent - the art, voice acting and soundtrack really helped convey the feeling of the game. Some of the background music in particular really unnerved me. \n\nThere were some interesting features that I've not seen in point and click adventures much that I think worked well - the \"think about\" option, to provide some more insight on Kathy's thoughts on things, and the closeup of characters speaking with a few different facial expressions. The method of travelling between locations on Kathy's motorcycle was enjoyable too.\n\nMy only complaint about this game was that towards the end I felt like I was just going back and forth between a lot of locations figuring out how to trigger the next event I needed to. With some of the animations it felt a bit slow. Also I felt like it ended a little more abruptly than I'd like, and I would have liked the story to last longer.\n\nAll in all I'd love to see a sequel or more from this developer, Kathy Rain was an excellent experience and I enjoyed pretty much every moment.", "timestamp_created": 1492433318, "timestamp_updated": 1492433318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31193942": {"recommendationid": "31193942", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988432450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 854, "last_played": 1492961085}, "language": "english", "review": "This was the most enjoyment game i have ever tried, \nThe puzzles was very good, it was not that hard, but some made me think alittle longer.\nI really love the gameplay, and the story is amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1492413220, "timestamp_updated": 1492413220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31180924": {"recommendationid": "31180924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046108460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1612121070}, "language": "english", "review": "As soon as I loaded it up, I felt a huge wave of wonderful nostalgia.
