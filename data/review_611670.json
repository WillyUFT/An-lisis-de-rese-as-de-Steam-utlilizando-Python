The rendering, the depth perception, the 3D implementation is more like being in a Star Trek TNG Holodeck. It's the \"3D graphics\" but they look not 10, or 15, or 20, but 100 better, more organic. The detail of the textures comes out incredibly strong, noticing all the bells/whistles, small details, like rivets in the armor, the glossi-ness of the eyes, the remarkable iridescent of soul gems, or any gem you pick up and hold up for a closer look.\n\nIt's like being at Disneyland on some cool ride with animatronics, with all the sights/sounds perfectly crafted, but imagine if those Imagination animatronics had RPG-NPC-AI and get up and walk around doing whatever. Crazy good.\n\nMost Skyrim SE mods work great (not all though and not all work at all). Just be sure to check for specific \"VR\" versions first. If it doesn't exist, then it's a dice-roll if it will work or not. Surprisingly though, many do, but do that due diligence first or your risk losing time when the game tries to load and crashes tons, trying to figure out which mod or mods are causing the problems. Ugh.\n\nYou see everything in a \"true 3D\" like you would see reality. Not some \"flat 360-degree IMAX-like\" version.\nLike I said, it's like you're there.\n\nGood mods are the one that lets you grab/pick up everything (including NPCs) or your gestures to easily interact with NPCs and they react (remember the 6-foot rule, if you grab/bump them too much they will aggro all \"WTF BRO!\") and the mod that renders your entire body (Skyrim VR just shows your wrists/hands, ugh). So whatever out you put on, you're literally wearing it and can look down at see yourself wearing it and all. Insane.\n\nEnhanced blood and other type mods are cool. It's crazy swinging your weapons to pummel an enemy and seeing your weapon, hands, armor, and all covered in blood lol. Also, crazy to travel to here/there, it's like \"oh wow, next I really need to go up the mountain right over there yonder to see the Greybeards?\"\n\nIt's a whoooole other, different experience than the normal Skyrim game.\n\nAgain, it's not \"you're there but \"inside\" and the graphics look the same\".\n\nNoooo, the graphics are 100x better, the depth perception and all renders it on such a level no screenshot or video can ever do it justice. They're out there but it looks nothing like that crap, it's 100X better and \"real\". Extremely immersive. You feel like you are \"There-there\"!\n\nWhat a bummer, while I paid full price, the thing goes on sale dropping down from $60 to $15. Press F!!!!\n\nEven so, the entertainment value IMO, the full price is justified.\nThat said, however, I have a pretty good, modern machine, and the Quest 3 that just came out a month ago which is higher quality than Quest 2 and others. For me, the game runs silky smooth, flawless, NO stutters/lag or anything (I don't link via wifi but to my system via wire so it renders off my system, not so much the VR itself).\n\nIf anyone has never tried VR before but loves Skryim and goes to play this with a good setup and decent VR, will crap their pants. I can't imagine going back to play normal Skyrim without itching all \"OK but what if THIS was VR?\" then seeing how most the mods I use work with VR, so then just go into the VR.\n\nAlso fun, the dual-equip \"Shock\" and go \"POWER! UNLIIIMITED POWER!\" at some fool that starts crap with me. Literally, lifting my hands for realz and going all dark lord of the Sith on a foe running at me with an axe, and I'm all \"Well, I know magic, beeeoch!\" and blast them.\n\nThe grabbing mod is great too, whereas in the game NPCs can be dumb and go into traps and get rekt, whereas I can walk up and grab them and pull out of danger with one hand, while healing them with my other hand. Then they go \"Thank you!\".\nIncredible.

[/h1]\n[h2] Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5) [/h2]\n\n\n\nSkyrim VR is an absolute masterpiece that seamlessly transports players into the breathtaking world of Tamriel like never before. As an avid fan of the original game, I was skeptical about how well the VR adaptation would translate, but I'm thrilled to say that it has exceeded my wildest expectations.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the sheer scale and beauty of the virtual world. From snow-capped mountains to lush forests, every location is stunningly recreated with incredible attention to detail. I found myself lost for hours just exploring every nook and cranny, encountering familiar characters and stumbling upon hidden treasures. The level of immersion here is off the charts!\n\nCombat has also been reimagined for VR, providing an unparalleled level of engagement. Using hand movements to wield swords, bows, and spells feels incredibly intuitive and natural. The intense rush of battle is enhanced tenfold when you're physically dodging incoming attacks or unleashing a devastating power shout with a simple gesture. The sheer joy of becoming your Dragonborn character is unmatched in any other VR game.\n\nAdditionally, the game's extensive content and replayability factor remain intact in the VR adaptation. The countless quests, factions, and choices ensure that no two playthroughs are ever the same. The inclusion of all Skyrim's DLCs only adds to the longevity of this title, providing endless hours of adventure and excitement.\n\nOne aspect that surprised me is the smooth performance and comfort factor. Skyrim VR has been optimized very well, reducing motion sickness and providing customizable comfort options for players sensitive to locomotion in VR. This is a major improvement compared to some other VR titles that often struggle in this regard.\n\nAnother feature worth mentioning is the active modding community, allowing players to further enhance their experience.  \n\n\n\n[b] -My favorite drinking buddy!

But for now, some words of warning. If you're using the Index controllers you [b][i] will [/i][/b] need to use some mods. It literally doesn't work without the VRIK mod and the keybinding alterations it offers as you can't navigate menus. I personally took 10 hours of my playtime just to problem solve what was wrong, so if you're seeing this review that's what's wrong. Also don't launch up the game with all the 2K texture mods imaginable, but add them gradually as you test your PC's limits. Half of my problem solving time was trying to figure out why the game was running on 2 FPS. Well, that was the issue. Just go fully vanilla until you get out of Helgen, and then meddle with mods. Just to make sure that if you have any problems with the game it's with the mods, not the game.\n\nNow for the good stuff. Skyrim VR is everything you can imagine, and a little bit more. Along with VRIK that also gives you a full body I highly recommend getting HIGGS. It enables object interaction so your hand doesn't go through everything you touch, and you can also pick items up and throw them at people. And if you're so inclined, certain \"physics\" are supported for hand interactions as well, just saying. And if you thought using the bow in the original game was fun, in VR it's even more so. Not only can you aim anywhere you want to, say behind a tree or do a trickshot behind your back, you can also rapid fire arrows. Your only limitation is your feeble arms. It's extremely satisfying. Pair that with something like locational damage and you've got yourself a playstyle you can't live without.\n\nCombat of course is a lot better in this as well, though swords don't actually go through people as much as I would've wanted to, but I'm sure there's a mod out there to fix it. Maces, however, are really good. If you've got the right mods to support the physics (Like PLANCK) you can just use a mace to swing at someone's head and send them flying. Then after doing that, you can pick up the body and throw it even further. Not that there's any need to do that, of course. Other weapons are a little underwhelming like I mentioned before. Your dagger will just behave like a wooden club as much as it has in every other version of Skyrim.\n\nSince this is just a port of the original Skyrim, mods that worked in Special Edition will work in this one as well. Just be informed that the Unofficial Patch is not supported in this version so importing the entire load order from SE will not go well, so it's best to check them first. There's also a lot of VR-specific mods, like the ones I've listed previously, so even if you've beaten the game many, many times before, there's still something new to be had with the VR version.\n\nOne thing that I immediately noticed was the scale, how absurdly massive everything is. That door to Bleakfalls Barrow could be opened to let a mammoth through, and when you're looking at mountains you're actually looking up. This is also relevant when you're trying to scale a mountain with a horse because your neck will be snapped at roughly 85 degrees just so see where you're going. And the paths especially look steep as all hell, and it's not something you can really notice in the desktop versions. How anyone's supposed to lug carriage up them is beyond me, but I digress.\n\nIn conclusion, the game really doesn't break new ground.

As a not-very-tall person of 5'5\", I feel like I'm either the height of a 10 year old kid, or I'm floating 30 cm above the ground. Everyone in this world is like 2 metres tall. It's pretty sad for people like me :(\n\n2. I swear the person who came up with the default control scheme for this game used a random generator to assign controls. Whoever decided that pressing forward on your right controller would make you jump instead of pressing A, grabbing made you go back, instead of pressing B; B and Y took you left and right in menus, instead of pressing the trigger buttons; and both rotating your left hand and rotating the hat switch made you change the direction you were walking, causing you to walk like a drunkard everywhere... must have been taking some serious drugs that day. I'm sure this can be fixed in settings, gad damn.\n\n\nNext up, why I don't recommend this game:\n\nThis really should be a feature or a DLC rather than a whole new game. It's a pretty basic port where even most mods for the original Skyrim still work with it. Definitely not worth the full price at least.\nIt'a also annoying because I can't play with the accounts I have on my regular Skyrim in VR when I want. I either have to make an account that's 100% VR or 100% desktop. VR tends to be an effort to set up and I'd rather play desktop on some days, and sometimes I want to have an immersive experience and I play in VR mode. Having these as completely separate games prevents me from doing that with one playthrough. It's quite disappointing. \nThere's also the fact that Skyrim was originally meant to be played on desktop, and there's a lot of things in VR that don't work very well, such as weapon handling (how-fast-can-you-move-your-wrist-back-and-forth weapon speeds) plus some other bugs that come with this being a very basic port. \nIf you have a VR headset and you're wondering whether you should buy this version of the desktop version, I'll send you to the desktop version without second thoughts. If you already have Skyrim and you want a new experience with the game in VR, yeah, sure you can get this if you want, if you don't mind that you'll have to start over with a new playthrough, and the game is still basically exactly the same as the desktop version, only a bit worse and in VR, and it costs extra money.", "timestamp_created": 1692334475, "timestamp_updated": 1692334475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144460540": {"recommendationid": "144460540", "author": {"steamid": "76561199103166646", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1700750297}, "language": "english", "review": "Its the best game EVER!", "timestamp_created": 1692331660, "timestamp_updated": 1692331660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144457516": {"recommendationid": "144457516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056773572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3561, "last_played": 1699333622}, "language": "english", "review": "boner", "timestamp_created": 1692327526, "timestamp_updated": 1692327526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144429194": {"recommendationid": "144429194", "author": {"steamid": "76561199041637438", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 823, "last_played": 1693609994}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR:Skyrim is a good game. Skyrim VR is a terrible port. Mods makes the game playable.\n\n\nThe only way you can make the game playable is to inject it with an ongodly amount of mods. Currently I have 192 active plugins. The vast majority of them are just bug fixes, optimizations, and VR features that should have been in vanilla Skyrim VR. Installing mods is a pain in the ass; a mess a dependencies, load order, and configs. I ended up installing something like a modpack called FUS that installed all the Fundamentals, Upgrades, and Stuff (thus the acronym) because I didn't want to waste hours upon hours installing and troubleshooting mods. The modding community is amazing. Bethesda didn't bother to add an actual player body, physics interactions, AI Upscaling, and immersive HUD for VR, etc. So the mad scientists that is the Skyrim modding community did it them selves. With all these mods the game is playable, and fun! However this is a review for Skyrim VR, not Modded Skyrim VR, and vanilla Skyrim VR is a dumpster fire.\n\nEDIT: My mods total 104 GB.

awful. I expected mechanics like Blade and Sorcery, with gravity for the weapons, the ability to grip a weapon with two hands. Instead what I got was weightless weapons that you can just flick around and instantly kill opponents, even when enabling all of the \"realism\" settings. This is an issue that does not exist in the non-vr version of TES V, since the heavier weapons take longer to swing, so I'd much rather play that version of the game. It's literally just a port of the classic Skyrim, with removed weapons physics. If you are playing Skyrim for the first time, this may be the better version to do it on, just install some mods for weapons gravity (I think they exist, I didn't even check). The whole point of playing Skyrim is the immersion, and with that one aspect of weapons gravity, this version could be better than the original.\n\nWaiting for my refund soon, as I don't want Bethesda to receive my 20$ for this lazy port after I've purchased Skyrim for the Xbox 360, one, and my Steam account.\n\nBrief summary of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\nMore immersive than the original Skyrim but requires mods for it.\nNice bow and arrow shooting\nMay be a nice introduction for first-time vr players in general.\n\nCons:\nWithout mods, weightless weapon physics which results in a spamfest.\nWith mods, achievements will be disabled.

I failed trying to make this game feel enjoyable once and gave up for 6 months before finding a guide I enjoyed. only after following that guide and getting ~130 mods (MANY for updated visuals, and then a good number to make the game... feel like a VR game and not a horrible port of a 2011 game) am I really enjoying it. I will link the guide I've followed below. I would also recommend a companion app available on Steam called Natural Locomotion, which lets you swing your arms (or feet, if you want to go through the setup) in order to walk through the world.\n\nthat being said, I've never actually beat standard Skyrim before-- I would just get bored and back out after a good few levels. playing in VR is so much more immersive and enthralling. I'm always excited to get back into the world and see what it has to hold and what there is to discover. I have the benefit of not having played the original in so long I literally remembered almost nothing, so the experience is not only refreshed by being in VR, but it is also actually new to me. The worldbuilding was good when it came out and really holds up. Walking around the world in roomscale is comparable to (and in my opinion better than) walking around as Link in Breath of the Wild-- there's always something for you to discover along the way to your destination, and a hundred ways to approach any problem (though, just like has always been the case, sneaky archery is usually the easiest).\n\nI honestly see myself finishing the game like this. I cannot emphasize enough how much credit should go to the many, many people that have put timeless hours into modding this game to make it enjoyable.\n\nthe mod list I most closely followed (with a few tweaks according to my taste and needs): \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimvr/comments/8riiqk/and_refined_my_texture_and_modding_guide_140/\n\nA comprehensive guide to modding Skyrim VR, in which you can find about a million resources and recommended mods and plugins: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbh7GE30xLyso7MA6u3xpNJNdL5r2V2WP8SjZ4VpHLQ/edit\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691296070, "timestamp_updated": 1691296070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.84314340353012085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143496040": {"recommendationid": "143496040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099807536", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1644976283}, "language": "english", "review": "mm yes i am the dragon born my soup is delicious", "timestamp_created": 1691292466, "timestamp_updated": 1691292466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143474881": {"recommendationid": "143474881", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982107217", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4087, "last_played": 1697697836}, "language": "english", "review": "Only way I know how to review this game is to simply say that If you have a VR headset and a capable pc, it is a MUST OWN.

I feel every gamer should at some point escape Helgen, if for no other reason than because of how iconic the opening of this game is. If you have never played Skyrim, this is a great way to first experience it. You will be blown away by the absurd amount of things to be done in this game, but that's really where the biggest issue lies.\n\nThe issue is that Skyrim is an absolutely massive game with hundreds if not thousands of hours of content, and if you try to complete all of it, you will almost certainly get bored of the general feel of the game first. Typically, multiplayer would be a good solution to this boredom, but Skyrim doesn't have multiplayer. You are eternally alone in this game, and unlike other single-player games I've played, I often felt painfully alone when in Skyrim. Fun can certainly be had nonetheless, but it's likely going to decrease exponentially for the longer you play. It's for that reason that I promptly uninstalled the game once I had gotten every achievement.\n\nI do still recommend the game, but not as heavily as I would recommend another single-player story-based VR game such as Budget Cuts or Half-Life: Alyx.

But I still feel like I can say this. The game is amazing MODDED vanilla is trash.  A lot of time you will spend is going to be modding for the first 1-3 days so you got to have determination to mod and a lot of times you may screw up and have to either A. Test to see which mod is crashing you or B. Restart the entire list SO ALWAYS keep track of what mods you download when and only download a select few at a time so that way you can seed out the ones that break the game easier. You will probably never stop modding this game I have about 100 but there's people with over 400 and even then if you reach that point you may still switch things up and replace a few or even add more. The good news is however when you do reach a point where you are satisfied for the most part the new mods you add will only be like 1 or 2 cool armor sets maybe as opposed to 50 different graphical enhancements that took 4 hours to download (Speaking from experience) but if you can endure the long hours of sitting there doing nothing and babysitting your PC (I watched videos to entertain me that helped a lot) it will all be worth it modded it has to be one of the most cool and beautiful VR experiences out there. Me personally it's been about a day and a half of constant modding and testing and I am getting to a point where the game is beautiful and has all the VR essentials so it may take less then 2 days but 2 days is about average modding time I'd say. You can even create a mod collection idk if you can set those to private but what I do is just write them down and back them up so I don't have to wait so long to download it all again. Now one more thing I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it's called cherry picking look for high endorsed collections and sort through the mods find which ones you like don't download them all just get the ones that seem appealing to you. A GREAT START IS this guy named Habbie you can search Habbie Skyrim VR online find his most recent video go to the description and download all the mods he has because he has the bare minimum mods to make it actually playable then branch out and install your own mods. I would also recommend this game on sale although great modded 60$ for a game modders had to fix is super scummy so buy it on sale. Now that's just the disclaimer onto gameplay review (WITH MODS NOT VANILLA)\n\nGameplay review (WITH MODS):\n\nThe game is awesome I mean getting to slice my enemies with a heavy 2 handed axe pretty sweet. The things you can do to NPCS is quite immersive there is tons of roleplaying options. For example you could be a cannibal or a werewolf and just eat people and actually bend down to eat them or you could sneak into people's houses and hold knifes to their throats and kill them that way or be a vampire and actually sink your teeth in sucking the blood from them. And without mods the graphics are good but with the graphical mod lineup I have stunning when I'm tired and sweaty from walking around I sit down and enjoy the night sky look at all the stars and the moon. Maybe I look to the mountains in the distant see how they howl. Sometimes I will travel through a harsh blizzard in search of a way out or shelter. Or a dark cavern full of mysteries and dangerous traps. I can go assassins creed style and kill a villager pick their body up hoist it over my shoulder and drop them in some shrubs. The possibilities are endless for RP you can be whatever you want or do whatever you want. I love it stunning game and a wonderful VR experience (IF MODDED) and like I said in the disclaimer you gotta be ready to heavily mod it or you will be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1688452754, "timestamp_updated": 1688544527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141259495": {"recommendationid": "141259495", "author": {"steamid": "76561199129924546", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1696727801}, "language": "english", "review": "sucks as vanilla, but once you get mods its one if the funnest vr games you can play", "timestamp_created": 1688436706, "timestamp_updated": 1688436706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141256941": {"recommendationid": "141256941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797263174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1688427348}, "language": "english", "review": "Bethesda clearly put 0 effort into this port, It's honestly sad that it's so bad.

Sure, you can fix this pile of poop and make it pretty nice(but not bug free) with mods. But the modders deserve that credit. Bethesda does not. This is the laziest imaginable VR port ever.

Same engine was ported over too, only without many of the bug fixes. Instead of adapting the engine and graphics to VR, they simply seriously reduced the detail and the view distance. And I know with an AMD processor and Windows 10 that the game crashes often within five minutes without the unofficial patch. This game is the epitome of why big studios should be hanging their heads in shame. I literally tried to figure out anyway they could have made this any lazier and more uninspired and I am coming up empty.\n\nBuy it at the deepest discount you possibly can.

I have had to do a fair bit of optimization on my system in order to get this all running smoothly. But it is now the best open world game on VR currently.

Other than the bow, weapons and spells, which are all poorly made and boring by themselves, there's nothing you interact with using VR, you're basically just getting a really shitty iphone strapped to your head and pretending it's VR experience.

It's a staggering display of incompetence and apathy.\n\nHowever, with the current mods available at time of writing this review, the gameplay and VR interactions can be fixed and fully transformed into what it should have been and puts it on par with other \"real\" VR games, which is nearly a miracle given the vanilla state of things. With the correct overhaul mods (HIGGS, VRIK, PLANCK are the big three, but there are a dozen others that I highly recommend and that all coalesce to further fix the experience) it becomes worth a buy, but only at the [i]deepest possible discount[/i] to ensure Bethesda is rewarded as little as possible for what they've done here.\n\nThat aside, it's exactly what you think it is. It's Skyrim, but in VR. [b]With the appropriate mods[/b], you will be able to engage in fairly good physical combat, cast spells with gestures, pet dogs, pick up and throw/manipulate items, and so forth. Of course, there are also some great sights to see that look extra impressive or scary in VR. There's fun to be had here as long as you aren't already too burned out on flat Skyrim.

That makes it all the more annoying that it really does feel like Bethesda just hit the \"make it VR\" button when porting The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition to VR. Aside from half-baked hand tracking and a custom starting area, very little care was put into making Skyrim an interesting VR game. While it's neat to explore Tamriel in a more immersive way, the game lacks the physicality that VR promises. There's very little in the way of physics interactions\u2014your hands barely interact with the environment, phasing through people and items. Without collision, melee combat feels like whiffing at the air. Congratulations, you're playing Skyrim again, but this time, you're doing it standing up. To add insult to injury, players are expected to purchase this rush-job separately from the desktop version of Special Edition\u2014which I still don't even own. If they were going to put so little effort into it, it should have been a free update to Special Edition and not a full-price standalone purchase.\n\nNot all is lost, though. I had quite a good time playing Skyrim in virtual reality, but that's despite Bethesda\u2014not thanks to them. If you're willing to spend half a day modding the game and learning how to correctly apply confusing shit like DynDOLOD, Skyrim VR is more than just a salvageable experience\u2014it's one worth getting into. The Elder Scrolls fan community has done an amazing job of making this port worth playing. With a handy guide and a bit of patience on the player's part, it's possible to make the world of Tamriel a beautiful, jaw-dropping experience worth exploring for the visuals alone. The combat and gameplay... well, it's still Skyrim. That said, I feel like the notoriously same-y combat is made a bit more interesting when the swings of your sword, the drawing of your bow, and the casting of your spells are done with your own hands' movements. There's an additional layer of immersion there that makes the combat feel more worthwhile than the one-button-mashing of the desktop version. If you have a headset, an attachment to Skyrim, and some time to burn, I think it's worth trying out the game after modding it. Just... don't buy it.

These games always make me happy with how much story there is. But, this story is unfortunately ruined by the game's mechanics. The whole point of VR is to actually be there-in this fantasy world-not on a 2d screen. Skyrim VR lacks this aspect largely. For example, you cannot interact with objects or npcs. No grabbing or collision, just a button to pick it up and store in your inventory. Some might say that mods make up this game-that mods will make up for what this game is lacking. Though, this mainly comes from people who have massively expensive computers and are able to run the mods needed for the game to be bearable (most modlists are 300+ mods)(I am somewhat biased in saying this). Of course, I have tried to mod the game to make it work. Unfortunately my hard work was for nothing because even after spending 5+ hours (downloading mod manager, waiting 3 hours to install, getting rid of mod conflicts, manually installing more mods) my computer was unsuccessful in running the game smoothly. Everything was choppy and really glitchy. (only 1 example)Every time I would snap turn the game would glitch out and look weird. I know that this is a result of my lack of understanding that I cannot run this many mods on my computer and installing the mods anyway, but was still devastating to find out nevertheless (I did not give up right away, I tried many programs to run the game smoothly and other things but this would take way too much time to explain, so I will spare you the details).

The game is a fully-featured version of the original Skyrim game, with added features and enhancements designed specifically for virtual reality gameplay.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of Skyrim VR is the immersive gameplay experience that it provides. Players can explore the vast and detailed world of Tamriel, encountering creatures and characters along the way. The game's VR implementation allows players to physically move around and interact with the game's world, making it feel more real and engaging.\n\nAnother standout feature of Skyrim VR is the game's combat system, which has been optimized for virtual reality gameplay. Players can use motion controls to attack enemies with swords, shields, and other weapons, adding a level of physicality to combat that is absent in traditional Skyrim gameplay.\n\nIn addition to the core game, Skyrim VR also includes several features and enhancements that are exclusive to virtual reality gameplay. For example, the game includes a new motion control interface that allows players to navigate menus and inventory screens using hand gestures, as well as a new teleportation system that allows players to move around the game world more easily.\n\nWhile Skyrim VR is a great game, there are some drawbacks to the VR implementation. The game's graphics are not as detailed as the original Skyrim game, and some players may experience motion sickness or other discomfort while playing for extended periods of time. Additionally, the game requires a high-end VR headset and a powerful computer to run smoothly, which may make it inaccessible to some players.\n\nOverall, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR is a fantastic game that offers an immersive and engaging role-playing experience. The game's optimized combat system, motion control interface, and new teleportation system make it a standout title in the VR space. While it may not be for everyone, those who are willing to invest in the necessary hardware and overcome any potential discomfort will find a rewarding and memorable experience in Skyrim VR.", "timestamp_created": 1679531971, "timestamp_updated": 1679531971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456140369176864624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135186984": {"recommendationid": "135186984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295557339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9569, "last_played": 1698181812}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1679519801, "timestamp_updated": 1679519801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135186107": {"recommendationid": "135186107", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044011895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1657325336}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El sistema de batalla deja mucho que desear, cuando golpeas con el arma no sabes si le diste o no, el mando no vibra ni da a entender que el golpe fue efectivo, hace que la inmersi\u00f3n en el juego sea muy pobre", "timestamp_created": 1679519186, "timestamp_updated": 1679519186, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135173094": {"recommendationid": "135173094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198956923872", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1672076446}, "language": "english", "review": "you need a bajillion mods to play this, and even then its just skyrim but a little nauseating.", "timestamp_created": 1679507635, "timestamp_updated": 1679507635, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135168143": {"recommendationid": "135168143", "author": {"steamid": "76561199212027070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 3940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 2916, "last_played": 1700213233}, "language": "english", "review": "download a bunch of mods, have it work, download one more, have game fail, delete mod, still have game fail, stop playing for 5 months, try again have it fail, repeat", "timestamp_created": 1679502744, "timestamp_updated": 1679502744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636735320091247559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135167036": {"recommendationid": "135167036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198885638507", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1679505883}, "language": "english", "review": "Download Wabbajack and learn how to install FUS mod list.

For the tl;dr, skip to the Conclusion at the bottom.\n\n[h1]Same Skyrim, New Tricks:[/h1]\n\nFirst let\u2019s talk about what VR brings to the table in a game like Skyrim. Going from seeing Skyrim through a monitor to Skyrim through VR goggles adds a handful of truly marvelous perks, primarily immersion. The ability to experience the game world at a 1:1 scale is remarkably engaging, even if you\u2019ve played through the game a handful of times already. Enemies present a heightened sense of threat in VR that they simply can\u2019t when they\u2019re on a 2D screen, casting magic using your real-world hands gives a feeling of power, and walking around the environments makes you appreciate the sheer size of them at a new level. So then VR is exclusively a good thing for Skyrim, right? Not quite.\n\nSkyrim is a game originally from 2011, and the Special Edition release is from 2016. Both games certainly looked somewhere between good to decent when they were released, and with mods you can improve the look of each even further. By today\u2019s standards or even 2018 standards when Skyrim VR was released, the graphics just don\u2019t hold up and they shouldn\u2019t be expected to. Unfortunately, Skyrim VR uses the same graphics as the 2016 Special Edition release meaning the extra immersion VR provides dramatically reduces the effective visual quality of many environments. Some issues you\u2019ll likely notice include extra blocky objects and dated textures. Water appears chunky and jagged, plants look like a piece of plastic with a flower painted on, and the lighting makes views that should be scenic masterpieces look fairly plain. Bethesda\u2019s choice to not upgrade the visuals of the game before moving it to VR is a significant hit to the quality of the game right away.\n\nThese graphical issues are not helped by gameplay quirks born from yanking a game from desktop to VR. Many HUD elements are placed at the very edge of your vision making them squirrely to find the heat of combat and the menu systems are clearly best navigated with a traditional gamepad or keyboard rather than a vr pointer. Items and corpses can\u2019t be moved around in the world like they can be in any of the desktop releases, and your character has no physical representation in the world except for a set of rigid, unsightly VR hands. NPCs, enemies, props, and traps can all push you around the environment against your will which is a real problem for folks prone to motion sickness. Thankfully, [b]some[/b] of these issues can be fixed by modding.\n\n[h1]Modding Skyrim VR:[/h1]\n\nUnless it's your very first time playing the game, Skyrim is widely considered at its best when stuffed to the gills with mods. Skyrim mods make the gameplay less buggy, the graphics prettier, the frame rate more consistent, the interface more helpful, the enemies more engaging, the weapons and armor more varied, the spells more useful, the skills more interesting, and even add whole new areas to the game if you like. This isn't to say that playing Skyrim isn't good or isn't fun [b]without[/b] mods, but after you play your first 20 or 30 hours of vanilla Skyrim you'll probably be thinking \"huh I wish the two handed combat felt more impactful\" or \"if only the alchemy perks were more applicable to the way I play\" or even just \"I want my anime waifu as my companion, dang it\". Modding those things into Skyrim Special Edition (which I'll refer to as \"SE\") is a cakewalk. SE is (at the time of writing) the most recently updated version of Skyrim available on PC. It includes all of the DLC from the original and, as such, it has the most updated mods out of all the PC versions. Because of this, if you hop over to Nexus Mods and open the homepage for Skyrim SE, you'll be greeted by countless mods that can be installed and set up with little to no effort. Certainly not all are worth your attention, but the sheer number of SE mods available means you can find a working mod to satisfy almost any change you'd like to make. That story is quite a bit different for VR.\n\nTo start, there's no good way to browse mods made specifically for VR because Skyrim VR and SE mods are all lumped into the SE category on Nexus Mods. Technically speaking, this makes sense; behind the scenes VR is actually just SE with some tweaks by Bethesda that make it function as a VR game. Because SE and VR share the same core game files behind this VR coat of paint, mods made for SE are \u2014 in theory at least \u2014 compatible with Skyrim VR. The reality though is that many SE mods aren't compatible with VR at all and not every SE mod that works on VR will work on the first try. This is in part because VR is based on a slightly older version of the game files than SE and hasn't been updated in some time. Certain content present in SE is missing completely from VR while some has been updated in SE but not in VR. Mods made for SE typically expect to be installed in the latest version of SE, but since the version used in VR is older you'll often have the game hang, crash, or generally misbehave the first time they are installed forcing you to either remove the mod or go dig up a compatibility patch. \n\nMercifully, not *every* mod will wreak this havoc on your game and some of the most popular mods are compatible with VR right out of the box. I've personally had the most trouble with mods related to graphical upgrades to the game (improved lighting, ENB, re-worked water, etc.), but some functionally important mods like \"Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch\" or \"Ordinator\" require their additional compatibility patch installed first to smooth over the problem spots caused by the mismatches between SE and VR. If you have experience modding Skyrim, whether that's through a tool like Vortex or by hand, you can no doubt get many of your favorite mods to work in VR with some coercion. If you have never modded Skyrim before and you want to try your hand at it, I would again point you to SE first as it is the more straightforward and forgiving option.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nIf all you want is to play vanilla, middle of the road, Skyrim-as-Todd-Howard-intended-but-this-time-in-VR, go right ahead and snag this game when it's in the $10-$15 range. Like all versions of Skyrim this is a moderately jank experience by default, but it does an adequate job of taking the highs and lows of plain Skyrim and putting them faithfully into VR. Similarly, if you have never played Skyrim before and are looking to dip your toe in, I would suggest you try out Skyrim Special Edition first since the addition of VR is really more of a novelty than a necessity.\n\nIf instead you are looking for the same Skyrim experience you know and love from previous editions of the game, preferably modded somewhere between a little and too much, [b]and[/b] you are willing to put in a great deal each of time, tears, and sweat to get there, this is the way to go. But even then, don\u2019t pay more than about $15 for it.", "timestamp_created": 1677444718, "timestamp_updated": 1690522428, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133610756": {"recommendationid": "133610756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167089749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1095, "last_played": 1692764781}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty much what everyone else says.\n\nUnplayable unless you mod it.\n\n4/10 unmodded\nwhatever you want/10 modded", "timestamp_created": 1677357996, "timestamp_updated": 1677357996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547444820404053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133567059": {"recommendationid": "133567059", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180028583", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1699683802}, "language": "english", "review": "great game and there are ll kinds of great mods available for it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1677319769, "timestamp_updated": 1677319769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133542463": {"recommendationid": "133542463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060775934", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4666, "last_played": 1678756830}, "language": "english", "review": "giant send you to space in vr", "timestamp_created": 1677290205, "timestamp_updated": 1677290205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485544443130493164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133468971": {"recommendationid": "133468971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198978016623", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1022, "last_played": 1670005654}, "language": "english", "review": "Not recommended unless you Mod it then i recommend. its not that the game is bad but the VR implemented is very bad you cant interact with anything (like pick it up without putting it in your inventory) but don't worry there is a mod for that.

Roleplaying is also a lot more fun if you \"are\" your Character because you can do silly little stuff the game wont notice but add a lot of details to your own personal lore. I always liked how litte storys just develop naturally while playing Skyrim and the fact that a lot of gameplay is more hands on in VR instead of just pressing a button and watching an animation really adds to this.

Sady its not a great VR game (maybe even a bad one).

Now that I have over 120 hours playing, and have played through twice, once as a stealth archer and once as a mage, I feel that an updated  review is required.\n\nFirstly, I\u2019m playing [i]almost[/i] a vanilla build, using two mods [i]\u201cEasy Lockpicking and Pickpocketing\u201d[/i] and [i]\u201cRally's Candlelight and Magelight Fix SE - VR\u201d[/i] (Both from the Nexus) for the sake of playability and sanity. After 200 odd hours on Skyrim SE and 120 odd on Skyrim VR I have picked enough locks to know that I can do it and to not want to do it again, and as a mage, I use Magelight and the default blinds me.\n\nLet's get into it. Skyrim always looked nice even if the vanilla experience is a bit dated now, but in VR it can be stunning, even with only the vanilla graphics. Being able to feel like you are actually there is awesome, and it is good enough that I avoided fast travel a fair bit, preferring to spend the time walking across the country. Sure, the snow and ice areas are pretty bland, but it is well worth the effort to walk around the more overgrown areas.\n\nEven the indoor areas looked nice in VR and since you are able to set your height in game (I\u2019m 6\u20194)  more than a few times I found myself ducking as I went through what appeared to be a pretty low doorway or tunnel.\n\nDark areas become really quite spooky in VR, far more so than when playing on a screen, and so the ambient sounds play a great deal more of a part than they usually do; I found myself paying close attention to what I could hear as an indication of where danger might approach from.\n\nAnd so we come to combat. Generally my favourite build is a stealth archer, and this was enhanced by being able to actually place the arrow and pull the bow for myself while aiming. It's quick to get used to and there are various settings depending on how you get on with it and I can say that I have never enjoyed using the bow as much as I did in VR.\n\nOn occasion when needed, I also used swords etc. While personally I find the bow much more fun, it is immensely enjoyable to slap a bandit in the side of the head with a sword, an axe or a hammer. Again, much more so in VR and yes, I tried them all just because.\n\nFor the sake of experiencing as much as possible I also played through as a mage, spending a great deal of time enjoying throwing ice spikes and thunderbolts at anything that moved. Using both hands, one for defence and one for attack, feels very sensible in combat.\n\nI played the main quest far enough to meet Delphine in Riverwood and then went off and played the Dragonborn and Dawnguard DLCs and all of the guilds (which don\u2019t take that long) and I maintain that this is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in VR so far.\n\nSure, it's not HL:Alyx, and without adding a ton of mods it's still only Skyrim graphics, but after you\u2019ve spent 10 minutes playing you don\u2019t notice that any more, and you get the chance to enjoy the wonder of actually being in Tamriel, and of course if you have the hardware you can always spend a bit of time and add a bunch of mods to make it even better.\n", "timestamp_created": 1675885985, "timestamp_updated": 1680202094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132405613": {"recommendationid": "132405613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027244720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6432, "last_played": 1698726340}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll start out like every other review.

That being said, with a few mods, this becomes one of my favorite titles in VR. Without mods, I wouldn't bother. If you haven't modded Bethesda games before, this is where to start, because it's totally necessary to make the experience worthwhile. There are plenty of videos on it but I'd say the minimum are 3d sound, Vrik's player avatar, PLANCK and Higg's enhanced VR interaction. The list from there on depends on the person, but this is what I'd say is mandatory for it to feel like a real VR title and not a shoddy port.\n\nThe biggest positive of this release, mods or not, is the immersion of seeing Skyrim again in a VR perspective. Every big setpiece, every interesting location becomes amazing in VR. You'll find yourself looking around and generally looking up more, making memorable events like exploring the flourescent otherworld of Blackreach or the climb to High Hrothgar a much more profound experience. That's where the benefit of the base game in VR ends though. You'll need mods for it to feel like a VR release instead of an obvious port where the headset is the only benefit and your VR controllers are are poor stand-ins for a keyboard (the controls for which you can't seem to change, although I believe some mods might be around that remap the keys). \n\nNow for the negatives (even with what mods I have). Some of the controls are pretty bad. The shouting key is mapped to what would ordinarily be the dominant hand's \"grab\" button - very easy to accidentally hit. Save often because apart from random crashes, you will be accidentally fus-ro-dahing shopkeepers and villagers more than you will your enemies, pissing off numerous guards.  As for combat, regular melee combat isn't very fun in VR in my opinion. Some of the physics additions in PLANCK make weapons feel more weighty and realistic, but you're really just flailing your weapon at them - it's more affective to \"bonk bonk bonk\" hit them as fast as possible than pretend to swing a sword like a sword. Magic is much more satisfying as well has its own share of mods that add a lot of depth if desired. Beyond that, for me being able to aim the Dawnguard crossbow one-handed in VR is incredibly satisfying and archery itself is much more interesting in VR.\n\nOverall, this is a terrible VR game without mods, and a great experience with mods. Skyrim is still Skyrim, for what it's worth (I personally don't feel the game or quests are anywhere nearly as memorable as Oblivion, and I probably wouldn't have played it again if it didn't get this VR release). That being said, being able to experience it from a VR perspective completely changes the game. You will notice details you hadn't before, discovering a room in a dungeon of slain explorers starts to actually look ominous and set some tension, and surprises like Dwarven spiders popping out of vents become borderline jumpscares. It's worth it, but only with a few mods that make a night-and-day difference.", "timestamp_created": 1672280549, "timestamp_updated": 1672280549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608448028564453125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129553787": {"recommendationid": "129553787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880832767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2081, "last_played": 1685277693}, "language": "english", "review": "brilliant game especially in VR. however bethesda are lazy so i recommend modding it for better physics and quality of life changes.", "timestamp_created": 1672266803, "timestamp_updated": 1672266803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129553069": {"recommendationid": "129553069", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053174107", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 11995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9852, "last_played": 1687825010}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Skyrim.

There are mods that fix everything that I've listed below and add even more to the game. However, this review is for the base game, not the hard work of the community. \n\nAlpha skyrim graphics, lots of stuttering and jitters, several bugs. Heck, the amount of bugs and glitchesI saw before I even left Helgen is astounding. My favorite was when (spoilers) ralof asks me to stay close as the dragon is attacking the town and then teleports somewhere else literally as soon as he finishes his sentence. He teleported a few times before and after that as well. \n\nThere are no VR elements aside from the ability to freely swing your sword. You can pick things up, but they'll be floating next to your hand, just like the non vr game. Lockpicking is done with the analog sticks, just like the console controller. \n\nThe visuals are horrendous, that includes EVERYTHING, especially textures except for maybe water in some places. The textures are especially bad.

After searching on google I discovered that it was set up for the Playstation beam controllers. Finally managed to get into the set up part of the game when you decide on what controls you want to use for movement - teleportation or walking.  An error occurred and the game went back to the menu screen and I couldn't find a way of getting back into the in-game configuration to select which bits I wanted to use. Back to google, navigated through the menu's and finally found it.\nWith HL Alyx I used the teleportation method of moment, was intuative, accurate and easy to use. With this game it looked like something out of the 1980's with this horrible curved coloured line to the spot you wanted to move to and it was only for real short distances. Settled for the walking movement.\n\nFinally started the game where you travel down in this horse drawn carriage with other convicts. \nThe talking between the characters was out of sync with their mouths and went on forever, there was no way to skip this so had to watch it all, your hands are bound so you cannot do anything with them.\nAfter this section it started going with the people getting executed and the dragon appeared. \nOh this looks good, the dragon looks great. Started following the adventure, got my hands cut free and started following the character around the building, \nI got handed my sword and started to practice but you could not move your hands to fight, you had to press a button. Your hands hover in front of you like you are playing \"paper scissors stone\" and that's the best they can do. You cannot cut with the sword you have to press a button. Completely defeats the idea of VR motion detecting hand grips. What is the point??\n\nKept positive and started running around the room checking out the chests and looting some items. Received several items of armor and got completely confused with the whole inventory system, It was just so confusing and difficult to use, trying to swap items without knowing the basic controls which took me 45 mins to set up in the first place I got completely annoyed with the game and had to take a break.\n\nI had read somewhere that you could install mods to make the game better so looked them up and installed Skyrim Script Extender and Vortex. Opened up the game and there were some changes to the menu's but the controllers had defaulted to the beam type of system and the buttons on the screen did not match the controller buttons. After another 30 mins reading up on controller settings I managed to get things working again.\nI installed the mod which improves the world graphics. Installed ok, started the game and was not impressed. Thought it might get better so decided to give it a chance.\nNext, there was a mod that gives better hand control and another that shows your full body instead of just your hands. Nothing happened, this mod was at the top of the list, active, no conflicts all set to go. Loaded up the game and it was the same as before. I thought that maybe once we got past the horse/cart intro it would work as you could see your hands. Nothing happened.\nI tried a few other mods which had dependencies on other mods for which I had the latest already installed but they kept coming up with incompatibily errors which I had to rectify but went round in circles installing/uninstallign them until I managed to get them all runing together but the end results were a total waste of time.\n\nI first loaded this game up at 10am and by 3pm I had gotten nowhere with the mods, The game play was anoying and I lost total interest in the game and uninstalled it.\nIf I had paid \u00a360 which was apparently the normal price I would have been very angry, but as I only had to pay \u00a312.50 I didn't mind too much, \n\nI've been playing RPG's for years and know how they are played, I've played half-life alyx 5 times to completion so know how the controls should work. \n\nThis game was so basic compared to what else is out there and would not recommend it to anyone. \n\nIt could have been so much better if the so-called mods were integrated into the latest release with the option to turn them on/off depending on your hardware by default instead of having to learn through the community boards and google to try and find compatible modules. \nThe menu system needs a total re-work as it's not easy to find anything. \nThe in-game control system needs ripping out and starting from fresh with today's technology and not something from 10 years ago. It needs to be able to detect your devices and mould itself around them instead of you having to spend hours trying to figure them out.\nIt needs to start of basic and introduce things one at a time and give you reasons and methods on how to use the controls and the environment. \n\nIf I didn't have any basic knowledge of games and was starting this as a new user I would be lost.\nIt's basically a 2D game converted to VR with basic controls and as you cannot see the keyboard and use that as a control method it's like playing a mobile phone game with oven-gloves on.\n\nIf they had integrated the half-life Alyx system of controls and graphics then this game could have been amazing. As it stands it was the biggest mistake of my life buying this game.\n\nA whole day wasted.", "timestamp_created": 1670066303, "timestamp_updated": 1670066303, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483919292688369751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127828209": {"recommendationid": "127828209", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972090895", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1670770956}, "language": "spanish", "review": "C\u00f3mpralo con un buen descuento, no pagues m\u00e1s de 25\u20ac de lo contrario te estar\u00e1s autoestafando.

Once you get the correct mods in place (VRIK, HIGGS, PLANCK, SpellwheelVR), use weather mods (I love Obsidian or Azurite), lighting mods (Lux, Lux Orbis, Lux Via), an ENB, and more, this game becomes the most fulfilling experience imaginable. I have clocked over 1400 hours in this game and do not see myself stopping.\n\nIt's difficult to explain exactly why this game does so well once it's fully modded. The controls, while not as simple as Half-Life Alyx or Blade and Sorcery, are extremely customizable. The world lends itself to exploration and wonderment. The quests you can add and the new places you can visit make this game incredibly replayable. Even simple quests you may have done a thousand times on desktop, such as delivering Farengar's frost salts or chopping wood for Hulda, take on a whole new life. And imagine being able to actually slap Nazeem. That alone is worth the price of this game! :D\n\nReal life is stressful, and after a day of streaming, developing, or anything else, I need to unwind. This is the game I do it in. I can live a second life, walk from Lakeview Manor down to Riverwood, camp in the mountains of Eastmarch, or chill in the Winking Skeever in Solitude. I can hunt with Aela, smith with Adrianne, or get into trouble with Erik the Slayer. Or... I can download new places and followers and experience something new.\n\nWhile it's true that you can do all of this on desktop, doing it in VR, when the game is modded properly, is a whole other experience. It doesn't matter how many monitors or surround sound headphones you use, nothing beats that first time you put on a headset and wake up to Ralof saying \"Hey, you. You're finally awake.\" (Or use Skyrim Unbound and skip the cart ride entirely...).\n\nIf you have a headset and you love open world RPGs, you owe to yourself to get this game and mod it. I can even post my mod list here if it will help. ;-)\n\nWelcome to your new obsession. <3", "timestamp_created": 1669659520, "timestamp_updated": 1669659520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127414179": {"recommendationid": "127414179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050524284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1669574438}, "language": "english", "review": "meh", "timestamp_created": 1669655664, "timestamp_updated": 1669655664, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127403663": {"recommendationid": "127403663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256775452", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1669649750}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

The question is, are the graphics up to VR standards? I would have to say no - not if you are at all sensitive to graphics in VR - i.e. if low-res graphics make you feel queasy. You would then need mods.\nI've tried a number of mods, and whilst many concerned with graphics do help a lot with the pukey feeling, most have failed at some point - often in dark scenes. I'm still trying to find one (or a collection of mods) that make me feel fine throughout.\nIf it weren't for that, it would be difficult to stop playing, despite the regular feeling of same-old, same-old that comes after the first few tasks/quests.  Some of the quests can also get a bit confusing for one reason or another - for this I have obtained two guides available on the internet - one the official strategy guide and the other is the IGN Wiki Guide PDF. I recommend getting these, but it will take you quite a while to read through them, so probably best to use them as reference books when you need or want to know more about a particular game method or quest.

Which is exactly what you need in order to enjoy Skyrim VR. \n\"I think standard Skyrim VR is fine as it is\" You say? Good for you sport. By the way, know that sled you've been playing on? Did you know you can take it to the top of a snowy hill and slide it down? You don't have to just sit on it in your back yard and pretend. It's going to blow your mind when you learn how much fun sledding can be. \n\nBack to Skyrim VR. \nIf you're willing to learn how to use mods, Skyrim VR can be transformed into how it should have been on release. \nFor example. Like role playing? Like building your character's face for 20 minutes? Well, sucks to be you because once you're done, you're a pair of floating hands with no body. \n\"Then why did I just spend 20 minutes building a face?\" Because it was easier to keep it in than to remove it. Character building in VR may as well be Race, Sex, Name, and then done for all the impact it has. \nYou could argue cosmetics does nothing in regular Skyrim but it's fun to walk around in 3rd person and pretend your character lives in Skyrim. But in VR that won't happen. \n\nAlso, why do you want VR Skyrim? \n\"Well, to live in and interact with the world of course!\" \nOkay, but you can't. Your virtual disembodied hands can't physically touch anything. Your sword phases through solid matter and enemies with no collision.\n\nBut with mods, although you'll not be able to see your own face, (at least not with the mods that I use) but you'll have a set of arms. You can walk into a bar and pick up a mug of ale, pretend to get drunk and throw that mug at the barkeep's head. If your companion gets stuck in the door, AGAIN! you can grab her by the hand and drag her aside, give her a smack on the ass and go about your day. \nI killed a man and threw his body into the river. \nOne mod I love, lets you throw weapons and call them back to you like Thor's hammer. Which is instantly more fun than skull F***ing Nazim...  \noh, you don't know who that is? You mustn't get to the Cloud District very often. \n\nI could go on. Or I could show you this. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kFj4DgcJeI&list=LL&index\n\nCompare that to video of Unmodded VR Skyrim. You choose what you want to play.\n\n*Edit\nI've made a few edits, spelling mistakes that I've noticed. \nBut I'd also like to add this link.

The introductory cart ride bugs out in horrific fashion if your headset refresh rate is set higher than 90 hz and, even after fixing that issue, the game itself remains physically uncomfortable to play for even the most experienced of VR gamers.\n\nWhat I'm recommending, then, is [i]modded[/i] Skyrim VR. But on the other hand, modding even non-VR skyrim yourself is an enormous hassle, isn't it? Days or even weeks spent choosing the mods for your perfect vision of the game, playtesting in tiny chunks to find issues that need resolving, then trying to find the source of those issues and resolve them in order to keep the game functional and playable. A whole lot of work just for the hope of having a good time at the end, many would agree. To say nothing of the extra headaches thrown into the mix when you introduce VR into the equation.\n\nSo, how is it that I manage to enjoy Skyrim VR? The answer is a little thing called Wabbajack. Not the ingame item (though there's little doubt as to the source of the name) but rather a piece of software you can easily find with a quick google search. \n\nWabbajack is an automated modlist installer for skyrim (and a selection of other games with active modding communities) that takes the monumental task of modding the game and brings it down to a manageable size. Dedicated users cultivate their own personalized modlists - which are regularly updated, playtested and troubleshooted - for players to choose from and adopt as their own.\n\nMake no mistake, installing a Wabbajack modlist will still be a bit of a chore. But it is nowhere near the insurmountable task it would be to achieve the same result by doing everything yourself. It is as simple as choosing a modlist from the Wabbajack gallery and following any directions the list comes with. Plus, if you happen to run into issues during the process, many modlists have their own dedicated discord servers full of people who might be able to help.\n\nIf you need help choosing a modlist for Skyrim VR in particular, lots of players recommend FUS as a starting point. Personally I play the more intensive Tahrovin modlist, and as a bonus I have found the Tahrovin discord community to be full of genuinely delightful people. I had my chosen modlist up and running within a handful of hours, and when I ran into issues they were quick to offer help.\n\nAs for how much fun the Tahrovin modlist is specifically, well, put it this way: at the time of writing this review, I've put more hours into it than Beat Saber.", "timestamp_created": 1668768265, "timestamp_updated": 1668768265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834928512573242188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125661598": {"recommendationid": "125661598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080112002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1668973113}, "language": "english", "review": "The FULL CREDIT for the positive rating on this review is due ONLY to the modding community. Namely Kvitekvist and his beyond amazing FUS modpack available with Wabbajack. Not only is he passionate, but he is dedicated to the point that he personally assists people in Discord with issues they run into during installation. For not one second do I give credit to Bethesda. They obviously only sought to cash in on \"the VR experience\" by re-re-re-re-releasing Skyrim VR in the state they did.\n\nThat being said if you buy the game do so with full knowledge that the vanilla experience barely scratches the surface of what you can achieve by modding. It requires a bit of patience and effort tech-wise but they're is a ton of support online for doing so.  If you put in the work, the reward you reap will be oh so well earned.\n\nTake it from me. I am using the Cangar preset from the FUS modpack, and I played the tutorial realm for 7 hours. I just stepped through a crystal into Whierun and my mind is blown. I might live here. \n\nAlso worth noting is the price. Do NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS PRODUCT AT FULL $59.99 PRICE. If you do so you deserve to be struck by a falling potted shrubbery.

There's a TL;DR at the bottom, but I encourage you to hear me out in full.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\nThe VR UX being better than FO4 doesn't justify the price in the slightest. If this was a $10-$20 add-on for Special Edition then it would be more than worth it and $25 to maybe $30 standalone would make the most sense if they [i]really[/i] wanted your money, but no, you pay full AAA price for the bare minimum of a VR experience whether you own every single other version of the game or not. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the bare minimum; there's motion sickness settings, gameplay supports 6DOF with touch controllers, and a new main menu where you can walk around and adjust settings. That's it. Everything else is identical to SE, the worst offender being the UI. It's insulting that they believe VR makes up for the blatant laziness/cash grab attempt.\n\nThe biggest issue is the lack of interactivity. The whole point of VR is to truly [i]be[/i] in the world you've entered, but Skyrim VR does everything possible to go in the opposite direction. The Half-Life: Alyx floating hands aren't as charming when they serve as a deceptive illusion instead of a deliberate game design choice. \"Grabbing\" items still functions like the cursor in flat mode and the dated combat is made infinitely more apparent when you're physically swinging your giant warhammer into an unresponsive foe. The only thing they nailed was archery and magic (probably a happy accident from the 6DOF support), which leaves dedicated stamina or spellsword players (me) with the worst experience.\nIf all these glaring issues are so bad, why did I put as much time as I did into it, and why am I playing it immediately after posting this review?\n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\nMods. You already know this. Why it should've just been an SE add-on is one of the reasons it's so good. Since it's literally just Special Edition in VR, 99% of the Special Edition mods work no problem. Download the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/]Vortex mod manager[/url]if you're a casual like me, download [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416]VRIK[/url]so you can actually see the dragon armor you worked so hard for, then download [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43930]HIGGS[/url]and  [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66025]PLANCK[/url]so the VR game you're playing plays like a VR game. [i]This[/i] is what the bare minimum should be, but unfortunately you've got some mods to set up.\n\nWhether it's vanilla or modded, you can't deny the atmosphere. The trees of the Rift, the sound of a calm stream with the harmony of crickets in Riverwood, the night sky cutting through the mountainous vistas of the entire region, all of it is gorgeous in VR and is the most enlightened you can become when playing a video game. I climbed the tower of Faldar's Tooth and just sat and listened to the ambient music as I looked upon a setting sun nestled in the valley of two mountains, its reflection on the nearby lake. I'm surprised I remained mortal.\n\nThe melee combat is laughable, but everything else is sublime. The archery is exactly as VR archery should be. Aiming your Destruction magic at multiple foes at once will activate every dopamine receptor you have. Physically crouching to pickpocket or sneak attack someone will put the dumbest smile on your toaster-head goblin face.\n\nI'm going to dedicate a paragraph to the dragons. Nothing will prepare you for how big they are, and [i]you're[/i] the one slaying them, not your avatar being controlled by some buttons. The music, the scale, even melee combat with a dragon makes you long for every chance you get to devour some souls. Peeking your head over cover only to see an enormous lizard incinerate your entire view with guttural noises will, dare I say, feel just as epic as it did in 2011.\n\n[h1] TL;DR & Conclusion [/h1]\nSkyrim VR gives me my most conflicting opinions I've ever felt. The vanilla gameplay experience for this price tag is borderline malicious. According to Steam I'm leaving a negative review, but because my playthrough is getting hard carried by mods I'm being completely honest when I say this is some of the most fun I've had playing a video game.\n\nGet the game on sale for $12 and it'll be your best 12 dollar purchase in any possible timeline.", "timestamp_created": 1668475573, "timestamp_updated": 1669997706, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 150, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.91605532169342041", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125420208": {"recommendationid": "125420208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043389770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1081, "last_played": 1642045332}, "language": "english", "review": "Only viable if modded, not even close to being worth the full price of ~another~ version of Skyrim", "timestamp_created": 1668357734, "timestamp_updated": 1668357734, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125363499": {"recommendationid": "125363499", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970662150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1668725385}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun to visit the world first hand for sure!\n", "timestamp_created": 1668274878, "timestamp_updated": 1668274878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501312315464019775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125332438": {"recommendationid": "125332438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213267740", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 876, "last_played": 1695505180}, "language": "english", "review": "Without mods it's meh it is just skyrim really but with mods it really becomes a good vr experience", "timestamp_created": 1668229407, "timestamp_updated": 1668229407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501312315464019775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125324301": {"recommendationid": "125324301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063862256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2943, "last_played": 1686151594}, "language": "english", "review": "Very playable and enjoyable once you get a few ESSENTIAL mods.

It's awful and lazy and it is frustrating to know it was, and still is, released at $60 even if this game does include all DLC.\n\nThat said, would I recommend this game if you have the proper PC to run it with some serious mods? Hell yes. Without a doubt, when this game is modded to what the game really should have been already, it is the BEST VR game on the market, to date. There is no other truly open-world VR game you can play, as of writing this review. It's all of Skyrim and all of its DLC locations for you to fully explore in VR. The size and scale of every building, creature and tree is incredible. And with the right lighting and texture overhaul mods, you will find yourself wanting to walk from place-to-place instead of fast traveling just to take it all in.\n\nGo to Nexus Mods, use their Vortex loader, and get yourself, at the very least, the following mods to make this the best VR experience you can get.\n\n-SKSE VR\n-HIGGS\n-PLANCK\n-Paralax 2020 4K\n-SMIM\n-Realistic Lighting Overhaul\n-Realistic Water TWO\n\nJust those mods alone will give you the VR experience you're looking for when exploring Skyrim. The physical body. The ability to pick-up almost anything and manipulate it in VR space. The absolutely gorgeous nights. If you can run this game with good mods, like these, then you will really love playing Skyrim again. If you cannot, then do not.\n\nIn short..

First, I strap on some 5 lb ankle weights (why in a second), then I start up VRocker and configure it (found on Steam and allows you to naturally move), then I start up the game through the sksevr file, and finally enter the game.  You can do all of this from inside the headset, by the way, using the virtual desktop (aside from the ankle weights).  Time from initial setup to being in the game takes less than five minutes for me at this point.\n\nTip: you'll want to copy the sksevr.exe file to your desktop (I prefer directly on the taskbar, as it's right there).  Then just start the virtual desktop from inside the headset, click on the .exe file, and you're in the game!\n\nI also have several texture and weather mods installed: Onyx VR Weathers, HD Skyrim Overhaul, and Noble Skyrim.  Yeah, HDSO and NS overlap a lot, but it doesn't hurt to have them both and they make the game look fantastic and very real.  Seriously, the game looks like shit without texture mods installed to make it look like Skyrim SE.  For some reason, they decided to use Skyrim LE as the base for VR, and it looks really bad.\n\nNow, the game.  Rule number one: Avoid close combat with spiders.  AVOID CLOSE COMBAT WITH SPIDERS.  They are horrifying in VR and always make me run in the opposite direction (literally with VRocker active).  Fortunately, if you're a decent shot with a bow (and you'll become one, trust me), they can be easily dispatched from a distance.  On the other hand, physical combat is really fun with VIRK, HIGGS, and PLANCK installed, and I find myself reaching for my sword more than my bow these days.  Encountering bandits on the road now feels like a genuine threat, especially at a low level.\n\nWith mods (and a few outside extras listed above), Skyrim VR is simply incredible.

Get your Nexus mods account updated because you are about to get tweeeeeaked!\n\nThis is absolutely incredible! The feeling of life in this game I was not expecting. The visuals were just something you cannot describe without seeing it. I have played Skyrim and all DLC countless times, and here i have already put 96 more hours into just the VR version. I anticipate many more. The immersion of sneaking (turn on real sneaking in VR options) and stealth backstabs/archery is just insane. My first cave i was sneaking up to a set of stairs. A skeleton was walking down them and I let loose my arrow. The skeleton fell apart and i could hear each bone tumbling down the stairs. I almost cried! It was so good! Its a million more moments like this where you feel so connected to the game in a way you had not known you were missing in the non VR game. \n\nNow that being said there are still some things... all the time you walk into a room and random items fly around like a poltergeist just got its first set of feels. Sometimes random doorways, and especially rotating gates in some dungeons, wont let you pass and you have to finger bang the thumb-pads to get past. Bridges sometimes do not let you land on them if you had to lower them into place. I did find a save and reload on that often fixed it, but it was still annoying. Once in a while you would hit a mob with an arrow and it would fly into the sky giant style. All of that stuff didnt subtract from the game enough to make me quit. \n\nWould i recommend you pay full price? I want to say no but with the mods it really is wonderful. I would pay it. But DEFINITELY get this on sale. Dont hesitate, just do it. And follow the guide. Some of it is outdated and the mods no longer available, but 90% of it is still there, and some of it is to your own taste anyway. \n\nSpend another couple hundred hours in Skyrim with me.

sorry no fix for that), repeat after me \"i solemnly swear to only play skyrim VR with mods or i will endure todd howards bdsm fetishs till the day i die\".. unless u enjoy pain, torture and suffering at the hands of todd howard that is... then go nock urself out... i mean it... the end part.\n\n        > MODS!!! yea its worth it when you finally get it all up and running the way u want to experience it...  but it can get complicated and can take hours/days to set up properly (if you lack patience or are not a cultured man find something else), trying different mods out, what u like/dont.., specially if you want allot of mods (99% of people do, u probably will as well)... i ended up with a very long list of mods many designed to improve the game visuals and core gameplay :), which can also get taxing on ur potato rig if u get it looking/playing like something more current gen, u have been warned!\n\nso depending on what the mod community is upto at the time of your download... \n\ndo a search for someone who has a uptodate mod list that works for the current version of skyrim VR with the bare essentials to make VR work properly and some life essentials to reduce the pain... \n\ndont go crazy on a massive mod list to start with = probably wont work due to 1001 reasons (unless u have some experience with this kind of thing), start with the basics, make sure it all works following their install guide (make a backup if u can incase things go broke and u dont know how to fix) etc then if it does, you can look at downloading whatever floats your boat, while keeping in mind not all mods will work together, some need additional mods downloaded/installed to work, some need to be placed in a certain load order in your mod list to work properly and some mods have multiple options for install which depending on what u choose, will effect what you will need to look for when downloading additional mods. u want to add ontop which use them as a base/dependency.\n\nor \n\nat this point you could also look at another mod guide which has a bigger list which caters to the what your looking to experience and includes as close to everything you already have installed (most mod guides will have common essential/mandatory mods).\n\noften it pays to run the game after each mod you install with its dependencies, just to make sure u didnt break anything, otherwise it can get annoying if you just installed 50 mods and nothing stands out as to why ur game broke, this is also a potential issue of copying mod guides which include a long list of mods to install, so check the comments under them.\n\nmake sure you read the mod info, some need you to start a new save file, some will break existing save files etc etc.\n\nas a note the adult mods for this game are REALLY good far as visuals go, u have some nice HD Nu** body models, jiggle physics / variety options for key @features@ and many diferent mods to explore the manner in which u wish to enjoy these @features@ be it as a standard scantly clad, dirty talking traveling companion with @extra@ services for when u get tired of killing wildlife... or a mod built ground up to insert new content into the game world or in set locations etc etc... there are even mods for those who want more taboo content or to just turn the game into a virtual brothel... some mods also wont be available on nexus as well, so look up some other sites dedicated to adult content to get the @full@ experience if interested.\n\n            > DISABLE UPDATES ONCE YOU GOT IT ALL WORKING!!!!! unless u want some random todd howard update to break everything... i sugest making a copy of your install and mods if you have the hard drive space, so if something does go broke, you can just roll back and in theory restore it back to working order... and in theory if u dont play it for a year it will still work when you load it up again...\n\nThen only update if u need to / want to... eg new mods need it or certain improvements etc etc\n\n>>>> if i forgot to mention something important, im sure you will find it in another review <<<<\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1658279345, "timestamp_updated": 1658279345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119093969": {"recommendationid": "119093969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061753171", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 2889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1625, "last_played": 1685263980}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a conflicting recommend.\n\nIf you plan to not mod, do not buy this game.

I always regretted that. I did try to play it about a year ago but by then I found the game not that interesting. I wasn\u2019t impressed by the graphics either and for a game that you\u2019d have to spend 100\u2019s of hour in, I wasn\u2019t feeling it at all.\n\nFast forward to today. Installed Skyrim VR and immediately was impressed by the immersion level and the feeling of actually being in a big open world. The controls were not very impressive but serviceable while the graphics looked a lot better than I remembered. Probably because VR games in general have pretty lousy graphics, I found the Skyrim graphics quite good.\n\nThen I figured, why not mod Skyrim? Took me about a day to install a modpack (which was quite easy for even a novice like me, the downloads just took forever). Installed Wabbajack en got the FUS modist. Wow! Just wow! Graphics all of a sudden went from cool to fantastic and the gameplay\u2026 oh man, the gameplay. It actually feels like a proper VR game now. I can interact with stuf, see my body with the armor I\u2019ve got equipped, use spell wheels, hear 3D sound, etc etc. This now has become one of the most immersive games I\u2019ve ever played. At this point, I\u2019m happy I didn\u2019t play the original. Going in fresh is utterly magnificent.\n\nAfter Half life Alyx, I found most other VR games rather boring (maybe with the exception of RE4 VR). I had my Quest 2 laying around for months with nothing I wanted to play. This holiday I bought a bunch of VR games, including Skyrim VR. Skyrim was the last game I tried. I knew I had to mod it if I wanted to best experience and the prospect of that was pretty daunting. Turns out it\u2019s literally child\u2019s play with modlists and tools like wabbajack. \n\nSo yeah, I know this isn\u2019t a typical review. It\u2019s just me gushing about my experience. But, I just HAD to share that this game, modded, is fantastic if you like rpg\u2019s. Last time I was so immersed in a game was when playing HL: Alyx. I recommend Skyrim to anyone with a decent PC and a VR headset. Non of the videos you\u2019ll watch about Skyrim VR can really convey how it actually feels in VR. \n\nThis is overall one of the greatest experiences I had playing any game, it\u2019s THAT good!

But when you add enough mods, it becomes freakin' amazing for today.  I have the luxury of a 3090 and a G2 headset and SVR suitably modded looks real enough to touch.\n\nMore mods expand the map.  There are expansion mods for SVR that are as big as whole titles from other publishers.  The community is amazing.  You can play SVR as a survival game, a stealth/theft game, a hardcore combat game, or enable a couple of cheats and just stroll around sight seeing (and the sights are worth it -- some of the most beautiful scenery and architecture in gaming).  There are many different character types, many different storylines, huge replay value.\n\nSkyrimVR is not really a game, it's more of a hobby or a way of life.  It's a real-feeling place that you visit, a vacation from the real world, like a waking dream that you can step into whenever you want.  SkyrimVR is what VR promises:  another world.  It's fully open and fully modelled -- go off the paths, head into the bush, orienteer your way ad lib around an expansive, scenic landscape.  Until you hit the map boundaries there will be no limits, no \"back sides\" to things -- it's all modelled all the way down.\n\nI have a lot of VR titles and I've enjoyed most of them, from casual toony sims to fairly sophisticated A-list games, but the one I never get tired of, never get bored with, always come back to... is SkyrimVR.  Give it a try if you seek immersion, gee-wow vistas, humblingly huge structures and spaces, atmosphere, occasional creeps and jump scares, elaborate combat, magical spells, a ridiculously complex lore, and quirky NPCs who are only too eager to tell you their life stories.\n\nIt's the title that would not die, and there are reasons for that.  SkyrimVR is the best single reason to buy a headset, and one of the most compelling demos you could ever show to a friend, to explain to them what VR can do.", "timestamp_created": 1655358305, "timestamp_updated": 1655358305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699395596981048584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117043886": {"recommendationid": "117043886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122864373", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1655329252}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a quick reminder:\nBlade and Sorcery is 1/3rd the cost,\nBoneworks is 1/2 the cost,\nboth of which are far more immersive and offer a more comprehensive vr experience by actually being able to interact with the world around you,\n\nyou're paying 60 bucks for a barely functional game you might get to work and be worth it if you dump a load of mods into it and play through an 11 year old story.\nDon't give Todd more money", "timestamp_created": 1655329890, "timestamp_updated": 1655330236, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626315474510192871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117036775": {"recommendationid": "117036775", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049455100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1694752152}, "language": "english", "review": "classic, Just VR. dont use mods unless you a striaght nerd or you will fuck everything up\n", "timestamp_created": 1655319741, "timestamp_updated": 1655319741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45267486572265625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116993208": {"recommendationid": "116993208", "author": {"steamid": "76561199009896562", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1656134995}, "language": "english", "review": "this is not a vr game", "timestamp_created": 1655242622, "timestamp_updated": 1655242622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116991423": {"recommendationid": "116991423", "author": {"steamid": "76561199283040031", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "playtime_at_review": 1297, "last_played": 1699769994}, "language": "english", "review": "dis game is shit whithout mods, but i whent down that rabit hole, i pro ble had the greatest vr experancre any human chould have.", "timestamp_created": 1655239908, "timestamp_updated": 1655239908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116955383": {"recommendationid": "116955383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214880295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 655, "last_played": 1660897156}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the games that VR was most meant for.

Combining the VRIK, HIGGS, and PLANCK mods (with honorable mentions of Conduit, Weapon Throw VR, and Spell Wheel VR) fundamentally revolutionizes the experience by letting your character and equipment physically interact with the world.  Seeing these mods demonstrated were what motivated me to finally take the plunge into VR.\n\nGrab a potion and run to a dark corner before pocketing it.  Shake hands with a newly met NPC.  Grab someone's shoulder if they start to walk away before you're done talking to them.  Chuck a tankard at someone to start a bar fight.  Slit a bandit's throat and carry the body away over your shoulder before the others see something wrong.  Throw a battleaxe and behead Nazeem from across the street, then use his corpse as a shield from the arrows of disgruntled guards.  Suplex a dead dragon to add insult to injury.

I would say get it for around $20 or less because it's not a perfect VR integration (combat is a bit jank specially bow and arrows), but it is very enjoyable and skyrim has always had a lot of things to do.", "timestamp_created": 1654025572, "timestamp_updated": 1654025572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116293388": {"recommendationid": "116293388", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064504151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1668401457}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun game as long as you get the right mods from nexus for it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1654013465, "timestamp_updated": 1654013465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116289969": {"recommendationid": "116289969", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049308058", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1657189238}, "language": "english", "review": "its skyrim.. but vr.

You need to filter out the mods that won't work in VR and those only [i]theoretically [/i]work but in fact infeasible due to VR limitations, and carefully assemble your curated mod list together only to hope that it runs within the narrow happy zone between minecraft graphics and burning your machine to ashes.\n\n[b]Second, you will have to live with the stutters, screen tears and bugs that are not only annoying, but literally hazardous to your physical health. [/b]The very advantage of VR's immersion makes any glitches much more dangerous to overcome. There're too many mod glitches and performance issues that will transform your headset screen to powerpoint slides, a spinning tumble washer, or van gogh's gallery.

I currently have around 60 active mods going on this game because the mods that work on Skyrim Special Edition also work on Skyrim VR, for the most part. The result? Many unofficial bug fixes, NPC and player models are improved dramatically, many of the statis objects are complete re-textured in HD, the level-up system is re-worked, you can see your own player model looking down (which is not in vanilla Skyrim VR, mind you), NPCs idle and day-to-day activities are re-worked to be more immersive, more weapons are added, more armor is added, more enemies are added, spells are re-worked, nightime skies are HD and cycle between galxies and northern lights, daytime looks privy to Minecraft HD sun shaders, and so, so, so much more.\n\nThe reviews of this game are painfully bad on Steam, but with a little trail and error with modding, you can turn this into one of the coolest, immersive VR experiences out there. This is only thanks to the community of people who love the Elder Scrolls games enough to create so many mods that the game is practically unrecognizable compared to how Bethesda left it.\n\nBuy this game on sale (usually for $20) when the next big sale comes around, install Vortex, watch a few tutorials, and have a blast.

With no hand interactions and just simple controller I/O from the base game, one could wonder if this game could simply have been released as a DLC of the base game, instead of a whole new release. Mods are the saviour of this game though, as with them you can make it a true VR experience.\nThe Story is exactly the same as the base game, with no changes whatsoever. Some of the perspectives have changes, you can look around while interacting with characters, but that is about it.\nThe Gameplay receives the most changes. The inventory now is managed through a fly-in menu that changes position based on which way you are looking when it was opened. Weapons can be swung much quicker than they should be, magic is fun and really good with the destruction school, and bows are made much more manual, requiring the loading of arrows. Bows clearly received the most attention with the VR port, with magic receiving the least, as not much needed changing. Melee weapons are weird, as clearly some work was done but dual handed weapons are clearly much better than single handed, and can actually be swung at a similar rate to single handed.\nOverall, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR is a fun port of Skyrim, but ultimately is a very lazy port. Mods can make it better, but essentially its the same Skyrim we know and love. It could have been so much more, or could have just been bundled as a DLC, but is overpriced in its current state.\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR gets a 6/10.\n\nFor more reviews check my Steam profile\nHope you enjoyed my review, god bless you", "timestamp_created": 1653230635, "timestamp_updated": 1653230635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115847327": {"recommendationid": "115847327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330309244", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3626, "last_played": 1683187559}, "language": "english", "review": "it was great.

First of all, it is ridiculously blurry for no reason, much like hitman VR. Making VR combat like this should be a crime, and the fact that Bethesda just did the bare minimum and then completely re-released the game is disgusting to me.

The fact that the game is not built for VR is painfully obvious.\n\n- Combat \n\nMelee is far worse than playing normally, your strikes have no strength in them, so combat consists of you just slashing at the foe while it slashes back at you. It just isn't fun at all. It lacks all the possibilities and potential that it being an VR game gives. Bethesda didn't even try.\n\n- Movement \n\nMovment in vr feels extremely awkward and clumsy, in combat, you have to run after enemies, alike bowmen and wozards, normally not an issue, but because of the throughly unenjoyable chore that it is in VR, it is infuriating. The lack of buttons available, means that many actions are performed with the same button, which works about as well as you might imagine, it doesn't.\n\n- Interaction with objects and the world\n\nThis is perhaps the only good side in playing this game in VR, and it isn't much either. the ability to look around by turning your head is nice and all, but it gets old very quickly, considering how much of an burden the gameplay otherwise is. Interacting with objects is, poor at best, even with some top mods available. Most of the time, when you try to grab an item from a shelf, and place it in your inventory, which is done by putting your hand behind your head, the detection fails and the item drops to the ground like an overglorified rock. INFURIATING. A feature that was supposed to improve gameplay, ends up infinitely worsening it.\n\n\n- In conclusion\n\nSkyrim in VR is not a game. it is a chore, unpleasant to play, that doesn't provide an experience that surpasses the base game, in any way. I have used several mods during my playtime, most designed to improve the experience, but this doesn't quite work out well, the base game just, is not fit for an enjoyable VR game.  1/5", "timestamp_created": 1652374688, "timestamp_updated": 1652374766, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509536802768707275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115339633": {"recommendationid": "115339633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044361021", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1704, "last_played": 1652015101}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] TLDR: crappy as-is, awesome with mods, use Wabbajack [/b]\nThis game can either be the worst, most basic VR game ever.

So why am I recommending it? Because like every Bethesda game, mods solve all of its problems. \n\nModded Skyrim VR is the most immersive and interactive VR experience I've had so far. It's a full AAA title with hundreds of hours of content, and while Skyrim was an ugly game even by 2011 standards it looks quite nice compared to most VR titles. HIGGS, VRIK, 3D Sound; various texture, ENBs and static mesh improvement mods serve to finish the job Bethesda started and turn Skyrim into a VR title worth playing. This is technically the Skyrim Special Edition, so you also have access to six years of user generated content. \n\nSkyrim on its original release was a disappointment for me. It felt watered down and shallow compared to its predecessors. But replaying it in VR with all these mods has given me a new appreciation for the game. Actually being there, in the room, face to face with the characters is a completely different experience than just staring at them on a screen. You find yourself roleplaying more - crossing your arms during a conversation, reaching out to \"grab\" an item an NPC hands you, sitting on chairs, eating food etc. \n\nIn conclusion, do NOT buy this game unless it's on sale (don't pay any more than $30 for this) and you're willing to put in the effort to heavily mod it. Otherwise you're just throwing away your money.

After another 2 days I appear to have a stable copy going.  Maybe the CC (thanks youtube, not the confusing guides) and best mods ported.  Maybe I got a decent substitute for survival mode.  Maybe, etc.  There's still nothing else like it, or I'd get something else working to scratch this itch.  I got the some sorta similar VR games, but as old as this is it still holds the title.  I was playing No Man's Sky for a bit, but realized how empty it feels in comparison (different genre I know) so I re-installed.  It is a neat take on a familiar game.  Still rage-angry, though :)\n\n----------------\n\nNegative, so much that I just did a rage un-install.\n\nLet me back up, I played the original to death on the Xbox.  I played SE and AE on PC, with a million mods running.  I even deleted it a couple times, because it got old but there's nothing like it.  I even played it in Spanish and German to help my language skills.\n\nI just got an Index, and this was the first game I wanted to play.  I spent three days trying to get it to work the way I wanted.  I had the main mods installed.  The dealbreakers were the Survival Mode and the Creation Club.  \n\nBasically, AE has many cool creation club mods.  The survival mode is awesome.  I wanted those to work.  Survival is a non-starter, I downloaded lesser nexusmods versions.  Ok, I can live with that.  I spent 1.5 days following an arduous process to try and get my creation club DLC to work, which in theory it can, and I gave up.  And I got so mad I deleted everything to do with Skyrim from my computer, so I can never try again.  I've gotten enough enjoyment out of this game.\n\nActual review from the 50 minutes I played, I started off impressed, the scale and the VR are awe-inspiring.  If only I could get it to work like I wanted... there are better, modern games to waste my time on.\n\nThe first thing Magellen did when reaching the New World, was burn all the ships.

Now onto my review with mods.\n\nWith mods, this game is more than salvagable. I am talking character creation, visible body, being able to physically grab things, weapon throwing, etc. Most mods for Skyrim SE are compatible with this, either by default or with mod patches. Weapon play feels great other than bows which still suffer from odd controls with or without mods.\n\nNow, I know most people would probably say that rating a game based on a non-vanilla experience is wrong, but I don't feel like this game should be passed on if you have the patience to mod and troubleshoot, I just don't believe the game is anywhere near worth full price.

They all give Skyrim VR the features needed to be such a fantastic VR game as it should because in all honesty, Skyrim and VR would work so well together if Bethesda put more effort into the port and these mods show it.

So, if you're considering buying this game, make sure to mod it to enjoy it at its fullest.\n\nTLDR: If you want to play Skyrim VR, Use VRIK, HIGGS and PLANCK.

(im still playing half life Alyx I do love the game and I played it before Skyrim, but Skyrim's freedom is incredible in VR) I love magic! I have exactly 84 mods loaded to enhance the game to my liking. ( Going for an only mage build here. I love magic.  Using mods like spell siphon, and arcane with some magic balance mods. In addition to upping the graphics with some added shaders, and npc models. To make the game look like it came out within the last 4 years.  Most importantly HIGGS. You will thank me later if you install it.) Did I mention I love magic??\n\nThese all instantly turned a vr game that lacked much immersion,  to a game that has fully  immersed me and keeps me for hours. Suddenly I can touch everything in the game (which isnt cool at all in unmodded since you need to press (a) on your controller to interact all the time) the textures were beautiful! The people looked fantastic and magical, I was throwing magic left, right and center. I was petting cats, ( yes I added cat mods) touching and bumping into people, accidentally getting caught trying to drink someones blood (great clip), fighting dragons, you know the typical skyrim stuff. \nEven better is that im very new to skyrim. So after playing a little bit on pc, a couple months later my friend gifted it to me for vr for my birthday.    (shoutouts to Arthur, big homie)    My mind has been simply blown ever since. \n\nI strongly suggest when you are looking to buy this, learn how to use mods, and a mod manager! Which is very important. Nexusmods.com is amazing, trust me they make it easy to do. You will thank me later!

You do not perfrom a good deflection or counter blow specific to the enemy's action and your weapon  swing and the collision with your opponent has little to no impact on damage. Also your shield only blocks arrows when held in a specific position so that you cannot block attacks and arrows coming from the side and you must turn first which means you can only defend against the guy in front of you.\n\nI played this game a bit and mostly just toyed around before switching to other smaller VR games with less content and \"inferior\", but maybe more functional  graphics that are simply more fun to actually play.\n\nAs I write this now there is an increasing number of \"real\" VR games in the RPG style that better show what VR can do and how much fun it can be.\n\nStill giving it a thumbs up because it does show VR can work well with a full scale RPG setting and it has all the AAA stuff you can't get from a true VR game so it is a good transition in the early days of VR.", "timestamp_created": 1646183493, "timestamp_updated": 1650425986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494699656963348389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111319334": {"recommendationid": "111319334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871760309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1645997763}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: It was the first time I was scared of fighting wolves, bow and arrow looks really cool, casting spells looks nice but it's really weird since it wil not go from where your palms are pointing but actually where your arms are :/\nCons: The game without mods is just impossible, with mods is more possible to play, but still most textures will be 2d, which look awful in VR, the game offers no keybind modification out of the box, so it's a STRUGGLE to learn how to play it.

If you are going to buy it my advice is to buy it on sale. \n\nAt the time of this writing I think I've spent about as much time fighting with mods as I have playing the game, but I think I've finally hit a decent balance and can stop playing the introduction to the game on loop while trying to make sure things aren't going to explode. \n\nThere are a lot of other high fantasy VR games out there but from what I have seen of most of them at best they look like highly polished tech demos. While the Elder Scrolls VR Port certainly shows it's age it's the most complete world.

Everything else remains mostly unchanged, including menu controls and minigames and all the tedium that brings.\nThe VR version was quickly abandoned after release, ceasing official support and updates. As such the engine the VR version is running on has lagged several years behind and is missing many new features that have since become exclusive to Skyrim: Special Edition, such as the Creation Club, along with the [b]ESL[/b] (light) flag for plugins. This means the VR version has a hard cap of [i]255[/i] plugins activated at a time, severely limiting how many mods you can have installed at once.\n\n\nThe only reason I'm leaving this as a positive review is because I find myself genuinely enjoying playing in VR with mods more than the flat-screen version (barring physical and technical limitations), the game feels so much more immersive and engrossing to play in VR.\n\nSomething as simple as being able to physically grab and pick up something in your hand, or wielding two-handed weapons with both hands (vanilla you use two-handed weapons with one hand) is missing from the vanilla experience and only accomplished through mods.
