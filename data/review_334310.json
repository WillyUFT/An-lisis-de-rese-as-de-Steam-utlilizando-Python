Things like getting a penalty to your religion if you attack a neighbor of the same religion make sense, but the AI in this game *never forgives* certain actions, meaning eventually you can get stuck into a negative faith cycle of excommunication, permanent inquisitors, fragmenting generals, which can undo hours of progress. Then there are things like not being able to repeat dungeon runs infinitely- I'd much rather have the opportunity to grind against a harder version of the current difficulty and give up structures being almost totally destroyed on revisit. \n\nThe minigames also really wear out their welcome quickly. Pick the right order of cards based on hints gets so repetitive, and there's no variation.

At the same time it's created a very straightforward and relatively easy to master way of playing that it rewards you for.\n\n\nBelow I go further in depth into some issues that were reported by other reviewers and I add some of my own along with some likes as well.\n\n* a big complaint I see is battle morale, This issue is created by giving the player the ability to halt and to switch units (after research) This in turn, facilitated a need for a measure that forces the player to engage and play combat as it's 'supposed' to be played. This measure comes in the form of your morale slowly ticking down, or to put it in a more complete way, the enemy will get consistent rewards for successful defence that ticks faster when you're stationary and not making progress/engaging. \nThis makes sense, because they're going more for a boardgame feel than an actual siege/middle ages simulator.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to me is how your troops morale works outside of the sieges. So, you've just won a siege easily taking only 1 block of hp damage on your tanking units? Alright, well, you'd expect your troops morale to go up, right? No! Still goes down. This gets to be a pain more and more the more you grow, as you'd find out that you no longer have enough generals to do anything in the church. Especially playing on the world map.\n\n* Another complaint I've seen is how the game drags on, reviewer stated they'd rather just play CK2, which I find really funny, because there exists no game slower. A Completed world free play game took me as long as my playtime at time of review, whereas I've only once completed (full conquest) a CK2 game and it took me almost a full week.\n\n* combat is very cheese-able,  Need to defend? 3 cavalry and cycle charges, enemy will take maybe one block of health from each cavalry early on, even less on later upgrades.\nNeed to attack in early? \nJust take it slow, walls stay demolished over time unless repaired, destroy a wall, retreat > repeat untill conquered. There is no punishment for retreating (except losing the resources invested in the attack). \nIn late? \nTake the best siege tower available to you at the time, General with 5 spots, stack 2 melee > 2 ranged (crossbow + bow) + healers. With 4 spots, remove one melee. \nWith 2 rows of melee you can just roll through, with 1 row you can stay 1 tile away from the enemy while you let your crossbows + bows shoot over the gap. This negates the morale in battle issue as eventhough you're not really in combat (you're not getting attacked if you move with a bit of attention) you are still dishing out damage and getting objectives, thus adding to your morale score.\n\n* Dialog is really really repetitive, they have literally 1 thing they say over and over again. Minigames for the catholic faith are a drag, the hot and cold diplomacy game is really really boring, and I've no idea how the icon guessing minigame works even after completing my match. It seems to me that there isn't enough time to be wasting on two convincing attempts (some units make you guess up to 5 icons, try to get that right on the first go) for it to even matter. Especially as you continue and become huge it just seems to be a \"I dont like you\" game, not an \"I do what's actually best for my country\" game.\n\n* Suffers from the same issue most diplomatic relationship calculation issues that most games do. Everything is relation, relation, relation, nothing is logical thinking. If you're the island of Cyprus, and ALL of the world around you is owned by 1 mega empire, you're not still gonna wage war on the unit, you'll do whatever you can to keep them happy...\n\n* The 'barbarian' tribes are not a fun mechanic, it's really annoying you cannot conquer them once and for all. if the berbers, celts, mongols and hashinshin keep using the same base of operations every single time, just occupy them so they can't. But, instead, you're forced to keep fighting wave after wave of useless incursions, spending a ton of your military might on wasted battles.\n\n* combat is a bit static, almost never do you have battle on a plain (only when a city with broken walls is being attacked), you're always either sieging walls, or defending siege walls. They tried to make battle dynamic by forcing engages but, they kinda failed because you're always at an overwhelming advantage or an overwhelming disadvantage. Regardless, even if you did have pure army battles, the side with more cavalry would just win regardless, as you can just cycle charges, almost completely disabling the enemies ability to deal any damage.\n\n* There's not a lot of events.\n\n* It takes a pretty long time getting a decent army going, i'd love a bunch more variations in troops.\n\n* animation are fun.\n* game is colorful.\n* has a good pace.\n* would probably be fun in multiplayer (idk if the game has any, I've only played one free mode world map so far).\n* jokes are relatively funny dry humor.

I had my cat walk over the keyboard while the EULA was displaying, which fixed that problem for me.\n\nPlebby Quest: The Crusades has the ridiculous, laughable price of $20 USD, for which you could easily get any number of older AAA games, let alone the sheer number of free games available on Steam.  This is more expensive than a Crusader Kings or Total War style game, which much higher production values, deeper and better gameplay, and superior graphics.   It's really hard to recommend this console game to PC gamers over that.  Aside from the price, I might even be inclined to give this a \"maybe\", because it does come a close 4th or 5th runner up in the race to being a good grand strategy... but Valve doesn't give us a \"maybe\" option. \n\nGiven the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.

You also cannot manipulate your neighbours, nor do your relationships with them mean anything. You can be allies with a kingdom for a decade but if you expand a little they will hate you immediately because of the 'wary of your territorial aspirations' and 'jealous of your growth' debuffs.\n\n-The AI plays dirty and doesn't follow the same rules as you do. They rarely get impacted by resource constraints or religion. Every city could have maximum dissent yet they couldn't care in the slightest. It simply doesn't effect them. I've also never seen any country get organically excommunicated by their religion. I say organically because some countries are scripted to get excommunicated or start with extremely low trust with their religion, like the Sultanate of Rum.\n\n-Religion punishes you hard for playing the game. You're usually going to be surrounded by countries with the same religion as you, so attacking them is essentially a death sentence unless you have some blessings that affect religion. Most blessings that can be obtained are nearly all useless except for the 'Forgive War Brothers', 'Transfer Capital', 'Small/Large Trust in Religion' and a few others. You will rarely get these however, and are guaranteed a useless blessing like a resource one, 'Small Diplomacy Points', which grants you a permanent three relations to any non-Outlaw nation, which is the same as sending a liaison, and 'Outlaw Diplomacy Points'. Outlaws are also affected by the 'wary of your territorial aspirations' and 'jealous of your growth' debuffs despite being bandits and not owning any land.\n\n-You have zero influence on the AI or world - only deciding which country you're going to takeover next. If your army gets powerful enough (or you just expand a lot) countries will fear you, which basically means they will rarely, if ever, attack you. After taking over a country or two a faction will form in which your enemies (or friends (why?)) will plot against you. Essentially you will never be able to be friends with them and if you already are friends with them relations will degrade and you can't really stop it. There is also a yearly council meeting for everyone who is in the same religion as you. It is borderline useless however, as I've explained earlier there is zero depth to diplomacy, or anything in this game. Accusing heresy upon other kingdoms does nothing except maybe lower relations with other kingdoms (which isn't very useful). You can accuse a kingdom of harbouring witches or pagans but this is only useful if you yourself plan to attack the kingdom as the AI is too stupid to take advantage of a kingdom losing one or even some of it's generals. You should really only prevent proposals that affect your country as that does negatively affect you in a big way (unlike the AI kingdoms...)\n\nThe game also has scripted events that make certain country's generals revolt, in which you can't stop them (at all). So if you expand in the direction of the scripted revolting general's capital, congratulations! Have fun forking over all that territory to them without any resistance. You also better have a good relationship with your religion because if you don't they're going to get angry at you for taking back what's rightfully yours.\n\nDon't buy this game.

The actions one can take are more tedious then addictive (constantly devoting a general to quiet rebellions, repetitive mini-games, etc.).\n\nThe first scenario seems to be a tutorial of sorts, and it is fair for that purpose. There are multiple attempts at humor, which come off as really stupid and intrusive, as many clicks are required to get past the lame dialogue to try and figure out what the hell I'm supposed to be doing.\n\nAside from nothing really special going on game play wise, there were a few mechanics that I outright didn't like. Many of the actions you can take are in the form of mini-games, some of which require dexterity based timing. I'm straight-up not looking for dexterity challenges in my turn-based gaming. Leveling up troops is also a pain, as you essentially need to sacrifice a duplicate squad to level up.

It takes a little while and can be quite expensive if you dont have a lot of money. Just dont lose a battle with them or they could be captured (unless you retreat, which you have to research!?!) and you wasted all that money and time...\n\nOne of the other major problems also has to do with the combat. Not all regions are connected to every region and if any region becomes disconnected from your capital youll lose it and any other regions that become disconnected as well. This can be quite frustrating, and the regions that were yours will be gobbled up by all the other countries in the region. It feels bad and i hate it.

I'm sorry for the negative review, the game is not good for me due to broken expectations. Some other people may love it.\n\nThe tag in the game description says it is casual, yet it enforces savescumming. The game provides extensive save management, hotkeys and gives 2x - 5x multipliers to your performance if you use savescumming. If you don't,  you are handicapped. If you do, the game becomes a hard grind, especially in coin-flipping minigames. \n\nThe game is hard. I spent 20 hours to complete 80% of the first scenario, even with save scumming. It is not casual in the sense of difficulty as well.\n\nThe marketing compares the game to Crusader Kings. I was able to play CK without savescumming. CK is a strategy game, and this one is not despite using the \"strategy\" tag.\n\nThe strategy genre assumes some planning and plan execution. Here are some things which prevented planning:\n* The absence of logistics means that the enemy can strike anywhere. You can deploy defensive force anywhere as well.\n* Diplomacy becomes obsolete after you conquer the first enemy. All fear and hate you. All diplomacy options become money sink.\n* The same battle played several times can have different outcomes due to random morale changes\n* Save scumming makes planning useless\n\nHere are strategies I've found so far:\n* Some neighbors can trade with you in the beginning for some time\n* Develop tier 3 units, upgrade them in the black market, strike the target multiple times\n* Have a rested general with troops to repel an attack\n* Grab any city which has broken walls\n* Reload\n\nThe RPG element in the game is quite fun.

Some nations can have their own specificites in terms of armies, so you will have to adapt to confront them. Even if you start snowballing, all AIs will start turning against you as you're become the logical great Threat. It was even a bit too much, but thanks to the last patch it is now quite perfect.\n\nSpecial missions-wise, you start with Sultanate of Rum which is kind of tutorial, then you will play as the Two Sicilies which is quite much more difficult, but really interesting. Finally you play as the HRE, it is harder but also way more subject to RNG which made it more frustrating to me.\n\nI would just love one thing : to be able to create or RE-create leagues.

It brings the characters a lot more personality and sometimes feels like you are following a story of the character you are playing.\nWhat I really expected from seeing the game was that all countries would be playable, I got all exited to play as England just to find out that you can only play a very select few countries and that the map is even cut short on most places (most of modern day Russia is in the fog, England is only a slight lower half, etc).\nDon't get me wrong I've enjoyed the game a lot and love the art work. \nI play a lot of Strategy games in my time so I noticed a few weird things when playing the story mode/campaign.\n\nDiplomacy is kinda hard to really do on a global scale and needs tweaking.\nThe first nation (north) you are supposed to go to war with doesn't give up ever, even if you take all but 1 of his cities he won't surrender and your global relations just turn to warmonger, everyone will hate you.\nAlso to make people your friend you need to either trade or give them a gift. Trading ill talk about later but the gift is always a diamond, if you don't have a diamond mine then this will be a very rare resource to you.\n\nYour income isn't really that clear. In your income you also see your expenses and it wasn't really clear on what some of the things meant. It's just a name and not really any extra info on what your spending is.\nTrading needs improvement. \n\nI like the trading overall, the AI wants to trade with you fairly quickly for mutual benefit but you can only trade to your neighbours. So even if you share an ocean/water route to that nation you can't trade with them. Or if you are trading with a nation between you 2 you still can't trade with them.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game, there is room for some minor improvements and some aspects like the map and playability of nations i don't agree with and hope the developers have it on their Trello board.", "timestamp_created": 1599057923, "timestamp_updated": 1599057923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541854500770568848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75323517": {"recommendationid": "75323517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085122675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1600613235}, "language": "english", "review": "very silly and very fun", "timestamp_created": 1599050454, "timestamp_updated": 1599050454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484048426151275635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75319768": {"recommendationid": "75319768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136895201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 492, "last_played": 1659753832}, "language": "english", "review": "Im loving the game!

Here the world map is cute and still manages to be quite accurate. Character models are also really great, having a lot of facial expressions despite being only rectangles.\n\n- The combat system / troops: the combat is great because instead of sending your troops and waiting for a result, you actually have to give orders on a 2D battle interface. It requires a lot more strategy than just having a larger army than your opponent. There are also a lot of special troops in the game (elephants, greek grenadiers, plague doctors, ...) which can synergise well with other troops.\n\n- Meetings: each month in the game can have a special meeting (parliament, religious proposals, ...) where you can take decisions that will influence your game; Another great feature.\n\n- Religion system, generals, ressources, ... There are a lot of other great features!\n\nCONS:\n\n- Passing turn can be frustrating due to other country's decisions popping up all the time\n- Alliances need to be reworked due to the fact that they are very limited in actions (ex.: cannot enter an ally war if you do not border the enemy)\n- Late game parliaments decisions tend to reward less research points\n- Roads and naval routes feel a bit weird since you can only attack from them\n- Minigames can get annoying late game (maybe have a research that makes them automatic?)\n\nOverall, this is a really great game that every fan of grand strategy / 4X games should look into!", "timestamp_created": 1598352582, "timestamp_updated": 1598352890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76289898157119751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74726294": {"recommendationid": "74726294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044328439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2381, "last_played": 1598106921}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.", "timestamp_created": 1598107018, "timestamp_updated": 1598107018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74517856": {"recommendationid": "74517856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085830894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 932, "last_played": 1597873531}, "language": "english", "review": "not very good at this game yet but damn if its not fun", "timestamp_created": 1597772692, "timestamp_updated": 1597772692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469798654317855835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73501446": {"recommendationid": "73501446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095262938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1025, "last_played": 1596319314}, "language": "english", "review": "DEUS VULT, INFIDEL!

The writing is interesting and doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes for some fun interactions between characters. The combat could use some work; it's a bit too obtuse for my liking and a bit counter-intuitive. Also, freeplay is fun, but the ai can be a bit weird; it will do things like break alliances one turn and then reform them the next, over and over and over again. Another weird thing is that alliances become very bothersome rather than helpful; because you can't attack from allied territory, allies of those around you just means you can't expand. The 'pirate' provinces that respawn threats are also somewhat annoying, but they don't respond that often to be an issue. \n\nI'd say that overall, it's a fun and charming little game.

Follow The Cpt Froggy Club Curator Page for plenty more![/b][/url][/quote] \n\nOn the main menu screen, you\u2019ll find New Game, Load, Achievements, Encyclopedia, Options, User Report and Quit. Selecting to play a new game will allow you to choose one of two game modes, Scenario and Free Play. I chose to play scenario, which then opened a world map covering from England to the Middle East. You will also notice three characters scattered on the map, Arslan II, Roger II and Siriya. Roger II and Siriya are currently locked so you\u2019ll have to select Arslan II for now until you unlock the other two characters to play. Playing as Arslan II \u2013 The Game of Princes will only allow you to play part of the overall map where all three characters were displayed. The map consists of seventeen kingdoms. Arslan II is the son of Mesud I who\u2019s the ruler of the kingdom Sultanate of Rum, which lies roughly in the centre of all the kingdoms.  \n\nThe date is August 1174 and Kilij Arslan II has been brought back home after spending time in Mosul. Arslan II thinks he\u2019s about to inherit the throne from his father. However, Mesud I had heard about Arslan II loitering outside the inn and whistling at women, smoking shisha with hoodlums and signing all day and night instead of doing his studies. Because of this your father wants you to start earning your keep and work for the kingdom. Thinking you\u2019re going to oversee some elite training or put in charge of some grand project. However, your duty is nothing so grand, instead you\u2019ll be on police duty as there is a mob of starving pagans heading towards our kingdom. \u201cNow begins the legend of the prince who returned!\u201d \u2026 \n\nYour first mission is policing the armed rabble within your capital Iconium. Before you can put an end to the rabble causing trouble in your capital, you\u2019ll first need an army. To do this you\u2019ll need to select Arslan II\u2019s icon in the bottom left hand corner. This is where any generals you\u2019re in command of are available to you, currently there\u2019s only Arslan II. Once selected a small window will appear, here you\u2019ll find information on that general. The information on the General consists of Class and Level, their Religious Belief and where they are Native from. Your general\u2019s icon displays the types of army under their command, any perks and their mood. You will also find Mosque, Inn, Commence, Police, Repair Walls, Rest along with Barracks, Granting Gift and Dismiss. \n\nSelecting Barracks open a window displaying your current army, to begin with you only have slots for two units, you can unlock more as your general gains a higher level. On the right side of the window is Reserves, here you\u2019ll find any reserve armies at your disposal. To begin with you have a couple units of Infantry, the units are far from elite units, more like peasants and farmers. Selecting one of the units will give you a couple options, Move to Army and Train, later you will be able to Award Medals here. Move to Army will move that unit to one of your empty army slots. Each army has a number of Health and Experience Points, along with any awarded medal.  \n\nWith your armies selected you may want to train them if you have the gold, this will turn your Infantry to Veteran Infantry. After which the Train button will change to Tier Upgrade, this will cost some Gold and Sugar (for infantry, other units have different requirements). This will then turn your veteran infantry into a spearman unit, you can then train your new spearmen into veteran spearmen, tier upgrade into a new unit and so-on. When tier upgrading a unit, sometimes you\u2019ll have a choice of unit to create such as, a veteran slinger can be upgraded to either an Archer or Crossbowman. \n\nIn combat your General is on the left side of the battle screen with your enemy on the right. Across the top of the screen is yours and the enemy\u2019s unit size, your army is in red and the enemy\u2019s in blue. This will move left and right as the battle plays out with the winner being the one who reaches the opposites general and still has an army standing. Along the bottom of the screen you\u2019ll find options to move forward, back and stop with other options as you research them later. Using the forward, back and stop to command your units into battle, you can also swap the positions of your units in battle. So, should your front line be getting their botty spanked then you can swap them with another unit.  \n\nTo be able to make commands however, you\u2019ll have to send them by pigeon, you will only have one to begin with but as your Generals levels increase you\u2019ll gain more pigeons in which to give commands to your units. It takes a small amount of time for the pigeons to reach your units and then for them to return to your general so that you can use the pigeon again. After a battle you\u2019ll either be victorious or defeated, your units will display their remaining health and they\u2019ll gain some experience points. \n\nEach General has one action to complete each month, the actions you can take can be viewed by selecting your general's icon. The actions are Mosque (this may be different when playing another scenario), Inn, Commence, Police, Repair Walls and Rest. Visiting the Mosque will let you pay your respect to God, catalogue books, make shisha and donor prize list. Cataloguing books will earn you research points, you do this by matching three coloured books in a stack of three by three. Making Shisha will allow you to sell it bringing in some gold each month. Donor Prize List allows you to donate some gold for the chance to stop three spinning gold coins. The outcome of coins falling on head or tails will determine what prize you will claim. The prizes could be resources like wood, sugar and prisoners, you could also gain units or some special prize. \n\nAt the Inn you can rest your Generals and their units, but this will cost you some gold and can be quite expensive but it\u2019s worth it when needing to replenish your unit\u2019s health and moral quickly. You can also rest your units by selecting the Rest option at your General, however if your units are severely damaged, they may take more than one action to fully replenish. You will also find some ruffians in the Inn, whom you can battle to increase your general\u2019s experience levels and may be gain some rewards.  \n\nYou\u2019re first mission is to deal with armed rabble you can do this by selecting a General then Police you can then place your General at the city where the armed rabble are causing troubles. It\u2019s best to jump straight onto these armed rabble and nip it in the bud before it causes too much trouble. There will be times where you can try and persuade the rabble to leave or by paying them off with some gold. \n\n[quote]THE FULL REVIEW CAN BE VIEWED IN IT'S ENTIRETY [url=https://www.zeepond.com/zeepond-reviews/plebby-quest-the-crusades] HERE[/url] AS IT WAS TOO BIG TO POST HERE.[/quote]\n\nPositives \n+ Graphics look great \n+ Funny dialog \n+ Enjoyable to play \n+ Has achievements \n+ Has cards \n\nNegatives \n- None \n\nHow will you build and expand your empire, through Trade?

The style and content of this game match my taste. 2D cube people and their meticulous movements. There is also the sound effect of this appropriate benefit (the sound effect of the army in the barracks reminds me of the \"\u6fc0\u7a81\u8981\u585e\"). There are also many built-in mini games in the game that add a lot of color and content to the game.\nOne of the businessmen, Yao. The \"bingtanghulu\" in his passage left a big impression on me. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about English, and I can't understand many plots and historical fragments. Even some ordinary conversations, technology trees and backgrounds Introduction. I need to use Google Translate to understand roughly. I really hope that the development team can do Chinese localization, or find a small Chinese localization team in China to launch the patch. Someone made a video about this game on bilibili. Me too I knew from this video. I believe there are many players like me who are eager to have Chinese localization. And more may still be waiting for the emergence of Chinese. Thank you, the production team.\nAlso, the production team has done a good job of prevention. From the game's release to the present. Those pirated websites did not crack this game.\nps: these 22 hours I played out in two days: D\nOnce again hope that the official can launch a Chinese patch. There are many players who have purchased and not purchased are waiting for the official Chinese.

The comparison stops there, however, none of the unit depth and complexity of Dominions is here in this title. You manage and train your units in your agents armies, go about doing things in your place of worship, manage your kingdom. I guess the other sort of title you could compare it to would be the total war series, if you took out the 3d map combat and kept the overland map. The turn-based gameplay is intricate and offers you meaningful choices and decisions. I like it a lot.\n\nCombat itself is sort of like a mobile side scroller type game, for lack of a better comparison. It offers some depth to what I honestly expected to be rock paper scissors combat, which it isn't due to a varied roster of units and different possible general and unit combinations. So colour me impressed here.\n\nI've finished one and half of the three scenarios and started a free game so far, the first being a mostly tutorial introduction to the game. The game has a charm and character that shines through in its writing and animation style that strikes true for me sometimes, but falls short at others.

Think of it as Risk on steroids where the combat is 2d side scrolling.\n\nThe strategy comes in with what decisions you have to make each turn. Each general has 1 action it can take: Attack, defend, quell rebellion, etc. You have to manage this. You have a tight amount of resources used to attack, heal troops and upgrade troops.

A lot of design decisions are either not fun, or don't make sense. Like soldiers can heal injuries on the battlefield when not fighting, but once you win, all those guys with injuries just die instantly? It's not like it's an oversight either, there's an endgame research that lets you heal a fraction of them. \n\nOn top of the issues are limitations in the design. The game tries to be an accessible strategy, not something hard to get into like EUIV. I respect that, but there are just too many limitations if you ask me. By reducing options to make the game easier to get into, the player is naturally restricted heavily in the way he/she can approach anything. \n\nAll in all though, I think this game is OK for $20 and for some not too serious scenario gameplay.

A South Korean studio making a game set during the Crusades, a game that suddenly came out of nowhere? To be honest, I expected a trashy shovelware product. I was wrong.\n\nIt is a cute grand strategy game with a lot of charm. While it may not always fully reflect historical events, it is far more complex than it looks at first sight. You have to manage your kingdom, including your generals, your cities, your army, the church, the state treasury, the diplomatic relations with your neighbours, a rather long research tree and additional events that happen all the time. While there is humor all over the place, this does not make the gameplay oversimplified. Quite a few options at any time, but only limited resources to carry them out make you think how to spend your turns wisely. One turn takes a month, and you can order your generals (who work as peace-time governors) to do something, but most of your orders take a month to fullfil.\n\nThere are scenarios to play, or you can take over a kingdom in free play mode and do whatever you want. I'd strongly recommend to play the tutorial scenario first to learn the basic mechanics. This is not a short tutorial, so don't expect to finish it in 10 mins. Taking over the role of a young prince who's only good at wasting his father's money on wine & women, your father gives you a little kingdom to restore order and prove yourself worth of becoming Sultan one day. Or maybe he just wants to get rid of you and assumes you will be hanged soon anyway. While there is a complex strategy game underneath, the scenario includes a ton of humorous conversations that made me smile far more than you usually do during a strategy game. At first your character has absolutely no idea how to rule a kingdom (like the player), but your advisors gently point out what you can do and what not, and you are not allowed to behead them because they are installed by your father.\n\nWhen you have recruited and (hopefully) trained military units, battles may occur, and even they are not as simple as they look from the screenshots. Different unit types, unit strength, morale, equipment, training and of course your orders on the battlefield decide the outcome. Don't expect Total War complexity, but it is more than just starting a battle and sitting back and watching.\n\nFans of grand strategy behemoths like Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II may be underwhelmed (but still enjoy this different approach to the genre), but for non-hardcore strategy players the game has a lot of things to offer. Balancing out the different requirements of a kingdom is not an easy task, so you should only consider this game if you are looking for a strategy game, and not a casual clicker (even if it looks that way).\n\n[u][b] Conclusion:[/b][/u]\nTurn-based grand strategy game that looks casual, but comes with quite a lot of depth without becoming a life sentence.

However past this hurdle and one would be reaping the joy of the game.\n\nPlebby Quest did a great job in designing the cornerstone of war, diplomacy, army composition, resources and research. An individual player would not be able to defeat the game with just excelling in one of the cornerstone unless they took an extensive amount of time. \n\nIn addition, Plebby Quest did a a job well done in the art where there are consistency in the art and it gels very well together with the map's direction of portraying a medieval map. The music is decent too.\n\nHowever, Plebby Quest does have it flaws too, subjective here, listed below.\n\n1) Geography cannot be changed directly by Player, with an NPC at a fixed interval providing options that are random(unsure) but I could build a road on the other end of the map when I am at the other end??\n\n2) The notifications every month is great but the resource can be summarised? Since, there is a finance on the top left. This would reduce the amount of clicks one would have to perform which is exasperating.\n\n3) Unsure whether the police and construction bot should be researched but the name can be better such as a police force of construction force etc.\n\n4) Economy is something players cannot improve forcing expansion, not sure how to improve this(quite complicated) but just putting it out.\n\nOverall, Plebby Quest is a great domination game where one could just chill over a cup of tea. \n\nHowever, DO NOTE that if players are looking for thrilling battle and characters upgrade, this game is most probably not your cup of tea. Plebby Quest focuses more on the management of politics, economics and composition and not the heat of the battle itself. \n\nPS: Its like sitting behind the scene and managing the war rather than being on the ground itself.\n\nLooking forward to stronger AI and multiplayer. \nReally enjoyed the games.

I would rate this more of a neutral score if I could but for now, it depends on how much you like to gamble and put your faith in a new developer.\n\nThe good:\n- A great combination of gameplay depth and an easy to use, neatly presented UI. It's not as minutely deep as full on grognard games but it's not casual either and what's there manages to capture that \"one more turn\" feel of a good strategy game. Management is nuanced and the fact that you can only perform few actions per turn means that decisions can be snappy but weighty, which lets things move along at a good pace. Combat, while not necessarily the best looking part of the package, is nuanced enough to be interesting and the more unique units the game presents to you are fun to discover.\n\n- Great presentation. The solid soundtrack and simplistic but evocative art style combine into a very neat presentation that probably caught your eye in the first place. Lots of iconography looks great and manages to present lots of information while still making the UI look stylish and readable.\n\n- Humorous writing that provides more hits than misses. The light-hearted combination of historical references, exaggerated personalities and the occasional pop culture quip is very fun and endears you to your region.\n\nThe bad:\n- Growing pains. The game has bugs, a wonky translation and it doesn't seem to be as heavy in content as one might imagine. \n\nStarting with the bugs, the game is purported to have stability issues that admittedly have not affected me so far but seem to be so prevalent, there's a new patch for them every single day. Yet the devs seem unable to fix them and worse, may be even breaking more stuff judging by the patch notes. It does not inspire confidence and considering the game seems to be from a newer developer, there's really no guarantee they'll ever be fixed before the devs jump ship. It's a huge red flag especially on Steam where there are hundreds of abandoned indie games in different states of disrepair.\n\nMoving on to the translation, the game is legible 95% of the time but there are an innumerable amount of grammatical errors and weird vocabulary choices that make it clear an editor was never involved in the process. Considering a fair chunk of the game is character based and that dialogue plays such a big part in scenarios, the shoddy translation is a constant annoyance that messes with the writing, makes some jokes fall flat and worst of all can at times make gameplay elements hard to understand. It's not ideal and makes the game feel cheap.\n\nLastly, the trailer might make it seem like you can play as every single province/kingdom/whatever but that is not the case. The game only ships with 3 scenarios, which you could describe as a \"campaign\" in a regular strategy game, and although there's supposed to be a couple more coming as DLC, the game is simply not the kind of endlessly replayable sandbox a lot of people might come to associate with the genre thanks to Crusader Kings II. In Free Play there are only 5 playable factions per geographical region and while a single match will take quite a long time, chances are good lots of people won't be able to play as their desired faction even if they are otherwise represented in the game, which in turns limits replayability. Free Play is also a little dry and there's barely any background or context as to who you are playing, who you are messing with and what you should do beyond your ultimate goal.\n\nAll in all, Plebby Quest is a very welcome surprise and a game with lots of potential whose shoddier elements sadly prevent it from coming out swinging. If the game was a little less work in progress I would heartily recommend it but as it is, it's kind of a toss up whether or not the devs will be able to deliver or if this will remain a janky, second rate title.

My initial review is at the very bottom. \n\nThis is a must buy game which is very unique to the grand strategy turn base games I have played before, yet still has some familiarity that makes it extremely fun. \n\n+++ Replay value is now sky high as the new features were added to have randomized nations for the new maps each game and your choice of selecting any faction on that map. \n\n- Only a few recommendations to further improve a game I now love even more.\n\n  - There should be an option for curses/blessings as some people like myself like the idea of being able to earn blessings without having a curse follow up - defeats the purchase. (This is my opinion which is why I feel it should be a setting option depending on the player's preference.) \n\n  - Diplomacy needs work; the system itself is not broken - but there needs to be more options and ways to improve and possibly solidify alliances. Diplomacy with your religious leader is the biggest downfall. I was hated from day 1 and could not stay out of a negative even when I was sending over a million pagan slaves and give a large contribution. \n\n   - Gifting money to help improve loyalty of a general should not take an entire turn away from your ruler. you can make the price higher - but when having 7 leaders become disloyal at the same time and every year, (because when you become powerful everyone hates you and causes trouble in your kingdom for you), it becomes tedious and puts you at a standstill. \n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI actually LOVE this game from what I have played...BUT...cannot recommend yet because of these reasons.\n\n1. I am confused about the free play mode..it was said ALL nations are available..yet no matter which free map I choose to play..only 4 or 5 choices are available out of 15-20 nations in play. :(  that is very aggravating. Until the other countries become available so the replay value is evident, I cannot recommend this. \n\n2. Some concepts are great...like when the coin toss is needed...BUT..it becomes too repetitive and tedious. It is appropriate in some cases like at the mosque/temple..but we need more variety that can replace some of the coin tosses. \n\n3. The game has great personality - especially from what I see in the campaign mode..but English writers need to proof read a lot of the dialogue and instructions/hints. The grammar is poor and words are even misused or are spelled completely incorrectly. \n\nI have faith I will change my post soon as the game shows A LOT of potential.

A cute looking strategy game with potatoes? Maybe I should check it out and get a refund before I hit the two hour wall?\" Thirty hours later, I keep telling myself \"Just... one... more... turn\" as I make my way through my first free mode campaign.  \n\nIt's a simplified empire builder with a dash of a-historical silliness. The art style gives life to the game. The characters, especially the generals and advisers, have great looks and expressions. which makes them all feel unique despite being rectangles. No blood patch or DLC here for the tactical battles. instead you get to see cute potatoes make a rubber ducky sound when they die. It all looks pretty simple at first and the initial scenario does a good job of walking you through the game without feeling like a boring tutorial (thanks in part to your leader being a young incompetent fool). \n\nAnd yet, behind the cute art and simple mechanics lies a pretty ruthless world. Going to war is a huge drain on resources. Unless you can quickly capture a capital city, expect every fight to be a drain on your treasury and your war machine to halt to a grind unless you planned ahead. Those awesome high level troops that chop/shoot/charge/heal really effectively? Well they also come with expensive needs when you ask them to storm a city and when they recover afterwards. The basic units and their more advanced versions don't have a ton of variety (infantry, shooters, cavalry, healers), but there is plenty there to play with and it makes unique units that you get from your alliances or other means that much more special.\n\nI enjoy the mini-games for things like research, goods for sale, gambling, etc. If you really want to try and focus, you can manage to get good results when the coin flipping game comes up. But even if you fail, an overall sound strategy will mean that over the long run luck only plays a partial role (in other words, it did not make me swear at the RNG gods).\n\nThe diplomatic interface is simple but I like it. Tooltips will give you good info and so far the AI's diplomatic moves make sense. Not once have I wondered why someone declared war on me (the curse of most 4x games). You can even see it coming, as the game will warn you so that you can try to gift/bribe your way out of a potential conflict. Religion complicates the picture, as sometimes your natural adversaries and allies are not what religious affiliations would prescribe. This may mean risking excommunication as you try to unify the Holy Land, leading to all sorts of morale and loyalty problems among your population and generals.    \n\nThe English translation of the game is not great, but it's functional and manages to carry most of the intended humour. It's made by a small Korean studio, so I'm already grateful that there is a translation at all. The interface is not optimal but it's not horrible either. You quickly learn that Ctrl is the magic key to speed everything forward (even the opening animation before you hit the game menu).  \n\nI had a couple of crashes to desktop on my first day, but the latest patch appear to have solved the issue.\n\nI would heartily recommend this game.

Super fun to play through. It was basically a a kingdom simulator on budget. The key gameplay mechanic revolving around conquest & adventuring works really well, though such approach has been done to death by the most prominent game studios in the industry such as CA, Paradox, etc. \n\nThe gameplay is great in short burst, if you don't mind the repetitiveness after roughly 6 hours of playtime in my case. Here's the reason: There's little variation in the mini games such as battle sequence or grinding for tech points. I'd hoped that they implemented some different factors into the game such as terrain/ location factors or aesthetics when you play the same mini game in different locations. Most factions have the same generic unit tree, except for non-unique non-playable factions like the mongols or the celt tribes. Army composition depends entirely on how you invest in unit upgrades and which type your general is. I miss the time in Knights of Honor when you'd have to travel all the way to wales & central england to find Longbowmen, or to the teutonic order's domain to find the best knight on-foot in europe. But perhaps it's just my preferences.\n\nThe music is good. After 12 hours it's still entertaining enough. What bugs me the most is the button layout. System uses the q w e for some scenarios, then switches to numeric 1 to 5 for others. And then you'd have to  remember to click either space or enter to go through cut scenes. I mean what's the point of such a confusing key mappings? To prevent players from skipping all the cutscenes unwittingly? You should only do 1 key mapping and stick to it throughout the game. \n\nAnd that was my only gripe with Plebby Quest. Other than that it was a solid game, well thought out and well executed.

This is one of the rare strategy games that is neither a Europa Universalis or Total War clone, instead opting for a somewhat more 'cartoonish', mechanics-oriented style where you control a number of generals within the nation and attempt to conquer your opponents. There's a lot of really creative mechanics, from producing and selling Shisha for money to garnering Papal influence to get rivals excommunicated; the game is focused around the height of the Crusades, and there's unique mechanics for many of the most iconic characters, like Baldwin of Jerusalem, Richard Lionheart, and Saladin. \n\nIt's well-priced at $20 ($15 if you get it on sale) and enjoyable. The battle mechanics, which involve sending out bluebirds to your advancing army to issue orders mid-battle (with their arrival time dependant on how far away they are from your general) is really interesting.

In this game, they also do. But you can still get AIs to do basically what you want because relationship dynamic is too straightforward. AIs will declare war if relationship went below certain numbers even if they're unprepared to go on any offensive campaign. And they're not very ambitious by nature, rarely go to war against their friends even though they're landlocked in it. A very sad sight like Mongolia. They do have certain functions human can't access however, like \"discussing about you secretly\" which will deteriorate your relationships with them. But you don't even have to care much about that if you choose your nodes to capture carefully since invasion can only occur to connected nodes. If you want peace with certain factions, just throw gifts at them while you getting rid of their friends. You almost always know you're going to win before you even start playing..it can still consumes a lot of your time. \n\nI would recommend it to any strategic boardgame players but it will lack the \"low accessibility\" compared to paradox's games.

Everything you do is a sorta mini-game to accumulate points and materials; in some instances it requires thought but there are a couple that are just the flip of a coin which I feel should maybe be changed to involve more strategy.\n\nOn the point of combat you are looking at effectively a Tower Defender game where you send your \"waves\" of armies to fight but you do train them and assign them into different classes.\n\nGenerals are also very cool because they have their own skill set and preferred army types; which I haven't really got a chance to look too much into due to the tool tip issue I mention below.\n\nOnly complaint I have so far is the tool tips don't appear to be working at all which makes it difficult to understand what different stats are and what reach does for you.\n\nEDIT: The tool tip issue has been fixed :)\n\n2nd Update:\n\nI've played over 15 hours now (this is addictive) the only additional thing I'd like to add and my only negative note... After so many turns the mini-games became somewhat of an annoyance for me; I hope in the future they add the ability to automate some of these events (books and wine production to be exact) and focus on more in-depth mechanics once you become an empire.\n\nStill a good buy for the price and look forward to many more updates in the future :)", "timestamp_created": 1586448599, "timestamp_updated": 1586536169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798781156539916992", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66962540": {"recommendationid": "66962540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046885671", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 2804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1670519713}, "language": "english", "review": "Other people compared this game with other Grand Strategy titles such as Total War, EU4 and CK. It is comparable but do not expect the same depth. PQTC is made for people who are not familiar with strategy games, but that is not to say a veteran won't enjoy their time. I personally had fun in my 24 hour play time and I would recommed this to pretty much everyone. Here is a little summary about the game:\n\n--Good--\nThe artstyle and animations are just lovely, never got bored looking at them.\nEven though PQTC is not a very deep game, it has everything other big titles has from trading to research. Just a bit more simplified.\nAI is not completely clues and makes moves which makes sense, kinda.\nMusic is pretty energetic and feels good.\n--Bad--\nIt lacks some basic features such as improving the settlements.\nAI is too defensive, I went to war with 20 factions and I had 1-2 attacks to my settlements in any given turn. Just dominated them one by one.\nNot all factions are playable, there are around 10 factions in total that are playable. That looks alright but there are more than 40 factions in the game. I can understand why they didn't put some of them because there are hopeless factions that just can not survive but I wish we could played with more factions.\nWhen you end your turn, the game becomes hold Ctrl and spam Enter/Left Click. We should be able to skip the turn of other factions faster.\n\nIn the end if you are new to the strategy genre or a veteran who wants to play something more casual, this game will please you.", "timestamp_created": 1586444975, "timestamp_updated": 1586893885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66952904": {"recommendationid": "66952904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845253009", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 294, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1586093855}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very cute and complex turn based strategy game.
