I started this game and played the first few hours with the immediate thought \"I think this is my new favorite game.\" It is so SO close to being my favorite, but there is just a few too many bugs in this game. There are other aspects too though that keep it from being in my #1, even though as time goes on I like it more and more. For the first time in one of my steam reviews, I'm going to break up this section by listing my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-The gameplay in this game is SO satisfying and addicting. I could seriously play it forever. The mechanics are probably some of the best I've ever seen given how satisfying each weapon is to play with. Most likely everyone is going to have a favorite weapon, but they all run amazingly. It shocks me that this game received a mediocre reception upon release given that it's one of the best I've played. I suppose that first game must have been genre-defining or something for people to have not given this one the love and attention it deserved.\n-This game is drop dead gorgeous. It hasn't aged much at all. I cannot believe it is 10+ years old, it looks better than a lot of the stuff that releases nowadays. This game instantly sticks in my mind for all the landscapes being varied and eye-catching. The animations too have a special level of attention to detail that I appreciated. The way Alice plays, idles, and interacts with people and enemies particularly sticks out in my mind. I also love the character designs, they're all so interesting and a bit grotesque, even outside of wonderland. This game will always stay with me for being the perfect blend of beautiful memorable aesthetics mixed with different types and levels of horror. We need more games that go for distinctive styles like this, I miss them desperately. I'd love more games that go for a style like this rather than striving for hyper-realism.\n-The gameplay has variation in a way that feels immensely satisfying. I know some people did not like all of the puzzles or the song games, but I didn't mind them. However, I do admit, that I did start skipping a lot of puzzles (chess, doll puzzle) toward the end because I was so excited about the story I did not want to be held up with any of the mini-games so I could finish the game. Certain forms of gameplay variation stick in my mind for their excellence (specifically the gameplay after eating cake was so fun and so satisfying). If I'm talking gameplay alone, this is easily the best I've played.\n-The story of Alice: Madness Returns is really interesting. Like, addictingly interesting. I was so fascinated by the story I could not stop playing because I wanted to know what was going to happen. Make sure you get this game when you have a lot of free time because if you are like me, it will consume your life. I will say after playing the full game, the story is not perfect but I feel like it's expertly crafted, well told, and resonant to a lot of people. I will not spoil anything, but all I'm going to say is that while the twist at the end wasn't executed perfectly, it had enough setup and payoff to not ruin the experience for me. I'll go more into my thoughts about it in the cons.\n\nCons:\n-This game is BUGGY. I thought people might have been slightly exaggerating or there were compatibility issues, but it is just a game problem. There were multiple times that the game would crash as I was starting it up or would freeze on a loading screen. Eventually, I looked to the community forum for help. To stop the loading bug, I would need to uninstall and reinstall the game, meaning I would have to repeatedly uninstall and reinstall the game just to finish the dang thing. I must have uninstalled and reinstalled this game over 10 times just to get it to work. There were an abundance of minor bugs I encountered too. Keep in mind that these were some of my problems in my play through. Some people have even complained that the game is so buggy they can't even play it anymore if they ever could.\n-If people in your community forum are telling players ways to code the game so it will look and play better, that's a problem. For example, originally this game ran at 30 FPS. The community suggests changing the game code to 60 FPS because the game look and play better. While the game did crash the first time I did that, the game looked and played way better after I did that for the rest of the game. I'm not sure if coding higher FPS would risk making the game incompatible for anyone's computer, but 30 FPS made the game look objectively worse for reasons I don't understand. Some mechanics are confusing too. Specifically, having to use focus to use your block attack. It's such a problem for some people they had to go into the code to fix it.\n-Most people's issues with Madness come from the fact that it makes a story that was initially morally grey story made into a more black-and-white story. I can't necessarily argue with that but I think that the twist has more weight to it than people give it credit for, even if I have mixed feelings about it myself. Sometimes you can tell a twist was objectively set up and paid off really well and still feel a little meh about the twist. \n-I feel like for many, the biggest issue not related to bugs is that Alice: Madness Returns has a little too many different plot lines and not quite enough room to flush them all out. That in itself is not an issue for me, but I understand wanting certain themes to be explored a little more or more heavily foreshadowed at the very beginning rather than in the middle. I think with just a tiny bit more time and fine-tuning everything could have come together a little better to make it perfect. As is, it's still a banger game though.\n\nI love this game, I truly do, and it deserves to be treated better, both by fans and by the studio that owns the rights to it. Even though I am disappointed about the ultimate fate of the Alice franchise, I 100% recommend this game to anyone who'll listen. It is a genuinely great game that deserves to be loved and celebrated more, don't let it become obsolete. However, if the game does not open or work for you, refund it immediately. Do not wait for the game developers to fix it because it doesn't look like that is an option. Lastly, and I want to make this abundantly clear, I do not blame any of the creators of the game for the game being so buggy. I personally believe the responsibility is on the studio which owns the rights to upkeep the games they own the rights to. American McGee and his team have the utmost love for this game and fought for a port. We are lucky to even have this game on Steam, let alone this game period, because of the people who fought for it. The game is so unbelievably phenomenal that it deserves attention. It is a shame this game ended a little open-ended because I was excited for the third installment after playing this game. I will always mourn the death of Alice Asylum, but there's nothing stopping fans from finishing the story in whatever way they please. We have this game as a sequel to the first. We are lucky for that. Send the creators some love. They deserve to be celebrated for what they accomplished. They do not deserve any harassment for something they ultimately cannot control. EA holds the rights and does not want to continue this franchise. There's nothing we can do about it. If you are upset, you can voice your concerns to EA in a polite, civil manner.\nIf EA happens to be reading this, hi. I know I might have been a little harsh in this review, but please hear me out on 1 thing. I think it'd be a good idea to allow fans to legally purchase the first Alice game on Steam or as a DLC to the second game. That way you can earn so much money for your work and fans can play the game legally.

If I had played another game instead of this one, it wouldn't have been too short, nor would it have been too long, but since this is the game I played, the 14 hours I put into it actually felt like a ~40-hour, excruciatingly long, tedious experience. The game is RIDICULOUSLY long for what it offers. It has content for like a 7-8-hour playthrough, which is half of the actual playtime. \n\nThe problems:\n\nThe game is an action-platformer. You mainly jump from platform to platform, have some story bits and kill some enemies in between all the jumping and platforming stuff. So far, it sounds completely fine, but what's not fine is that the platforming \"puzzles\" (for want of a better word) are not hard or challenging at all, they are almost identical with only slight variations, and they make up the majority of the content. They are so dead simple that you don't have to think, you don't have to look around or time your jumps / movements correctly. Because the game is so long, you just do them ad nauseaum until your brain starts to go numb and you start to go insane because of the boredom. Everything is copy-pasted everywhere, only the textures and models look different, but the core of what you have to do is the same everywhere. Them being easy wouldn't be an issue if the game weren't as stretched out, or if they weren't repetitive, but they are.\n\nWhich brings me to the chapters / levels. At the beginning of each chapter, everything looks beautiful and mesmerizing (the art style is one of the few strengths of the game, the game still looking good to this day), but since every chapter is longer than it needs to, the glamour will start to fall off sooner rather than later, and everything will just blend together in your head because of the copy-paste nature of everything. The story bits happen very sporadically. Sometimes you jump around mindlessly for 1-2 hours before the story progresses. The pacing in the game is godawful.\n\nThe game also has very few actual puzzles and side-scrolling platforming mini-games. The puzzles are just as easy as the rest of the game (they are mostly sliding puzzles, which take like 5 seconds to solve). The mini-games are the exact same platforming stuff you do in the game, only in 2D. There is no purpose to them other than to pad the game's length. They are completely unnecessary.\n\nTo get you out of your numbness, the game will throw some enemies at you here and there. The combat is the only thing in the gameplay that I actually enjoyed despite its flaws. The enemy variety is good, mostly. All of the enemies are unique, they all have their unique ways of dealing with them. The weapon system is creative. All the weapons have their use (again, mostly, because the hobby horse felt totally useless after I got the teapot).\n\nHowever, I can't walk past the controls. If you want to use either the pepper grinder or the teapot, you have to lock onto your target. Unfortunately, the target-locking, or rather the focus target mechanism is completely broken. Once you have locked onto your target and start moving around, the camera won't follow your character properly. What will end up happening is that both you and your target will end up in the opposite ends of your screen, making you unable to see where the other enemies are. Sometimes you won't be able to see either yourself or the enemy you're targeting, either. To solve this problem, you have to re-focus your target constantly, which is easier said than done when you are surrounded by multiple enemies because target-swapping is also broken. Since the targeting is in the way all the time, it makes you focus on the game less and on the controls more, which is just annoying.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the above mentioned broken mechanic is blatantly abused by the developers in two boss fights (one is in chapter 2, the other is in the doll house in chapter 5). What these bosses have in common is that you have to use a ranged weapon to beat them (I guess you can melee them as well, but that way they are much harder), they are not hard to kill by themselves, they just take long. They have these slimes, which look like leeches, spawning around the area. The slimes barely do any damage to you and die in one hit, so they should be barely an inconvenience. But they are not because what they do is totally mess up your targeting because they make it almost impossible to lock onto the bosses because guess what, you can't get rid of them because they respawn until the boss dies. The reason you take damage in these fights is not because the boss mechanics are hard, but because you are too busy fumbling with the controls. Instead of implementing actually interesting and challenging boss mechanics, the developers chose to make two already easy bosses \"harder\" by abusing the broken focus target system. The purpose of the slimes in these two fights is to mess up your targeting, nothing else. The bosses were not hard to kill, even with the slimes, but the fact that the developers did this is truly ridiculous.\n\n\nI could also talk about the various bugs / crashes that happen during gameplay, I could also talk about how you can't assign the melee weapons to their own hotkeys in the game's menu, how you can only do this by editing an .ini file, which is on another level of ridiculousness.\n\nAll in all, what this game needed was for the developers to cut its length by half, make the platforming harder / swap some of the platforming sections for actual puzzles and fix the targeting system. This way, we could have a much tighter, more enjoyable experience. It's a shame what state the game is in because hidden underneath all the bad stuff is a great game.

I know I can remap the controls, but the other convenient keys are taken.\n\nOverall, I'd still recommend this game. It's a fun, broody experience. I completed the game with only a few facepalms.

La jugabilidad esta muy bien, aunque podr\u00eda ser mas c\u00f3moda. Si juegas con mando seguro que lo disfrutas mas. Aunque hay suficiente variedad para mantenerte enganchado, a la larga podr\u00edas encontrarte con situaciones repetitivas (para ser un juego lineal) pero, no por ello, aburridas. Por otro lado, el dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico es espectacular. Podr\u00edas estar un buen rato solamente apreciando el dise\u00f1o de los escenarios y los personajes, intentando encajarlos dentro de la ambig\u00fcedad de la historia.

I loved the aesthetics, the music, the characters, the art, the scenes. EVERYTHING! And when i learned that there might be a possible 3rd game of the series, i got super happy. I'm not the kind to follow the developments of the things i like, i just wait for them to be published. And i'd know if the game was published because it'd be a big thing. But it did not so i wondered what happend to the possible 3rd game and i checked on it recently. It is so sad to learn that the hard and passionate work of a game developer, who dedicated his time and hardwork, along with bunch of other talented and also hard-working people, is turned down by a big game company. And the explanation why it was turned down is not satisfying at all. I won't be able stop thiking about the \"3rd game\" and how it could have been.

Not only does this game look wonderful and run great, (I know it's old but you'd be surprised how poorly optimized most stuff is), but it's also so extremely imaginative and fun! Let me try to list some reasons to play this game, even in the modern market:\n\n- The gameplay is fun and rewarding, not the other way around!\nWhat do I mean by this? Well as far as I'm concerned, tons of modern games love to make playing their game a chore. Not only are the things you can do not very cool, fun, exciting, or whatever else you want to call the gameplay element in question, but most of them have obnoxious cooldowns and/or resources that you have to spend to even use the ability. This game does none of that. The guns are balanced with an overheating system and all your weapon upgrades are gated behind the single resources in the game, teeth (aka the money). It doesn't feel stingy, you can EASILY upgrade all your weapons before the end of the game, and they're all really fun to use and switch between. The jumps/double jumps and the shrinking ability are both extremely useful and don't require any cooldown or any other dumb mechanic to use them, they just work.\n\n- The world is creative and fun to explore!\nEven though our games keep getting larger and more sprawling with every release, they often seem to lack depth; at least from my perspective. The maps are large, but every corner is unworthy of exploring. Things look boring, or all too the same, there aren't rewards in the remote corners of the map like you thought there would be, and it's plain and simply just not fun to run around in. Alice is the antithesis of this! Each and every map is beautiful and creative in their own way, reflecting the personality of not only the character we will be addressing in this chapter, but also reflecting how Alice views this person in real life. Each area has a lot of scenery to chew and enjoy, a lot of changing details that are fun to look at, and tons of hidden areas of secret paths that reward you! I know maybe this can sound like a silly compliment to a veteran gamer that's been playing for decades, but modern gaming is so bad at doing what this game did SO WELL that I think it's easy to forget to appreciate these things and point them out. Overall just wonderful design in this, sorry for the essay.\n\n- Rewards, Rewards, REWARDS!!\n\nI don't know how you guys feel about 3D platformers, but I usually get pretty annoyed with the sheer amount of stuff they want you to pick up while navigating the map; and I get even more annoyed when all that crazy stuff I've been collecting has no purpose other than a number on a screen to make me feel like I accomplished something. In Alice, everything you pick up means something. All the memories help you uncover Alice's history and the true intentions and feelings of the characters driving her life along. I even wondered what use there was for collecting one of the items, the bottles, but if you get all of them in an area you unlock extra story content. Very well done; it made me want to find all the hidden areas and extra goodies. Even all the times it was 'just' teeth I was happy because I wanted to upgrade my weapons. Kudos to the collecting aspect of this game, I really didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did!\n\n- I'm no idiot, don't treat me like one!\n\nOkay maybe a weird one to bring up but WOW modern gaming makes me feel like a baby. The dialog in so many games feels so obvious and surface level that I get really bored and, often times, just skip much of said dialog because it isn't engaging. Alice does not hold your hand and it doesn't care if you don't understand something. Much like the feeling of consuming old Alice inspired media, this game is cryptic in much (not all) of it's dialog. People speak in odd ways and reference things you may not be privy to and it just hopes you'll pay attention and keep up. Loved that. Thanks to the game for the fun little story, it was actually fun to uncover and figure out and experience. ALSO: there's tons of areas where they introduce completely new gameplay features and they just quickly go \"okay here you've played something like this before, just play it\" - like they didn't feel the need to do a tutorial for every single thing in the entire game, it's just smart enough to know that I'll press the 7 buttons available to me and figure it out. UGH THANK FUCK.\n\n- Not too easy, not too difficult.\n\nTons of games want to be either the most relaxed thing you've ever experienced or they want you to sweat bullets and beat your head against a wall until you get it. This game is just right in it's difficulty. Nothing is too difficult and the auto-saves are close enough to where you'll die to not make it a huge deal. There is ONE enemy that I am near positive was supposed to be like a difficulty cap for players, to like make you get better before moving on I think (?), but WOW he's actually really annoying and I hate him a lot BUT that being said he wasn't impossible and you'll probably only die like once or twice to one when you're fighting it. Overall though this game was great about how difficult it wanted to be and, at the end of the day, it just wanted to assist you in using the mechanics to play the game and have fun and that's a huge plus in my book.\n\n- Damn bro, you need more? Just go play the thing.\n\nNah seriously, did any of you even make it this far? You're reading reviews for a 12+ year old game?..... Nice. actually.\nUhhh game good. Music is great, good tracks for every area. Each area has it's own weird little gameplay thing like if you've ever played Bayonetta 1 you'll know they do these dumb fuck segments where you're like a jet suddenly or something idk anyway they always suck in other games because they're clearly not as fleshed out as the rest of the game BUT IN THIS GAME they work great. I mean IDK that they're perfect but they work well and they feel seemless and I really appreciate their inclusion. Game feels good, just has good game-feel (if you don't know what I mean I have no way to explain, you just gotta play more games and get that game feel kinda shit down you know?). Just good. Go play.\n\nI give 9/10. Great. Loved. Deserved more love.

I recommend playing this game at a heavy discount, please do not give more than 3 dollars to EA games.\n\nFirst of all I don't blame American McGee I know EA had some part in fucking this game up which could have been otherwise a masterpiece.\n\nI read somewhere EA said McGee has 3 months or the game doesn't get released.\n\nCompared to the first game, the first game had a way better soundtrack, way more enemy variety, more weapon variety, characters seemed more fun, bosses, etc.\n\nLevels in the first game were all unique, each level had a story to tell just by walking through it. However the second game because Alice can triple jump this creates lazy map design. So they copy and paste floating platforms all over the map which drags the chapters out for hours at a time. \n\nOther things the first game did better when Alice shrunk she became the size of an ant and you had to explore a whole giant world.\n\nSecond game when alice shrinks it's just to go into a hole to collect a memory (in game collectible) nothing really exciting.\n\nThe second game has way less enemies and they copy and paste baby dolls all over every level which makes the levels feel less unique. \n\nThe first game has 9 chapters, each chapter has 2 to 6 subchapters in them and each sub chapter feels new and refreshing to explore through.\n\nThe second game has 6 chapters and from start to finish they look and play exactly the same and drag out over 2+ hours.  The only chapter that felt the most finished was the queen of hearts chapter which I read was the only section of the game that was 100% done at the end of the 3 month deadline. \n\n\nAgain it's a great game but I blame EA for the copy and pasted map design, the lack of enemy variety, the boring soundtrack and the bland levels, boring NPCs, etc. I know American McGee would have wanted to do better.", "timestamp_created": 1699008716, "timestamp_updated": 1699009878, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149420023": {"recommendationid": "149420023", "author": {"steamid": "76561199430657976", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 366, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1700790685}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es genial poder comprar tu juego mas pirateado de tu infancia.", "timestamp_created": 1698987154, "timestamp_updated": 1698987154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652082264423370361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149407245": {"recommendationid": "149407245", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049394606", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1698967840}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Compr\u00e9 el juego en oferta, al inicio tuve problema por que tenia bugs, un ejemplo el del paraguas que no salia pero ya lo arreglaron.

Maybe it's because I love anything that lies within the horror genre, or maybe it's because I genuinely believe this is a great twist on the beloved story \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Regardless, this is a game I can confidently say I will be playing as much as I please, which will probably be an unnecessary amount of times, and truly enjoy. And this is evident considering all the screenshots I've taken of this game so far\u2014 screenshots that take up half, maybe more, of my gallery on Steam. First and foremost, this game features a wonderful story that, from the start, reels in players. In this game, Alice is a young orphan girl who, at some point in her life, found care in a psychiatric clinic. It is clear that Wonderland serves as some form of escapism for her trauma and past, but unfortunately, Wonderland is not the beautiful world we know of. Playing as Alice, you fight evil creatures and meet characters that we know from the original story, like Hatter and Cheshire Cat. For some, I'm sure this game is just plain creepy and that there's little to no beauty in the world of Wonderland, but from the little details of flowers you find roaming about to Alice herself, I find this game rather alluring in a beautiful sense. I am so, so excited to play through the entirety of this game, and I would highly recommend this to anyone that's considering buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1697625495, "timestamp_updated": 1697625495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148416868": {"recommendationid": "148416868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112152506", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1695432913}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Alice haceme un pibe.", "timestamp_created": 1697595759, "timestamp_updated": 1697595759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717351734638214111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148404869": {"recommendationid": "148404869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038474851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1697579023}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game. kinda trippy", "timestamp_created": 1697574183, "timestamp_updated": 1697574183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148396224": {"recommendationid": "148396224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198888171458", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 504, "last_played": 1686885546}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was my fav has a kid and still is", "timestamp_created": 1697562938, "timestamp_updated": 1697562938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148361353": {"recommendationid": "148361353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080326159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 949, "last_played": 1691795680}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\"OBRA MAESTRA GENIALOSA\" \n\nS\u00f3lo un v\u00eddeo como el que os dejo a continuaci\u00f3n define a la perfecci\u00f3n \u00e9ste t\u00edtulo imprescindible en cualquier biblioteca.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXKTfoP25oU", "timestamp_created": 1697499506, "timestamp_updated": 1697499506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148323663": {"recommendationid": "148323663", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039238066", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1699605912}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buenisimo , debes jugARLO", "timestamp_created": 1697442403, "timestamp_updated": 1697442403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148318651": {"recommendationid": "148318651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016126318", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2449, "last_played": 1698458641}, "language": "english", "review": "its absolutely amazing!

I would often imagine myself running across the mossy forest, hopping through the beams of sunlight, and chasing down a rabbit in a suit, seemingly in a hurry. I would write my own stories with different twists, varied characters of the same caliber, and additional endings. What if I tumbled down a rabbit hole? Or a magical well? I would have the wildest dreams of going on all those expeditions and adventures with the friends of my own imagination.\n\nThen, I slowly hopped onto the train of young adulthood, assembling a more [i]gothic[/i] alter persona (whatever that means?) My interests remained as they were; however, they gained new and more fascinating dimensions. I loved Tim Burton's take on the story of Alice, for instance, and fell in love with the other works he had to offer. I loved the cabaret-like imagery from the 19th century, circus-related looks from the 1910s, fantastic realms of different times, and [i]everything with stripes[/i]. So, as you can also imagine, my first encounter with the game, Alice: Madness Returns, awakened pure madness in my 13-year-old brain! It had creepy dolls, underwater themes, fantastic realms, incredible costume designs (with striped socks!), and a witty, smoky-eyed protagonist with a troubled past. How edgy, am I right? Don't laugh, though- my teenage self was dying to be like her. To this day, almost 10 years later, I still quite like her! \n\nSo yeah, that's my story. I don't know how many times I beat the game or at least booted it up for comfort since then. I know the controls are wonky, and the port is kinda bad ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3014521889]which has a fix right here.[/url]) But it holds so many dear memories that I always come back. \nSo, thank you, American McGee, and everyone else who worked on all the projects of the merchandise! \n\nI am devasted to hear that the Asylum project got canceled, by the way.

The original game which isn't included is an absolute masterpiece. Even though the original is dated, it still has so much originality and is very whimsical as well as atmospheric. Alice Madness Returns has some beautiful imagery, but also has some horribly ugly imagery like the town areas where everyone looks atrociously ugly. \n\nThe biggest problem with the game is how boring it is. While the levels do have some cool imagery and graphics, a lot of it is copy and paste. The levels are long and tedious and the chapters feel like they drag on forever. You will fight a lot of the same enemies over and over again. There are some chapter specific enemies, but you run into the same standard black ooze/doll part enemies in every chapter. There is also only 4 weapons, which all get pretty boring after awhile. The upgrades offer nothing more than attack damage and a different skin for the weapons. \n\n\n*spoilers ahead*\n\nI'm not a big fan of the story. Madness returns adds a sexual assault story line which wasn't implied in the original. The original game was Alice going mad from a house fire that killed both her parents. Madness returns changes the fire story quite a bit. The game also gives Alice a sister that she didn't have in the original.

The domains in the game are beautiful, always managing to take your breath away with its' amazing settings and cutscenes. The cutscenes are unlike any other I have seen. They have a unique style and look amazing with great animation. The problems I do have with the game are how short it is, how annoying some of the platforming is, and how long the domains are. While I did say I didn't like how short the game was at the same time the domains sometimes stretch on for far too long. The game was originally planned to have more domains and I felt that the addition of those domains could have helped solve this problem.

The scene with her house burning with her family in the first game keeps on haunting her in this game. Gameplay wise the game is a 3D platformer with Super Mario style platforming sections. In this game Alice have a 4 double jumping ability with a leviate ability after each jump. With this mechanic I feel the game has stretched its platform all over the place so the world feels kinda empty. As for the combat; you get 2 melee weapons and 2 ranged weapons. The Vorpal Blade, a fast style weapon which uses small swipes to take of the enemies for you. The Horse Thing, I giant horse head on a stick Alice uses to deal heavy damage with slow attack speed. The Teapot, basically a grenade launcher, and The Peppergrinder, which is basically a machine gun. The combat runs fluid but may be interrupted from time to time because of the camera not willing to work together with you.\n\nIf you like platformers and don't expect anything exceptional or deep, this game might be okay buy.

The combat camera is absolutely terrible and locking on an enemy was a sureway to getting killed. It also overstays its welcome a little and every chapter could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and be better for it.\n\nThe narration is also kinda \"choppy\" and the cutscenes could have been better implemented in the game. Some voice actor are wonderful, but others are terrible.\n\nBut good lord what a game! What assault to the senses! As an ex-goth kid, I just loved the aesthetics and music. I stopped at every new section just to appreaciate the details on the levels, enemy designs and costumes. Even with the camera problems, combat was fun and the platforming puzles very satisfying, at least until they star repeating the same gimmicks.\n\nThe plot was really good too. I was expecting it to be dark and cruel, but not this dark and cruel! OMG! It goes to places where AAA and AA games don't usually go. This is the territory of itch.io indie games that go head-on on abuse themes.\n\nAt first, I didn't understood why there were so many doll heads in the enemies and levels, once you understand what they represent you get horrified.\n\nIn other time, I would have restarted inmediatly this game and even try to get 100% items and secrets.

AMR is a relatively enjoyable experience for the first several hours of the game, but it soon fades away when your jump is blocked by yet another invisible wall, and the level proceeds to go on for an hour longer than it should. The puzzles are void of creativity, And the most creative pieces of the game are copy pasted so much you want to alt-f4 at the sight of them. This game is also severely buggy on modern hardware, and requires ini editing in order to get a cool 60 frames. AMR's largest positive is by far it's aesthetics and visuals, with breathtaking worlds all coming with uniquely stunning outfits for alice.

Alice's story and style capture the madness like lightning in a bottle, while handling deep themes of trauma and abuse with a surprisingly human touch. Worth a look for art and writing alone!\n\nGameplay-wise, Alice is a wonderful character to inhabit: her movement feels graceful and effortless, which is perfect for the platforming-heavy levels. Combat is more puzzle than battle: most enemies have a trick to defeating them, forcing you to think on your feet. Woven between these are interludes out of totally different genres: 2D side-scrollers, musical rhythm games, chessboard problems, and more. Best of all is a sequence in which you, growing to giant size, stomp your way through vast hordes of enemies. Some people might find the interruptions annoying, but I found them charming, and essential for breaking up the lengthy levels.\n\nWhich brings us to the few cons. The game's levels are long, and can sometimes overstay their welcome, so bring patience and a cozy blanket. Luckily, they're fairly easy (I played on Normal), but the final boss creates a jarring difficulty spike, which is all the more frustrating as he's perhaps the most despicable character I've seen in any work of fiction! Less subjective is EA's negligence: sometimes, Alice just doesn't want to run. I found that setting all the graphics options to low (then switching them back after a loading screen) solved it 99% of the time. Still, not great.\n\nBottom line, though: if you're up for a game of beautiful madness that tackles mature subjects with empathy, you could do a lot worse than Alice: Madness Returns!", "timestamp_created": 1691983713, "timestamp_updated": 1691983713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144142547": {"recommendationid": "144142547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032152605", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1692154822}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1691981243, "timestamp_updated": 1691981243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144117088": {"recommendationid": "144117088", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971979586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 783, "last_played": 1693767858}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting storyline and evolutionary gameplay keeps the game interesting.

HOWEVER, be mindful on how buggy it is on PC/Steam (I heard it works fine on PS3). The blocking feature with the umbrella ONLY works if it is on default controls with keyboard. I had to do lots of research on it since mine refused to work at first, which unfortunately is a vital feature when dealing with the \"cannon crabs\" and the \"menacing ruin\" (i hated this one, I was stuck on a level for a long time since my weapons refused to work. One time the Vorpal blade was not appearing.) If you are using keyboard, for blocking you need to HOLD CAPS and then tap E and HOLD to block for the umbrella to work and have the projectiles bounce off to hit the enemy's shield. After figuring this out, I was able to proceed through the game fortunately.\n\nBUGS/Glitches/Issues:\n-Loading screen. This was my biggest issue aside from the umbrella blocking. When I opened the game, it would be stuck on loading for a long time. Unfortunately, it seems to be a common issue. I had to reset my pc multiple times and changes my resolution to the default setting. The other options i left on low or none/off. For me, I left alot of the options on default except the camera sensitivity and the interact button to \"F\" as a preference. Then it loaded for me after a few pc resets.\n\n-Alice would randomly move forward on her own and it takes awhile to gain control again (I thought my W key was not working, so I tested it on another game and it worked perfectly). When this happened, I paused the game for awhile and she would reset in a way and stop running forward on her own.\n\n-Umbrella blocking. Biggest struggle for me. Granted. I did not try it with controller and I heard it works okay with controller after I figured it out on keyboard. Unfortunately, you need to leave the umbrella blocking at its default or it would refuse to work.\n\n-Jumping was a pain at first. You really need to time it right at times. It is not really easy to control but after awhile you get used to it. There is like a fickle limit on how much you can jump/glide. Sometime it would let you triple jump, sometimes it wont and only do two. If you do it too fast it cuts itself short and you would just fall.\n\n-There is an autosave feature BUT if you are unlucky, you would have to start all the way over and listen to the same unskippable dialogue. When I was struggling with the blocking feature, I had to restart this area in the Mad Hatter, Mad Hare and mouse section SO MANY times all the way to the most inconvenient area and recollect the collectibles and teeth (if you die you may have to recollect stuff, sometimes it does keep it), plus redo all the switches to proceed. When I got to the part fighting the giant Executioner, I fell off and had to walk all the way back to the battle area. It was honestly funny seeing how big the guy is that you would normally not see during the battle.\n\n-Also, there is no instructions for controls to move the puzzles (the picture puzzles). You have to move them with the space bar and select them with either WASD or arrow keys.\n\n-The musical note parts were SO LAGGY. You gotta be patient and go slow.\n\nTIPS:\n-Use shrink alot if you are stuck or can't find where to go (there is also some pig snouts that needed shrink to locate them. I encountered it 2 or 3 times)\n\n-Collect as much teeth as you can to level up your weapons, I did Vorpal blade first, then evenly did the other three. The teapot is SUPER helpful so level that as much as possible. All weapons were helpful in their own ways for specific battles and exploration.\n\nDespite the bugs, it was very creative and enjoyable story.

This sequel to the cult classic \u201cAmerican McGee\u2019s Alice\u201d is a dark and twisted masterpiece that successfully marries psychological horror with platforming and action elements. Visually, \u201cAlice: Madness Returns\u201d is a macabre work of art. The design of Wonderland is a nightmarish wonderland of grotesque beauty, filled with twisted landscapes, eerie characters, and a sense of foreboding around every corner. The game\u2019s ability to seamlessly shift between the whimsical and the horrific is a testament to its artistic direction. The storyline is a psychological rollercoaster, delving into Alice\u2019s troubled psyche as she attempts to unravel the mystery behind her family\u2019s tragic past. It\u2019s a tale of trauma, coping mechanisms, and the thin line between reality and madness. The narrative is both engaging and unsettling, drawing players deeper into Alice\u2019s fractured world. Gameplay-wise, \u201cAlice: Madness Returns\u201d offers a blend of platforming, combat, and exploration. The platforming sections are cleverly designed, making use of Alice\u2019s unique abilities and the ever-changing environment. Combat, while not the game\u2019s strongest suit, still provides satisfying encounters with various grotesque creatures and offers a decent variety of weapons and upgrades. What truly shines in this game is its atmosphere and attention to detail. The haunting musical score, coupled with the eerie sound effects, enhances the sense of unease throughout the adventure. The game\u2019s collectibles and hidden memories add depth to the narrative, encouraging players to delve deeper into Wonderland\u2019s dark secrets. While \u201cAlice: Madness Returns\u201d has its share of quirks and occasional camera issues, it more than makes up for them with its unique and immersive experience. It\u2019s a game that isn\u2019t afraid to explore the darker aspects of the human psyche while delivering a compelling gameplay experience. In conclusion, \u201cAlice: Madness Returns\u201d is a mesmerizing descent into madness that successfully blends horror, platforming, and storytelling. It\u2019s a game that lingers in your mind long after you\u2019ve put the controller down, making it a must-play for those who appreciate games as an art form and are willing to explore the darker corners of Wonderland.", "timestamp_created": 1690880668, "timestamp_updated": 1695619645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143169450": {"recommendationid": "143169450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856020047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1693703011}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Siempre me llamo la atenci\u00f3n este juego, y he de admitir, que, al menos por ahora, cumple todas mis expectativas, si se topan una oferta o les sobra un poco de dinero, es compra seguro si disfruten del terror psicol\u00f3gico", "timestamp_created": 1690840513, "timestamp_updated": 1690840513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143144073": {"recommendationid": "143144073", "author": {"steamid": "76561199274198566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1694864003}, "language": "english", "review": "Underrated game.

crashed a few times in-game but it's still enough of a problem to be worth noting.\n\nwhile performance was generally fine, there was a fair bit of lag in some parts, which is odd given i'm playing on a decent gaming laptop that should definitely be able to handle it. it was to the point where a couple sections were literally unplayable (specifically the rhythm parts which the game mercifully let me skip).\n\nlastly, the worst offender for me is that on many occasions the shrink button kept locking so i couldn't unshrink and i had to either keep pressing and waiting for it to finally register or simply reload and start that section over again.\n\nagain, the game itself is pretty good overall and i'd love to recommend it, but sadly this port is so riddled with bugs that i'm honestly not sure i can unless they ever got fixed (and given both how old and largely forgotten it is by EA that's extremely doubtful).\n", "timestamp_created": 1690414517, "timestamp_updated": 1690414517,

Alice Madness Return is a good game. Not an excellent one, mind you, but a good one. For starter, it has a fairly creative environment (although not really... queer. :)) and... that 's it.\nThe gameplay is... basic. There's no other word to describe it. Enemy design is... boring? uninspired? (although it does have some sense in the context of the story, they could have done something a lot better than this) a ''copy and paste'' a thousand times with little design changes for some areas of no relevance whatsoever. But, but, but... it does have some fun into it.\nSame goes for the story, that could have been something if not for the horrible, horrible pace, predictable clich\u00e8 and the guilt of using the victorian era's setting in an awful way. Still, manages to ''support'' the game by presenting interesting themes... if not for the atrocious presentation.\nThe soundtrack is not even worthy of being mention, being probably some royalty free music or something similar. Definetely, the WORST offender here.\nAnd... well, it is time. Let's talk another reason (and my main disappointment) why this game is... decent, but nothing more. \nBeing sequel of a creative, genuine, full of wonders and excellent ideas game such as American Mcgee's Alice is not easy.\nAlthough both games were made by the same author, the difference in quality (in everything... but I won't write about the glory of the first one or I could be here the whole day) between the two is... monumentally profound.\nBut, almost as an unintended apology, this game did give it for free. But gods be damn, now the only reason why madness returns could be worth almost 20 euros is gone. they removed it (although I know it wasn't really their decision).\nSO, after all my rantings, is the game worth it?\nWell, it is playable, and for someone (I cannot believe the amount of people that found this sorry repetition of fights fun) even enjoyable and funny to play. So buying it (only discounted) it isn't something I'll tell you not to do. I mean, i did it. And in comparison to other platformers, it is enjoyable (after all, it was made by McGee, which is a really good developer).\n", "timestamp_created": 1690384954, "timestamp_updated": 1690384954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142802651": {"recommendationid": "142802651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130524424", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1892, "last_played": 1480134200}, "language": "english", "review": "it fits my [i]a e s t h e t i c[/i]\n\naction + platformer + dope artwork + gothic victorian weird shit.

It was really well paced and had me hooked from start to finish. The characters are all so wonderful and feel distinct and unique from one another. It definitely gives the game that much more immersion to it. \nThe multiple Settings of both Wonderland and London are presented really well. London is usually used as an indicator of what the next part in wonderland will be like and wonderland is just wonderful (pun intended). There is so much variety in these surroundings that prevent the game from going dull.\nVisually it's just stunning. The Performance was iffy and that is due to this game having a poor port from the console. While it runs decently well it does play on 30 fps which could be a turn off for some. There was also this bug on the second chapter were loading into the level would just crash the game. The way i found getting around this was putting everything into default and resetting it when i got into the level. There was no glitches but a few crashes. Art Direction on the other hand is just unbelievable on how fantastic it is. Wonderland is just so well detailed and is really immersive. \nSound and Audio are also great with the soundtrack feeling other worldly and the audio perfectly matching everything from the likes of attacks and movement. \nIn terms of Gameplay, it does a lot and succeeds in pretty much all of it. The only complaint i would have about it would regard the lock on camera cause it can be a real pain trying to fight enemies while the camera of all things is pretty much fighting against you. Apart from that, movement feels great, combat is pretty well developed but I would have liked maybe more of an arsenal of weapons when going against enemies. The enemies are well diverse and offer a good challenge, the platforming is really good and the light puzzle solving is a nice switch up and is pretty fun as well. \nOne thing I would like to bring up is how bad i feel for the creator of this and the previous title American McGee. For those who don't know, American wanted to make a third entry in the series called Alice Asylum and had spent 10-12 years creating a design bible of all the things he would have wanted to develop, however EA (of all companies) owns the IP for Alice and throughout those 10-12 years they just refused him to work on another title leading this series into a limbo and pushing American to quit game development all together. It really sucks cause this is such a fantastic game and there's no doubt that the previous entry was great as well and because of EA being well known for how money hungry they are, it has made one of the best minds of gaming quit on his creation and his career. \nOverall, Alice Madness Returns is a brilliant and twisted experience based off the Lewis Carroll book and while the performance was an unfortunate response from the era that this game was released, all other aspects really shine and is an experience i won't be forgetting anytime soon. \n", "timestamp_created": 1690076865, "timestamp_updated": 1690076865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487540245056152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142601878": {"recommendationid": "142601878", "author": {"steamid": "76561199505192918", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1695574458}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game so much ive been waiting to play since 2012 and i finally got to play it, the graphics are a 10/10 \ntotally recommend and totally worth all that money", "timestamp_created": 1690054485, "timestamp_updated": 1690054485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142566528": {"recommendationid": "142566528", "author": {"steamid": "76561199522004518", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 851, "last_played": 1689627448}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1690005096, "timestamp_updated": 1690005096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142564554": {"recommendationid": "142564554", "author": {"steamid": "76561199331305657", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1690051951}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta muy bueno, lo \u00fanico malo dentro de todo serian sus controles", "timestamp_created": 1690001443, "timestamp_updated": 1690048197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142556816": {"recommendationid": "142556816", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229311393", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1689987778}, "language": "spanish", "review": "NO PUEDO SEGUIR AVANZANDO GRACIAS AL BUG DEL PARAGUAS D MRDA, gracias", "timestamp_created": 1689988226, "timestamp_updated": 1689988226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142543936": {"recommendationid": "142543936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204217908", "num_games_owned": 2290, "num_reviews": 341, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 990, "last_played": 1665849639}, "language": "english", "review": "One of a kind type game, excellent all the way through-out. the best part is buying this gives you access to the first game as well.

Admittedly, I was playing on Nightmare, and it was my first run, so it could just be a skill issue, but I struggled to gain any feeling of satisfaction from a game that just feels like, at least on Nightmare difficulty, is trying to be as punishing as Dark Souls without having things as basic as its dodge functionality working smoothly. Target locking is an unfortunate place where this game's combat takes a pretty severe quality hit. Though some won't mind, I found it increasingly frustrating that I was being forced to use such a poorly implemented system. Locking doesn't actually focus the camera on your target, it's target swapping will sometimes choose to simply not swap targets because of the angle by which one enemy is blocked by another, which is really rough when there are ranged attacks that come with little warning apart from a small sound cue - lost in the mess of other sounds and music playing during combat - that hit you for half of your health. But that wouldn't be so much of an issue if it weren't a core fundamental necessity of the combat system. The aiming mechanics are very dated, so locking is basically your only half way decent option for aim, and on top of that there are certain mechanics as fundamental to combat as BLOCKING that you can't do unless you are currently locked on. This results in the combat feeling incredibly cumbersome as you are forced to engage with easily one of the worst aiming systems I have experienced since Golden Eye.\nBut all that wasn't enough to get me to stop playing this game, which I will admit was telling an interesting story, with a really stark depiction of Wonderland that I personally found really appealing. The environments are fun, even if the exploration through them sometimes feels a little basic, and the characters are all depicted in a very interesting, bleak style. No, that didn't do it. What did it was the bugs.\nThis game bugs out. A lot. Many times I would be beating my head against a particularly frustrating encounter only to finish it, see that there was one enemy kind of off on their own, realize they bugged out so now it won't fight me, but I also can't kill it, so I have to restart my last checkpoint - which were never remotely close to the place where you would fight, which meant you just have to platform your way back, grabbing several collectibles because the game doesn't record that you picked them up when you find them. rant over - and go through the fight all over again, sometimes having to bug test to figure out what would break a given enemy type so I could avoid breaking the fight. I want to battle big monsters, not the software. \nEverything kind of came to a head when I entered the third chapter of the game, and my game started to just look for any and every opportunity to crash and force me to do a hard shut down of my computer. So I said screw it and uninstalled, bringing me to you now.\n\nIf you have the patience of a saint and you can get it on a sale like summer sale (I am relieved I waited for a sale) then give this game a try, but it really isn't of a meaningful quality, so it doesn't really push much of an argument to keep you playing.\n\n3/10. What I experienced I enjoyed, but not enough to deal with how poorly the games mechanics were handled while also battling performance issues and crashes.

Calles sucias, gente tan fea por fuera como por dentro, lavado de cerebro, abuso de menores, prostituci\u00f3n, violencia, asesinatos... Pero afortunadamente, esto no es una pel\u00edcula rusa, sino la creaci\u00f3n de American McGee, que muchos reconocieron solo gracias a la primera parte del juego.\n\nAquellos que se oponen a las secuelas no deber\u00edan apresurarse a abandonar esta creaci\u00f3n solo porque naci\u00f3 en segundo lugar y no puede evocar nostalgia f\u00edsicamente. Tomemos la banda sonora como ejemplo. Cada melod\u00eda de \"American McGee's Alice\" contaba una historia por s\u00ed sola, incluso sin hacer referencia a los niveles. La secuencia de video del juego era solo una buena adici\u00f3n, porque la imagen que esta m\u00fasica pretend\u00eda transmitir ya se presentaba claramente en la mente. Sin embargo, en cuanto suena \"Madness Returns\", las nuevas melod\u00edas cobran sentido. Algunas evocan pruebas emocionales por las que tuvo que pasar la hero\u00edna, mientras que otras representan momentos o pensamientos espec\u00edficos. La banda sonora en s\u00ed se ha vuelto poderosa solo ahora, pero durante el juego, su uso exitoso a menudo se nota con admiraci\u00f3n.\n\nLas armas parecen carecer de la inventiva anterior: son pocas y no son esos juguetes infantiles que sol\u00edan fascinarnos con su uso inesperado. Sin embargo, no pasa nada. Hay armas cuerpo a cuerpo y a distancia, bombas de relojer\u00eda e incluso un escudo. La t\u00e9cnica de combate se ha simplificado al m\u00e1ximo (al presionar \"Bloq May\u00fas\", puedes enfocarte en un enemigo y dispararle sin mirar, y todos los proyectiles dar\u00e1n en el blanco). Adem\u00e1s, los movimientos de Alice son fascinantes y es gratificante simplemente admirar c\u00f3mo \"baila\" alrededor de sus enemigos. A pesar de la frivolidad ideol\u00f3gica de un molinillo de pimienta o la cabeza de un unicornio en un palo, la magnitud del da\u00f1o que causan es impresionante.\n\n\"American McGee's Alice\" era sangriento, oscuro, impregnado de desesperaci\u00f3n y \u00fanico incluso en los instrumentos musicales que componen las melod\u00edas de la banda sonora. La secuela fue diferente a esta experiencia \u00fanica desde los primeros minutos, por lo que no quer\u00eda aceptarla. Al principio, solo la apariencia del juego despierta inter\u00e9s, pero lo hace con dignidad. Y luego entra en juego el contraste. La combinaci\u00f3n de lo lindo, lo inquietante y lo desconcertante del juego atrae a una audiencia diversa que busca una u otra cosa. Algunos pueden sentir miedo cuando los lugares bonitos se convierten repentinamente en algo as\u00ed, mientras que otros pueden sentirse inc\u00f3modos al ver c\u00f3mo lo terrible coexiste con lo amable y puro. Si hubiera existido esta pesadilla desde el principio, no habr\u00eda tenido el mismo efecto, pero la pesadilla aqu\u00ed literalmente absorbe lo bueno y lo puro.\n\nLas im\u00e1genes mostradas en el juego son relevantes para muchos en nuestro tiempo, al menos para el p\u00fablico objetivo de Alice. Sospecho que se trata de personas cuya edad psicol\u00f3gica corresponde a la de los adolescentes: un sentido de su propia importancia les lleva a pensar que su alma es algo as\u00ed como el Pa\u00eds de las Maravillas, tejido a partir de sus propias im\u00e1genes y asociaciones del subconsciente. Inicialmente, este Pa\u00eds de las Maravillas es hermoso y sorprendente, pero las experiencias que se tienen en el mundo real cambian su apariencia. Si algo terrible ocurre, el alma comienza a doler y convierte lo que alguna vez fue amable y dulce en una verdadera pesadilla de im\u00e1genes inquietantes. Cada persona que atraviesa un per\u00edodo dif\u00edcil puede sentirse como Alicia. Sin embargo, no debemos olvidar que ella est\u00e1 loca, y su obsesi\u00f3n por las im\u00e1genes, no importa cu\u00e1n tentadora sea, no tiene un valor real.\n\nSi quieres apreciar la belleza y el encanto del juego, debes estar preparado para su contraparte, tan significativa como la primera, pero atractiva de su propia manera. \"Alice: Madness Returns\" es entretenimiento principalmente para la mente.

Steam, but I still do have the original copy of the PS3 version that I had played about halfway through a few years ago. While I would love to give this game a 10/10, I cannot here on Steam as this port has numerous and game-ruining issues - the biggest being that a major mechanic doesn't even work without editing the files.\n\nThe broken aforementioned mechanic is the ability to repel projectiles with the umbrella. Thankfully, there are several guides out there that provide as easy fix, but the fact that this is in a $20 USD port of a 2011 game is ridiculous. Another easily fixable issue would be the frame rate, which is for some reason capped at 30 by default. Again, this can be fixed with another simple tweak to the game's files. This port is just massively overpriced for the quality you get.\n\nOn a positive note, the actual game itself is fantastic... especially for a game published in 2011. Playing through it for the first time was a really unique experience that had me fully engaged. While I'm not usually into platformer-style games, the game kept me highly interested throughout with its storyline, art, music, and combat - all of which make this game, in my opinion, a masterpiece. This is now absolutely one of the favorite games of all time.\n\nTL;DR: It's an amazing game, but only buy the game if you're comfortable editing the game's files for a better experience as this game's port is terrible quality.

His work with the original Alice all the way back in 2000 on PC was an artistic masterwork in atmosphere and game design, a complete, singular vision from an incredible mind. While gameplay wasn\u2019t the best, it was still a great work of genius, a fully realized vision like no other video game. So in some miracle, EA and McGee released a continuation of such a classic with an even more ambitious title: Madness Returns.\n\nThe sequel was a beautiful, audacious game that expands the twisted Lewis Carroll allegory for trauma into a horror-heavy dark nightmare, making more deliberate shocking twists and visuals. It\u2019s more playable than its predecessor but it isn\u2019t as inspired. Its visuals are a mix of stunning to typical PS3/Xbox 360 resolution. It isn\u2019t as crisp and concrete as 2000\u2019s Alice. But besides that, it\u2019s a solid sequel from a great game designer.\n\nBut the PC port\u2026\n\nYeah, 2010s era EA games were not the best on PC. Titles from Harry Potter to FIFA were known to be locked at 30 fps and ran dismally due to poor optimization and lack of future-proofing. This was also the era of the physx software by Nvidia, which was utilized beautifully in Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, yet has a tendency to hinder performance. This has lessened with new updates and recent releases, but Alice II struggles with lag and  inconsistent framerate, even when the program files are adjusted properly. This can lead to many crashes, even some that require a complete restart of the game. It doesn\u2019t make it unplayable but the fact that the original title is over 20 years old and suffers from less compatibility issues is astounding! And you know sure as hell EA won\u2019t patch it! \n\nThat\u2019s the major problem with Alice: Madness Returns, the current condition of that game as it runs on Windows. EA put NO effort in making the game run smooth and consistently. And this is evident in the lack of future-proofing, making this unplayable without patches, which is unacceptable. \n\nHowever, you should definitely check this out! Don\u2019t take this review as to dissuade you from Alice: Madness Returns. You have two options: patch it on PC, suffering through crashes or play it on Xbox Series X with backwards compatibility.

It holds up.\n\nThis is really not my \"type\" of game.  I think that jumping from platform to platform is the lowest form of entertainment, but the aesthetics and story here made it make sense, and made me excited to wander the inner landscape of fiction's most famous disturbed young woman.  Levels occasionally drag but are cleverly designed and fun, and I explored every area as thoroughly as I could to collect as many hidden memories as I could find.\n\nThere is plenty of combat in the game as well, though not so much that it gets tiresome.  A great variety of monsters are out there and you have four weapons to switch between to cope with armored enemies, fast-moving enemies, flying enemies, etc.  Combat here is at its best when multiple enemy types attack at once, forcing you to develop new strategies on the fly.\n\nSome users complain about the lack of camera control during combat.  I found the camera angles increased the drama in a very appropriate way for the aesthetic, and the game is not so hard that you really need the most convenient Call of Duty controls.  I would definitely not want it changed.\n\nOf course what really sell this game are the art and sound.  To be brief, environments are perfect - whimsical and intimidating at the same time, each of five chapters boasting its own distinct and dreamlike biome.  Characters are cartoonish yet ugly and disturbing, with unpleasant, muddy voice acting to match.  (Leave subtitles on.)  The childlike menace of the music dovetails seamlessly into the visuals.  Alice herself stands out against this twisted setting as graceful and poised, her voice strong and clear, her untidy hair tumbling about fetchingly through her exertions.\n\nThe story is not long or complex; it is instead slowly drip fed to the player over the course of the game through discovered memories, building to a satisfying (if not exactly joyful) conclusion.  In my opinion this sparse story is very good horror and I had strong emotional reactions along the way, particularly at the end.\n\nIt took me around 20 hours to complete the game!  I was surprised there was so much content.  To be honest, it overstayed its welcome a bit - again I am not \"into\" platforming so the increasing challenges of navigating the environment became something of a chore after a while.  But it's a journey I'm glad I made.  The environments are compelling, the combat is engaging, and above all the heroine is sympathetic.  I think you'll find it worth your time to help her discover the truths of her courage, her goodness, and her worth.\n\n[i]Madness Returns[/i] is frequently on sale - wishlist it and very soon you can pick it up for $5 or less, which is an excellent value even a decade+ after the game's original release.", "timestamp_created": 1687732496, "timestamp_updated": 1695776791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509700179100036621", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140698462": {"recommendationid": "140698462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798490139", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 969, "last_played": 1687728383}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, and I love the story.

I bought it originally when it came out back on the Xbox 360 and had the alice original port bundle as well. Was such a good experience on console. Eventually PC version was impossible to get due to EA shenanigans. I wanted a PC copy so eventually just sailed the seas and played it like that on PC and was impressed with how good it played for PC controls for a 3rd person game. \n\nWhen I saw you can purchase it again I wanted to support American McGee by buying it again in hopes of Asylum. Unfortunately we are all left with a sour taste in our mouth. \n\nI've vowed to never purchase a EA game ever again. Plenty of other good new and old games to play besides the shameless microtransaction infested crap they make. \n\nIf you are a fan of 3D action platform games you'll likely love this. This is up there with favorites of mine like Nier Automata. \n\nIt's really fun fluid combat, beautiful environments, character design, music, and interesting story.

There you will encounter various familiar characters from Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass.\" These characters obviously have been transformed into distorted versions of themselves, reflecting Alice's disturbed mental state! Would you be brave enough to embark yourself in this twisted adventure to discover the rest of Alice\u2019s story?\n\nOverall the game is magnificent, even with all the years that passed since its release!\nSo many options to customize the character\u2019s outfit (if you don\u2019t like gothic Alice) also the weapons! The battles are really fun, the art is amazing and the scenery will have you taking screenshots and stopping in your tracks almost every two steps!\n\nJUST LOOK AT THIS:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712634994\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712442199\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712423609\n\nI DARE YOU!

It is extremely inconsistent. Sometimes your aim will move normally, next second it's gonna be 1/20th of your set sensitivity for NO REASON. Or when your crosshair is near an enemy, it slows down even more. It makes aiming extremely difficult, and you are going to be doing a lot of that. I did not find a fix for this.\n* There is a lock on system, but it also has a mind of its own, locking onto random enemies, changing lock when losing line of sight, etc.\n* !!!

Pero nunca me andaba (tal vez en parte fuese por los medios por los cuales adquir\u00eda el juego...) y ahora entiendo por qu\u00e9. TREMENDOS GRAFICOSSSS!!! Literal, le renderizas un poco m\u00e1s el ambiente y las texturas de algunos enemigos y listo, juego de nueva generaci\u00f3n. Muy buenos para ser de 2011. \nLa jugabilidad est\u00e1 muy bien para el 2011, pero bueno se queda media cortina ahora. Eso de \"enfrentarte\" a jefes que en realidad no te terminas enfrentando per se.... Bastante choto eeeh. Pero bueno, dada la distancia temporal, no creo que pueda ser muy objetivo en este aspecto. Lo importante es que se disfruta y tiene variedad y muy vistosos los combates.\nPadece de algunos bugs, como que queres avanzar pero como que hay una pared, pero despues al toque se sale y avanzas. O algunos enemigos de bugean (en especial los pejelagartos esos de hielo, podemos estar 5 minutos esperando a que salgan de abajo del hielo o que directamente se quedan ahi bugeados). Peor bueno, espera un parche como esperas el mensaje de tu ex diciendote que sos el amor de su vida y la mejor persona y que la tenes enorme (s\u00ed, nunca va a pasar bro... lo lamento).\nHasta ahora la historia me est\u00e1 gustado, interesante. Una lastima que la saga no va a tener culminaci\u00f3n. Estar\u00eda bueno que el creador subiese la historia, si total a EA le chupa un pingo hacerla asi que... X. \n\nEn fin, muy buen juego para recordar buenas epocas y si no lo jugaste nunca, como yo, adem\u00e1s, esta buenisimo poder jugarlo y disfrutarlo. \n\nPd: Muy buen Soundtrack amigo.

It's a sequel to American McGee's Alice, but even without playing the first game you can pick up the story of this one fairly easily. The characters are memorable, the gameplay is nice and smooth, there are plenty of secrets and collectables for you to find, enemies to fight with a small but decent variety of weapons, and sound design's great. But where this game stands out most of all is its visual design. Each stage you go to has a distinct aesthetic, and everything is quite gorgeous to behold.\n\nThe only minor (and I emphasise minor) gripe that some players may have is that one or two levels may drag a little. But other than that, there really wasn't anything that I felt particularly negative towards in this game. Definitely worth giving it a shot if you like 3D platformers and visually stunning levels!\n\nAs promised, for anyone wanting to see a sample of gameplay before buying, here's a link to my play-through on Youtube (be warned - this is from when I was playing on an older, non-gaming PC, so the gameplay's frame rate will sometimes chug a bit!):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMFqe7GYvjM&list=PL05Yc3_TEBpM3PLj-tZULRLhJFaKrzzo7", "timestamp_created": 1684855137, "timestamp_updated": 1684855137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138839184": {"recommendationid": "138839184", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036884671", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1684845087}, "language": "english", "review": "nice\n", "timestamp_created": 1684850026, "timestamp_updated": 1684850026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138837390": {"recommendationid": "138837390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087311402", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1689258181}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me into a weird MF I am right now.

American McGee's Alice was a wonderfully twisted take on the story and this one follows the same premise. But I just can't bring myself to review this game well. My major gripe is the safe function ie there is none. The game relies on check points, you can't save your progression as and when you need to. It's annoying enough when you have 2 directions and not sure which one to take, so you take one and boom, check point save and the path behind you becomes blocked so you can't go back and check. But it's worse at the many platform sections. If you mis-time a jump and fall to your doom you respawn at a check point and have to re-do the whole thing. Over. And over. And over. And don't get me started with the bugs; one bug I came across with a boss fight you have to use an umbrella. Except the bug prevents you from using it. So you have to quit (which you can't save so again, check point), edit the game and log back in.\n\nIF there was a proper save function then yes, I would say this is a good game and worth playing.

I wanted to play this one as well because I tried to play the first one in this series and I honestly didn't enjoy it enough to finish it. I felt like I was fighting the controls more than the mobs and so I gave up a little ways in forget how long. \n\nWhen I started to play this one though I was like okay now i see this is what they wanted to do and even though the controls had challenge and I did die sometimes hence the cursing with my slow aged adjustment to speedy attacks it still overall was a fun experience. I just know I couldn't for me skill wise play it on the harder settings.  \n \nI want to give this a good review so badly but I feel like I cannot because I would not want someone else to buy it and then get stuck at the same place I did because I recommended it.  I bought it on sale ages ago for about 5 dollars I believe, and for the hours I got out of it and the enjoyment I did have overall I will say I did get my money's worth. If you do happen to buy this game even after my reading my review I really hope the crashes do not happen for your game. I will be crossing my fingers and my eyes if it helps for you! ^_^ Best of luck!!\n\nP.S This is giving me some Oblivion flashbacks though not quite as bad ^_~", "timestamp_created": 1684535752, "timestamp_updated": 1687618176, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538570761680603027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138571361": {"recommendationid": "138571361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354810747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1228, "last_played": 1686455375}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Super entretenido y aunque su jugabilidad y dificultad es regular vale la pena solo por la historia y el apartado visual, impresionante", "timestamp_created": 1684531042, "timestamp_updated": 1684531042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138566938": {"recommendationid": "138566938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377195101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 596, "last_played": 1684871224}, "language": "english", "review": "It is an amazing game.

ever. Back then, I remember watching my sister play American Mcgee\u2019s Alice demo in our old computer before because we couldn\u2019t really afford to buy the game and although the controls and platforming were kinda clunky and difficult, it still had an allure to it I was really drawn to. I was so intrigued with Alice\u2019s story, I kept going back to it and when finally I got my first laptop, I tried to play a pirated version of the game. Barely ran smoothly even at the most minimum settings, I still played it even though it lagged to an oblivion. Eventually, its sequel Alice Madness returns came. I remember seeing it in a game magazine and I wanted it so much but having no console to play it with nor a decent computer, I had to just to resort to watching Youtube let\u2019s plays.\n\nNow I finally got a decent laptop to play this game, when it went on sale I finally got it. Finished and spent hours on the game and although Alice Madness returns was pretty linear and had it\u2019s own lapses for being too stretched out and repetitive, I still enjoyed it as an experience. Alice\u2019s story is a compelling one. For her, Wonderland was her escapism and what represented her innocence. You play the game traversing Alice\u2019s nightmarish world as a result of her trauma and see how her story unfolds. In the end, she eventually conquers and reconciles with all aspects of her trauma and fears.\n\nThe game has sure aged well and I loved how Mcgee had (emphasis on \u201chad\u201d because we won\u2019t ever get another Alice game brought by the recent news.) introduced a twisted and surreal rendition of Alice in Wonderland. I love how you were thrown into the beginning of the first game as you try to regain what\u2019s left of Alice\u2019s wonderland in ruins.  \n\nThis will be one of the best games for me. As far I was distraught by the news that we won\u2019t be seeing another game of alice again, maybe it\u2019s for the good. If you want to play this game, just pirate it instead. \n\nDon\u2019t support EA and its corporate a**.", "timestamp_created": 1684244630, "timestamp_updated": 1684323780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767988085746765137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138378143": {"recommendationid": "138378143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345245667", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 955, "last_played": 1684240463}, "language": "spanish", "review": "aunque se le notan los a\u00f1os es un juego muy disfrutable y con unos dise\u00f1os geniales, muy recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1684240529, "timestamp_updated": 1684240529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138375257": {"recommendationid": "138375257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296603950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1672346886}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than Super Mario Brothers 3 for the NES.", "timestamp_created": 1684234191, "timestamp_updated": 1684234191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138355439": {"recommendationid": "138355439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419007873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 551, "last_played": 1684462006}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, bad port.\n\nConsistent crashes in specific parts of the game, plus random crashes to desktop, from time to time.

I advise everyone to buy the game and feel the crazy adventures of the main character.", "timestamp_created": 1684100090, "timestamp_updated": 1684100090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138308271": {"recommendationid": "138308271", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985909208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1695754987}, "language": "english", "review": "First time playing this game and was recommended by a friend!

The story begins in aftermath of tragic death of Alice's family in the arson attack. She is admitted to Rutledge Asylum, located in impoverished London. Dr. Angus Bumby allegedly helps her through hypnosis treatment to forget her memories. However, he begins to distort and twist the Wonderland. Soon she\u2019ll follow the white cat into an alley. She meets an old woman there, invites her to her house and Alice suffers a mental collapse. That leads her to Wonderland. The smiling cat tells Alice that the homeland has changed, new rules reign, and a train has arrived. Our adventure begins by discovering the purposefulness of the train, retrieving the memories and facing the evils lurking, since by saving the land Alice will also be saved.\n\nThe story is extraordinary, tragic and petrifying. Apparently the game is based on the well-known novels of Lewis Carroll. It also took as a starting point the game [i]American McGee's Alice[/i]. Although this game is a more dingy, gloomy, dark and violent version that distances itself from the pleasant world of Disney production. The argument is quite simple and understandable. But we must put the pieces of memory together in the form of a puzzle to expose what really happened as well as discover the intention of the train. The language of the game reminds us of Carroll's poetic tone: he amalgams logic and poetry with unexpected puns. In addition, a psychological symbolism is presented at every moment. With this they achieve to perturb us in order to plunge ourselves in the traumas and in Alice's story. It\u2019s a good adaptation that gradually persuades us of an oneiric journey in the sea of nightmares. \n\nAbout art is quite interesting. The game always contrasts the real world, the distortion of that world and the wonderland. Each chapter develops unique art, just like Alice's outfits. The game is fairly rich and harmonious in colour palettes with an exquisite mix of various shades. Art is also deeply influenced by various currents and artistic expressions: Victorian aesthetics, baroque, mannerism, realism and surrealism. Above all it reminds us of the paintings of Dor\u00e9, Magritte, Arcimboldo, Metsys, Mark Ryden, Ceccoli, just to mention a few. The game's art design harmoniously complements the narrative, so we can comprehend the symbols, meanings, buried details, and plot clues as we get closer to Alice's thoughts. Each place reveals the character's personality before the depersonalization process. The design of each place is extremely amazing, that intrigue and capture our attention. It\u2019s ambivalent: a protected maze; tidy and broken, colourful and opaque, vivid and sinister, alive and dead, fantastic and horrid; all in Schr\u00f6ndigerian overlay, that is, in paradoxes.\n\n[b]Playability[/b] 10/10\n\nThe base mechanic of this game consists of the platform. The game is designed in the form of levels. Each of them contains a series of puzzles to open a path and thus continue. It's not just about jumping on every moving platform. It\u2019s about discovery a way to cross to the other side. For that we have basic movements like jumping, leaping and floating. Those moves can be combined to reach far away platforms or take advantage in combat. It\u2019s important to pay attention to the things on each scenario, because this game is intuitive through which it allows us to decipher the riddle.\n\nSince Alice follows the narrative of the literature we know, she can shrink. With that ability, she can temporarily hide from enemies. Being small, she can go through small doors, see platforms or hidden paths, as well as look at notes on the blackboard. The latter through drawings tells us what we found in our path. They are purple indications. Hence exploration is important in the game. We\u2019ll find memories, teeth (which are used to improve weapons), roses (which form for the character's health), and secret passages revealed through Pig Snouts' sneezes.\n\nEach level is common, as sometimes it's just progress, while other times it will be fighting enemies to unlock doors, levers or switches. As we progress, the difficulty increases. Different enemies emerge. For this, we have weapons and outfits with dissimilar advantages. Each outfit and weapon is unlocked by playing a certain chapter. In combat mode, there is the option to activate concentration mode. This will allow us to evade enemy attacks such as counterattacking, for example, by rejecting an enemy's projectile with the umbrella. We can also use Clockwork Bomb to distract enemies, to open some doors or use as a counterweight on switches. It can be combined in many ways. When Alice is about to die, the hysteria mode will be activated. We can also improve our health bar through [i]Paint the Rose Red[/i]. Four shards are required to get a whole rose. The Radula Room will guide to the spots where these fragments will drop from completing challenges.\n\n[b]Music and FX[/b] 10/10\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Marshall Crutcher, Jason Tai, and Chris Vrenna. The theme of the score finds its substance in the dantesque world of Alice. The musical pieces epitomize how Wonderland is distorted and Alice will achieve everything possible to recover it and rescue herself. She\u2019s her own protagonist and her own hero without the uneasiness or fuss of being rescued by someone else.\n\nNow the music is polyphonic and polychromatic. It has a variety of tones, sounds, performed by various musical instruments and electronic effects, which craft a rich and exquisite concentrated content. Sometimes we hear sweet and cheery sounds, while other times we perceive sinister and gloomy melodies. The soundtrack attempts to maintain an equilibrium through the opposites: lucidity and madness, wonder and horror, light and dark. Everything is spinning between reality and surrealism.\n\nTo achieve their composition, the musicians use various electronic effects and musical instruments. On many occasions it\u2019s based on dark ambient or orchestral arrangements. Some tunes contain a children's theme performed by music box melodies. But always highlighting musical pieces that contain violin and piano. That offers, through a sinister scale, the sensation of fear, horror and disturbance. It constantly accentuates the consternation caused by Alice's distorted world. In moments of battle, instead, the insistent energy of the percussions rules. But it\u2019s soon mollified by the music on the scenario. Each chapter has a unique piece of music \u2014we can listen to them as a looping. The musical pieces contain mystery and symbolism that make more noticeable the drama of the story and emphasizes the aura of each corner of Alice's mind.\n\n[b]Duration[/b] 10/10\n\nLike leafing through a book: always motivated to know what will happen. This game is an interesting artwork that comprehends psychological symbolism in an enthralling adventure. The game is quite long. It has several difficulties; it can be replayed via game+. The previous game, American McGee's Alice, has been included. The rest of the gameplay is worth living the adventure. In this way we discover different rhythms and gameplay, as well as puzzles in the form of mini-games. It\u2019s worth finding out the mysteries of the human mind expressed in art and games.\n\n[h1]Recommendation: 10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1684089962, "timestamp_updated": 1684089962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138277745": {"recommendationid": "138277745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059946528", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 706, "last_played": 1684127616}, "language": "english", "review": "You have to do a few bug fixes: rebinding keys, changing resolution, changing fov, and changing max fps.

Even if your health gets low, you have a special ability that makes you temporarily invincible and increases your damage, so the enemies feel more like a grind than a legit threat.\n\nThe game is also kind of a glitchy mess. There are instances when you are locked with a certain weapon and can't switch without restarting the game, or the menu mouse cursor remains on screen while you play. The glitches are severe enough to soft-lock you from the rest of the game. In my case it was the umbrella block tutorial section. I was stuck fighting an enemy that was invincible to any other attack and I couldn't do anything about it.\n\nAlso, it's owned by EA that would rather let this IP rot than let anybody else realize it's potential.

No es necesario jugar este para entender Madness Returns.\n\n\n\nHablando m\u00e1s en profundidad del juego:\n\nVisualmente es incre\u00edble. Pese a ser del 2011 se ve de maravilla por su preciosa ambientaci\u00f3n la cual es tan bonita que parece un cuadro hecho videojuego. Los escenarios son preciosos, cada lugar se siente \u00fanico y diferente y tiene un significado narrativo dentro de la historia. \n\nEs un claro ejemplo que, para que un juego tenga buenos gr\u00e1ficos, no tiene que ser t\u00e9cnicamente perfecto, ni tener texturas ultra HD, resoluci\u00f3n 4K, HDR, raytracing y remil paridas solo para poder ver hasta los pelos del culo sin dientes de sierra. Con tener a un buen equipo de artistas con mucho talento y darles libertad para expresar su creatividad, se lograr\u00e1 crear arte. \nY este juego lo demuestra.\n\n\n\nPor otra parte, tanto la exploraci\u00f3n como el combate son excelentes.\n\nEl secreto est\u00e1 en las armas, que son pocas pero todas tienen su utilidad tanto para luchar como para descubrir los diferentes secretos ocultos y conseguir todos los coleccionables.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, se pueden mejorar para que sean m\u00e1s efectivas, lo que incita todav\u00eda m\u00e1s a querer luchar y explorar, ya que as\u00ed se conseguir\u00e1n dientes (la moneda del juego) para poder mejorar dichas armas.\n\nQuiz\u00e1s lo \u00fanico \"malo\" es que no hay penalizaci\u00f3n por morir.\nHubiera estado bien que hubiera alg\u00fan tipo de castigo por morir, como en Bioshock Infinite que si te matan pierdes algunas monedas del juego e incluso otros juegos como Hollow Knight si mueres pierdes todas las monedas, aunque luego se pueden recuperar.\nLo digo adem\u00e1s porque al final del juego consigues dientes de sobras para tener todas las armas mejoradas al 100% y ya no hay motivo para acumular dientes.\n\n\n\nPor \u00faltimo, y no menos importante, he de decir que la historia me ha encantado.\n\nEl juego original American McGee's ALICE cre\u00f3 una historia muy buena sobre que hubiera pasado si Alice hubiese quedado traumada tras la muerte de sus padres y su hermana, sinti\u00e9ndose culpable por ser la \u00fanica superviviente. Y todo el juego transcurr\u00eda en una versi\u00f3n pesadillesca del Pa\u00eds de las Maravillas, dando como resultado una historia de autosuperaci\u00f3n muy emocionante.\n\nEste juego va incluso m\u00e1s all\u00e1 y nos cuenta la historia a trav\u00e9s de los ojos de Alice, tanto dentro como fuera del Pa\u00eds de las Maravillas, donde conoceremos a m\u00e1s personajes y veremos como el Pa\u00eds de las Maravillas pasa de ser un lugar verde y vivo a un infierno lleno de sufrimiento y tortura.\n\nEs de los pocos juegos que he visto junto a Psychonauts y Celeste que saben reflejar muy bien lo que son las enfermedades mentales y lo que cuesta superarlas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn resumen:\n\nUn juegazo muy bueno y precioso desde todos los \u00e1ngulos y perspectivas.\n\n\nCada salto es muy satisfactorio y cada parry muy gratificante y si lo combinamos con cada una de las armas cuerpo a cuerpo y a distancia que tienen tanta utilidad en el combate y la exploraci\u00f3n, tenemos un juego de plataformas y acci\u00f3n excelente que te entra por los ojos por sus preciosos gr\u00e1ficos.\n\nLo \u00fanico triste es ver que el creador original nunca podr\u00e1 hacer su deseada tercera parte de esta saga (se iba a llamar ALICE Asylum) porque a Electronic Arts no le da la gana.

Prep\u00e1rate para un viaje a trav\u00e9s del mundo psicod\u00e9lico y retorcido de Alice, donde nada es lo que parece y todo est\u00e1 al rev\u00e9s.\n\nEn este juego, encarna a la famosa Alicia del cuento, pero en una versi\u00f3n mucho m\u00e1s loca y demente. La historia comienza con Alice intentando recuperarse de la muerte de su familia y la locura que la ha perseguido desde entonces. Pero en lugar de recibir terapia, se encuentra en un mundo extra\u00f1o y oscuro, lleno de criaturas deformes y peligrosas.\n\nLa mec\u00e1nica del juego es bastante simple: tienes que explorar el mundo, encontrar objetos y resolver acertijos para avanzar en la historia. Pero lo que realmente hace que este juego sea divertido es su est\u00e9tica g\u00f3tica y su enfoque en la locura y el surrealismo. Desde el momento en que comienzas a jugar, te sumerges en un mundo retorcido y colorido que parece sacado de un sue\u00f1o febril.\n\nLa jugabilidad en s\u00ed es bastante s\u00f3lida, aunque a veces puede ser un poco repetitiva. Pero la historia es lo que realmente hace que este juego valga la pena. Es una mezcla de cuentos de hadas cl\u00e1sicos y psicodrama oscuro, y realmente te mantiene en vilo.\n\nEn general, Alice: Madness Returns es un juego divertido y emocionante que te llevar\u00e1 a trav\u00e9s de un mundo loco e imaginativo. Si te gustan los juegos con una est\u00e9tica g\u00f3tica y un enfoque en la locura y el surrealismo, \u00a1este es el juego para ti!

These games were the entire career of a man named American McGee who has been the main developer and story writer of the franchise since its inception and release in 2000. There was a planned sequel to Alice Madness Returns that would continue the story known as Alice Asylum which was planned after Electronic Arts originally approached McGee about a sequel. As of not even a week ago at the time of writing this the project has been canceled after being reviewed EA felt that the much awaited sequel would not be published due to things such as popularity and other metrics.\n\nThe true reason not to buy this game lies in that, American McGee, the rightful owner and creator of this IP has been removed from it. After denying the creation of the third game which they originally approached him for they also refused to sell the IP to him so that he could publish his own game, thus entirely removing him from his own franchise he had worked on for the past 23 years, a franchise that from its very beginning was his and even named after him. The fact the modern game industry can take a man's own work that he has spent his entire career making deeply saddens me, the soul of the game comes from its creator not the soulless corporation extorting it for money.\n\nThat said please do not support this game going forward rather support Mysterious the company ran by McGee and his family if you wish to show any love for him or the franchise. For any long time fans or newcomers McGee has also released the Design Bible for what would have been Alice Asylum, so any looking for a continuation of the story should look to that and look to obtain the Alice franchise games through other means that do not support EA as this game and franchise is worth playing due to the soul it holds from American McGee which has been taken away now by EA. McGee has stated he will no longer be developing games whatsoever due to these events, and that any attempt at another game in the series will be done without his involvement as EA has taken his IP from him entirely. I will link below some places for more information and resources for any interested.\n\nOfficial Post About The Cancellation\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/end-of-adventure-81049672\n\nAlice Asylum Design Bible\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/alice-asylum-v1-78703655\n\nMcGee's Online Store Mysterious\nhttps://mysterious.americanmcgee.com/", "timestamp_created": 1681673854, "timestamp_updated": 1681673956, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136819912": {"recommendationid": "136819912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130038882", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1682043657}, "language": "english", "review": "New Classic", "timestamp_created": 1681670412, "timestamp_updated": 1681670412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464601784944534302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136818482": {"recommendationid": "136818482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135250573", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1681668357}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is good not bad but It feels like you're just looping around and doing the same shit again and again.

Pan across something at a distance and the mouse slows to a crawl. \n\nMaddening.\n\nSecondly, the auto-save system is quite broken. If you die to platforming, no worries you restart close and can continue. If you die to monsters, YOU DONE F*****'d UP and the game will restart you at the beginning of the platform. So, so far back. Like maddeningly far back. Oh and the enemies are only at the end of the platform, obviously.\n\nThirdly, the key bindings!

Normally I don't leave review until I have finished playing the game. But this game...\n\nI haven't actually started playing it yet, even though it says 54 minutes on my account. I spent around the first 30 minutes tinkering to make the game support the Ultrawide 21:9 display and raising the fps from 30 to 60 fps; and then I spent another 20 minutes or so choosing the best Video Settings, Sound Settings as well as walking around in the game to get a general feel of it to see if it is worth playing or not.\n\nAll I can say it, the voice acting is absolutely brilliant!! And the random dialogues from the men aren't boring either. Graphics look awesome, especially from a game that was released 12 years ago. The bricks, the wall, very well made and the town is so lively. It even supports surround sounds, so I imagine when I start playing for real, I will be able to tell exactly which ways the enemies will be coming from just by hearing the directions of the sounds.\n\nNow, for whatever strange reasons, EA didn't put up the first here on either Steam nor Origin. So I will have to watch the playthrough of the first game on Youtube, instead of being able to play them, before I can start to play this one for real, so that I will know how the stories are connected.\n\nHowever, the main reason why I am leaving this review early on, instead of finishing the game first, it's because just about 10 minutes earlier, I was thinking if there might be a third game in development and due to release soon by any luck? Since this game is from such a long time ago.\n\nSo I found the news announcement that, (you've guessed it) that they canceled it just a week ago!\n\nThe article says something like EA didn't want to do it, but the Alice IP is important to EA so they don't want to sell it to American McGee. That was more than frustrating to read.

[i]Maybe for Alice: MR it's not a good idea[/i], here's why:\n\n1. Dodges are atrocious. Enemies can transfer their aggro mid-attack to you and it feels absolutely frustrating. \nYou can place decoy bunny-bomb which can get destroyed any second and you get punched for it.\n2. Auto-aim camera is horrendous. It often moves to funny angles where you simply can't see you enemy.\n3. Big enemies have a tendency to cast stupid grab attack. It's hard to dodge when you can't turn character where you want all the time while dodge-spamming. And dodge-spamming is the only way to dodge grab attack which is designed to catch you 100% of the time you're close enough even when mid-dodge.\n4. Some enemier are too weak. Like they liteally just stand AFK. No joy in defeating those. And they exist even towards the end of the game somehow.\n\nTo everything else:\nPlatforming is beatiful. It's a pure joy to jump around and seek for keyholes and hidden objects. \nGame delivers that.\nLevel design is excellent. Every time Alice enters a new lvl she changes her outfit which is a neat little feature that adds to the environment. \nArguable but you can feel how Alice moves deeper into her mind throughout the game. \nCloser to the end you get less story and more of some mad and unsettling levels.\nPig snouts have the worst hitboxes in gaming history.\nSome enemier repeat thoughout the whole game.\nGenerally it feels like devs could use more time to polish some mechanics.\n\nSadly, can't say much about characters of Wonderland. \nIt sure feels like their stories are underdeveloped. We don't get much sense even towards the end. \nThat leaves me with some feeling of unsatisfaction. \n\nOverall - this game has it's charm and I'd recommend playing it for sure, even though it's been 12 years since it released. There are some minor bugs that I could address, but those are negligible.\n\nIt's a real shame EA killed the franchise, imagine this game with AAA graphics and modern technology. \nRIP Alice.\n\nP.S.

Now she\u2019s trying to regain some semblance of a normal life only to have to fight her way through a corrupt Wonderland once again. Will Alice be victorious or will insanity overtake her?\n\nRemember how the last game took place entirely in the corrupted Wonderland of Alice\u2019s mind? This game changes things up a bit by showing some segments in London while slowly venturing into Wonderland. The first London segment has Alice getting medicine for Bumby from Pris Witless, a nurse from the Asylum who\u2019s blackmailing Alice into doing free labor for her. This becomes the first segment into Wonderland where Alice has to go through an evil factory where the Dormouse and the March Hare literally work the dodo employees to death. Which is a clear reference to the deplorable nature of Victorian factories but can also work as a reference to the slave labor Alice has to do for Nurse Witless\u2019s silence. The second London segment is about Alice narrowly avoiding a rape experience to see her former nanny turned prostitute, Nan Sharpe, only to get slapped by her pimp. This leads to the next chapter in Wonderland where Alice has to help Walrus and Carpenter put on a show not realizing that she helped them gather sentient ocean citizens for the Walrus to eat, including oysters and fish, until it\u2019s too late. While it\u2019s supposed to be a metaphor for pimping, I believe that there\u2019s more to this level which I will go into later. In the third London segment, Alice visits her former attorney to get the stuffed rabbit he unlawfully took from her. The Asian art in his office inspires Alice to visit a country in Wonderland inspired by both Chinese and Japanese culture which is an inaccurate blend of both countries. This is justified since Alice has never been to either one in her life. During Alice\u2019s journey to see the caterpillar, she comes across innocent peasant origami ants brutally attacked by samurai wasps. While this could be taken as a reference to the historical British colonization of the East during that time period, in the case of Alice, it represents how the weak get overtaken by the powerful which is how she feels throughout the game. At the same time, the ants see Alice as their savior, which reflects her desire to be the hero yet, no matter how many wasps she defeats, they just keep coming. This represents just how helpless she feels in a dangerous world. The very last Victorian segment is when Alice gets thrown in a jail cell after accusing the pimp who slapped her of burning down a pub/brothel. The jail cell turns into the dungeon of the Red Queen, who Alice thinks she must defeat once again to save Wonderland. However, despite the Red Queen\u2019s actions, she\u2019s not the true villain of the story. Just like how Alice believed that the pimp, while an awful man, was the true villain when the true villain was right in front of her eyes.\n\nAfter that is the final part of the game, the Dollhouse. It\u2019s unique in that there\u2019s no Victorian segment. Instead, it begins with a flashback to the asylum, showing the torture and humiliation Alice went through. Then slowly goes to the Dollhouse, where the true enemy is revealed. The man I mentioned earlier, Dr. Bumby, who gives Alice and the children at Houndsditch therapy sessions so they can forget their traumas. Since forgetting is essentially a bad therapy practice all together, the true purpose was to erase their minds until they become a blank slate and then sell the blank slates to satisfy the twisted desires of the rich. It was not only Bumby\u2019s plan for Alice, but he also wanted to erase her memory of the fire. Years ago, Bumby was obsessed with Alice\u2019s sister, Lizzie, and snuck into their mansion late at night to rape and murder her. Then burned the mansion down to erase any evidence that he committed the crime. In Wonderland, Alice\u2019s mind turns Bumby into a creature known as the dollmaker because, in the sickest way possible, he\u2019s making dolls for the rich citizens of Victorian London to play with.\n\nWhile all you do in London is walk around, you\u2019re much more powerful in Wonderland. You can kill enemies with a knife, a pepper grinder, a hobby horse or a teapot. If that\u2019s not enough, you can collect teeth to upgrade them to their most powerful level. You can jump and glide to where you need to go and shrink to not only find secret locations but see hidden platforms. Though the camera can get a little wonky to the point where you and the enemy you\u2019re fighting completely disappear from the screen. For anyone buying the game here, be warned that there\u2019s a serious coding problem. In the game, you pick up an umbrella which you can use to block while locked on to enemies but, when you push the button, the umbrella doesn\u2019t even appear. Trust me when I say that this will get really irritating, especially with enemies where you need the umbrella to beat them. I had to google how to get around it and mess with the coding in the files just to use the umbrella and, since it\u2019s an old game, I doubt Steam\u2019s fixing this. You also have a time bomb which you\u2019ll end up using more as a glorified paper weight than anything else. During the game, you can also collect bottles with artwork, shoot pig snouts to access different areas or get more teeth and collect memories so you can get the full story. Though I should warn you that the game isn\u2019t open sandbox so, if you miss any, you\u2019ll have to actually use the chapter select and start the game over right from that chapter. Which I\u2019ve actually had to do a couple of times. This is why, if you\u2019re going to have a collection side quest, you need to make the game an open world. So, if you miss something, you can always go back and get it.\n\nDespite the many enemies you\u2019ll find in this game, there are no boss battles whatsoever. Sure, the game teases boss battles throughout each chapter, like Chapter 1 teasing the Dormouse and the March Hare and Chapter 4 teasing the Executioner. Instead, both villains are easily taken care of in a cutscene. All right, that\u2019s not entirely true. There\u2019s one boss battle at the end of the game with the Dollmaker. Apparently, there\u2019s a reason for this. American McGee felt that Boss Battles were becoming a clich\u00e9, so he chose not to have them. The only reason there\u2019s a Boss Battle at the end was because he wanted to end the game on an epic note. Unfortunately, he failed to realize that Boss Battles are the point of battle games in general. You gather weapons, you practice your fighting skills to take on the big Boss at the end. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point?\n\nThis game is addictive, yet disturbing. I give it 7 out of 10; stay away if you\u2019re easily triggered but, otherwise, enjoy.\n\nhttps://suburbantimewaster.com/", "timestamp_created": 1681071394, "timestamp_updated": 1681071394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136430402": {"recommendationid": "136430402", "author": {"steamid": "76561199102935265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 833, "last_played": 1697577821}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game even if its 12 years old soon.

The story is compelling and the visuals are brilliant, but sadly the gameplay mechanics are sorely lacking. This game is from 2011 but feels much older.

I reconfigured the umbrella block from E to RMB because that makes sense, but it doesn't register that I'm using it. As a result, combat is frustrating and not very fun. I find my fingers having to perform feats of keyboard acrobatics that no person should endure. The lock on system is also incredibly jarring - I lose fights not because they are particularly challenging, but because I'm distracted by fumbling with the weird controls and janky camera.\n\n It's a huge shame because I really want to like this game.

Hope you like em Bri'ish.\n\nAlice: Madness Returns is surprisingly hard to judge. A lot of the things the game does appear, on a surface level, to be really good - until the novelty wears off and the issues become more apparent. Inconsistent would be a good way to describe this game, but overall enjoyable and very unique in its own right.\n\nThe story is good - it takes the original children's book and puts it in a somewhat over-the-top perverted shell. Due to the inherent insanity of Wonderland this creates an almost natural blend. The game has a few very quotable lines.\n\nThe visual presentation is good - if not a little inconsistent. The animations are overall good. The cloth and hair physics make the game feel like a demonstration of whatever version of PhysX they were using at the time. The backdrop is inconsistent, ranging from good to very bland. The caricatures are great and create a Burton-esque vibe in combination with the morbidity of the topics involved.\n\nAudio design is decent, but again pretty inconsistent. I can appreciate the decision to go for merely ambiance backdrops as opposed to musical compositions, but they're fairly bland. The SFX is really not bad. Love the sounds for the Pepper grinder (minigun).\n\nGameplay is, once again, good but inconsistent. When first introduced to it I was blown away with how seamlessly it blends ranged and melee combat while allowing for an incredible amount of expressiveness through only a few enemies. Almost all of them require a completely different approach to be dealt with. Unfortunately it doesn't do a very good job on expanding upon it as the game progresses and the jankiness starts to eventually claim it's toll. Many of the arenas are not designed for the sheer amount of threats thrown your way and the lock-on system simply isn't robust enough to mitigate this either. Enemies do not seem to attack by any rules other than some randomized internal timer - making it very common to just die in a single stroke of bad-luck (on Nightmare difficulty). The parry mechanic is very poorly implemented and way too limited. The melee weapons do combine, but very poorly. The \"roll\" (a dash) seems to have a will on its own when locked on to enemies. There are a lot of pieces here that would make for a great game, but they just don't really seem to fit together.\n\nLevel design is actually kind of disappointing. The game sets itself up for some really nice secrets through some of the introduced mechanics, but only uses them in the most blatantly obvious fashion possible.

Get ready for \"Alice: Madness Returns.\"\n\n[FADE IN]\n\nNARRATOR (Honest Trailer Voice): \"Alice: Madness Returns\" is a dark, twisted take on Lewis Carroll's classic tale that somehow manages to make Wonderland even more nightmarish than you remember. It's like someone handed Tim Burton a megaphone and said, \"Go wild, but make it a video game.\"\n\n[ENTER RYAN GEORGE]\n\nRYAN GEORGE (Pitch Meeting Style): So, we're thinking Alice in Wonderland, but like, not at all the Disney version, you know? Dark and gritty. \n\n[PRODUCER]: I like it. What's the pitch?\n\nRYAN GEORGE (Pitch Meeting Style): So, we've got Alice, right? She's all grown up now, dealing with some intense trauma, and her Wonderland's not exactly the tea party she remembers. In fact, it's a psychedelic horror show.\n\n[PRODUCER]: I love the nightmare fuel, go on.\n\n[BACK TO HONEST TRAILER]\n\nNARRATOR (Honest Trailer Voice): Strap in for a thrilling adventure filled with gruesome enemies, jaw-dropping visuals, and a story that'll keep you guessing. It's like Tim Burton's fever dream, but interactive!\n\nRYAN GEORGE (Pitch Meeting Style): And check this out - Alice uses weapons like the Vorpal Blade and the Pepper Grinder. You ever wanted to fight your inner demons with a pepper grinder? Well, now you can!\n\n[PRODUCER]: Unique, I like it.\n\n[BACK TO HONEST TRAILER]\n\nNARRATOR (Honest Trailer Voice): But, don't be fooled by the dark and twisted exterior, because at its core, \"Alice: Madness Returns\" is a story of mental health, trauma, and self-discovery. It tackles these heavy themes with grace and artistry.\n\nRYAN GEORGE (Pitch Meeting Style): And Alice, she's voiced by Susie Brann. Fantastic job, by the way. Her delivery is on point, and she perfectly captures the essence of a young woman struggling with her sanity.\n\n[PRODUCER]: Sounds intriguing.\n\n[BACK TO HONEST TRAILER]\n\nNARRATOR (Honest Trailer Voice): As you journey deeper into Wonderland's chaotic abyss, you'll uncover hidden secrets, engage in mind-bending puzzles, and meet an array of bizarre characters, each more twisted than the last.\n\nRYAN GEORGE (Pitch Meeting Style): Oh, and we've got collectibles. Because nothing says 'exploring your fractured psyche' like searching for hidden bottles and memories!\n\n[PRODUCER]: Brilliant. The gamers will love that.\n\n[BACK TO HONEST TRAILER]\n\nNARRATOR (Honest Trailer Voice): But don't forget, this game can get pretty intense. It's not for the faint of heart, folks. Be prepared for some disturbing imagery that'll make you question your sanity.\n\nRYAN GEORGE (Pitch Meeting Style): And check this out, we've got dresses. Alice can change dresses to gain different abilities. Because why not? We'll throw in some platforming, some slashing, and some psychological horror just for fun.\n\n[PRODUCER]: You had me at dresses.\n\nNARRATOR (Honest Trailer Voice): \"Alice: Madness Returns\" is a triumph of storytelling and design that invites you into the depths of madness. It's a game that manages to be both visually stunning and thematically profound, exploring the dark corners of the human mind while delivering an unforgettable gaming experience.\n\nRYAN GEORGE (Pitch Meeting Style): And hey, we even leave room for a sequel. Because nothing says Wonderland like a whole series of mind-bending games!\n\n[PRODUCER]: You're a genius.\n\nNARRATOR (Honest Trailer Voice): So, prepare to fall down the rabbit hole into madness, as you guide Alice on her journey through the distorted landscapes of Wonderland. It's like a wild, never-ending tea party with the Mad Hatter, but with a dash  dash of horror and a sprinkle of psychological trauma.\n\nNARRATOR (Honest Trailer Voice): \"Alice: Madness Returns,\" where the only way to survive is to embrace the madness.

Therefore Alice: Madness Returns starts off in a somewhat strange situation. Yet the at the same time the protagonis can barely remember her past and I merely joined in on the amnesia. With regular switches between the dark, bleak reality and Alice's twisted wonderland, the story unravels on multiple levels. By the last two chapters I was more intrigued by the upcoming conclusion rather than the actual gameplay. A truely impressive feat for a game that consists of 95% gameplay. Without spoiling too much, the unique twisted wonderland with all of its disturbing imagery and the surrounding story make for an unforgettable setting.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nWhile Alice is just a poor, insane girl without any skills but walking in real life, she turns into an instoppable killing machine equiped with a knife, a pepper-grinder machine-gun, a toy horse battle-hammer and a teapot mortar. Floating, multi-jumps, timebombs that also activate pressure plates and a shrinking ability to squeeze through hidden passage ways, Alice has all the tools she needs for any combat encounter or platforming puzzle.\nThe platforming puzzles themselves are mostly straight forward, but can be challenging at times. Yet I never got stuck for more than a few minutes. The tougher ones feel appropriately gratifying after completion.\nCombat is theoretically engaging as every enemy has a way or two to expose weak points, but is otherwise reistant to most weapons. Yet the combat suffers from one major problem, which I will get back to in the next section: target locking.\n\nWhile the basic gameplay is great, engaging and fun, the game is riddled with insanely bad design decisions. At every parting of ways, the player is left wondering. Is one of them a dead end containing collectibles? Are both ways alternatives to the same destination? Or is there only one way forward? Usually that would not be a problem in a game about exploration, yet levels are swarmed by points of no return. Every doorway, every jump can lock you out from going back without warning. Thus collecting everything without a guide is basically impossible, unless you want to rerun chapters multiple times.\nThese points of no return can also be triggered by gathering a quest item or killing enemies. This means that you have to explore every room with enemies attacking you, if you don't want the game to consider a room completed and literally teleport you out and close the door behind you. You might even see a collectible or hidden passage during the little cutscene that kicks you out.\nThen again, once you give in to the madness that is this horrbile design choice, once you just don't care about collectibles anymore, every one you find becomes a nice little surprise, instead of others being missed opportunities. Maybe that's what the developers had in mind in the first place.\n\n[h1]Camera[/h1]\nThat one is so bad, it deserves its own section. During most of the gameplay the player can control the camera and it works perfectly fine. But everytime the game takes control, things fall apart.\nThere are small sections where the camera jumps to a corner to display the whole room. Unfortunately the controls don't make that jump and still act like the camrea is following you. Once you push a button, though, the controls suddenly realize that they should behave diffently according to the camera position. This means you shuffle to the collectible like an idiot, running into walls headfirst. At least until you realize that you can simply swing your blade once to reset the controls.\nThen there are \"2D\" sections. They control horribly throughout.\nLast but not least, there is combat. Target lock is the worst I have ever seen. The camera merely tries to keep you and the locked enemy on screen, instead of looking over the shoulder at the enemy. This leads to so many awkward camera angles that it's unplayable. Switching the locked target is also a game of chance rather than a precise act, and locking on targets out of view simply does not happen. Everytime there are multiple enemies involved, you will find yourself attacked from out of sight by enemies with ranged attacks. You will have to unlock the target, move the camera manually and lock again. As a cherry on top, you can only block while locked on a target. The same button allows you to jump, meaning you cannot do that while locked on the target. Horrible design, plain and simple. Alice: Madness Returns shows its true horror with the worst camera handling I have encountered since Legacy of Kain: Defiance.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nMostly stable and smooth, but with occasional sutters and crashes. Completely unplayable with rythm puzzles, though. It's just a little 2d animation where you have to push buttons once the line hits them, but the processing is so unstable that I have simply skipped every single one of those puzzles after a few tries. The developers knew what horrible mess they were producing when they introduced that skip function.\n\n[h1]Aesthetics[/h1]\nGod damn, is it beautiful. Yes, it is bizarre and unsettling and depressing, but the designs are so intriguing and unique, that you just can't take your eyes off. The age somewhat shows, but the art style easily makes up for it. Every chapter is a feast for the eyes and Alice gets a matching dress to go along with it.\n\n[h1]Female Protagonist[/h1]\nSpeaking of dresses: I have to address this topic here. In our own sick and twisted reality where people seriously discuss how much of a natural hip sway caused by female anatomy is appropriate for a female protagonist like Aloy, Alice is a breath of fresh air - even though released 12 years ago. When she walks, jumps, twirls and floats, every move she makes is distinctly feminine. Butterflies accompany her in the air and when she dodges, she even blinks in a massive explosion of butterflies. The way she moves her hands while walking or positions her arms and legs when gliding are girly yet elegant. And so are the dresses. Every one has a sick little twist, but they are gorgeous nontheless. She even talks like a proper british lady - unless she goes into an eloquent rant. Alice is as feminine as protagonists get, yet she becomes a total badass in combat - and players root for her even more once she takes that badassness into reality for the ending.\nI miss those days when female protagonists were actual girls with impressive skills and not just toxic men with boobs. Can we have more Alices in the future, please?\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game is great for the most part. The camera is jarring all the way to the final boss, but the other aspects of the game more than make up for it. If you're into surreal, disturbing imagery and goth girls, this is the game for you. Actually, unless you are a completionist who refuses to use guides and still wants to keep his sanity, this game is also for you. And it's currently for sale.

The game's story is set in Victorian-era London, where Alice has been committed to a mental institution following the death of her family in a fire. As she navigates through the game's twisted and distorted version of reality, Alice confronts a range of characters and situations that reflect the trauma and abuse she has experienced in her life.\n\nThe game's unique art style and eerie atmosphere contribute to the overall feeling of unease and discomfort, creating an immersive and emotionally charged experience for the player. Throughout the game, Alice struggles with her sanity and the dark forces that threaten to overwhelm her. The game's story and themes are a commentary on mental health and the effects of trauma on the human psyche, as well as a reflection on the societal norms and expectations that can contribute to such experiences.\n\nDespite its dark themes, Alice: Madness Returns is a game that offers a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the human experience. It offers a unique blend of action, adventure, and puzzle-solving in a beautifully designed world. The game's focus on mental health and trauma is a welcome change from traditional gaming narratives, and its platforming elements offer a challenging and satisfying experience for players who are looking for something a little different. Overall, Alice: Madness Returns is a game that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and gaming, and is well worth exploring for those who enjoy games that challenge their perceptions and expectations.\n\nIn addition to its dark themes and motifs, Alice: Madness Returns is also notable for its striking visuals and imaginative design. One of the most striking features of the game is the beautiful and unique outfits worn by the main character, Alice. These outfits range from a traditional blue and white pinafore dress to a more Gothic and macabre style that fits with the game's overall aesthetic. The attention to detail in the character design and outfit choices contributes to the overall immersive experience of the game.\n\nThe weapons in the game are also impressive, with a range of creative and imaginatively designed weapons to choose from. The Vorpal Blade, for example, is a weapon that Alice uses to slice through enemies, while the Pepper Grinder is a ranged weapon that shoots out pepper to stun enemies. The weapons are not only effective in combat but also fit well with the overall aesthetic of the game, contributing to the immersive experience.\n\nOverall, Alice: Madness Returns is a game that offers a unique blend of storytelling, game play mechanics, and visuals that create a cohesive and memorable experience for players. The game's attention to detail in character design, outfit choices, and weapon design contribute to the immersive experience, while the focus on dark themes and mental health challenges players to think deeply about the human experience.", "timestamp_created": 1680346516, "timestamp_updated": 1680346516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749152004718780518", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135853155": {"recommendationid": "135853155", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974945040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2826, "last_played": 1680323823}, "language": "english", "review": "Very poorly optimized port. Game has \"console-itis\" all over: the inclusion of arbitrary collectibles that have very little reward, weapon upgrades that have minimal impact, with an inverse curve making your starting weapon one of the last ones you'll actually want to upgrade (everything else is not only better but cheaper to upgrade). On top of that, a lot of the combat has this \"zelda twilight princess\" feel to it from how the camera focuses in, to how it functions in combat including how you can only use the block function during lock-on. Platforming itself it solid, for what little you get of it in bite-sized fragments. Devs felt the need to constantly break up the flow of gameplay by adding poorly controlling 2D side-scrolling segments, including a twisted form of mini-golf. Fortunately the game is so mind-numbingly easy even on the harder difficulty settings, that you can easily brute-force your way past any annoyances or obstacles. It's unfortunate that similar to these 2D sections, a lot of the 3D platforming is needlessly segmented and separated by constantly taking control away from the player to show off every single platform you've just activated. There's also this \"shrink\" mechanic that's required to see a lot of invisible platforms everywhere and access hidden tunnels. While neat on paper, this idea feels exhausting to manage constantly, as the effect of \"invis sight\" is extremely short-lived, meaning you need to constantly keep crouching over and over to keep the sight going for more than a half second. \nSome technical issues that also hold it back are how the targeting system rarely allows you to actually switch targets, including how you can't tell it which direction to pick - you just hit Tab and pray to the gods it picks the right target. Unlocking and re-locking is also a crapshoot. \nFinally for me, unlike the first game, there's no boss fights (until the very end) and there's tons of enemies that get re-used over and over and OVER AND OVER through all of the areas, which reduces some of the \"unique-ness\" of the zones (which is funny 'cuz w/out those \"ruin\" enemies there's still plenty of enemies available they could've used instead).\nIt's overall a giant wet-fart that was poorly ported. I'd say I'd give it an overall rating of 75/100. A solid \"C\" for: showcasing interesting ideas, but failing to execute those ideas in a strongly coherent manner, in a game style that requires technical coherence to succeed.", "timestamp_created": 1680324587, "timestamp_updated": 1680324587, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500625073909759521", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135837123": {"recommendationid": "135837123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344792731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1535, "last_played": 1680305944}, "language": "english", "review": "Freezes and kicks you out frequently :(", "timestamp_created": 1680305123, "timestamp_updated": 1680305123, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621945202350616455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135801422": {"recommendationid": "135801422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200519975", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1691632691}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good.", "timestamp_created": 1680269804, "timestamp_updated": 1680269804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135778970": {"recommendationid": "135778970", "author": {"steamid": "76561199225829797", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1689556579}, "language": "english", "review": "by far this is one of my favorite games, and alice was represented so well with the fact that if it was in real life she would be like that", "timestamp_created": 1680232118, "timestamp_updated": 1680232118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135775024": {"recommendationid": "135775024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124383615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1163, "last_played": 1679957415}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this is more than just a regular game, this is an experiment that allows you to fit into the shoes of a crazy girlfriend's boyfriend - at one moment she is all so sweet and cute and goes to hug you, and after a minute she sticks a screwdriver in your eye, because she doesn\u2019t like that you breathe loudly.

But these parts are lost among the long jumping and runing and fighting sections,(that don't end!!!)To get to a character that furthers the plot you have to go through like 5 long sections and then that character gives you 3 more areas to complete before anything happens.Even so, i would recommend it because it IS fun to play (i really like to fight the katana wasps with my 4 lv blade, it looks really cool), and the game controls and mechanics are nice. Just keep in mind that it is really long and tedious.(This is my first time interacting with this franchise, so i don't have anything to add about the story.

It's astonishing to bare witness to Alice's despairing/negative almost attitude but yet also an attitude where literally nothing seems to phase her. She's kind of like a Wednesday Addams in my opinion (kinda the same vibes). Not only do I take the time to get lost in the story but the atmosphere can be pretty amazing/cool to stop and look at too. What seemed kinda funny to me was from the very beginning you think \"Gee, Alice is such a sweet innocent little girl, why does she end up going through such hellish things?\" Well, if my memories were fractured/lost I would probably be going through my own crisis of hell too trying to piece everything back together also if I had to murder a few \"things\" along the way then yes I would you're damn right I would and I'd do it unforgivably too. On the other hand let's toss it up to saying Alice is just on some serious drugs and this \"Wonderland\" she keeps going to is just her tripping real hard on whatever drugs she is taking but what about the killing right? Yeah well drugs man, she could've been hallucinating so badly that murdering a little here or there was all just part of this sick/twisted plot I made up but it'd be one hell of a plot right?!\n\nAlice's reality is already twisted enough though even before you start thinking up stupid plots like I did. Alice is just struggling to fix what is broken what is crumbling. Again if I was in this sweet innocent girl's shoes I'd stop at nothing to take back/remember the more peaceful memories I treasured so if it means going a little mad then let it be so. All in all I'm just in completely in love and addicted to playing. Alice's character design/outfits/abilities or weapons as well are just really cool. I still think she's a good example of Wednesday Addams.\n\nAnyway 1000/10 a great game. I'd go absolutely mad with Alice any day or any time but that cat?

The movement and the fact that the entire game was created using a modified Quake 3 engine gave me conflicting feelings when I first started playing it. I thought the hitboxes would be a major issue, and they were, but not to the extent I had anticipated. The developers found a very simple fix for this: absolutely everything you kill now grants you both Sanity and Will (HP and Mana), ensuring that you never run out of either resource.\n\nPLATFORMING: The platforming is quite ok, nothing to write home about, but it did the job and at times it was even entertaining, if it weren't for the screaming enemies who would sometimes launch you into Narnia because of either FPS or even maybe intentional, pushing \u00a0Alice to her death\u00a0most of the time. One aspect of Alice's platforming\u00a0that I didn't enjoy was how light she seemed, and I thought her boots were occasionally smeared with grease, which prevented her from stopping right away.\n\nWORLD DESIGN: With level design that occasionally makes you feel like you're on LSD, to capturing being left in a mental asylum, to reasonably cheerful locations, to a true warzone, and so on and so forth, the developers were able to successfully transport you inside Alice's damaged mind.\nThe player is presented and told the levels' stories in a very effective manner. My favorite section was the chess levels, where there were several gimmicks to passing the levels, sort of like playing chess, but not really.\nThe horrible water level appeared just as I was ready to thank\u00a0Jesus that there is no water level in this game. It wasn't all that bad, but it could have been better.\nYou eventually arrive at what I would personally refer to as Hell after navigating vortexes, libraries, castles, and vulcanic regions during the course of the game. The Queen of Hearts levels were fantastic, and you felt pretty uncomfortable in the region because it was literally made of meat and bodies; the sound Alice was making as she stepped on grass, wood, or stone had been replaced by a mushy sound.\n\n\nCOMBAT is one area in which I eagerly anticipated starting Madness Returns in order to play a game with better combat, only to return dissapointed\u00a0to the original title.\nIn contrast to Madness Returns, melee fighting in this game is not recommended, and using all of your available weapons is usually the best course of action. You must throw your knife if you lack Will(Mana), but it has a reasonable share of CD.\nWith the ability to combine them into lethal combos, the 10 weapons you unlock as you advance through the game are immensely entertaining to use.\nThe fact that practically every weapon in the game has a different fire mode that performs something else is something I really liked.\n\nENEMIES, GORE, BOSSES: I was shocked that all three of these aspects of the second game were subpar. This game features a wide array of enemies, including Pawns, Grasshoppers, Ladybugs, Mushrooms, and Demons in addition to the standard Card Guards.\nI wasn't expecting to be able to cut Card Guards in half in addition to seeing their heads decapitated and running around like chickens with blood pouring from their necks. [spoiler] The decapitation of the Cheshire cat was also very unexpected and made me feel bad for him, but in the end, everybody that dies comes back, as we see at the end and in the next game.\u00a0[/spoiler]\nIn this game, there are 7 bosses, and each of them plays very differently from the others, encouraging you to use all of your weapons and identify their weaknesses in order to defeat them more quickly and easily. Some of the bosses are immune to damage and must be defeated by shooting them in vulnerable areas, so you must be somewhat strategic. The final battle with the Jabberwock was the most frustrating because for some reason\u2014again, possibly connected to FPS or I dunno, would start spamming the flame attack, killing Alice right away.\nI have yet in this lifetime to play another game where you kill somebody by making them sneeze so hard their head explodes so that was a huge plus from me.\n\n\nTHE SOUNDTRACK: Far superior to Madness Returns, I remember almost all of the OST, being very different based on the area you are in, some of it really capturing the feeling of mental ilness and Alice going mad.[spoiler] For instance in the battle with the Dutchess you can hear a woman screaming [/spoiler]. In contrast I can't remember anything from Madness Returns exept the combat music as it felt super generic and repetitive and that was a major dissapointment.\n\nMADNESS RETURNS:\n\nPLATFORMING: The ability to triple jump, dash, glide, and generally have greater control over Alice made it significantly superior to the first game. There was also no longer any grease on her boots. Yet in my opinion, the more unique platforming ideas were dropped in favor of simpler, safer areas. But, the game now has secret locations that you can reach using new gameplay mechanisms that are exciting and enjoyable to use.\nThis was a significant extra addition that I appreciated, giving the platforming more incentive to experiment where you can go while trying your triple jump and dash range. The game introduced collectibles, which for me were like a drug and I had to find them all. These collectibles were intriguing not just for their own sake but also because each one contained a tiny piece of information\u00a0or dialogue that added to our understanding of Alice and the perspectives that others have of her.\n\nWORLD DESIGN: Regarding world design, I genuinely feel conflicted. If American Mcgee or the crew is reading this, please know that you have my utmost respect for creating an underwater level\u2014not really\u00a0underwater, but I'll count it\u2014that I actually loved playing and might even consider one of the game's best locations.\nNow, as I've already mentioned, some regions I love and others I detest to the point of being boring and dull. My expectations for the remainder of the game were raised by the initial area where the transformation takes place. The Japanese area, also known as \"The Oriental Grove,\" was the area that I disliked the most and wished it had ended sooner. But like\u00a0 Jesus himself Chapter 4 and the Queensland came and my interest and desire\u00a0to continue playing after that awful zone came back.\u00a0\n\nCOMBAT: Darksouls, I will skip this part because I want to talk about the bosses and the steam review has a limit. All I will say is that the combat is generic and we only have 4 weapons this time, not that many combinations this time. :(\n\nBOSSES: Again. What the hell happened here????I have never in my life felt so cockblocked by a game. Just when you are about to fight a \"Boss\" they die or you don't fight them at all........why???The rabbit and the mouse that escaped their prison in the first game now own Hatter's factory and get crushed by him in one second....huh?The other boss from the Underwater level, whose name I can't remember or what his plot was (again showing how underwhelming this section of the game is), gets killed just when you were ready to fight him.The one that literally made me laugh was the Executioner. I was happy that we could literally hit him and fight him, but he is invincible, and you have to run from him.[spoiler]Then Alice finds a cake that says \"Eat me\", literally eats a piece, grows 5x the size of my homie, and with a smug face, crushes him under her boot........ =)))))))))) ) [/spoiler]Also, all the bosses that you had to fight in the first game are now .... your friends and help you???? Like, homie, you killed them before, why did they just agree to help you? It's not like they don't remember. They all remember what you did to them.The final boss was fun, sure, but this game has only 1 BOSS, the first game had 7\nWould I still recommend the 2nd game? Yes it's good, but the first one is better.

more than a basic knife throwing bitch and adding 2% more brain function which by result makes you actually think of what is the best weapon use for different situations, this game unlike MR also has actual boss fights, all pretty good for the exeption of the first and last one.\n\nMadness returns offers more unlockables through optional routes, environment design and a deeper focus on the story, while the original alice game's combat had more variety this one is a bit dumbed down, you have less weapons and for the most part the most challenging moments are the ones where you get ganged on, but this might just be an intentional allegory to the game's plot, platforming is pretty good but sometimes the camera randomly decides to fuck your day up, dk what that's about, the game can also get

They supported the game for a few years, made their money back, and abandoned it.\nBugs and server issues that have plagued the game from day 1, remain and will remain.\n\n\nHackers and cheaters are rampant, and the report feature may as well be called the \"do nothing\" button, because that is exactly what it does.\n\nAnd if you dare go to the help desk for support, you get cookie cutter canned answers telling you to troubleshoot your PC, your internet and get over it.\nThe forums? Worse. I made multiple threads over the years. Never received a S I N G L E response from ANY of the \"community managers\".\nSo I started @ them (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you @EA_Barry) in my newest threads. At first I'd get 4 or 5 posts in a week before they soft gagged the board and required threads to have more than 3 posts from the same poster in a row, before allowing further comments.\n\nSo I started making a new thread every week on the 3rd comment, and @ several of them.\nThis got their attention quick, I was banned for \"spam\", but the issue was ignored.\n\nSo I continued asking for help or even a response until they finally permanently banned me, without EVER answering a single of my threads.\n\nThis is EA. This is what it means to be \"in the game\" with these bastards, and this is beyond a shadow of a doubt, the future this \"game\" faces.\n\nEA, if you want me to play your garbage shovelware, you have to PAY me to do it.

The official art book for the game delves into a lot of the cut content. It sounds like what happened is EA pulled a classic EA move and simply demanded the game be done ahead of schedule, resulting in the developers having to hurriedly slam together the pieces they already had finished. \n\nThat having all been said I love this game - it's in my top 20 of all time. It's so imaginative and dark and creepy and unique but in a way that doesn't rely on gore or language (though the game has plenty of gore if that's what you're after). The game itself is a linear third person action game with platforming and combat being the main aspects, with a dash of some puzzle solving. Today in 2023 it's an basically dead style of game, they hardly make these anymore. Everything here works and works well - combat is fast and brutal and has just enough variety to stay fresh, the platforming is tight and fun and Alice controls lovely, and the puzzles are quick and snappy and just enough satisfying without being annoying. \n\nThe real star here is the music, the environments, etc. This game is an absolute mood, man. The level at the bottom of the ocean and the queens castle in particular are just absolute dreamscapes, or perhaps nightmarescapes, but they are just so lovely and memorable. For the era this game had some really slick graphics, especially Alice's hair which behaves exactly as you would expect it to. The music is absolutely awesome - creepy drawn out notes and bellows that underscore the environment, and one of the best combat themes in a game ever (seriously it's amazing, an adrenaline injection for every battle, and it has a few epic mixup variations sometimes too).\n\nThe game isn't perfect however, far from it. The last few levels, especially the final one, really just go on way too long and seem to be artificially extending their size in cheap ways to pad the game length - this being a result of the development not being truly finished. While the combat has good variety, over the length of the game (and it's a decently lengthy game for its type) it can start to wear a tad thin by the end. The developers highlight a few weapons, enemies, and moves that were forcibly left on the cutting room floor in the art book; the game was also intended to just have more in general, more areas, bosses, puzzle elements, etc. For being a cobbled together game though they really did a good job and it shows, but it's too bad to see that corporate shenanigans stood in the way of a finished product that would have been even better than this already great game.\n\nThe story is good but also vague and heavy on the allegory and metaphors, which I suppose you would expect nothing less from the mind-travels of an adult Alice. Nothing here will shock you or blow your mind, but it's a good story that services the game well. \n\nIf the game looks visually interesting to you, buy it, you'll love it regardless of whether the gameplay appeals to you. If however this particular visual style doesn't appeal to you, it comes down to whether games of this type and era appealed to you back in their time. If you like third person action combat platformers this is a super solid one. If you didn't really enjoy this type of game back then though this game doesn't do anything so exceptionally above and beyond gameplay wise that it'll change your mind. Me? I've beaten it three times, once on PS3 and twice on PC.

And how unexpected some of the Plots are.\nFighting foes, solving Puzzles and uncovering the Truth that is hidden behind a dark Web woven by Traumata during her childhood, Players have to help Alice to finish her journey.\n\nAnd how simple as it is, the more enjoyable it can get, with its easy to learn controls and a simple Combat-System to fight a lot of Enemies and even some Bosses. Also the Levels have a nice touch to the Environmental Themes and Alice\u2019s Clothes change with it.\nThere are also many interesting Characters inside the Game, some old ones and some new ones Alice is able to talk to and hear their Story of what has happened to them while she was gone and also what has happened to herself in that Time since her last Adventure in the Wonderland.\n\nThe Game\u2019s strength is definitely is definitely its Atmosphere and the Art style it uses to establish the Themes of the different Locations the Player has to go through and all the Puzzles and Quests to solve to unlock the Gates to the next Locations.\nAlso the Combat is nicely implemented in this Game and not to difficult to handle, allows to getting immersed in this fantastic and weirdly freaky looking World and to fall into *Madness* alongside Alice herself.\n\nBut there are also some weak points to mention for this Game. The Graphics in the Texture and 3D-Model departement lack a lot of Details and Quality and could need a little bit of overhaul to support the Artistic Style much better.\n\nI recommend this Game to Players who like simple 3D Plattformer sprinkled with simple action Combat and also for those who want to see Alice\u2019s real View of the Wonderland.\n---------------------------------\n[h3]Points i give this Game (average Points 7,41 / 10):[/h3]\n5,2 / 10 Graphic (Old graphhic, would need a little bit improvement)\n8 / 10 Art-Style (Well designed World-Build that really support the Themes of the Locations)\n9,2 / 10 Atmosphere (Perfect Atmosphere of Madness and depression the Hero-Character has to feel and so the Player too)\n6,8 / 10 Gameplay (Easy to learn Gameplay. Plattformer, Puzzles and Combat with Bossfights too)\n9,5 / 10 Story (The Story really had some surprising and disturbing Plots. Would like to see the Prequel coming to Steam and a Sequel to continue the Story)\n7 / 10 Characters (Lots of Characters known from different Versions of Alice in Wonderland Stories and some new ones too. Nice interactions with them, would have liked to see more of them.)\n6,2 / 10 Soundtrack (Soundtracks fit the Environment.

The game had totally blown my mind. Now, with much more gaming experience and having completed the first game (American McGee\u2019s Alice) I couldn\u2019t really say the same.\n\nThe main selling points of the game are undeniably the visuals, music and the atmosphere. \n\nThe scenery of Wonderland are just stunning. Every location has its own unique theme. Even the looks of protagonist, Alice, get different styles, depending on the location she is in. The music adds to the atmosphere of insanity and bizarre (not the level of the first game, cudos to Chris Vrenna, but still). The character design is also very good. Newly added episodes in the real world leave a really bitter taste in your mouth by portraying everything in a very special way \u2013 ugly, dirty and unpleasant. Which correlate greatly with colorful imaginable wonderland.\n\nMy main problem with the game is combat system. No combos whatsoever. The weapon upgrade system is very plain. Only 2 ranged weapons and 2 melee weapons, one of which is mostly technical \u2013 for breaking hidden walls and pushing through enemy\u2019s blocks. Yeah, first game didn\u2019t have combos or anything, but there were much more weapons to choose from (around 9 to 10 or so), even with alternative fire modes! Also, some of the enemies require waiting for them to be damageable, which hurts greatly the flow of combat. \n\nThe collectibles that only adds to the story. Well, the story stuff is great and all, but why not to add a little bonus to exp or smth like that? It would greatly support the motivation for exploration. There is really no point in exploring to be honest. Most of the currency required for upgrading weapons are not hidden or drop from enemies. \n\nThe level design is too straightforward. Platforming sections are very plain and doen\u2019t bring any joy to complete. Most of the NPC interactions share the same paradigm of having one temporary hub and 3 paths with some item to bring back to that character.\n\nWhile the design of the enemies is great, I\u2019d really love to have more variations of them. And more bosses! Previous game had plenty, why wouldn\u2019t you bring more of them in this one?\n\nThe game has many other minor issues like occasional bugs and crashes, mechanics that are not properly introduced and explained and so on.\n\nI cannot really recommend the game, sadly. If you\u2019re a huge fan of American MCgee\u2019s work and his interpretation of Alice in wonderland, you can check the game out for the story and visuals at least. Other than that, I would recommend to skip on this one, as I did on my second walkthrough and dropped the game for good.", "timestamp_created": 1675750189, "timestamp_updated": 1675750189, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132343169": {"recommendationid": "132343169", "author": {"steamid": "76561199258568414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1694468705}, "language": "spanish", "review": "el juego no funciona", "timestamp_created": 1675725750, "timestamp_updated": 1675725750, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132336177": {"recommendationid": "132336177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067053320", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1675714816}, "language": "english", "review": "The umbrella keybind simply doens't work unless you edit config files.

Luego lo llaman de otro modo.[/quote]\n\nAlice: Madness Returns es un juego de plataformas, con algo de combate, en el que se cuenta una atractiva historia de fantas\u00eda oscura, basada en los personajes de los libros de Carroll, pero con un tinte mucho m\u00e1s t\u00e9trico y adulto.\n\nJugablemente es, como dec\u00eda, esencialmente un t\u00edtulo de plataformas (con un dise\u00f1o de niveles realmente bueno), con un poco de [i]Hack and slash[/i] (parte terriblemente penalizada por los dolores de cabeza que da la c\u00e1mara cuando fijamos un objetivo).\n\nDonde destaca m\u00e1s es, sin ning\u00fan g\u00e9nero de dudas, en la ambientaci\u00f3n. A pesar de que los gr\u00e1ficos no son punteros (el juego tiene m\u00e1s de once a\u00f1os en el momento en que hago esta rese\u00f1a), la forma de recrear el surreal y maravilloso [i]Pa\u00eds de las Maravillas[/i] es simple y llanamente excelente. El buen doblaje al castellano tambi\u00e9n ayuda a crear esa magn\u00edfica atm\u00f3sfera.\n\nEn resumen, se trata de un t\u00edtulo que, en lo jugable, tiene el sabor a\u00f1ejo de los buenos juegos de plataformas de hace unos a\u00f1os, y que, solo por lo espectacular de su ambientaci\u00f3n, merece mucho la pena. Dura unas 12-15 horas, y suele estar rebajado a menudo.\n\n(*) Jugado en Steam Deck de principio a fin, a 60 FPS estables y sin ning\u00fan cuelgue. Solo se necesita un peque\u00f1o retoque para que los FPS sean constantes (setear PhysX en bajo).\n\n\u272a\u272f\u272a\u272f\u272a\u272f\u272a [h3]7.9 / 10[/h3] \u272a\u272f\u272a\u272f\u272a\u272f\u272a\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2922488228\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927344182\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2919673893", "timestamp_created": 1675357737, "timestamp_updated": 1675357737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673385143280029297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132068240": {"recommendationid": "132068240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052557285", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1107, "last_played": 1675351190}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game a lot with it's fun game play of hack-and-slash and the graphics looks amazing.

Porting games this old isn't exactly easy.\n\nThis game I highly HIGHLY recommend. American Mcgee's Alice is by far my favorite version of this story after playing it. The art direction and designs of this game are beautiful and amazing to look at. It can be so pretty, yet so terrifying and dreadful at the same time. I absolutely adore it.\n\nThe gameplay, in my opinion, never gets boring. This game knows how to keep you on your toes and always has something for you to explore, especially if you're going for 100% completion. The enemies are great, though some are quite challenging as well.\n\nThe story, though gruesome and genuinely frightening, I love it to pieces. The way Alice goes through her memories and mind to find out the truth of what happened to her family is amazing, and when you finally realize who the villain is, it's gut-wrenching to see and hear how truly despicable they are. I had points in my playthrough where I was in shock at how cruel they were and how they were not remorseful in the slightest for their actions. \n\nOverall, I love this game to death. The design, the story, the soundtrack, the gameplay, in my opinion, it is all spot on. 10/10\n\nAnd I seriously can't wait for American Mcgee's next entry in the Alice series. <3", "timestamp_created": 1674922337, "timestamp_updated": 1674922337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131732709": {"recommendationid": "131732709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158387738", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1676741653}, "language": "english", "review": "If it weren't for the bugs this game would be a 10/10 :)", "timestamp_created": 1674919802, "timestamp_updated": 1674919802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131699497": {"recommendationid": "131699497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346429202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1677303036}, "language": "english", "review": "asdf", "timestamp_created": 1674881708, "timestamp_updated": 1674881708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131696955": {"recommendationid": "131696955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871285566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1674933226}, "language": "english", "review": "-Really fun single player platformer... i am loving the way it looks, it is a beautiful game... the hair animation is really good for it being a game made over 10 or so years ago! some AAA games from 2020-2023 still cant seem to get the hair just right lol ;p", "timestamp_created": 1674878137, "timestamp_updated": 1674878137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131687820": {"recommendationid": "131687820", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005650437", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1687245343}, "language": "english", "review": "I know that I don't have a lot of playtime yet on steam with this game but I have played it on console to an extent and so far the gameplay seems to hold up pretty well on pc. \nAlice Madness Returns holds a special place in my heart as I am a big Alice In Wonderland Fan and this vibe really captures my attention.

It got released in 2011, when you didnt know ;). Also the Audio quality is great and you have a lot of different languages to choose. \n\nTo come to a conclusion, i would say that this game is pretty awesome and a pretty disturbing experience. So it is great for horror fans. The horror is created by the atmosphere and also kinda by the (character) design.

It's incredibly tiresome.  It's only playable because the progress and success is as equally buggy as the challanges, I feel. I guess there's a chance it's buggier for some more than others?\n\nI have to open the game twice everytime because it always crashes the first time. I have to play with both controller and keyboard because the keyboard got too confusing and non-intuitive, and so as I've switched to controller, some buttons aren't working (such as calling Chesire and going into Hysteria I have to do on keyboard, as well as upgrading weapons with mouse) and it makes the game feel unrelieble, along with everything else that's wrong.   It crashes in the middle of gameplay from time to time, and it's always a guessing game where it got saved last.\n\nEnemies keep bugging out and not dying, sometimes even go entirely invisible, which means I can't progress unless I replay a huge fight.   Dodging and evading is impossible half of the time because body-blocking is apparently the enemies strongest point. Also, Alice apparently forgets her left-and-right from her front-to-back along with her increasing madness, nomatter wether I'm in aim-mode or not.\nShe also gets stuck in absolute thin air, a lot. As in- anywhere at anytime. Invisible pixels, in or out of fight. Not as in lagging- just suddenly stuck spinning or staring. Usually in corners, door-openings, or uneven but seemingly plain ground.\n\nThings that should NOT happen automatically does, and vice versa, making me feel like I'm not in control of playing/fighting at all. I'm not sure how much of these particular happenings are bugs, or if they're bad control combinations, but something is imbalanced to say the least.\n\nI'm also questioning a huge amount of the content within the game. It feels like most of it was thrown in as an after-thought. Like the flower-painting thing for example? I'll never believe it was suppose to be like that. After 16 hours, I'm also pretty sure the game was suppose to be a lot shorter, but then they extended it and threw in a bunch of lesser well rendered areas. The script in itself is the best part, so I don't mind it being as long as they could make it, but I'm wondering why things feel rushed. \n\nConclusion: I don't think they actually finished this game.\n \nHowever, just because I love Alice in Wonderland, and because I'm stubborn, and also because I love most of the visual design in this version, I'll try to finish it.   I don't know if it's a Steam-thing or an old-game-thing but this is horrid on my nerves. \nIf you want this game badly- see if you can find it another way first at least, In case it is a Steam-thing.\n\nIf they reworked and remastered this game, I would love to play.  But this thing? Never playing again after this, unless I get paid damn well to do it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1674417332, "timestamp_updated": 1674429276, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1,

I found every level had you spend the perfect amount of time on it, and when the next one came along, it was refreshing. The setting of this game goes from frozen caves, to rivers and forests, to lava castles and more.\n\nWhat is more is that the soundtracks that accompany these locations are phenomenal and fit the game perfectly \u2014 the tracks are creepy, but at the same time wondrous, with great touches like old grandfather clocks ticking sounds marking the rhythm. I really, really enjoyed the music in this game and much of its magic comes from it.\n\nThe gameplay itself was also more complex than I imagined it would be. \ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude48\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude42\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a'\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5a is mainly a platformer, but it also includes combat elements \u2014 you will find an array of weapons at your disposal, which you can discover throughout your adventure in Wonderland, as well as various types of enemies: from card guards and antlions to fire imps and fish. I have to admit the combat can be a bit messy and unrefined, and the platforming can be slightly annoying at times, but I only had a handful of these moments, and using quick save and quick load you will barely have any issues.\n\nThe horror theme of exploring Alice's broken mind through this imaginary world she has created is simply breathtaking.\n\nIn conclusion, I found the length of this game to be perfect. It was extremely enjoyable to play, the soundtrack is top notch and the gameplay holds up okay 22 years later. This is a gem of a game that deserves more recognition, with a fantastic art style and design.\n\n\n[h1] [i] \"Into the hole again, we hurried along our way, into a once-glorious garden now steeped in dark decay.\"\n                   - Alice [/i] [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1674245009, "timestamp_updated": 1674245136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131182927": {"recommendationid": "131182927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233410632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1679263070}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Arreglen el paraguas mamahuevos!\n", "timestamp_created": 1674185027, "timestamp_updated": 1674185027, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734813332557678223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131175528": {"recommendationid": "131175528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150583804", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1675039489}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is extremely fun.

As games, they're not too good. Finished both titles since from what I understand this port and the EA Origin release are the only official ways to play the original Alice. As stated, the artwork for both super interesting and I love how the soundtracks are more or less horrifying soundscapes, rather than being actual soundtracks. The atmosphere is really well done in both titles, but the gameplay isn't fun in either of them. The original Alice is a sorta fun boomer shooter / puzzle platformer that while sort of enjoyable, aged like milk (minus the art direction, that shines even today). Alice: Madness Returns is a really, REALLY boring hack and slash with repetitive gameplay and almost no depth when it comes to the combat or anything regarding gameplay. Both of these titles are cult classics for a reason, I suppose. If you're one of those super artsy scenecore hipster nerds then sure, you'll probably love this stuff. If you come into these titles expecting something fun, rather than just really cool art pieces (like me), you're gonna think this is really underwhelming. Writing this makes me feel really conflicted since I think everything surrounding these games is super interesting, but they're just not that much fun. If you can ignore the boring gameplay and throw out 30 or so hours of your time without feeling like your time was wasted, go ahead and play these.

Alice: Madness Returns is a good game, the story is interesting and the graphics and music are good. This, however, is a bad port. I played this game originally on the PS3 along with the original American McGee's Alice. Got the DLC, played all the way through and even started a second playthrough. It was fun, and when I saw that it was available again on Steam (having been taken down once) I figured, why not?\n\nIt is ... pretty annoying to play this on PC. Even after following some guides to tweak settings to be more optimal or take advantage of more modern hardware, things just get weird. If you don't have things set just right, you will [i]consistently[/i] crash at varying places. For instance, lets say you want to remove the 30(ish) fps cap and go up to 60: Well, most guides tell you to add a few extra to whatever setting you're going to use. Thing is, it needs to be only one or two extra. Setting it to 65 like I did caused my game to consistently crash while dealing with a specific section. Likewise, you need to drop your PhysX settings for one specific spot in the game and just that one spot. There are gamebreaking bugs still present if you do certain things in the wrong order. The most egregious issue for me is that you can't run if the camera isn't following you. If the camera isn't positioned juust right Alice will stutter-step and generally move weird which is annoying if not lethal. And the camera controls are a bit wonky, but that may just be my controller settings.\n\nWhy did I mark this a recommended? Well, like I said: Its a fun game. Maybe it will run ok-ish if you don't tweak things. Or, maybe you should just copy the tweak guides exactly and not try to fudge things a bit like I did. The game really is fun, and snarky Alice is fun. The combat is action oriented as opposed to the shooter system from the first game. You can move, dodge and eventually block. You will eventually get two melee weapons and two ranged weapons, and a clockwork rabbit bomb that doubles as distraction and exploration tool. The combat is serviceable: It's fluid and relatively fair. Camera issues occur, but it's hard to say if it's just user issues or narrow areas throwing the camera for a loop. \n\nExploration is a pleasure marred only by the movement issue I mentioned earlier. The game is beautiful and surreal. The music is a pleasure to listen to and matches well with each area. There are plenty of nods to the previous game (and it's quite easy to add it into this game, that's actually where most of my playtime is from) but there's some explanation of things in the game. You could look up what happened or read a synopsis (there's a bit of exposition available in the Extra Content section of the main menu as well), but it doesn't really affect things too much if you haven't played the original. I found it to be a pretty satisfying game and story, and having figured out most of the ... quirks of this port I'm pretty satisfied.\n\nAs a warning for completionists, you'll want to really take your time or use a guide. There's plenty of things hidden in the world that are easily overlooked. Shrink sense can be used liberally to find lots of things, but I still kept missing a few things here and there.

First most of the weapons share the same mana pool for ammo forcing you to resort to your slow knife attacks in long fights. \nSecond the majority of the attacks in this game push Alice back after she it hit which is fine if your on the ground, but if you at all in the air you will be sent flying usually into the nearest bottomless pit or pool of lava.\nWhile I didn't hate my time I wouldn't make this a selling point.\n\nAlice: Madness Returns\nStory wise its fine, better then the first game's plot, but nothing I would sell this game on. Level design is still great, good variety in environments. I do wish levels were a little bit shorter and instead have one or two more stages. Combat is more enjoyable then the first games single ammo bar physics mess, but it is really hurt by the lock on camera moving to terrible angles and Alice's dodging based on how she is facing the locked on enemy and not in relation to the camera itself.\n\nFor both of these games I was really expecting more, they are not bad I just feel they fall short of what I feel this series could be.

The platforming was great but was very long. As someone who likes to collect everything when they play these kind's of game's, I felt like it took way to long to do that and they really just stuffed a bunch of collectibles in this game to stretch it out. Game probably could have been shorter since it was beginning to feel repetitive half way through. The combat is nice but that camera is awful. I love the voice acting in this game, its so nice hearing everyone's voices, the dialog is great even though It kinda confused me sometimes. I was surprised to see an Easter Egg to my favorite game ever Psychonauts while playing, very cool. Something I really hate though is there's no achievements for this game on steam, there is on Xbox but not on here, very disappointing would have had way more fun collecting though's. This game was just great though, I wish there was a sequel to this game.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.\nEventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared.

She wears many different dresses during the story, each with different skirt and underwear. Some is even comes with see-through camel toe.

Controls suck like there's no tomorrow. You're never in control, Alice's always moving on some invisible rails and it some times does not matter what direction you're pressing.

Alice: Madness Returns is unexpectedly one of the best video-games out there. Not only is the gameplay and level design amazing and there is well over 25 hours of 3D platforming in visually stunning and high-effort creative worlds with mind-blowing music: the story and characters are also extremely present, strong, heart-breaking and immersive.\n\nObviously the movie Alice In Wonderland is one of the best movies that exists, but this game is TEN TIMES darker. Wonderland is about the darkness, flaws and evil that rooms in the industrialized city life, how absolute evil disguised as pathetic humans scour in every corner and dark back alley. How nothing is safe for an innocent and pure young girl without parents; how everyone is trying to take advantage of you either sexually or financially.\n\nThe mind of Alice is the mind of a traumatized and severely abused and manipulated orphan girl. \nYes , Alice: Madness Returns is dark, your teenage sister was raped and later locked and burnt to death in the room next to you. You thought she was talking in her sleep that night, but no she was getting raped that night before the criminal would start a fire to burn off your whole family. Your entire family has been burnt alive, you were able to escape the home just in time before it burnt down and from a distance you saw the skin melting off your beloved family as they couldn't escape. \n\nAfter all this tragedy, at first Alice can't rest because to her it makes no sense how the home could have caught fire. The therapist assigned to Alice suspects Alice herself to have killed her parents and for that reason she has been put into a mental asylum and labelled as a dangerous psychotic woman. After the family tragedy Alice wastes years of her most valuable years scared, lost, locked, lied to and manipulated without family or friends in an asylum for minors. \n\nThe only \"friends\" Alice has had after her loss have been evil and bitter two-faced people who abuse her and lie to her. Later in the plot you find out that your therapist was involved with burning your home and family down, in fact he was the one who raped your sister and burnt it down. His plans for you was to make you forget everything by becoming your therapist after the crime he committed and to gaslight teenage Alice during therapy sessions for years, to make Alice kill herself and memories with therapy sessions so nothing but a gas-lit soulless poor girl remains to be sold to the city's brothel for a lot of money (self-admitted therapist's plan). \n\nAll of this is told in a mysterious, dark, scary, emotional yet beautiful way. Alice : Madness Returns is a legendary game and despite its older age it has aged super well. This game is a master piece.\n\n\"You've used and abused me, but you will NOT destroy me!\"\n\"Save myself from death, is that it? Is that why I've come here? I'm not afraid to die! Times I've welcomed death.\"\n\"I want to forget! Who would choose to be alone, imprisoned by their own broken memories?\"\n\"I know their pain. I would assist. But is sanity required for the job?\"\n~ Alice Liddell\n\n\"Threats, promises and good intentions don't amount to action.\"\n\"Ah, Alice. We can't go home again. No surprise, really. Only a very few find the way, and most of them don't recognize it when they do. Delusions, too, die hard with memory. Only the savage regard the endurance of pain as the measure of worth. Forgetting pain is convenient, remembering it: agonizing. But recovering the truth is worth the suffering.

Sometimes you don't know if you reached a platform by mistake or not. I've died many times to the character jumping in the air instead of the platform. The level design is basic and it never really feel like you are smoothly traversing the arena. You always have those bad level design camera to show you where to go as the visual are messy. The animations are basic as well and they are quite ugly during cut scenes.\nCombat is just messy and the best way to handle it most times is to cheese the hell out of it. The camera does not help and the locking system does not allow you to handle multiple foes, and they clearly want you to. The attacks from enemies are not always easy to avoid because the dodge mechanics has a weird way to receive input; many times I dodged an attack but the character stayed in the same place instead of going back or on the side. And combat movement is separate from the platforming and you can clearly see how the dodge ability breaks or is inconsistent with traversal.\nHit boxes are a joke for both enemies and platforms. It's so annoying to be able to fight to just been denied because you are 2 degrees too on the left to hit it.\nThe story is basic and does not necessarily lead you to think for yourself but just wait for the next information that adds nothing to it. And man, so much useless information is provided.\nThe devs added hours upon hours of the same platforming and puzzles making the experience tedious instead of interesting. If you extrapolate everything that is fine from the game, it would be 1-2 hours long instead of ~12.\nI haven't played the original game so I might have missed a lot of references but I don't that could save a mediocre game.\nBut the worst thing of all is that this game is also quite unstable, crashing randomly and running like crap.\nIt's locked at 30 fps and feels sluggish, GREAT FOR A PLATFORMER. I also lost 10 mins of progress in 2 occasions because of crashes.\nSo the point here is, don't buy it.

Sometimes it even begins with loading the game or getting into it, the game crashes or freezes way too much, every time opening the game is a gamble in itself! Then somehow the game lags a lot, it is as if there is an input lag or something like that. Furthermore sometimes after using the pepper gun you cannot switch back to your melee weapon, your knife!! It is suddenly gone! The button used to use your melee weapon is suddenly the ranged one too! And let's not even begin with talking about the umbrella, I can't even get past that part of the game since you are forced to use it but Alice does NOT use the umbrella no matter what! I tried out with changing the button, reset it again, looked through the menu and everything but nope! Umbrella can't be used!

With that, my main problem with the game is that most of the levels felt really, really long, and I eventually grew tired of them.\n\nA minor detail was the occasional crash from alt-tabbing, but fortunately no other crashes or bugs were present through my playthrough.\n\nOther concerns would be the fact that you have to tweak some game files in order to get additional content (which DLC weapons no longer work) and boost the game's performance.\n\nUltimately, \"Alice: Madness Returns\" was an enjoyable game with a very intriguing storyline and unique style, a game that can be easily picked up by anyone and enjoyed just for the quality of visual stimulation one can find within its hellish representation of Wonderland.", "timestamp_created": 1670645306, "timestamp_updated": 1670645306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128249625": {"recommendationid": "128249625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803468949", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 528, "last_played": 1670855494}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like creepy and victorian/steampunk kind of stuff you will def like this. a lot of content to explore :D", "timestamp_created": 1670622034, "timestamp_updated": 1670622034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128248595": {"recommendationid": "128248595", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086498146", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1675289331}, "language": "english", "review": "its really good but the pc port is kinda shit its locked at 30fps without useing mods and it crashes sometimes but if you can then get it, its really fun.", "timestamp_created": 1670620794, "timestamp_updated": 1670620794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128223075": {"recommendationid": "128223075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125922656", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1663955934}, "language": "english", "review": "I know there's a way to get the dlc illegally without using steam to do it, but it would be nice if it was on here.

Reminds me of when fairy tales weren't all cute and cheerful, but actually had some darkness to them. Level environments are good too, they go from looking all colorful to looking like Satan's backyard. Gameplay is pretty good albeit towards the middle-end of the game it can feel quite tedious, levels do eventually feel the same in regards to how navigating levels work, combat while being good again does get tedious as the same enemies are thrown around alongside maybe 1 or 2 new enemy in a level, and some levels feel waay too long as if they're dragging them out. Overall the game is really good, I would just recommend also playing this alongside other titles so you can take a breather.\n\nI really would recommend Alice Madness Returns, but just not the PC version if you're the type of person who isn't comfortable/willing to configure multiple ini files. The game does not contain it's dlc out of the box, American McGee's Alice is missing albeit having an option in the menus, game does not run at a comfortable framerate out of the box (unless you're fine with 20-30 fps), you might even encounter a bug where your umbrella doesn't work, and also half the tutorial prompts don't show gamepad ui albeit the other half will making controls confusing for a minute or two in certain areas. If you are comfortable with configuring these then I'd say give the game a shot while it's on sale, it really is good albeit feeling a little tedious. Works great under Linux so anyone using a Steam Deck should be able to play this fine.

Overall I absolutely recommend to anyone who likes 3D platformers. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1669949560, "timestamp_updated": 1669949560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127731531": {"recommendationid": "127731531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400878069", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1669929678}, "language": "spanish", "review": "MUY WENO", "timestamp_created": 1669949407, "timestamp_updated": 1669949407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127707359": {"recommendationid": "127707359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315687173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 593, "last_played": 1669856969}, "language": "english", "review": "boring, whole game feels like a chore", "timestamp_created": 1669916254, "timestamp_updated": 1669916254, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413793116807937622", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127676144": {"recommendationid": "127676144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251196836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1669873462}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice creepy vibes but boring gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1669874088, "timestamp_updated": 1669874088, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470760107040405273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127657189": {"recommendationid": "127657189", "author": {"steamid": "76561199008182140", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1668679896}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games of all time, though I played it on Xbox 360 for years.

Challenging and fun at the harder difficulties.  Mildly repetitive but the story moves it along fabulously.  If you like this style of combat i would recommend lost in random.  You can tell some of the art directors and game play creators are of this kin.\n\nGraphics - I played on 1440p monitor.  Still looks slightly aged but would recommend higher res for sure.  The eerie setting and visuals are stunning and engaging.  Very creative beautiful and sadistically Gothic in a cool way.\n\nMusical Score - Adequate to keep you engaged as you journey through the dark abyss of madness.\n\nVerdict - 9.5 out of 10 What a story!

Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\u201d - Martin Luther King, Jr. \"Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.\" - Martin Luther King, Jr.\nALICE\n IS \nHOT\nTLDR: Game is beautiful, story is intresting and atmospheric, but gameplay streches too long and some parts will be boring and monotone - game is often on sale, a -75% usual one is GREAT to pick the game up. Don't bother with full price, I don't think it's worth it.\nAccording to Steam I've played this for the whopping amount of 36.9 hours - ingame timer says 16 hours, 91% completion.\nAbout this game: picked up a copy for a friend to return a friendly gesture and at the same time I bought it for myself, because I was really intrested in it (Alice + implementation of madness? Yes please, I'm in!)\nThe game starts out wonderful. You'll keep making screenshots - the game world is really nicely designed and well-executed, some landscapes are jaw-dropping both in terms of quality and creativity.\nPlatforming works great, there are no issues with controls - but after a time it can be boring, because most chapters (5 looong chapters, all in 1-2 different settings than the others) use quite the same mechanics/ideas as precious ones, only re-skinned.\nCombat is both lacking and feels rewarding. Why? Personally I really miss combos and airbone attacks. Maybe I'm too new for the third-person platformers, but I think while combat plays a really central part in the gameplay, it could have been much better. And why is it still great? You have 4 weapons - basically a light and heavy variant of melee and ranged. As most things, the weapons look astonishingly good, with real nice sound - and visual effects. But the biggest and best thing of combat system is the really different enemies. They all work in their own way - one is easy to take on with the pepper-grinder (machine gun), the other one's weakness is the heavy Hobby Horse's armor-breaking hits. Each enemy, and especially their mixed groups require different tactics to defeat them. It's a little shame that by the time you finish a chapter, most likely you'll be bored of the enemies - the first Samurai Wasp is challenging, the third is an intresting enemy, but you'll stomp on the 8th one. Not to mention the 20th one.\nLevel design: Gorgeous. In chapter 2? you'll go into a snowy landscape, to end up in a ship-in-a-bottle, only to get it sunk then continue your journey underwater. Another chapter is all about Japan and the East - koi pond, china-landscape, traditional fans. Chapter 4 and 5 are just incredible and maybe the best ones from the game, both in terms of gameplay and design. If only chapter 2 and 3 would be similarly good.\nThough there is one thing that can put a dent on the experience: invisible walls everywhere. You can't touch most of the walls because you'll stop running ~ 30 cm before them, you can't jump on most things because pleasantly placed invisible ~2-3 metre tall \"boxes\" are placed on them because you only can jump on something you're *supposed* to jump on. It's a shame in a game from 2011.\nMinigames! There are various minigames/ tasks in the game you need to complete to continue: chess puzzle, sliding blocks puzzle, shoot 'em up game, sidescrolling platformer, guitar-hero like small puzzles.. I haven't expected this much variation, it's a really strong positive of the game.\nCollectibles: Collecting memories gives you a small quote (1-2 sentence) from a specific character of the story that deepens the main story. Even though they are quite conveniently placed and easy to find/get most of them, this makes collecting them really rewarding. Game lacks backtracing at several points of the game, making impossible to get the stuff at the other side of the crossroads if you took the correct one - without chapter selection. What a pity.\nAfterall, all I can do is to recommend this game. It has several really strong aspects, while the weakest points aren't worse than \"average\". Previously I thought it's a silly suggestion, but *Good Guy Nick* is right - playing the game for more than an hour can induce a strong feeling if monotonicity. I feel like most chapters should be 10-20% shorter, because while there are enough action, jumping and fighting to fill the gametime, there is not that much \"soul\" in the game to keep the gamer playing for longer periods. At the end, it was a nice - after how bad is EA's reputation in recent times, it was refreshing and pleasantly surprising to see a really creative and daring game under their name.", "timestamp_created": 1668691006, "timestamp_updated": 1668727149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 7192, "total_negative": 906, "total_reviews": 8098}, "cursors": {"AoJwo4LvwoQDf9qc3wM=": "Thu Nov 23 23:24:34 2023", "AoJ4oPK/2IsDdKqvuwQ=": "Thu Nov 23 23:53:21 2023"}}
