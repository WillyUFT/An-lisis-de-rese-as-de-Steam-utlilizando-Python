It does contain some combat in the form of little mooks you occasionally have to mop up. The plot revolves around an unnamed princess seeking to stop an unnamed witch, with little vignettes between chapters.\n\nThe controls for combat are not ideal, cause dodging is either leaping backwards or jumping forwards (into the sky) often leading to you falling over the side. You have combos that will typically miss cause there is no locking onto enemies.

It failed to keep me engaged, with too much filler and flutter, and it felt as though I was playing through a story that had no real substance. I was not invested in completing the level to find out the next part of the story. As with anything, there is room to worsen.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 3/10\nYou play a princess in a 3rd person action platformer. I personally had issues using the gamepad from the start, and it definitely does not work properly. The goal is to complete the level, and collecting all of the crystals is not worth the effort.\n\nDIFFICULTY: 3/10\nIf you plan on being an achievement completionist, you should expect this game to last you longer than it should. For me, the puzzles were frustratingly difficult, and I found myself having to go back and forth in some areas too many times to completely understand some of them. When you complete the puzzle, you will feel negative for wasting your time. The combat of the game is terrible; you will face a handful of different skeletons with varying abilities, all will frustrate you; the combat is weak and leaves you with nothing but disappointment.\n\nTECHNICAL: 2/10\nWhen first launching the game, the menus confused me, clicking each one of them takes you to a different part of configuration or tutorial, and eventually will start the game. I would have personally liked if the menus were a bit more intuitive, but that's too much to ask for in this poorly designed game. Performance was meh, with a shaky 30fps and constant dips in graphics. Some of the sounds, like a whistle for the balloon when you die can get annoying; I would prefer something less irritating.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNot recommended gameplay for a platformer that fails to deliver anything remotely interesting, with meh graphics and a forgettable story. 3/10", "timestamp_created": 1681253821, "timestamp_updated": 1681253821, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135449986": {"recommendationid": "135449986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145505653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1475223682}, "language": "english", "review": "Short 3d game.

They were clearly going for that \"cutesy\" anime style when it comes to the character design and voices, but it's annoying, and it's unnecessary how often we get dialogue from the princess just thinking out loud about the crystals and the witch. Or the princess saying things like \"I'm going to get you, witch!\" every 5 minutes.

The graphics for the game were good nice and colorful with a cute anime theme to it, the levels in the game are good, it wasn't really diverse but it's substitute that with having beautiful scenery to look at and explore.\n\nThe music in the game was good nothing to grandiose or epic but genuinely sweet and fits the game very well. The characters in the game were good very adorable looking and having sweet personalities, the voice acting the game was good and can be generally adorable. The enemies in the game were okay they had a cute look to them and the boss of the game was good and was not too tough.\n\nThe puzzles in the game we're good nothing too complicated, just simple environmental puzzle, the price for the game is fair. But my favorite part of the game is after collecting 100 crystals from a level you're treated to the story revealing itself as well as getting these adorable drawings to go with the story which I found nice and adorable.\n\nAlright the dislikes, sometimes the game can be a little frustrating like getting knocked back when hitting an environmental hazard, and I feel like the combat in the game felt like it was more of an afterthought and there was a bug or two in the game but nothing really game breaking.

There is also combat involved but there isn't a lot of depth, but serves its purpose of bringing a few more obstacles in your path which admittedly isn't extremely challenging, so if you are looking for a more complex and tough puzzler, perhaps this one isn't aimed at you.. \nThere is also the crystal collection. While you can complete the stages without collecting all of them, it is strongly recommended to do so, not only to unlock more of the story but to explore and engage more with exploration, the tower's puzzles and figuring out what to do.\nMusic is appropriately comfy and voice acting is on a similar note, simple and sometimes cheesy.\nIf there is one downside is that it's a vey short game and it's a shame because the devs have obviously put a lot of care in designing the stages and the puzzles and the game would only benefit with an expanded set of them.\n\nWhile not mind-blowing and not sure if I could call it a \"hidden gem\", it is a really nice game if you want to spend a few hours of casual puzzle platforming fun. \n", "timestamp_created": 1647890896, "timestamp_updated": 1647890896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112062518": {"recommendationid": "112062518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044801039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1647033581}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game using a coupon I got from crafting a badge on Steam. I usually don't play games like this but I read in the reviews that this was a relatively short game with some simple achievements so I thought why not, having another perfect game is kind of cool for the (low amount of) money.\n\nI started out having a \"meh\" time. Combat feels a little sluggish since you can't find AND jump at the same time, you're not able to run anywhere (pressing 'shift' does something else) and I often got hit because I was still locked in another animation. The first few levels weren't particularly challenging and the voice-acting was a little too much for me. I had some trouble getting into it. \n\nLater on the game and levels became more fun though. I really wanted to get the '100 crystals' per level and for that you have to destroy some statues. Further into the game I came close to finishing levels with close to half of the required amount of crystals even though I thought I had been and looked everywhere. Needed to some some backtracking at times and that actually wasn't a big deal because I thought some of the level design was quite good and sometimes even challenging.\n\nAlso, I LOVED the way this game did 'checkpoints' since whenever you fall off the tower, you'll respawn into a balloon that drops you off basically right where you were before.

The player will spend most of his/her time maneuvering through the obstacles of each level. A different gimmick is introduced in each level which prevents the game from feeling stale or repetitive. There are some secret areas added into each level as well, for those who are explorers or completionists.\n\nAs the player progresses, he/she will occasionally come across a cluster of enemies or a puzzle to solve. The puzzles, for the most part, are rather intuitive, offering a simple challenge that can be overcome with a small amount of trial-and-error. There are very few puzzles that might stump the player for a few minutes or so. Combat, on the other hand, is a bit disappointing. It's pretty basic with only a few attacks and a dodge. There aren't a whole lot of enemy encounters in each level and only one boss at the end of the game, so unfortunately, this makes the world feels very empty. \n\nVisually, the game is beautiful to look at. The world is bright and colorful, like one might see in a fairy tale environment. The protagonist has a cute design. The background music is nice and suits a platforming game well. The voice acting, however, is average.\n\nOverall, the game is okay. Though it is a polished game, it feels like it fell short of its full potential.

I thought the only downside to the game would be its short playtime, but I was completely wrong. In fact, it's more heavily focused on puzzles and precision platformers. While I'm still a fan of those genres, some things don't sit right when I played [b]Forward to the Sky[/b]. More on the review.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Almost all dialogues are dubbed\n- 6 levels with one boss fight level\n- Difficult puzzles\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- The hitbox of the lasers in level 5 is too large\n- You still can move when you are pushing boxes\n- Dialogues are being told as you explore the levels, even if there's an enemy to fight\n- Poor combat mechanics\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]No.[/b]\n[i]There are better games than this. One example is [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/205910/Tiny_and_Big_Grandpas_Leftovers/][b]Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers[/b][/url] ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132503739/recommended/205910]my review[/url]), which also focuses on puzzles and has longer playtime with the same offering price. It's even cheaper than this game when it's on sale.[/i]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe main menu is the first thing that ruins my expectation when I played this game. It looks like a cheap unity game where the dev tries to slap some images with no word to it. Not only did it look terrible, but it is also confusing. It took me some time to figure out how to start the game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2292560069\n\nLuckily, the in-game graphics are the same as the screenshots on the store page. The main character has a cute, anime-looking style with a simple, yet great-looking environment in it. It looks cheap while beautiful at the same time.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story was told in two parts. There is a huge chunk of text that acts as a summary to the game at the beginning and end of each level and some dialogues that happen as you play the game. It seems that the dev is bad at making an attractive main menu because the summary has the same style as the main menu; it also looks like one of those cheap games.\n\nWhile the in-game dialogue looks great with the beautiful dialogue text and voice dub in every dialogue, it becomes annoying as time passes because the character doesn't know when to stop. She always talks, even if there are monsters that I had to beat. If you ask me whether I had to listen to the pointless dialogue or focus on killing the monsters, there's no way I wouldn't choose the latter one.\n\n[h1]The Game[/h1]\n[b]Combat[/b]\nTo be honest, the combat feels more like hack and slash rather than action RPG. You can use left or right mouse click to attack, space to dash, and shift to dodge backward. Although the game seems to differentiate between left and right mouse click attacks, the difference isn't noticeable to me as I just needed to mash my mouse clicks to defeat the enemies. Dashing forward and rolling backward are also useless that I never paid attention to them.\n\nAlthough enemies are very easy on the first level, more variations and stronger enemies will be available on the next few levels. You still need to spam mouse click to defeat them, although you might want to prioritize the stronger enemies first. Since the dodge backward mechanic is counterintuitive and there's no other way to dodge enemies' attack, you're bound to take damage in each fight. Luckily, I finished all levels on my first try despite me always almost running out of health. I'm sure wouldn't enjoy the game this much if I had to die and restart the game again from the beginning.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2292560037\n\nThere is a boss fight at the last level where you must figure out the boss' attack patterns to defeat. While I find this to be the most satisfying combat the game has to offer, it took me a while to realize that my attack is effective towards the boss. The boss doesn't move at all when I was attacking that I thought that I wasn't dealing damage.\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nThe game relies heavily on puzzles in two of the levels. While the first one is quite obvious, it took me a while to understand how the second one works. There is no tutorial or whatsoever that can help you to figure out the confusing mechanic either. However, it becomes one of my most favorite levels after I learned it due to its challenging difficulty.\n\n[b]Platformer[/b]\nYou'll need to jump through platforms, sometimes within a time limit, to reach the other side of the road. However, I found it hard to control where to land whenever I'm taking a long leap to finish the run more efficiently; I ended up ditching the idea and had to be very careful to make sure that I landed correctly whenever I jump. Luckily, the game doesn't give any penalties if you fail the jump; you will respawn close to where you fall so you won't waste time walking to the same spot again.\n\nThere is still one more problem though. One of the levels requires you to dodge a laser while moving. However, the laser seems to have a larger hitbox than it seems, making it hard to figure where to actually move. There is even an occasion where you must move close to moving lasers that it seems to be impossible to get through without getting hit.\n\n[b]Difficulty and Length[/b]\nThe game has 6 levels in total. Each level has unique mechanics although your objective is still the same: to reach the goal. There is also an additional objective where you need to collect 100 crystals, which can be found by clearing everything in the dungeon, to unlock the full story. Doing so is tricky though as some crystals are well hidden, giving more challenge to the game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2292560100\n\nThe game is not hard to beat although I admit that I was always close to death whenever I finished the levels. Each level can be finished in less than 30 minutes and I finished the game at 2.3h after replaying the first level once because I didn't collect enough crystals to unlock the story. The game seems to only provide a save for level completion that you must restart the level again from the beginning if you want to collect the missing crystals.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nI just find it odd that the game decides to let my character move whenever I was pushing boxes. I needed to reposition my character several times because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nDespite it being marketed as an action RPG, there aren't many enemies to beat, and combat isn't what I remember doing the most in the game. The only combat that is memorable is the final boss level which also has its issues. In fact, the difficult puzzle level still remains in my mind due to how enjoyable it is. However, with so many lackluster mechanics that the game has, I don't think I can recommend this game, especially since there are better games out there with longer playtime and cheaper price.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1605843581, "timestamp_updated": 1607432990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684100210666656494", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79013425": {"recommendationid": "79013425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281128382", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1560380923}, "language": "english", "review": "simple good game", "timestamp_created": 1604952232, "timestamp_updated": 1604952232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78972069": {"recommendationid": "78972069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422199704", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 414, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1607552078}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a super short game without a good story telling either.

Then again there's only 6 stages to begin with. Nothing much to explore.\nThere're a total of 6 stages so it's a pretty short gameplay, for those who wants to buy the game, buy it whenever you feel it's the right time for you so you can say it's 'worth it\".\n\n\nCons:\n- Main Menu UI is hard to distinguish from the background\n- Playing one stage is enough to leave me with motion sickness with the (very) swift movement of camera rotation and such. The camera doesn't seem to rotate that smoothly. Jittering when running on stairs doesn't help either.\n- Since every platform looks the same, and the camera is rotating in a weird way, it's actually hard to see the bigger picture of the map\n- Needs map, in addition to previous points\n- Needs target lock so we know if we're bashing on the right enemies.\n- Needs enemy HP. This is optional, because I know some RPG games which doesn't implement this, and can still play nicely, BUT those games at least show a reaction from the enemy when getting hit, so we know we actually dealt some damages at them.\n- Needs better effect/SFX and animation to show damage dealt to the enemies. Right now it feels like I'm hitting a stone.\n\nConclusion: 6 stages with old UI and gameplay which of course can't be on par to games these days.

Forward to the Sky is a platforming game in 3D, where you control a very zealous young Princess, who set off in her hot air balloon to scale a crystal tower and defeat the resident witch!\n\nIt\u2019s charming! Endearingly so. The Princess is na\u00efve, but her heart is in the right place. You scale six levels of the tower, chopping away at skeleton foes and smashing statues to collect crystals. Collect 100 at a level and it reveals the full story for you. Collect fewer than 100 and you get half the story or just one part of the story. (They don\u2019t drop individually, they drop in clusters of 10/25, so it\u2019s not a chore.)\n\nAs you progress the young Princess debates with the witch as the lore becomes more revealing.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty good. Gameplay is fairly simple platforming and you swing and hack at the skeletons, though combat is a minor and trivial part of the game. It is probably a great game for kids to play, but it isn\u2019t perfect.\n\nSome issues are floaty controls, which can make jumping sections tricky and a rather unrefined combat system. Those two issues aside, the game is short and the difficulty is trivial. If you fall off a platform for example, you don\u2019t die, it just rescues you in the hot air balloon. You only have to restart the level if your health expires and you\u2019re given 1,000 hit points, which is fairly generous. It is however, appropriately priced at a mere \u00a35 and you can probably get this for less at places like Fanatical.\n\nDefinitely a good game and a little hidden gem to try out if you ever get the time.

There was a vision there, but the actually development seems to be missing the talent required to make that vision something really good.\n\nThe gameplay is the worst part though, combat feels sluggish and unsatisfying as you beat up skeletons that vary little over and over though luckily there isn't much combat to do. However you'll be doing a fair bit of platforming over the 6 short levels and it's terrible, because once you start moving in the air there's no way to stop your character from moving in a direction, so if you're high above what you want to land on you'll be doing a dance of going back and forth trying to stay above your landing zone so you don't drift away.

Jumping, pushing boxes, messing with switches that move platforms/doors/obstacles. Only six levels (but each are decently long) where you climb the tower and collect the 100 crystals that drop from enemies (1 each, 25 enemies) and statues (25 each, 3 statues tucked away in optional/out-of-the-way areas). You have 1000 HP to take damage from enemies and obstacles (and luckily falling off the tower doesn't harm  you) so you can take a good amount of hits. However, you can't slack off too much because there's no way to restore HP and losing it all means you start the whole level over. I took combat too casually (just ran towards and slashed enemies) and got burnt by the big mage in the 4th level who just summons crystals next to them and freezes you in place for the other enemies. The solution: [spoiler]Just defeat everyone else first while staying outside of crystal range.[/spoiler]\n\nThe story is alright (fairy tale) but the main character is so naive?/innocent?/childish? that the dialogue is sometimes hard for me to listen to. It reminds me a bit of RWBY.\n\nControls are pretty simple. Directional movement, buttons to jump, backflip, and two multi-hit attacks (first attack goes for up to 5 hits and you move forward a little bit each time, second attack does a bigger lunge forwards and goes for up to 3 hits). In the tower, you attack to activate certain switches, stand on buttons, walk into (to push) boxes/rotate certain objects, and jump for platforming/dodging enemy attacks.\n\nWorth a look if you can stand naive protagonists and want a somewhat casual and short action-platforming experience.\n\nOther thoughts:[list]\n[*] The controller is fine in-game but I couldn't figure out how to move the volume sliders without the mouse. Also, it feels a bit weird to have x360 controller use X as confirm instead of A.\n[*] It's a bit annoying that you don't have a dash forwards. It feels like the fastest way to travel is to face the camera and backflip.\n[*] I wish there was a jump/aerial attack. It doesn't feel great to have to land before attacking.\n[*] It's nice that the game is generous/close in its placement when you fall off the tower. There is very little backtracking from my experience.\n[*] When you fall off the face of the world there's a whistle as you take the air balloon back to the tower. The whistle is almost like/replaces the falling scream you'd hear in other games.\n[*] I'm not 100% sure but I think that crystals are always automatically collected (you don't need to walk near them), which is nice. You don't need to worry about defeating enemies near the edge and the crystals falling off the world or randomly missing a crystal you should have gotten.\n[*] It's nice that you unlock shortcuts between parts of the level in case you missed a statue and have to backtrack.\n[*] While the camera is normally fine, I wish you could zoom out or detach the camera. There's one small part where you walk upside-down and I didn't like the how the camera faced the ceiling.\n[*] The coloring/shading of her face is static so close-up it looks kind of like she's wearing a mask/face paint.\n[*] The air balloon is so handy that you'd think you would be able to just use it to climb and skip the whole tower.\n[*] The story ending is only okay. [spoiler]The solution to isolation is to go stay in an isolated place to avoid contact? I guess one person is better than no contact.[/spoiler]\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1558178566, "timestamp_updated": 1558178566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500449597835540771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50611696": {"recommendationid": "50611696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416565657", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 3050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2451, "last_played": 1637072444}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has beautiful graphics and story.

The game is incredibly short. I finished it in little over an hour, and would've likely got 100% Steam achievements with an extra 15-20 minutes.\n\nEverything in the game is cute; the story, the protagonist, the graphics, the voices.. Even the enemies are pretty cute. It's a pretty nice looking game and the platform elements, although nothing new or special to platformers, give a small challenge to those playing.\n\nIt's a very chilled experience, maybe too chilled. Nothing is particularly difficult or stressful. The combat is very basic. All you really need to do is mash your left and/or right mouse buttons and you'll be fine. You do have some form of dodge, but it's pretty redundant.\n\nIt's a nice looking game, and would likely be fine for a young child starting off in the world of gaming. For anybody else, it's just simple and boring (and I'm usually a fan of simplicity). If it's on sale, or in a bundle and you want to kill and hour, then you may want to try the game, but I can't justify getting it at full price.\n\n[quote]For more reviews follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33506892/]Gawain Games Curator Page[/url] and check out the [url=https://gawain-games.com/]Gawain Games Website[/url].

While controlling your character you can jump, attack and dodge. The game is split up in 6 chapters, and most of them have their own theme and puzzle type. Most of them aren't that much fun to play trough however; the combat is very clunky and doesn't feel satisfying at all, the puzzles are very easy, and the world design is confusing at times. All just feels very low quality, and as a bad example of game design.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Visual style & Graphics \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nThe visual style is cute and colorful, and while the character model of the princess is very cute, most of the assets and textures used in the levels don't look very pretty. Everything is very clearly grid-based. The game also didn't run the best, despite running it on a GTX1060 and i7.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Music, SFX & Voice \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nI didn't like the music in this game, it's just not good. Very low sound quality, but also very uninteresting composition, just some random MIDI tracks that seemed to be thrown into the game. The loop points are also very noticeable. Sound effects are just sh*t, they sound bad, the volume is all over the place, and they just make the game feel even cheaper. The voice acting sounds kinda amateuristic, and there are some problems with the timing of the lines, but i guess the voices used are pretty cute. \n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Story \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nThis game has a very basic story, just as a tool to glue the levels together. You will get a piece of story with every level you play, but it's really not that interesting. The execution is just not good, but i guess if you can see it as a very simple children's story, it has a tiny bit of charm. The game duration about 2 hours to complete everything, so very short.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Technical & Bugs \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nBad.

Camera control is ridiculously slow and choppy with controller, mouse is much more fluid.\n\n... Not a good game, gets a little better after the first two chapters (out of 6). First chapter has the worst graphics, with textures that look lifted from Steam Greenlight titles, and the most boring puzzles. The combat is imprecise, with only two combos to cycle through mindlessly. No attacking while jumping. Really short game, so not much combat to be had, thank the devs. Air jumping puzzles in Ch.3 highlights the game's difficulties with its controls and Light crystal puzzles in Ch. 4 have some jumps in logic that make little sense. Appreciated the gravity flip in Ch.3 but not much is done with it. Spike traps in Ch.1-2 are not precisely timed and are very annoying.\n\nGame is really for little kids, but then the puzzles ramp up in difficulty without warning before getting easy again later - that's a big minus. Otherwise, this is just too terrible a game for older gamers. There's a barebones story about a headstrong princess who wants people's approval so chooses to climb the Witch's Tower, vowing to defeat this \"evil\" witch, but finding that there's more to the witch than the legends say. Starting health is somewhat generous and platforming fails are met with immediate respawn nearby with no penalties. But damage amount taken is arbitrary and unpredictable.\n\nVoice acting (English) runs the gamut from absolutely horrible to barely acceptable. When translating the lines back into Japanese in my head, it still doesn't inspire much faith in the game's writing staff. \n\nCharacter model is flat, though her ribbons bounce when moving and hair flap a little when falling. Upskirt views with some mature (?) underwear are possible in some sections or when free-falling, nothing to write home about but might catch you off guard if unfamiliar with the way Japanese pop culture treats girls' panties. Their faces are frozen and the faces have an odd curvature to them upon closer inspection. The promotional art for the game is far better than any of the 3D art you will find in this game.

So take recent reviews with a grain of salt. \n\nAs for the game, it\u2019s super adorable and not demanding at all graphics wise, and is a pure platforming puzzler. If you aren\u2019t good with precise jumps and aligning yourself in platforms, you will HATE this. From like chapter four and onwards, this game requires a lot of precise movements. I found chapter four to be particularly frustrating, but not because of platforming----the puzzle for that level was just crazy. I didn\u2019t really struggle anywhere else, but puzzle platformers are one of my all time favorite genres and I play them quite often. \n\nThis game has six chapters and within the chapter your goal is to go forward to the sky, up to your air balloon and off to the next level. You also need to defeat various enemies and find three hidden statues in each level, with the statues usually involving some really fun puzzles. The final chapter is a boss fight and a great conclusion to the story, I wasn\u2019t expecting this game to feature a sweet boss fight but really impressed that it did. \n\nMy only complaint with this game is the voice acting, as someone who has an actual high voice, listening to a voice actress fake one for hours is really, really annoying and straining on the ears. So I played this game on silent. Not sure how the the voice acting is in other languages, but the English voice acting is terrible. \n\nAlso, with a lot of recent negative reviews, I see people complaining about framedrops and I can say I played this game while watching livestreams and was at 60fps the entire time, didn\u2019t have a single stutter or lag in the game. So, I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s your setups, but man you gotta have a dookie setup to not be able to run THIS.

That\u2019s what led me to try games like Pocket Kingdom and Submerged, a mixture of art and atmosphere that evokes very specific feelings or memories in me. I couldn\u2019t resist giving Forward to the Sky a go for that very reason, looking like something that lands square in between Studio Ghibli and Skies of Arcadia. But I know as well as anyone that it\u2019s always a gamble when you pick up a game based on screenshots, and this one was a bust. As much as it may have nailed an aesthetic that I really appreciate, it certainly didn\u2019t take any inspiration from better platformers or adventures.\n\nI won\u2019t go too deep on the story here, partly because uncovering it is a major thrust of the progression and partly because there\u2019s not much depth anyway. The sky tower was once an important source of magical crystals for the world, but a none too neighborly witch moved in and cut off the supply for a better part of a century. The tower drifted away under her ownership but now it\u2019s back, and a spry little princess with a poofy dress and a bigass sword is looking to seize the means of production. But not all is as it seems in this airborne edifice, and it becomes clear right from the start that the witch is hiding a greater secret. If the princess can survive the journey up to meet her, she might get a little bit more than she bargained for.\n\nThe story is told in very brief still scenes between levels, but there\u2019s a catch. One of the magical properties of the crystals here is recording memories, and as you bash enemies and statues for the precious gems you\u2019ll unlock more of the tale. Functionally, this means you have to collect all 100 crystals in a level to see the full scene and keep up with the story, and while they\u2019re not exactly hidden it means the game is geared way more towards completionists. It\u2019s also worth mentioning there\u2019s a lot of dialog between the princess and the witch during levels, and it assumes you\u2019ve seen the whole story scene leading into that level. This can get a little awkward if you\u2019re not keeping up with your collecting, but not as awkward as the intensely amateur-hour voice acting.\n\nCrystals are squirreled away in statues off the beaten path and in the bodies of rather adorable skeletons that you\u2019ll spar with periodically during levels. Each kind of skeleton pretty much has one attack and goes down in a couple hits, so fighting them is just a matter of clicking in their direction. You have two stiff combos that will dispatch just about anything, and while they\u2019ll get some hits on you from their own stiff attacks, you have so much health you can laugh it off. Outside the combat you\u2019ll be scaling a big stone tower, or at least the fragments of it. Levels are really collections of rooms and platforms floating in the big blue sky, and while they might look vast and complex there\u2019s really just one main path through each level. Take a peek at obvious platforms and you should find all the statues, and don\u2019t bother exploring little ledges or archways because they\u2019re just for show.\n\nIt\u2019ll take you about 15-20 minutes to get through each level, and there are six to tackle. They tend to have different gimmicks like spinning fans or gusting winds but every single mechanic and hazard feels either poorly-implemented or janky to work with. There are mystical breezes that push you around but the glow that marks them is far too subtle, and the aforementioned fans have finicky hitboxes. More important than any of this, though is that levels are just boring. There\u2019s not enough going on, not enough to see, and so little to the plot and combat that Forward to the Sky really lacks any kind of hook whatsoever. I could easily beat this in two hours but when I realized I was dozing off during fights in the fourth level, I knew it was time to stop.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

That bias may skew my review, as you can see it doesn't score all that well, but I still recommend it. \n\nHaving finished 100% of the achievements in only 5 hours, it's a short game. On top of that the voice acting is painful and I did encounter a couple of glitches. However I feel that the only reason this game fell short of greatness is a low production budget.

Basic rating - 6/10\n\nFirst thing is first - game is short, simple, and not particularly deep. In many ways, it feels like a first attempt by a single author (which, to be fair, I believe it is). The story is charming, but the initial twist is telegraphed in the first 10 minutes. The second twist is nearly as obvious, if more delayed. However, the story is heartfelt, and the mechanic of revealing additional plot through item collection isn't bad. \n\nThe graphics are fair, if a little boxy - think late N64 or early ps2 grade. \nMusic is reasonable.\nThe combat is simplistic, melee and dash attacks, and the mix of the two is rarely needed, or useful. I beat the game using melee 90% of the time.\n\nEach stage is very individualized mechanically (though the visuals are fairly uniform), which improved the general fun nicely. For example, level 5 is an obstacle course of traps, while 3 involves using various wind currents, and 4 involved light emitters. The challenge ramps up smoothly. However, the overall challenge wasn't too high - I failed to find 2 statues on my first playthrough of the level the entire playthrough, and one was due to me picking an irreversible path. \n\nI don't think the game has much replay value once everything has been found - and, again, finding everything is fairly easy.\n\nHonestly, this is one of those games that I would naturally give a neutral rating, if I could.

It falls short in nearly every category, unfortunately. It feels like an early demo of a platformer. \n\nThere's a lot of promise here, but it's simply not polished enough. The puzzles are unique in each level, and setting intention for collecting (in this case, crystals to unlock story) is always a positive. The art style is adorable, and was obviously influenced by just about every PS2 era anime-esque game out there. The controls are rough, clunky and not responsive enough for a platformer that requires such careful movements.\n\nThe writing is not exactly top tier. I don't expect Pulitzer-level stuff, but I would hope for some thoughts a little more coherent than \"It's beautiful here! (referring to the landscape) --Oh no, I can't go praising a witch!\" What does the world's beauty have to do with the witch? It makes no sense. Also, the levels all look identical, save for the different puzzle element swapped out in each stage.\n\nThe voice acting is cheesy, and sounds like a bad fan anime dub, but we see that in all kinds of games I like. \n\nThis is the kind of game I really wish we could give neutrals for. It's not really a full fledged game, but there's still something charming about it that kept me going. I knew it was bad, but, in a weird way, I enjoyed myself. Still, I can't recommend it in its current state.\n\n5/10\n\nLiked this review?

You can die either through losing in combat (controls are a bit wonky and hitboxes vague) or if you lose too much health to the environmental dangers (collision detection can be very off).\nThis is a strange choice given that the game actually has a good in-level checkpoint system in place. If you fall off a platform you don't die and your balloon rescues you and puts you back not far from where you fell. Why the death mechanic is so much more punitive is anyone's guess. Fortunately the levels aren't too long so you do end up back to where you left off relatively quickly.\n\nI got this in a bundle and felt it was priced appropriately as such.

The end of the last level before the finale could use some polish though, the beam things seemed inaccurate - there were a few times I should have been shocked but wasn't, and many times I don't know why I was shocked. That part was frustrating and felt like it required as much luck as skill.\nMy other complaint was the Princess. Is she supposed to be a small child who really shouldn't have a sword, or is it just the anime style that makes her look young? I'm fairly certain it's the latter, in which case she's a complete idiot. As the story unfolded I had my own suspicions, but sometimes it was like she completely ignored it. You want to ask her 'Did you not hear what the crystals just said?'. Maybe that's an anime thing though, I don't know.\nThe story itself could have been fleshed out a little more (Why was the 'Witch' the way she was?) but it's decent enough. As you collect crystals you learn more, and if you don't collect enough on a level then there'll be a hole because you can continue, but you'll be missing a piece of the story.

It has floaty controls, bad hit detection and terrible voice acting, yet it sits (at the time of writing) at \"Very Positive\"\n\n[B]Graphics & Sound[/B]\nThe graphics in Forward to the Sky is hardly amazing, in fact it looks a bit dated, like something released in the early 00's, but with slightly better lighting and a higher resolution. Textures are flat and repetitive, and the models look like they have a low polygon count. Of course, the technical aspect is not everything, a game can be built on ancient tech, and yet look good due to a strong art direction. In my mind the art direction in forward to the sky is acceptable, and while I do appreciate the use of more vibrant colours, the rest is just \"meh\". Not terrible, but not good either.  \n\nSound effects are alright. Not something you think of, but they could have been worse. They serve their purpose. But the voice acting, oh the voice acting. It seems like they just decided to let some intern do one take, and then used that, because this is some of the most uninspired voice acting I've ever heard. It's not funny bad, it's just uninspired, flat and boring.  \n  \n[B]Gameplay[/B]\nThe gameplay in Forward to the Sky is marred by issues. Combat with enemies is simplistic and quite boring, as there seems to be very little strategy involved. At least early in the game. It reminded me of Fable 3, only even less involving, and Fable 3 had amazingly simplistic combat. \nPlatforming is hampered by really floaty controls. It feels like gravity is not quite what it should be, and the character moves through the air in an odd way. What I'm getting at is that platforming is not well made, and there's a bit of it.\nThen we have the hit detection. I quickly started to suspect that the hit boxes of objects did not match the models very well, and tested on some spiked, and as suspected, I would get hit even when the model was not touching the spikes. It's as if the hitboxes are too big compared to the models. \nThese issues all add up to a game that feels amateurish at best, and is really not fun to play.  \n \n[B]Closing thoughts[/B]\nWhat more is there to say about this game? It's bad. It works, but it's simply a bad game. And as a cherry on top of all the other issues, the main menu puts style over usability. It's not a massive issue, and if the rest of the game was good, I would have easily been able to forgive the poor main menu, but when there are so many other issues, it just becomes another annoyance. Had this been a student project, it would have been acceptable, but as commercial software, it's not worth your time and money.\n", "timestamp_created": 1527962663, "timestamp_updated": 1527962663, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727084040641784668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42420391": {"recommendationid": "42420391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147215542", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1527837687}, "language": "english", "review": "Please wait for a sale or find a way to purchase it for a cheaper price.

I get that this is more of a platformer / puzzle(?) \n game though, just wish it was something more.\n\n- Puzzles not being built upon, instead being one stage gimmicks. Puzzles are very easy to figure out (even the spots that lead to the statues) Imagine if they added more puzzles / levels, but they combined them.

(There are more ideas I could've came up with but you get what I am saying) \n\n- Terrible hitbox. I can't tell you how many times I got hit when nothing was near me and fell off.

The game surely has its flaws, but I did enjoy it for the most part.\n\nThe elements that interested me the most were the puzzle platform aspects. Each of the six stages present a new concept to tackle, and while each one doesn't appear past its debut stage it does mean players get to take on a variety of tasks such as rolling rocks to reach high up ledges or activating crystals to alter the presence of platforms and walls. Hunting down the crystals needed to fully reveal the story was also fun, with at least one crystal statue per stage being in a place that's visible when looking around as you explore but requiring some careful thought to actually reach. In general the trek from the beginning to the exit was fun, requiring players to look around and explore to find the next path onwards and upwards.\n\nThat said, platforming itself can be a little tricky because the controls are rather slippery. The Princess appears to have two movement speeds - not moving and full pelt with nothing inbetween. Most of the time it's not too big an issue, especially as falling into the abyss has no actual downside other than the game resetting you close to where you fell, but it can still be annoying when trying to navigate some of the small platform segments and accidentally shooting off the edge trying to reposition yourself. Likewise aerial movement can feel weird which can make directing her to the right spot a little tricky.\n\nThe final boss fight was pretty fun, with multiple stages and some neat ideas like using its own attacks against it or carefully circling around to attack while it's locked in an attack animation. Sadly this fight really is the only notable highlight of combat. The actual mechanics involved are a bit sloppy which can result in many encounters only being serviceable, outside of the final boss and a few of the large mobs that require good movement around. Some encounters are quite irritating though, like the sword and shield enemies where their walking and shield bashing animations look identical or the wizard that spams massive ice spikes all around it.\n\nAt 1.7 hours it was a pretty short game, but enjoyable enough to be worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1527458204, "timestamp_updated": 1527458204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516666650772094727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42323018": {"recommendationid": "42323018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018580644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1527460128}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this for about $0.50 as part of a bundle, yet I'm still disappointed.

However, the mechanics aren't used to their full potential giving the player the bare minimum puzzles that can be seen in any other puzzle platformer, which is a shame. This isn't helped by the lack of shadow which makes landings hard to predict. \n\nStory and Voice Acting: There is an effort here however it's not great. The story is so simple that you'll most likely figure it out after the first level is completed, however, if you don't the characters will make sure you do as the princess (she has no other name) will exposit to you each level about her shifting opinion on the witch (also has no name). \n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\nTerrible Optimization and Buggy Hitboxes: For such a simple game it stutters without a pause, making the platforming a nightmare at times. Meanwhile avoiding spikes and other environmental obstacles can be an issue as they will hit you even if you're not standing on them.  \n\nCombat: The combat is a chore and totally optional, defeating enemies will give you crystals which just unlock the story bits at the end of each level. I'd suggest just skipping the fights up until the last level where you have to fight a boss of the game.  \n\n[h1]General Thoughts:[/h1]\nFor an hour's worth of time, it's not a bad, but it feels much more like a demo than a real game. It's unpolished, it feels like there could be a good game here the style and music are good and the puzzle platforming can be charming.

This Princess, has a very distinct mission; To defeat the evil witch and gain recognition and applauses!\n\nAccordingly to the legend, an evil witch lives on the top of the tower, surrounded by her evil minions who follow her villainous deeds. The tower was once the peaceful home for its inhabitants, who worked on the mines, extracting crystals to sustain their humble lives, until that flagitious day, where a baby girl was born with the ability to form crystals within her body.\n\nThe young girl grew apart from everybody, and the miners progressively noticed the low and unprosperous mining results, and everyone eventually blamed the girl as the culprit. Legend has it, the young girl attacked the mine workers with the crystals themselves, and became the ultimate fearful witch! The Princess must now rid the world of such meanie witch and return the crystals to its people.\n\nDeveloped by [i]Animu Game[/i], a small team dedicated to Anime-based games, [b]Forward to the Sky[/b] was their very first game published on Steam back in 2015, 3 years ago to be precise, and up to this day, the feedback has been positive among Steam users. Although the game is short, the objective was simple; to create something interesting, fun and compelling. Mission accomplished!\n\nThe player controls the Princess, in her journey through the Tower in a mixture of action and platforming. Against the evil minions, the player can use just two different attacks, and with them, two different combos respectively. However, to climb up this tower, simple attacks won\u2019t be enough, as you\u2019ll have to jump through moving platforms, gears, and even giant stone spheres.\n\nCreating platforming elements can be tricky for any studio, and we\u2019ve seen many succeed and fail, but in this case the ending result is very positive, with a easy and fun movement system. Platformers are part of every youth, and this game is highly recommended for young gamers!\n\n[i]Animu Game[/i] presents us a very Anime-Based Princess, whom, although swings a sword bigger than herself, it\u2019s extremely cute, and we surely appreciate the details on her dress, such as her bow ties. She is a princess, after all, and one willing to take matters into her own hands!\n\nThe visuals are very appealing to the eyes, and since this adventure is portrayed through different parts of the day, we get to enjoy different weather, going from a beautiful sunny morning, into a magical night, and ending in a wrapped torrid sunrise! Although the levels are repetitive and simple, it has some sufficient details, such as wildflowers and moss, leaving a faint impression you really are in ancient ruins.\n\nThe small story-plot is told by folklore and legends in animage/text sequence of short notes, almost like a puppet play. These story segments are unlocked if one collects every crystals in the level, and there are 100 to gather in 6 different levels.\nCrystals aren\u2019t easy to gather, as they are very well guarded by evil skeletons! These are the only enemies you\u2019ll encounter, and they have different classes too; warriors, mages, archers and even heavy warriors. The combat is not complex enough to perform huge and extreme combos, so you\u2019ll most likely feel like taking them one by one, if you can get that attention individually that is.\nAlthough simplistic, don\u2019t underestimate this title, as enemies have really good hitboxes and clearly a fantastic reaction to the player. Their group behavior is pretty good as well, so you\u2019ll never have the same fight twice.\n\nWorry not brave Princess, because the skeletons are not what you\u2019ll most fear in this adventure. Crystals are running wild, especially with their laser beams, and that\u2019s definitely tricky. The hitboxes for our main character could have been improved, but not game breaking!Since we are talking about platforming mechanics, you\u2019d expect to fall to your death, but no...\nFalling over the leges won\u2019t kill our protagonist, as her truthful air balloon comes to the rescue, but remember though, losing all your life means a new level star over!\n\nPC settings are really basic ones as seen on many other Unity engine games, with just three major options to choose from; Resolution, Fullscreen mode or Windowed, and graphic options, going from Fastest for better performance to Fantastic, where the best visuals are. Among these options, light effects seem to be the heavier one, where my GTX 750 Ti struggled the most.\nInput for joystick or controller is also available, but the game is extremely well optimized for keyboard and mouse.\n\n[b]Forward to the Sky[/b] would be fully voiced, if not for the storytelling, as both the Princess and Witch are voiced over in English during their adventure. The audio works are pretty good, and worth any Anime audio-subbed, we\u2019ve been having this last couple of years on TV. That\u2019s not saying much, but this is a small game as well.\nMusic is included, and it\u2019s free for owners of the game on Steam.

The controls are simple, the story is short and sweet and the level design is actually really well done and intuitive. \n\nPuzzles are simple and have limited combinations making them easy to pick up and uderstand where you went wrong. The game has you collect gems in each level which, with a keen eye, can easily be done in a single playthrough. There is no lives system, anytime you make a mistake and fall off you are simply ported back to where you last were. Instead you have a health bar that depletes as you take damage but there are no health items to replenish it so you cant just brute force the larger packs of mobs, however it is large enough to not have to worry about it most of the time.\n\nThe only gripe i would have, and it is a really basic one, is that a lot of the sceanery is destructable but doent serve a purpose other then in one or 2 specific parts. Due to this I assumed that there would be items hidden inside the sceanery and speant a lot more time on level one then i should have.\n\nAlthough the game is short with only 6 levels  I would highly recommend this as a beginers game for kids so that they can be introduced to the old puzzle solving problems and item collection that made great PS1 generation platformers.

It has also none replay value.\n\n-Control: The control in character, objects and combats are all pain in the a*s. The controller supports outside actual gameplay are even more confusing. The UI seems to be designed for keyboard and mouse alone.\n\n-Showcase-like gameplay: While new puzzle systems are adopted in every new stages, those in last stages are completely discarded. Deepening of game mechanics is particularly important for puzzles yet hardly observed in this game.

This can lead to clicking outside the window instead of attacking.\n-Can teleport onto top of platform if jumping high enough next to it.\n\n-Attacking needs polish: Button clicks are queued such that if you double click, your character will attack twice. However, if the second click is done toward the end of the previous strike, the second strike won't happen until the next time you click to attack, upon which the character will attack twice despite clicking only once the second time.

So double the unfun to fight. \n\nMr. Bones is alright though.\n\nMost of the platforming challenges are trite timing or physics puzzles, and combined with the locked movement directions they're not much fun either. \n\nNone of these remotely break the game.

A lot of games are too depressing, too linear, too purely violent with no adventure or mystery, too automated, but this is none of that, really good, i feel a sense of freedom, good for releasing stress!   ...I just can't seem to get the controls to work through. i've set the input to my gamepad but i don't known how it does what it does, it maps the buttons all over the place in random ways, not what i specified, sometimes important buttons like jumping or attacking just get replaced with the backflip or disappear. and i can't really control the camera angle on my controller, somehow when i press the A button it will jump and rotate the camera together, that's not what i set the input to do at all, it sort of works i guess but it should to what you set it to do, i was hoping to control the camera with the d-pad arrows on my controller or L and R perhaps.., i end up having to use the mouse and a controller, pretty awkward to sit up and reach over when ever i want to change the view, then i was trying to get the jumping to work on my mouse, so at least when i am using the mouse i can mostly control the game, but the mouse will only attack, even when i set the mouse input to do jumping it just ignores it so i can't have the mouse in one hand and the controller in the other because the jumping button is on the right side of my controller, but that is still awkward anyway. i was hoping to play the game entirely with the controller. This game is pretty awesome and i hope to figure out whats wrong with the button mapping.

There's a modicum of backstory, but even without 100% completion (which is required to get all the details), you can probably fill in the gist of it yourself. Which doesn't speak too highly about it, but anyways...\n\nThe combat in this game is, shall we say, subpar. There're only two possible attack moves (which I can't figure out the difference between, practically speaking), and a seemingly useless dodge mechanic. Enemies are either worthless or insanely annoying, and with no way to recover health, the game becomes a bit of an endurance test - can you make it to the end of the level before you run out of health? Not the most compelling gameplay.\n\nThe saving grace of this game - and the only reason you should consider looking at it - are the puzzles. Each level introduces an interesting mechanic for you to learn and use, and with only one personal exception, the puzzles have always seemed to be of appropriate difficulty - giving you the satisfaction of solving a problem without much frustration. It would've been nice to see levels combine these mechanics, but considering the other issues with the game, its short length is probably a boon rather than a liability.\n\nFor its normal asking cost, I wouldn't, but if you find it on sale and want to spend a couple of hours on some nice puzzles, then why not?", "timestamp_created": 1466977005, "timestamp_updated": 1466977005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494954466819763184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23840267": {"recommendationid": "23840267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037683039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1674337648}, "language": "english", "review": "Hmmmm...

The story is sort of ok-ish. not ok, that EVERYTHING of the story you collected while be read to you in the and again and I couldn't quit it. (Bug or is it a special key beside \"Enter/Escape/Space/Strg/Shift/.....tried some more\")\n\nSome [b]pros[/b]:\n1. The artstyle is nice, just like the soundtrack.\n2. Some of the puzzles are quite nice to solve. Except the last angel on lvl 5 at which the stoneballs always glitched inside of each other and the lasergrid which I wouldn't get throw cause I was thrown back no matter how carefull I tried to go through. (I watched a yt vid and made the same as the person there and glitched through)\n3. It's fairly short. Pro because I wouldn't have been motivated to play it for more than the 100 Minutes (including all achievements, chatting a bit and starting this review).\n\n[b]All in al[/b]:\n\nNot worth the 7.99 it costs usually.

On your first playthrough you may find your self enjoying the game somewhat but if you were to step back for a second to take a more objective look at the game you would see that it's rather bad.\n\nThe combat in Forward to the Sky could be completly thrown away and nothing would be lost expect for a couple of sales because they wouldn't be able to feature it in promotional images and videos. It's awful, pointless and adds nothing to the experience other then frustration at how little range and \"AOE\" you have in your attacks.\n\nThe platforming is trash and only has one mechanic to it... the jump key and movement keys... you get no double jump, sprinting varying height nothing. You can jump and move that's it for a platformer these mechanics are far too simplistic.\n\nThe puzzles are ok however with that said this isn't a puzzle game it's a 3D collectathon puzzle platformer with combat elements. The collectathon part of this game is pointless and is only there to make sure that you kill all enemies and solve the \"optional\" puzzles. Honestly though if you skipped the collectathon part of this game you could probably beat this in under 30 minutes.\n\n[b]In conclusion[/b]\nForward to the Sky feels like a foundation for a better game as it has ok ideas it's just that they're executed poorly. If the developers were to take these mechanics and improve on them in a new game I wouldn't complain even if it was of the same length because that's the thing I prefer quality to length but with Forward to the Sky you don't get quality or length.\n\nSo do I recommend Forward to the Sky?... No, it's not bad but it's not good even if it were free I wouldn't recommend it as the mechanics aren't good but I've said that several times.\n\n[i]I also did a video review if you want to watch that but I doubt you would want to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tG_W3szkDc[/i]\n\n[h1]A message to the Devs[/h1]\nYou're game isn't awful but you need to expand upon and improve the mechanics you have because when your being out matched by old PS2 games your not in a good position.", "timestamp_created": 1457347140, "timestamp_updated": 1475378456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681668460369110107", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21356021": {"recommendationid": "21356021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220159903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1460085859}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game, short but fun.

I loved that every level, a new gameplay mechanic is brought into the game, so each level has different gameplay. The bad thing is that there are only 5 levels and a bossfight, which you'll beat in about 2 hours, getting 100% achievements meanwhile.\n\nI think the developers could actually squish more out of the game, at least every gameplay mechanic (gravity changes, wind rings, elevators) could get more levels that would just grow in difficulty by the progress. Anyway, the game, even when is short, is entertaining and worth buying - though it's up to you to decide if you'll pay the full price or wait for (another) sale.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n- [b]Relaxing and entertaining[/b]. Your brain (or fingers) won't melt there, don't prepare to die. You'll just be jumping and slashing with your sword.\n- [b]Cute protagonist[/b].

At one point there is this random purple shit that knocks you off the platform and the only way to bypass it is to just walk against it and pray. Most of the time, you are left just repeating the same action, as there is literally no other way, until magically the game decides that it will let you get to the next platform. \n\nNot only that, but the combat is absolute trash. When you have to fight something, it feels like they tried to \"spice it up\" a bit and just add a lil skeleton dude that you hit once and it dies. \n\nOh, and did I mention there is no saving mechanic? On top of having little to no controls or options, the game decides when your checkpoints are. Again, I have no problem with this as most platformers have their own checkpoint system, but this one is unforgiving. I could go so far and even have to sit through an entire dialouge section, and then fall off the cliff and respawn 3 years earlier.\nI had such high hopes for this game, but was throughly let down. \n\nAnd before anyone says \"it's only $8 don't be so harsh\", I know and have played plenty of other low-budget indie games, but not putting in at least SOME effort to make it good is unacceptable.", "timestamp_created": 1450754197, "timestamp_updated": 1450754555, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458404064178466797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19802270": {"recommendationid": "19802270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046766056", "num_games_owned": 1186, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 157, "last_played": 1553772032}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]An\u00e1lisis / Review - Forward to the Sky[/h1]\n\nCuando compras este juego, debes tener claro que no debes esperar grandes cosas de \u00e9l, el juego ya de por si se muestra bastante sencillo.\nTiene un aspecto visual bastante bonito, que lo hace relativamente atractivo a la vista y te anima a la compra.\n\n[b]Historia:[/b]\nLa historia es bastante simplona, es bonita y muy corta.

It follows the story of a Princess who explores the Sky Tower to learn what happened to it and reclaim the crystals. It's a nice, relaxing game with good music and pleasant, vibrant visuals. The game is 6 levels long, and will keep you occupied for about two and a half hours. The combat is very basic with a strong attack, light attack and a dodge, but that's really everything you need. The jumping is good overall but changing direction in mid-air moves Princess a bit further than you'd like to, making precision jumping difficult at times. But the game is forgiving enough that it never really becomes an issue.\n\nThe meat of the game is in the puzzle platforming, and it's pretty good at that. Every level introduces new mechanics and presents you with interesting puzzles. None of them are especially taxing though, so don't expect taking hours on finding the solution to a puzzle.

It's on the store page; no review (not even my stellar, first-rate, excellent, incomparably fantastic review) can match what you'll get from the demo, so if you're on the fence go download it and try it out.\n\nMy opinion is that this is a very charming, simple game. I enjoyed the game thoroughly (with a few slight misgivings), and I hope to see more from the developer.\n\nI'll cut right to the chase and tell you that this game is EXTREMELY short. My gameplay stats list it at an hour, but I did play the first few levels without running Steam so it's actually about twice that at 2 hours (I did go back and replay the first 3 levels in Steam to get the achievements, but at that point I remembered the layout and basically just speedran them). There are 6 levels (5 levels, really; the 6th is just a boss fight), so that puts it at right about 20 minutes per level on average. I bought it on sale so I wasn't put off by the lack of playtime, but it is something you should consider.\n\nThis game is mostly platforming, with two or three combat setpieces per level between platforming sections. I have absolutely no problem with the platforming beyond the fact that every level introduces a new gimmick, and none of these gimmicks are ever repeated, meaning that the skills you get in one stage never carry on to the next. As an example, the third level introduces wind gust tunnels that you have to navigate to get to different sections of the level, but no other stage has these tunnels. Every stage is mechanically completely different from the next. However, that's really just kind of a nitpick. If the game ever gets a sequel, I'd love to see stages that incorporate the gimmicks from previous stages. Level design does incorporate the gimmicks well, though, and overall each level is pretty fun. Thankfully, the camera is completely controllable and the princess controls great, so there's really no major gripes from me about this portion of the game.\n\nCombat, though, is a little boring and really just amounts to a button masher. You have left-click attacks and right-click attacks, but the difference is minute enough that you can go in swinging either way and it doesn't have an impact on combat. There is also a backflip button, which acts as a dodge, and that's fairly useful late in the game against the mage enemies, but they only appear in the last two platforming stages. Earlier stages can be beaten by literally just tanking every hit and whaling away on the mouse. However, the stages are mostly focused on platforming and like I said there are at max about 3 major \"battles\" per level, so it's not unbearable.\n\nDuring each stage you have to pick up the various crystals you find. Small enemies drop one when defeated, big enemies drop three, and statues you break apart are each worth 25 crystals for a total of 100 in each stage. Typically, the split is 25 crystals from enemies and 3 statues. For every 33 crystals you pick up, you unlock one section of that stage's story; if you only collect 33 crystals, for instance, you'll only get 1/3 of that stage's exposition. Honestly, it's kind of a non-issue. If you have absolutely ANY sense of exploration you'll easily find all of the statues (some later stages have statues hidden behind puzzles, but all of them are rather simple, and the statues have a very noticeable glow that is visible even through solid objects) and enemies are NEVER off of the beaten path so it's very rare you'll ever finish a stage without getting all 100 crystals. I don't know what happens if you don't get all crystals from each stage; there might be two different endings depending on whether you get all of them or not, but like I said, it's simple enough to get all of them.\n\nI did have a slight problem with the voice acting. None of it is awful, but none of it is good, either. I would describe it as \"endearingly mediocre.\" The princess and the witch, the two main voices you'll be hearing throughout the game, are both fine, but I really didn't like the third voice actress.\n\nThe story is just a setpiece, really. It's there to justify the fact that you're a cute girl jumping around in a tower in the sky. There's nothing wrong with that; the story fills its purpose, and even though it's about the simplest and most cliched story you can think of, it's amusing enough that it doesn't get on your nerves. Though I enjoyed the game and wish it had been longer, I think that if I had had to listen to either the voice acting or the story for much longer it might have started to drag the experience down. As it stands, though, the game is short enough that neither are too grating.\n\nThe characters are rendered in a cel-shaded chibi style, which fits the tone and is pretty cute. The early levels are rather plain and bland, but later on there are glowing crystals and colored fogs and other visuals to help keep things interesting. The music is enjoyable and, again, mostly fits the tone of the game.\n\nOne thing I WOULD like to complain about is the presentation of the menus. There's no text; everything is done via pictures. This isn't a terrible thing, but I did twice accidentally end the game because I couldn't tell which button was supposed to take me back into the game. I will chalk that up 90% to personal idiocy (just hit the Esc/start button again to get out of the menu, idiot), but even just a single word \"Resume\" or \"Close\" would have been helpful. The buttons for camera inversion are also a little awkward. However, this is another tiny nitpick and the game itself is not in any way negatively impacted by this.\n\nOverall, I think this is a thoroughly enjoyable game. Bear in mind the cost when deciding if you want to buy it now or wait for a sale, and above all, since the developer was nice enough to include a demo, play that to see if you want the full product. My guess is that you'll enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1435035549, "timestamp_updated": 1435035549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717303574085235596", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16613597": {"recommendationid": "16613597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080708735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1435143538}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty simple, the combat system is pretty horrendous, but the game doesn't rely on that.

On her way, she has to fight her way past  enemies and solve puzzles in order to unlock the passage to the next floor of the tower as well as the \"full story\", with more lines getting added the more crystals you collect in every stage.\n\nThe game is quite charming both in terms of visuals and sound; both add quite a lot to the feeling of being high up an uncountable amount of feets up in the air. However, this doesn\u00b4t mean that it\u00b4s impressive from a technical point-of-view: It looks very low-res and without much detail, and the only thing that stands out a bit (outside of its style) is the destructibility of the terrain: Most pillars, bricks, stone piles and even some walls can be destroyed with your sword, even possibly hurting you in the process if you aren\u00b4t careful. Soundwise, it needs to be said that the voice acting, while not exactly terrible, feels very amateurish as well: While I personally had no problem with it, this may be a downer for others. Controls for the most part are fine, though a bit too floaty and not always as precise as they should be. Combat controls are very simplistic, with two kinds of attack and a parry move; the latter one being kind of useless though (you\u00b4re better of just jumping out of the way).\n\nGameplay-wise, each stage consists of platforming, hitting switches, finding specific statues and defeating enemies, neither of which is particularly difficult even if you aren\u00b4t used to platformers in general. Each stage also has one or two unique gimmicks (like boulders that you need to roll on, or lasers that you need to dodge with the right timing) that aren\u00b4t reused in other stages, as well as one or two new enemy types. You can\u00b4t fall to your death (your trusty hot air balloon will always catch you), but you can die in battle or by getting hit from obstacles; if that happens, you have to restart the stage from scratch, so keep that in mind. Even then though, you will rarely get stuck, and no stage should take you longer than 15 to 20 minutes to complete. \n\nConcerning the length: It\u00b4s a very short game and should not take more than two hours to complete. The only kind of collectible are crystals that you need to collect in order to unlock new story passages, and they can only be found by killing enemies and destroying hidden statues. Some of those statues are fairly well hidden, but nothing you can\u00b4t find on your first try. Otherwise, there is no replay value, no hidden bonus stuff or unlockables. Having said that, I found those two hours to be quite enjoyable and entertaining.

When you complete the puzzle, you will feel positive for completing it and continuing on.

Needs a bit of polish, but if you like light-hearted games, hack n\u2019 slash games, puzzle games, and/or platformers this game is definitely worth the money.)\n\nPRO:\n- Lots of gameplay elements; puzzle, hack n\u2019 slash, and platforming.\n- All gameplay elements are very well done.\n- Fun, cute little story.\n- Good visual style.\n- Good music.\n- Adorable dialog/voice acting (it\u2019s not good, but it\u2019s charming in how silly and earnest it is).\n- No recycling; every level introduces new challenges and enemy types.\n- Interesting mechanic of having to gather items on each stage to reveal more of the story.\n- Full voice acting in-game.\n\nCON:\n- The combat could be deeper.\n- The lack of a lock-on or ability to adjust mid-strike makes the directed attack all but useless; the game is essentially just one-button combat with the wide area attack.\n - The dodge sends you flipping backwards relative to where your character is facing, not the direction you push the left analog stick/what movement key you hit.  This makes the dodge useless as you can\u2019t see where you are dodging and often go flipping off of a ledge.  My advice is to just jump out of the way instead.\n - It\u2019s a bit hard to explain, but your character is sort of \u201cfloaty.\u201d  It\u2019s almost like she is TOO responsive; trying to land on some of the smaller platforms will often result in her running off them as you try to just adjust yourself slightly.  Maybe this had something to do with me using a controller instead of the keyboard. Regardless, my advice is to stop touching the stick/keys the moment you are about to land.\n- VERY short: I was able to 100% complete it in less than two hours and in just one run.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a fun little game with lots of features and a sweet story.  My only complaints are that the combat is rather shallow and it is way too short.  It should be noted that there are many bad games out there that are \u201canime-like.\u201d  For those games it\u2019s clear the developers made them that way simply because they knew people would gobble them up.  That is not the case with this game; when you play it you really get the sense that Animu Game cared about their project.  Honestly, I recommend buying this game at full price like I did.

You play the role of a young princess, and the story goes as follows: A tower emerges on the sky of your town; Legend says that a wicked, evil witch that has oppressed your town lives in the tower. The princess decides to go up to the sky tower, on her air balloon, to confront and defeat the evil witch. The game consists of six levels, each corresponds one of the six tiers of the tower. The game plays as a storybook/fairy-tale and as you progress along the game, there will be items to be collected which will shed light on the story and will expand upon the legend.\n\nGameplay:\nThe platforming elements of the game are solid. Controls are crisp and responsive and the default controls are intuitive. The trickiest part of the controls is the free-roaming camera, which you can control at all times. Once I found the proper sensitivity setting and reversed the appropriate axes on my mouse, it became second nature in minutes. The camera allows for greater exploration of your beautiful environment and to spot possible secrets or danger areas. A few clipping bugs exist, but these are rare and not gamebreaking. If encountered, you can easily clip out of the structure in which you just clipped in.\n\nLevel/Game Design:\nEach progressive level of the game introduces a new gameplay dynamic which allows the game to remain fresh. On the other hand, the combat dynamics are relatively simple and straight-forward. Attack 1 (LMB default) allows for a quick attack with your broadsword and several LMB clicks allow for doubling on your attack and following with a jumping attack. Attack 2 (RMB default) allows for a slower, more powerful attack where you charge forward with your sword. Repetitive RMB clicks lead you to perform a rapid stab maneuver, followed by a deep, powerful single stab. You can also jump out of harm's way (default spacebar) and dodge your way from danger (pressing left shift); the dodge is basically a backflip.\n\nThere are a handful of baddies which all have different attacks and timing. Combat relies on learning the patterned behaviour of your baddies and attacking them on their refractory period and avoiding head-on attacks (flanking or attacking from behind).\n\nHowever, it is in the platforming where the game shines. Given the fact that each level consists of a different puzzle/platforming dynamic, part of the allure of the game relies on figuring out these dynamics while avoiding the danger that these may confer.\n\nDifficulty of the game is low overall. There is no significant punishment or damage taken for falling of the ledge of the tower or falling down a few levels. If you fall, the young princess will dish out an inordinately strong whistle which will summon the air balloon to your rescue.\n\nDesign of the princess is intricate, cutesy with an anime-flavor. Levels are well-designed, which allow for the different game dynamics, however, given the fact that the whole game takes place in the tower, textures are relatively repetitive. The background, effects and platforming obstacles do provide some needed visual relief.\n\nMusic is relaxing, ethereal, appropriate and enjoyable. Sound effects are on point, some minimal distortion noted uncommonly\non several of the attack grunts/screams of the young princess which occur on destruction of walls/columns.\n\nReplayability:\nOverall, the game provides some mostly mindless fun. Most puzzles are simple and quickly figured out. A couple puzzles may take a few minutes to understand and solve, but complexity is basic. The game is quite fun due to the variety of game dynamics and physics. It is the puzzle platforming that shines, while the combat can be fun, but relatively monotone.\n\nConclusion:\nGame completion should take anywhere from 2-4 hours, depending of if you rush through the game or choose to take your time and complete the achievements. Content of the game is appropriate for all ages, and the simple story behind the game and story book design is very appropriate for children. The violence is limited and safe for players of all ages. While the presentation is cutesy, the gameplay can be enjoyed by all. Game contains steam trading cards (5) and achievements (12). This is a title which can be completed to 100% achievements in a relatively short amount of time. It provides for an enjoyable experience, which feels introductory for an upcoming sequel. If you are looking for a simple, fun puzzle platformer with beautiful, cutesy art and basic difficulty, look no further than this title.\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1423968688, "timestamp_updated": 1433530302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518199741840362549", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14446014": {"recommendationid": "14446014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002089996", "num_games_owned": 1344, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1423829109}, "language": "english", "review": "Check out the full review at http://www.tegangibby.com/?p=84.\n\nIt's an unpolished puzzle platformer with lots of issues, specifically the dire lack of content, but it's pretty fun.

The platforming consists of making simple jumps with the meat of it being positioning platforms to progress to either the next section of a level (there are only 6 levels in all) or for a side area.\n\nThe premise of each level is to either reach the end or collect 100 crystals before the end to unlock a side story. Crystals are obtained from enemies or smashing statues. Enemies range from melee, range, and magic and come in different levels themselves: minion, veteran, boss (not official names). With the simple combat it means for some groups you'll have to employ strategy to defeat a group at times as you cannot replenish lost life in a level and later groups can mob you to death if you just rush in blindly.\n\nIt's a quirky fun game but once you full clear the six levels there isn't much reason to go back to it, still I had a lot of fun with the game and can recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1423584850, "timestamp_updated": 1423584850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488201797008514404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14413844": {"recommendationid": "14413844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057787296", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1514129097}, "language": "english", "review": "There isn't a lot of complexity to this short yet simple indie action puzzle platformer and yet, it has still managed to enthrall me as I progressed from level to level, puzzle to puzzle.\n\nForward to the Sky is a very charming third person adventure game where you control a princess (whose design is very reminiscent of Saber Lily's from Fate/Unlimited Codes) as you attempt to scale the floating sky tower and confront the evil witch, or so it goes. \n\nEach level features a different game mechanic that a player has to use in order to solve the puzzles and move on as well as find secret areas that will allow you to collect all 100 crystals in that level. While the puzzles may not be overly complex, they are hard enough that gives you that 'Aha!' moment once you solve them and yet are forgiving enough that I don't think anyone will ever feel frustrated with any of them. In that sense, to anyone who has played a Zelda game, Forward to the Sky is pretty similar in regards to its puzzles.\n\nWhile the voice acting may seem a bit lackluster and the main menu may be a bit cryptic, it more than makes up for it with the aforementioned puzzles, satisfying gameplay, the simple yet adorable art style reminiscent once again to old Zelda games, serene music, responsive controls and its fairy tale charm.\n\nWith all that said, would I recommend this game?

Graphically the game is sound, and the music does a good job of propelling the atmosphere and the momentum through the story. The game is based around climbing a tower, and there are only six levels to the tower, making the total game time between 1 1/2 and 3 hours. As you ascend the tower, you collect crystals on each level that drop from killing monsters or solving a puzzle.  \n\n\tThe gameplay is simplistic, and what combat there is, is not the selling\npoint of this game.  You are given the option to kill all the enemies, or bypass them, if that is not your thing.  You can make your own path if you wish\nto.  I feel that the story was overdone, and a lot of it is unnecessary filler.  \nWhen the dialogue happens, the text takes up a large portion of the screen and limits your view.  That coupled with  all the extra story got to be annoying.  \n\n\tWhat makes this story interesting is the level design.  Each level offers\nnew, interesting mechanics, making each level unique and keeping the player\ninvolved.  It keeps the gameplay fresh.  The level design offers freedom, with an  open feel that allows the player to bypass parts of the level if they choose.  \n\n\tOverall, the combat is sufficient, there is a large variety of puzzles and\nlevel design mechanics that adds to the possibility of replay, and I never felt\nas if the time I put into the game wasted my time.  It respected me as a player, and I enjoyed my time in it.  I would have liked to see more levels, but overall this was an enjoyable adventure.  \n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho", "timestamp_created": 1423448898, "timestamp_updated": 1423448898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507121145725250244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14395125": {"recommendationid": "14395125", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967093184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 102, "last_played": 1423430046}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and simple.

Don't worry too much about falling though cause you will be respawned and flown back in to someplace nearish to where you fell.  \n   I honestly think that this game would have been more fun if it was a little more old school and sent you back to the start when you fall off the world. That said...\n   Most of the puzzles are pretty striaght forward to solve. The more annoying ones are the timed jump \"puzzles\" but they are easily overcome since the game restarts you near to where you failed, or has a route you can take to retry it again and again till you get it right.\n\nSummary:\n   Tagging this game as an RPG is WAY off imo. For starters, there is no character development or anything of that nature.  It's a pure 3D platformer in an anime style.

Beautiful graphics and detail. 9/10 would buy again.\n\nI first purchased the game because the cuteness got me. I was not disappointed. It was quite adorable with a sweet storyline that you uncover as you go. While it is a bit short, it isn't half bad compared to other indie games out there. Especially since it is (i think) the company's first game. But, lets get to the niddy-griddy.\n\nPros:\nIt was fairly easy to dive into, you don't have to deal with a tutorial. The graphics are quite beautiful and interesting. The story was good, if not a bit obvious to me. However, it is the characters that make the story, not the story itself. Voice acting was pretty good as well.\n\nNeutral Statements:\nThe main menu was a bit odd, since it didn't say what each thing was and was only an Icon. But that isn't anything major. (The menu itself was good looking too) There wasn't much combat, and most of it was easy once you got the controls down. The puzzles are relatively easy if you think about them for a few minutes, but as a game that can easily be rated E, thats to be expected. \n\nCons:\nIt was short. Took me roughly 1.5 hours to complete. (But, for $8, i feel i got my moneys worth) There is a lack of replayability, as once you complete it nothing really changes from each playthrough, unless you miss crystals going through the levels. (but then again, almost every game has almost 0% replayability for me anyway, lol) The \"flying\" stuff is kind of wonky. It can be hard to use if you aren't prepared.\n\nHonestly, i'm excited to see where they go from here and look forward to the company's future games.

It's very minimal.\n\nThe game contains 6 levels/chapters, in each of which a new, unique mechanic is introduced, which I like.  The dialogue is sometimes funny but overall very naively written, what makes it obvious that the game was targeted at children.

While the music isn't very memorable it does it's job and suits the atmoesphere of the game. The voice acting on the other hand will be hit or miss for some. As while it is by no means awful it's certaintly nothing to write home about. At the very least it isn't as bad as some anime dubs I have seen. \n\nOverall the game is an enjoyable time but some consideration should be put into whether it's worth the $8 considering it's fairly short length and fairly minimal replay value. As well as it's fairly easy difficulty, which a child could beat. This may be a good or bad point for you.\n\nI would recommend buying this game on sale, but if you're craving a light-hearted anime game then you certainly can't go wrong with this one.\n\nHere's a link to my review: http://youtu.be/DXz6CknBx9U", "timestamp_created": 1422926551, "timestamp_updated": 1422984043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573793411254882813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14299656": {"recommendationid": "14299656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016432008", "num_games_owned": 493, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 85, "last_played": 1422902116}, "language": "english", "review": "A great fun little platformer that looks great and has a lovely story any one saying it\u00b4s a bad game needs to get there brain chekced.", "timestamp_created": 1422902217, "timestamp_updated": 1422902217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491036385297775269", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14295939": {"recommendationid": "14295939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062791060", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1422965687}, "language": "english", "review": "-------------- I LOVE ANIMETION GAME ----------------------------------------\n\nthis is the best game (Seriously??)\n-short gameplay (6 chapter 6 Stage 6 level WTF)\n-best story\n-good character\n-3D view so lag.....\n***it so good (Seriously??)\n\nYou know what i mean??\nthank for porting this game thank....", "timestamp_created": 1422884965, "timestamp_updated": 1422884965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14292477": {"recommendationid": "14292477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025904178", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1422857647}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are looking for a very astetically pleasing, nostagic throwback to the golden age of platformers, minus the frustration.

Leaning toward \"Yes\" because it is a pretty charming and enjoyable experience. \n\nThe two main flaws are the length and simplicity. I 100% completed this in just under 2 hours and I goofed off a bit at some parts. The game is also very simplistic. The combat is basic 3D swordplay like something out of Ocarina of Time but without any of Link's gadgets. There aren't many enemies, though, so the lack of complex combat isn't a huge deal, IMO. The levels are like 20% fighting and 80% puzzling/platforming. \n\nThe story and voice acting are pretty amateurish but at the same time they're kind of charming so, again, not a huge deal for me but my finding them charming is subjective so I wouldn't fault anyone for hating on them.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty basic but not braindead. In a few of the latter levels I found myself having to go back and forth to find things I missed or to figure out a puzzle. Each level adds like 1 new enemy type and 1 or 2 new puzzle/platform mechanics so it does stay fresh as you progress. There are some interesting mechanics you don't see very much in puzzle/platformers. \n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable 2 hours but for $8 some might have a problem with the length, the simplicity or both.

A couple of them you also have to actively look for in order to see. One in particular is if you come at a box on it's corners it gets pushed in both directions making it spazz out and go a lot more forward a lot faster then normal.\n\nSome of the enemies were extremely annoying and kind of OP. Particularly the guys that make the crystal barrier.It's not hard to get down what you have to do against them, you have to totally focus on them before any one else. Otherwise you'll waste a lot of time or actually end up dieing, which almost nothing else in the game will kill you except them.\n\nThe mechanics weren't quite that smooth. The boulder rolling and the low-gravity sequences were very hard to control at times. (Though thankfully it wasn't so god-aweful that it caused me to die.)\n\nI was expecting another level to put everything I learned through the rest of the game to the test. Instead, I got level 5 that introduced some new things then straight to the ending boss battle that used nothing from the rest of the game.\n\nFinally, I'd love to see combinations between the LMB and RMB attacks and the combat to be more interesting.

Forward to the Sky is a charming, but short, puzzle action-adventure that's definitely worth the small price tag, especially if you have fond memories of older-school Playstation and Dreamcast action-adventure titles (^-^)\n--\nI've just pulled myself away from playing this after having played a bit of the 5th Chapter of the game. 5 of 6, so that's a little bit of a bummer. But it's a bummer simply because the game is fun, well-made and good-looking, and I totally would love to play more of it. On the flipside, this is one title that definitely won't be cloggin up your Steam backlog; this is a title that you will actually finish :) \n\nSo it's short; that's not necessarily a bad thing. What matters is if it's good, and Forward to the Sky certainly is. As a rookie effort from a small studio, this is a very well made game. They do a lot with a little, and despite only having 6 chapters, every chapter introduces new mechanics that mix up the style of gameplay. One brings in elevators and fan-platforms (jump on the blades), another will bring wind that pushes you around and \"air gates\" for you to ride in, the next will bring in crystal prisms that shoot lasers around to activate hidden platforms and stairs, etc. These things do a great job of changing the platforming gameplay & puzzles from Chapter-to-Chapter.  \n\nThey also do a good job with the limited art assets, changing the time of day/skybox/lighting to make the Tower levels look... well as different as you can, even though the assets are pretty much identical throughout. It's just amazing what a change of lighting can do. It's not as varied as a bigger production, but for what it is, it's very smart and well-done. \n\nThe combat is the most simple part of the game. It's not bad; it's almost like a 3D Secret of Mana or classic Zelda title. You have a simple combo, and then a charge attack (which you can also combo). The depth comes from handling the different types of enemies, which they do manage to mix up as you proceed to the game. So there's enough enemy variety here to make the encounters feel fresh Chapter-to-Chapter. They have guys that fire arrows, shielded foes that use charge attacks, sorcerers that can freeze you in ice if you get too close with a wave of their wand, etc. They introduce a new unit every Chapter, and fighting different combinations of them is engaging. There's definitely a little bit of strategy here; trying to pull some guys away so you can take them out before projectile-users start firing on you from across the map, or rushing in and trying to kill the archers before they become a nuisance... and how best to take on a bigger enemy one-on-one; can you get a combo in before they wreck you, or should you try to get their rhythm down, and doing hit-and-run tactics instead? That sort of things. It's old-school, and it does it's job. It's engaging enough without getting monotonous. Besides, combat is there but it's not really the focus; it takes a back seat to the puzzle-platforming. \n\nThe worst part of the game (which isn't that bad overall) does affect the platforming though, which is a tad floaty. The physics though, they're not that much of a problem - a floaty jump is fun and forgiving in most cases, and that rings true here. What's awkward is that jumping will KEEP YOU jumping in that direction until you change direction in mid-air. So for a game with some precision jumps (especially in the Second Chapter with the fan-platforms), you end up doing this silly move where, to land your jump accurately, you pass over your platform and then start quickly moving in a tiny circle in mid-air so as not to overshoot as you wait a beat for your fall to actually drop you on your destination. It's never really putting you in serious risk (if you DO fall from the Tower, the Princess will summon her Hot Air Balloon to catch her and plop her close by to where you fell), it's just a little less polished than you'd hope for.\n\nPlus, oddly enough, while the lighting is good overall, there is no shadow underneath the character. The oldest-school trick in the 3D gaming book to help with this sort of thing. Weird. \n\nBeyond that though, I honestly have no issues with the game. I mean, it's fun. It looks good. It sounds good. It's got a simple, cute story (with simple, cute voice acting). And it's a really well designed, very small production that successfully hearkens back to the age of really charming Japanese action games. It's like someone took the design principles for titles like Threads of Fate, Tenerezza, Gurumin, Dual Hearts, Dawn of Mana, Brave Fencer Musashi, even Dark Cloud and decided to make a new game like that with modern tech. Which is awesome! It's just short and doesn't feel quite as good as you'd like it to. \n\nBut make no mistake about it, I'm definitely recommending it! Plus, $7 is not that much for a fun experience and to support a promising developer, especially if you have anything in your Steam Wallet to knock that down even further. It could be $6, $5 or even lower for you. So don't let the length dissuade you if you enjoy titles like those I just listed. This game will definitely entertain you and charm your socks off, just like games used to do (^-^)\n\nHighly recommended. Very fun.

The focus on less levels allows them to keep a theme and style in each one, but also retain an overall consistency that flows together very well.\n...\nYou can read the rest of the review at: http://techraptor.net/content/princess-tale-forward-sky-review", "timestamp_created": 1422627229, "timestamp_updated": 1422660843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558350265026092529", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14237421": {"recommendationid": "14237421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068250792", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1423558923}, "language": "english", "review": "Seibah Simulator 2015\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1422607619, "timestamp_updated": 1422607619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 41, "weighted_vote_score": "0.374495714902877808", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14237149": {"recommendationid": "14237149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155870927", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1452904965}, "language": "english", "review": "+\nGood graphics and graphics options\nRebindable keys and buttons\nRelaxing atmospheric music\nInteresting puzzles\n\n+/-\nDecent platforming\nMildly interesting story\n\n-\nShort (1.5-2 hours to complete and about 2.5-3 hours for all achievements)\nCombat is more of an afterthought (very hard to avoid getting damaged by enemies)\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10 (Would like to see more levels and achievements considering the cost of the game)", "timestamp_created": 1422605225, "timestamp_updated": 1422605225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66767418384552002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14235965": {"recommendationid": "14235965", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960555817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1422595349}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed Forward to the Sky.  It isn't a long game, took me about 2 hours to 100%.  The graphics are nice and the atmosphere changes as you progress through the tower.  It isn't the hardest game around by a long shot, but a few of the puzzles took some skill and creative problem solving.  \n\nThe story was simple, but nicely presented in a storybook fashion.  The voice acting was a great touch, and they didnt over-do it with the dialogue, just enough to give you the flavor of what's going on.  The mechanics seemed a little clunky at first, but really aren't.  They have a unique feel, and once you understand them, make total sense.  Each of the six levels presented a different type of puzzle mechanic and each felt distinct and presented different challenges.  The progression of the mechanics throughout the level showed a good understanding of design and scaffolding.\n\nI encountered no bugs throughout the game and it ran beautifully on highest settings on my 5 year old PC.  You can tell this game was a labor of love.  I thought it was very enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1422595993, "timestamp_updated": 1422595993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639234364032745361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14234988": {"recommendationid": "14234988", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977080684", "num_games_owned": 4082, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 109, "last_played": 1422737371}, "language": "english", "review": "I would recommend this game for the following reasons:\n\n1. The graphics are pretty nice. The game hovers around 60 FPS at 1080p. It is vibrant and colorful. The main characters looks great and animates well. Enemy animation, however, isn't as smooth as I would like. I liked the grand scale of some of the levels which are floating in the sky and have you traversing higher up as you progress. You can see parts of the tower floating in the background. They are detailed enough that it creates a cool 3D effect. It's cool to start at the bottom and work your way up only to look all the way down and say, \"hey, I was just there.\" Unfortunately, much of the first levels look similar. I haven't seen the later levels yet, though. \n\n2. The gameplay is fun and pretty unique for PC. It is an adventure game where you play as a princess trying to discover the mysteries of a massive tower. There are six levels and the increase in complexity and scale as you progress. There doesn't seem to be any power-ups or collectables other than crystals that you are required to find in each level. Crystals are gotten from beating enemies and breaking statues. They can be cleverly hidden so finding all the crystals is a challenge. Enemies don't vary much and they're pretty easy to dispatch. The real star of the show is the level layout, puzzles and traps that you must get through. The puzzles are what you'd expect from this type of game (move boxes to jump higher, throw switches to move platforms) but they fit well with the whole massive tower-floating-in-the-sky theme. The traps can pose a bigger challenge and I was supprised to find that I just barely made it out of the first level alive because of all the traps. \n\n3. The price is right. This isn't a big game, but it's a nice diversion and it's something different than what we are used to on PC. \n\n4. Trying to 100% each level is a fun achievement. I don't know if it will make a difference in the game or ending, but finding all the crystals is a nice challenge. \n\nSome other things: this game works with a controller (although I noticed the controls were a little spotty and unresponsive a few times). There's not much music variety in this game and sometimes sound effects are missing, but there is voice acting. The voice acting is what you'd expect from the genre (cute little girl voices). \n\nI would recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of the genre (Japanese style adventure/action games). It is a budget title but it is very playable and enjoyable at a reasonable price.", "timestamp_created": 1422589467, "timestamp_updated": 1422591910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692507088184356689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14234972": {"recommendationid": "14234972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037386251", "num_games_owned": 465, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1422589587}, "language": "english", "review": "Forward to the Sky is a very simple game. The controls are easy to understand. Left and Right mouse buttons to attack, keyboard for movement (You can use a controller as well). \n\nCombat: Combat in this game has no depth. All you are going to be doing is spam clicking left or right mouse (doesn't really matter which) until the enemies are defeated. There is also no blocking function. The only \"defense\" you get is a back flip which you will never use. \n\nPuzzles: All of the puzzles in the game are very simple, with exception to level 4's main puzzle. It took me a minute or so to finally realize how to complete it, which is a good thing. The rest of the puzzles focus on switches and platforming that anyone can complete with ease.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack in this game is nice to listen to, and fits the Fighting/Platforming/Puzzle gameplay the game has to offer (with exception to the final battle).\n\nVoice acting: Not best, but it's ok. (The main character sounds cute, so that's something).\n\nOverall, the game is something you would beat in one sitting, it consists of 6 levels, all which take around 20 minutes to complete MAX. I do recommend this game, and it would be a good game for casual players and some hardcore gamers. If I had to rate the game, I would give it a solid 7/10. The game is surely there, just not put to it's full potential.", "timestamp_created": 1422589367, "timestamp_updated": 1658507381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 203, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87673485279083252", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 577, "total_negative": 211, "total_reviews": 788}, "cursors": {"AoJ4reK7nMsCfNWmNg==": "Thu Nov 23 15:38:07 2023"}}
