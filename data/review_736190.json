While the game is humorous and entertaining, it also offers deep insights into the intricacies of Chinese culture, educational systems, and familial expectations.\n\n---\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\n[b]Mechanics[/b]\n\nIn \"Chinese Parents,\" you start as a newborn and navigate your way through various stages of life, including infancy, childhood, adolescence, and eventually adulthood. Your primary goal is to balance academics, social life, and family expectations. The game employs a turn-based system, where each turn represents a week in the life of the protagonist. \n\n[b]Skill Trees and Activities[/b]\n\nYou have various 'stats' like Intelligence, Creativity, and Emotional Intelligence, which can be improved by participating in activities or attending classes. There's also a unique \"Face\" system, representing your family's social standing, which adds an interesting dynamic to the game.\n\n[b]Mini-Games[/b]\n\nThe game also incorporates mini-games, like tests and quizzes, to break the monotony. These are often challenging but rewarding, allowing you to gain extra points and unlock achievements.\n\n[b]Choices and Endings[/b]\n\nYour choices significantly affect the outcome of the game. You could end up as a successful entrepreneur, a devoted family person, or even a dropout, based on the decisions you make.\n\n---\n\n[b]Graphics and Sound[/b]\n\nThe game uses simple 2D graphics that are charming and easy on the eyes. The soundtrack complements the overall feel of the game, adding depth to the emotional moments.\n\n---\n\n[b]Cultural Insights[/b]\n\n[i]One of the most commendable aspects of \"Chinese Parents\" is its authentic representation of Chinese culture.

If you like child-raising sim games in the vein of Princess Maker, Growing Up, and Long Live the Queen and can look past the translation quality, I'd recommend this.

There are so many different jobs and skills to choose from and perfect. I have spent days trying to perfect one career through each generation. The game time one can get from this game is exponential, and each playthrough is rewarding as you still gain stat bonuses even when the life turned out worse than your last one.\n\nThere are also many future spouses for your children. It's a bit weird that the date candidates have the same names as past generations, but I guess it does help when making dating guides. \n\nI did find an issue with parent expectations. Sometimes they would ask you to learn skills that you don't have available. During one of my playthroughs, the parents wanted their child to learn the \"Modeling\" skill. I looked for guides on how to get the \"Modeling\" skill but the only one I could find was under performing arts for male children. At the time, I was playing as a female child. I checked if I had learned \"Scientific Modelling\" to see if it was shortened, but I had already learned that skill. Besides this issue, it may be helpful to give a brief description of how to earn the skill that the parents want their child to learn. \n\nOther than that issue, I think this game is very easy to get the hang of and addicting once you do.

Fun and clever, and does just enough to color your character's life while letting you imagine the rest. I personally like that in a game. The two things I would like are 1. An option to date same-gender characters. I felt pretty unenthused when I the option to make friends and date opened up, 'cause I was looking at a whole load of girls. 2. A character customization system would be nice- although I understand how that would be hard to integrate into this game. I haven't played very much so far, but the feeling I get is that you might ruin the game for yourself if you play generation after generation without stopping. It's a game experience, and you should only play it when you feel like having that experience- i.e., there isn't that much variety.\nEdit: Hey Hey Hey, they made some cool improvements!\nThey added a system where you can determine what kind of parent you're going to be to your child before the next round starts, which I LOVE. It's such a good fix to the problem of feeling like you have no control over what your character does once their round is over. Major kudos. They also made a bunch of simple but important quality-of-life improvements, like giving you a way to increase your intimacy with a character each round without wasting a ton of energy on it. There's still some stuff that needs updating, but it's cool to see a game that seems to earnestly want to incorporate user feedback.\nI still wanna be gay though. I'm not too concerned with hard realism here. I like romancing boys in real life. I wanna do it in my games.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1630906718, "timestamp_updated": 1671021024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695121824741363525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98841973": {"recommendationid": "98841973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930838368", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31326, "last_played": 1671419671}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game", "timestamp_created": 1630863252, "timestamp_updated": 1630863252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98838786": {"recommendationid": "98838786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198729088764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1631280844}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a good game, that say a chinese stoey.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1630859266, "timestamp_updated": 1630859266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98764834": {"recommendationid": "98764834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198958984147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 701, "last_played": 1676078922}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it.", "timestamp_created": 1630754502, "timestamp_updated": 1630754502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98620769": {"recommendationid": "98620769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128607679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1186, "last_played": 1630906614}, "language": "english", "review": "\u6211\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u4e86\uff01\u6b27\u514b\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1630511677, "timestamp_updated": 1630511677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98494802": {"recommendationid": "98494802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140747536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1653458261}, "language": "english", "review": "I was a great kid,\nbut not good enough.\nThen I had children\nand they were better than me when I was a kid\nbut not good enough.\n\n10/10 life sim.", "timestamp_created": 1630311466, "timestamp_updated": 1630311476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98378736": {"recommendationid": "98378736", "author": {"steamid": "76561199194893748", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 38347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 951, "last_played": 1674420289}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple idea executed well.

For example the screen that appears in the beginning to inform you of news is currently very badly written. To the level that appears like someone just put everything into google translator and hoped for the best.\n- I still have not understood how to do the chinese new year event. It always goes badly no matter what I do. No idea whether I am just doing something wrong or it just does not work. Anyway, that is annoying, wish I could skip that. Alas, that is not possible.\n- Some concepts make no sense in other cultures. The reduction/adding of points to for example imagination due to an event often is very strange. I assume that many of them make more sense in China than in other cultures. Some of the things that would (apparently) negatively affect a Chinese child, would positively affect someone from other cultures. Its disappointing that there is no way for the player to find out, why they gained the bonus, so why it would decrease the charm for example. Might be obvious to the developers, but certainly not to every player. Then again, maybe I am taking the game too seriously. *shrug*\n\nOverall a good game that is fun to play when you are bored and want to focus on something relatively light for a while.

There's a child, and you schedule activities to develop that child's characteristics (IQ, EQ, Constitution, Memory, Imagination, Charm and Face).  This gives you currency to play a minesweeper-like puzzle, which in turn gives you currency to buy new skills to schedule.  Rinse, lather, repeat.\n\nThe gimmick behind the game is that, after passing the final high school exam, the game loops and you start with a new kid who gets passive stat boosts based on your success.  The boost is fairly modest and is mainly determined by your career path and whether you married your high school sweetheart.  But, after playing through a few generations, the stacking gains traction and skills become easier to purchase sooner, leading to a better career later.  Just like real life.\n\nPros would be the simplicity (which allows you to grind out massive hours while sustaining the erosion speed of your sanity) and dialogue charm.  The lukewarm wit worked pretty well at the beginning, if I remember.  I remember being told by my mother that she regretted having me after scheduling one-too-many trips to Europe.  There are some typos and silly stuff.  I also enjoyed the jokes I told myself.  Those were good.\n\nCons would be the dialogue.  It never changes.  Ever!  Never ever.  And you can't skip it.  You just sit there and click and click and click and click and click and click and click and click.  You stop knowing who you are or what your reason for living is as you browse through menus or the spreadsheets you made outside of the game to ensure your taking the most efficient path to achievement completion.  You see, every single skill, that is, Every.  Single.  Skill. you acquire contains a third type of passive called a \"trait\" that is only unlocked through scheduled study, based on a dice roll dependent on that trait's rarity.  The final achievement of the game is to collect 100% of them.  It took me 24 generations and over 90 hours to get it, with each generation taking between 3 to 4 hours to complete.  After about 5 generations, the game loses all charm.  After 15, you speak only in tribal grunts.  This is Edge of Tomorrow: Scholastic Edition.\n\nWould I recommend this game?  Yes.

So this is my go to game. I'm currently working on a guide/100%ing the game. I will do my best to explain this game because at a glance I'm sure it looks different than other life sims. This game is about continuity. The more you play the better the outcomes in the next generations of life. In one save you can have a lifeline of 50 generations. It takes me around 8 hours to get through one generation. You inherit the stats of your previous life and if you manage to snag a spouse/partner you get their stats to add as well. Each job/occupation has it's own unique storyline and each spouse you can take on has their own unique story line. You have 5 primary stats that you need to maintain in order to get good grades and earn face to unlock additional traits/rewards while simultaneously chasing your own dream job. You also have a cute little bubble pop mini game before the end of every day to increase your stats each color signifying another stat.\n\nHonestly, if you're looking for a good stat simulator with unique stories to chase after in each generation and a game where choices matter to develop your child - this is a good game with a lot of content for just $9.99 USD.

There are quite a few characters you can meet through skills that you learn, and they all have a bit of a story with them- which is very nice and gives more depth to the world.\n\nI would DEFINITELY say to first play with the tutorial to get a basic understanding of what everything does and how to play- once you complete one generation, you should be pretty good with understanding the rest.\n\nIt's pretty relaxing and you can definitely find yourself getting lost in playing it- I know that I have \ud83d\ude05 \n\nThe name you choose as your save is the last name of your family, so don't make anything silly or weird if that's not something you want your characters being called!\n\nI 100% recommend this game, and hope that more games are created like this- also looking forward to any possible updates that add some new skills or dateable characters, or maybe even a second game! \ud83e\udd1e\n\n-----------\nHere are some tips to start out with: \ud83d\udc9e\n\nTime Management, Skills, Grades, and Fun: \ud83e\udded\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcda\nYou dont need to study the subjects to get good grades, instead use your time slots to focus on which skill you want to be the best, on things that will give you traits, or what is needed for your goal career. Just make sure to learn the basics for all main subjects to keep a decent grade (at least a B, but an A is the one you'd want most). Make sure to have some fun activities between these- some can build your skills, can give traits, and some other great perks. You want to keep your parents happy, and keep yourself happy as well- it's all a balancing act, but pretty simple to find the rhythm of and keep with it. (Buying things from the top row of the shop can help with both mood and making parents happy, but they are limited to only 1-3 a day)\n\nDating: \ud83d\udc96\nIf your character is boy, it would be better not to focus on trying to date as it is much harder and takes up more of your energy than it does as a girl- if your character is a girl, just date enough to get the option to have them as an after school buddy, it will gain you relationship points with them, without needing to use your energy.\n\nTraits: \ud83e\uddec\nTrying to get as many traits as possible (by repeating the same actions) is the best way to go about gaining better skills for the next generation, the game gets much easier as you build up your families skills. You get a daily boost from traits, though this boost doesn't increase every time you get the same trait- it only gives it once (but lasts forever).

It's brimming with soul, and remarkably addictive. Considering its simple presentation and use of familiar concepts, it's amazing what they've done to create an immersive and interesting simulator, and it still manages to challenge with its puzzle-esque gameplay. \n\nThe best part of this game is the atmosphere. It really encapsulates what it feels like to be growing up, with creative and sympathetic events and an excellent soundtrack. Without having to do much, it really makes you feel like a kid again, and you become invested in your stats and career goals. Likewise, there's a lot of good-natured humour about parental expectations, intergenerational habits, and childhood culture. Aside from that, the gameplay is stimulating and well-rewards one's desire for a feedback loop between unlocking desirable skills, and performing well on its \"mental map\" puzzles. Through all this, you're curious what kind of character you'll develop, what sort of romances they might have, and hoping that they'll receive beneficial traits from an effective schedule. \n\nMy only major problem with the game is in its art design--it's all over the place. All the characters look like they were drawn by different people, and though it's sometimes cute and endearing, it clashes and makes the game come off as a cheaper experience. This is apparent even on the Steam art, as you can see the stark comparison between almost racist depictions of an Asian family contrasted with anime-styled art. I think they chose to keep some of these elements from an earlier build, as the facial expressions or doodles are almost iconic, even when they're of notoriously bad quality. \n\nI think Chinese Parents would appeal to most any type of gamer, as it's strongly reminiscent of mobile experiences; but it's a lot more than meets the eye.", "timestamp_created": 1601262097, "timestamp_updated": 1601262097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76644697": {"recommendationid": "76644697", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023789252", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1485, "last_played": 1601109446}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate this game. We hate this game.\n\nThe gameplay on its own is truly lame. In all fairness, I would never play this game. However, there is something about being Chinese and wanting to please your parents (even if they are fake AIs made by a sadistic team of Chinese game developers) which motivates you to want to do better in your virtual exams. Since my boyfriend and I can never please our parents in real life, we have resorted to trying to please the virtual parents in this game. We thought that being Chinese meant that for sure we would be able to outplay the game! WRONG! Real or virtual Chinese parents, as a child, you will be their greatest disappointment. T________T I told a friend and he retorted, \"I don't want to be Chinese. It sounds sad.\"\n\nThis sad and depressing reality is probably the only reason this game is selling. The worst part of all this is how close to reality the game is. In a nutshell, this is exactly what and how it is to be Chinese. If you want to simulate how to be a disappointment to your parents even if you scored 740 on your national exam and ended up as a successful doctor, this would be your best bet. Just pay $11.50 to realise that dream! Or... if you're Chinese, save the $11.50, it's free, just ask your parents to recount tales of your life.

It's incredibly addicting and has one of the best core gameplay loops I've seen in a while.\n\nThe premise is this: You're a child raised by Chinese parents who push you to succeed. You choose how to allocate your time from birth until the \"Gaokao\" a national examination you take at the end of HS (think SAT, but more serious). Do well, and you set the next generation up for success. Do poorly, and your child will struggle. You can play generation after generation endlessly, and much of what you earn in previous generations stacks with successive ones.\n\nThat mechanic is fun and rewarding. While each generation's playthrough doesn't really change, working towards the ultimate generation is enjoyable and keeps me engaged with the game.\n\nThere are a few things that I wish this game did better. It could use some QoL improvements, like the option to skip dialogue or events that you've already seen before. Some of the art could use an overhaul so it's all on the same level. It would also be nice if your previous choices contributed a bit more flavor to later generations: Marrying one of your classmates should lead to different dialogue when they're a parent, instead of just a new sprite and minor stat boosts.\n\nBut for the price, this is a great game.

The game lets you create your own Chinese family tree and you can go on for generations. This might sound very repetitive and boring, which it might be in the beginning, but I assure you it will get better. Not that the game gives you more stuff to play with, because it is basically the same procedure for each generation, but you inherit your parent's \"stats\". The stats are: IQ, EQ, Constitution, Imagination and Memory. When you get a child it will inherit some stats based on your career and personal progression. Now lets say your first character becomes an athlete. It will gain a boost to constitution (how much constitution you gain after each day) and some other stats based on how you lived your life. This means that your choices will effect your child's stats. Might not sound very fun, but bear with me. I once had a character whom I tried to make an athlete, but it didn't end very well. He became an athlete, just not a very successful one. This was because he had low constitution gain because of his parents lives, which means that it costs more to buy constitution based skills, and because of this you have less money to buy skills that help with your tests (which is bad) and you might not get all the skills before the game ends. However I decided to make his daughter become an athlete as well, because even though he wasn't very successful, I had still gained that constitution boost. She became a Olympic level athlete and was very successful. It was just very satisfying to see how it all came together. The same thing happened to a mathematician i made once. He wasn't very successful, but his daughter became a \"Reincarnation of Gauss\" and became one of the top mathematicians in the world. This will lead to a bunch of questions in your head like: \"what if i focus just on IQ and all generations forward become super smart?\" This is the magic of the game. I invite and encourage all of you to give it a try! \n\nP.S Everything more than 10 generations becomes super easy, because depending on how you played (if you tried a bunch of different careers) you will get over +100 gain per day in every stat. This makes it easier to do everything, but in a way makes it more fun too, because you get to see your demon master mind walk around getting A on every test while still because world chess, badminton, football, spelling bee champion, which I find very funny, but it doesn't take anything away from the experience", "timestamp_created": 1597519880, "timestamp_updated": 1597519880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74192871": {"recommendationid": "74192871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280275927", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3526, "last_played": 1629912799}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun!

It's broken. No patch with fix is expected.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, yet, can't recommend it anymore. \n\nThe game has got at least two game-breaking bugs after introducing the latest patch. The creators promised to take care of them at the beginning of 2020, but then coronavirus appeared. The studio is from China so, because of the quarantine, had to hold off for some time, which was understandable. Yet, it is the end of June when I'm writing this comment and the forum is filled with bug reports with no responses from the studio. It seems they have abandoned the project and the community. Gamers had to give themselves some tips to overcome the problem, but it's just a temporary solution, because there's no official fix.\n\nIt's a shame because this game was really good.

It was fun for the first play-through, but only for that first play-through, because nothing new happens, each play-through is identical so it becomes quite repetitive very quickly, and the game is designed that way(by way of playing through new generations) but fails to keep it entertaining by not adding anything new except for the chance of maybe getting to play a different gender this time, and slight stat improvements from generation to generation, in terms of content it's the exact same thing though.\n\nIn the end for me, an hour or so before I quit and uninstalled it, it had turned into an absolutely brainless, mind-numbing clicker, I was just spam-clicking to go through dialog and cut-scenes and just clicking on a little bit of every subject because that's what you need to do to get a decent exam result, then repeat every 5 minutes, over and over. My eyes weren't even focused on the game anymore.\n\nAlso, considering the points above I find it very weird, almost absurd that you can't skip the seemingly endless amounts of identical dialog and cut-scenes after the first play-through, and why does it keep showing me tips meant for the first time you play-through it in all my new games, even when I explicitly select the 'Disable tutorials' option?\nNot being able to skip that stuff when you've already seen it several times strongly adds to the tedium, it acts as if each time you play, you're playing for the first time... It just doesn't make any sense honestly.\n\nYou're given the illusion that you can go down very specific professions and only collect 1 or 2 certain stats that you need to go deep into that profession or skill-set by way of giving you a career goal, but in the end you have to get all stats, otherwise you'll constantly fail quests/tasks, you'll get horrible tests results, etc. The game acts as if you do not constantly practice math you'll just end up not even knowing what math is anymore after a week. If you could actually deeply pursue a certain line of skill or profession(refer to: The Sims) it could be a pretty fun game: each play through you can pursue something different and have a totally different experience with new, unique events happening based on what you're pursuing to be good at, but that's not how the game works. It is technically possible if you're okay with getting an F on every single exam and basically failing the game every time you play, but no unique events or things occurs anyway, again... it is the exact same thing over and over.\n\nI do not see the value in it after 2 play-throughs max. If it cliques with you, that's good for you(and kinda strange that you enjoy tedium), but it doesn't for me, for me it's like re-watching the same TV-show or movie over and over and over instantly after the last watch-through. Sometimes, every few episodes or scenes you notice something you didn't last time, just some minute detail that doesn't really matter, but other than that it's the exact same thing.\n\nThe game is entirely targeted towards a Chinese audience, if you're not Chinese your chances of enjoying this game is overwhelmingly reduced, that's how it comes off to me at least. (I've even seen reviews from Chinese people saying that the tedium isn't strong enough... saying that this game doesn't make you repeat the same tasks enough, it needs more repetition)\n\nOther dumb things:\n\nWhy is the max name length 7 characters?\n\nThe English translation is horrible(and incomplete, random things still shows up in Chinese). Considering the huge amounts of sales this game has had I think the developer can quite comfortably afford paying for a proper translation.\n\n\n[h1]Curator page[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/29162366/]my Curator page[/url].[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1592037018, "timestamp_updated": 1592451419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602335929870605469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70647254": {"recommendationid": "70647254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084668903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 836, "last_played": 1575533032}, "language": "english", "review": "poggers", "timestamp_created": 1591910444, "timestamp_updated": 1591910444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54813086986541748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70605907": {"recommendationid": "70605907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012329211", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6076, "last_played": 1655333620}, "language": "english", "review": "This is easily and surprisingly one of the best and most replayable life sims I've ever played. The flow into a \"new\" game is really cool and rewarding, and the huge diversity and depth of paths keeps me playing more. I've learned a lot about what it's like growing up in China; there are a lot of little things that are different, and the pressure (even just of the gameplay) is overwhelming, but I really appreciate the moments where I feel total understanding and empathy for the characters, even across the cultural divide. I never would've expected it, but this game has made me tear up on a couple of its paths.\n\nI would love more in-depth romance. I hope they spend some more time on that aspect of the game going forwards. I'm already thrilled with the huuuuge variety of endings and choices, but I'm happy to know that they're always working on more of that, too.\n\nI'm mostly writing this because I became interested in this game and did some research about it. I learned a lot about the indie game dev scene in China, and the challenges teams like this game's developers face. I'm really happy to know that this game has been so successful there, and I hope it paves the way for more like it.

There's an interesting concept somewhere in here, but it's buried beneath endless tedium. Dialog text you can't skip or speed up. Unskippable (and often irrelevant) cutscenes. Repetitive tutorials and tips--it's bizarre how a game that's meant to be played for multiple generations treats EACH generation like it's your first time playing. I don't think I've ever played a game that does this.\n\nI can forgive the awkward English because it's inevitable that things get lost in translation. That's fine. But does the art direction get lost in translation too? I say \"art direction\" rather loosely. Not because the art is good or bad--it's just all over the place. It's like they hired a different artist for each character. (And I take it back: some of the art *is* bad; some of these folks are downright ghoulish.)\n\nIf the game was more fun, I could forgive all of the above. \n\nBut it's my fault--I kept playing! Joke's on me. I guess I kept thinking there'd be more to the genetics/inheritance mechanics, or that lifestyle choices would have a more meaningful impact on how you grow and develop as a person. But as others have noted, 90% of the game comes down to a simple point-and-click mini-game. \n\nI don't think games should be free; developers work hard and should get paid for what they do.

I spent hours micromanaging and making sure I was best suited for that path, and at the end of the road I still wasn't sure. There's a lot of choices in this game, and no clear path, and that can be overwhelming very easily if you don't remember and try to stick to your goals. Especially with the pressures forced on you.\n\nAll in all, my parents wanted me to become a manager and I became a writer, and I did it by sacrificing all of my friends, working to give myself the small pleasures to let myself overwork without breaking, and never having any fun.\n\nI started my second game deciding to just meet expectations, and go a more lighthearted route. And, in the process, some of the criticisms my original character had. I found myself asking \"Where did you learn that kinda atittude?\" Only to realize, I taught her that attitude. I never gave her a break, and I pushed her to succeed by sacrificing everything.\n\nI feel like that's probably just her programmed response, but. It really gave me insight into how the mindset perpetuates itself, and as a real life writer I think I can use that in the future.\n\nIf you're looking for a reference on the feel to a Chinese character.

There are so many options and replayability is so amazing, that just wow.\n\nThere are so many different kind of mini-games, that you won't get bored, or you won't get only one thing.\n\nYou start as a child and get traits depending what you do for free time. In some sense, you probably become trait hunter soon. But you'll also decide what path you're gonna hunt with this character, while also keeping in mind to get your normal studies as high as possible.\n\nYou need to make sacrifices to get to your goal. And sometimes you do, and sometimes you don't. And once you don't, you get this bitter feeling -- but not in a way that you want to quit, quite the other way -- and you want to retry or learn way to reach the conclusion you'd want.\n\nIt's amazing game when it comes to relaxation and having it as a side, while also doing something else, such as watching tv series.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that this is game that's definitely not for everyone. When I showed it to few of my friends, they immediately found it boring, while I'm thrilled and tell them what's happened to X generation boy named Y.\n\nIt's also the fact that it's a bit cruel world, showing off the parts of the world where expectations are really huge. But still true, and sometimes necessary, I actually learned few cultural things from this game.\n\nAnyway, I might not do many reviews, but I felt that this one deserved one.

How well you do for previous characters impacts your current one, through genes, which will give you a stat boost per turn, the boost dependent on your previous characters' stats. Another example is that your character will get a certain amount of pocket money each turn depending on his/her parent's (your previous character's) job and how good s/he is at it.\n2. You can play as a girl or as a boy, with things changing in some areas depending on your sex. For example, if you're a boy, you will have a different interface for friends than if you were a girl, as well as different interactions. \n3. Has great replay value.

You play as a Chinese child growing up from infancy to graduating high school. Your cumulative choices add up to your score on the GaoKao, the SAT/ACT in China. Your score also determines which university you went to, whether you got the job of your dreams, and how much allowance your future child can earn. Then you get to (possibly) marry your high school sweetheart and play as your own child, from infancy to GaoKao, and on and on. Every play through becomes easier due to \"genes\" being passed down through each subsequent generation. You can use that boost to pursue different career paths, or to try to master one career path in particular. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes playing cumulative completionist games. Using a guide once you are 2 or 3 generations in is a must. Good luck finding all the careers and mastering the GaoKao.

The game starts them out simple and then makes them more complex as the child gets older. Some can be reasonable, some can be downright impossible to achieve. Sometimes you have your own idea of where you want to go with the kid, but the parents have a complete different vision. It makes for hard choices: appease your parents or be an individual.\n\nThe game allows some choice in raising skills, but there's too much RNG for my taste. At the start of every turn you have a board which allows you to improve your skills. The boards are very randomized with no way to pick which skills you will focus on. You just have to hope that you get what you want, which does not really reflect an individual's choice to improve. You get to set a \"schedule\" to figure out what skill you will focus on, but it seems like you really have to take a hit in some areas to improve in others. Some made little sense to me. The tests rely on random appearances of various colored icons to form chains to make a \"solution\" to a problem.

I checked it out because I think Chinese culture is very interesting and has been such a powerful force throughout the ages, and was very curious about this window into the mentality. Now of course it's just a game and certainly a bit silly, but I actually related a lot as a westerner both in similarities and differences; I feel I gained insight both into my own culture and that of others.\n\nGameplay wise, Chinese parents is fairly simple and laid back; it's certainly a casual game. I still enjoyed the almost minesweeper-like zen of the mind-map game, and the rather absurd but strangely relate-able face battles. It was probably most fun before I knew what the heck I was doing and was just picking things randomly because they sounded nice or seemed to offer some benefit. 5 generations later the powergaming is real and every move is optimized with no motion wasted.\n\nSurprisingly though this game was pretty evocative. As a new parent I found a lot of the tiny emotional beats in this game to be almost comically impactful, and it made me think a lot about the nature of my life path and our morally festering western culture. Certainly worth the handful of moneys I paid!\n\nGood job Devs!", "timestamp_created": 1570126385, "timestamp_updated": 1570126385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61804664134979248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55404497": {"recommendationid": "55404497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037289388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 802, "last_played": 1656939157}, "language": "english", "review": "When I saw this game I got some strong Princess Maker vibes. So I decided to give it a go. \n\n/rewarded by vibes\n\nI'm not Chinese, but I can understand the insane amount of competition and need to succeed being pressed on by your parents there. The face-off situations are clear examples of what parents go through in order to get some esteem or powerplay in their lives, simply by using their kids' progress. This is what this game stands for: to raise your kid in Chinese standards, though if I'm honest we all have those standards in some form and are all part of it.\n\nBut really, the game is fairly simple but fun as you have to level up stats for your kid (which is randomly a boy or girl) to get to a desired outcome. Focusing on every topic (math, science, sports, etc) is not advised, as we also know that in real life you should focus on one (or a few) things to get to a skillful or even master level. \n\nYou even have a shop ingame that allows access to skills or study material for your kid to get great in. \n\nOther than that you have a bit of an dating/friend system in the game, but it's very flat. It definitely adds something to the game, but still looks unpolished. \n\nIt would've been awesome if the game had any customization options in regards to yourself and/or children. The reason for this wish is that you have to play from one generation to the other. You can have an endless amount of generations but the playthroughs will all feel alike. The minigames will eventually tire out and you feel like you are in a repeat with too many texts & scenarios that you've already read/seen in previous play throughs. It is not refreshing enough to keep on doing this for xx amount of generations.\n\nWhat is also a bit of a bother is that at the start of every new generation, you have to go through the same 'tutorial' steps. Somehow this cannot be disabled. \n\nBut I have to really recommend this game. You may wonder why, but I love simulation games with a lot of stats like the Princess Maker series (available on steam) or Academagia (also on steam, though more story based). The power to mend something to your own liking and shape with certain factors, including random chance elements, can be very addicting. \n\nUPDATE 24/10, new patch: Tutorial skip function now available, you can skip the tutorial when creating new save file.

Although it's great the game has a translation now, and most of it is fantastically done, some parts are hit and miss. The odd typo or poor translation shows in terms of clunky sentences, or just outright bad English; some references or situations may go completely over your head because of their nuance with Eastern culture mixed with a bad translation. There's also gameplay differences between playing male and female children, and while this isn't inherently bad, playing a girl is way easier (at least in my experience) than playing a boy, particularly related to the dating mechanics, which are much more restrictive on the male side of the things. \n\nThis being said, the game is worth it despite the rough edges. The unique experience of a really solid life sim - which are few and far between - is a joy. And the game features generations of kids, so you can move into a NG+ starting as a newborn again.

It also interest many of my classmates, even those who doesn\u2019t care about independent games. We enjoy it, talk about it, and reflect it. The newspaper of the game was read for many times, and my classmates feel curious and excited about it.\n As a Chinese student, the content of the game is really existing in my daily life, the pressure in preparing for Gaokao (National College Entrance Exam), the pressure from balancing satisfying parents\u2019 expectations and chasing our dreams. Individually, the story may not happen in Guangdong, as we Cantonese don\u2019t have that kind of lucky money culture\u2026we prefer to give a small amount of money to every children we know. The reality is much crueler, as every action and choice is much more complex. But as the author said, he manage to compress 18 years into a few hours with fun in rounds, so the game is very signifying rather than paying attention to each details. The latter style can be explored in Tokimeki Memorial (Japan) and Gaokao Love 100 Days (China mainland), which is also excellent games. Consequently, Chinese players can recall their memories in their playing with fun and foreign players can have a look in Chinese education with fun as well. The compromise is not bad, as it successfully achieved the game\u2019s main idea. The developer is also endeavoring to cover more aspects of Chinese education. Their determination can be proved by their progress in releasing the girl\u2019s version and adding more details. There\u2019s no doubt that the game is a miracle, and it will continually be miracle in the near future.\n As is known, Chinese parenting has been widely accepted as a problem in Chinese education home and abroad. There are so many Chinese parents, teachers and children taking part in it with so many critics and researchers working on it hoping to find a better solution, but only the game\u2019s developer came up with the idea of making it into an AVG so as to draw more attention to the topic, not just for complaining, but also for finding more constructive suggestions. As the author once said, to make the game he nearly read all books of Chinese school and family he can find. Though the art resources may not be not enough, the author managed to convey his idea through the simple but impressive pictures and the fashionable words.\nThe method enjoy its pros and cons, and opinions rooted from Chinese culture is uneasy to be changed. Similar situation can also be seen in Japan and Korea. Of course, the system may not be the best, but evidently it is the best one available. Luckily, the Chinese authorities is also managing to perform reforms to encourage student\u2019s all-round development. We don\u2019t hope to follow the tracks of an overthrown chariot of Japan\u2019s reform in the 1980s. To avoid trapped in Chinese way of thinking, we are also learning from the west.\n Additionally, as a future programmer, I am dreaming of devoting myself to the production of these independent game that reflect modern China so as to promote understanding between China and the world. \nPS: I strongly recommend you to play Gaokao Love 100 Days (English translation guaranteed) which is considered \u201cpositive\u201d as it right reflect the puppy love of Chinese adolescents in China\u2019s excellent public school which is generally forbidden.

But what is it actually like to grow up with tiger parents in China? If you ever wanted to know, now you can experience it in the simulation game Chinese Parents. \n\nThis indie title is now accessible to an international audience, with an English version of the game that has already sold hundreds of thousands of copies in China. \n\nThis life sim, developed by Moyuwan Games, puts you in a Chinese household with tiger parents who are obsessed with your grades above everything else. You go through this journey starting as a newborn and ending at the age of 18, with the ultimate objective being to pass China\u2019s ultra-competitive National College Entrance Examination -- commonly known as the Gaokao -- at the end of the game. \n\nI love Chinese Parents. In fact, I\u2019ve written about the game twice before. But with a newly translated version available, I\u2019ve come to realize that Chinese Parents offers far more to players than just a few hours of escapism. \n\nChinese Parents shines as a great piece of interactive entertainment that offers non-Chinese players a rare glimpse into the thoughts and feelings of Chinese millennials. It sheds light on how young people in modern China have adapted to such a high-pressure environment by learning to look at their hardships through a satirical lens and roll with the punches.\n\n\n\nThis dad literally has the character \u2018love\u2019 tattooed on his arm, but he always threatens to beat up my beloved character. (Picture: Coconut Island Games)\nBefore I dive into the meta-commentary, let me quickly explain the game. In terms of game mechanics, Chinese Parents isn\u2019t anything earth-shattering. It follows the tried-and-true formula of many sim games: A solid resource management game played through multiple rounds, with a variety of quirky mini games periodically popping up to prevent it from slipping into monotony. \n\nChinese Parents has you work through a total of 48 rounds, building up stats like IQ, EQ or memory in each one. You can then use those stats to learn skills and meet your parents\u2019 expectations. \n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: Your parents\u2019 expectations are ridiculous. For example, besides having to pass the college entrance exam at the end, your character will have to constantly earn good grades, win elections to become class president and bag awards in talent shows. And from time to time, you have to put other kids to shame in public in order to earn face for your parents. \n\nIt\u2019s during the \u201cFace Duels\u201d with other kids that your learned skills are especially handy. These skills can be absolutely ludicrous, and depending on their absurdity, they deal varying degrees of damage to an opponent\u2019s face (or dignity). The first to lose all their \u201cface\u201d loses the duel. \n\nFor example, after you\u2019ve taken a few English classes, your mom will flaunt that you have a \u201cLondon Accent.\u201d This might not sound all that special, but speaking the Queen\u2019s English does sizable damage to your opponent. Better yet, if you\u2019ve taken a few probability classes, you will then unlock a skill called \u201cCasino Champ,\u201d which deals even more damage than speaking like a Harry Potter character.\n\nYour opponent also has an assortment of preposterous skills to counter you. One of these skills is literally just called \u201cSuccess,\u201d which is described as something your opponent acquires after spending all his time studying. This skill, as the name might suggest, could cost your mom a significant amount of face.\n\n\n\nYour mom takes you out to battle other kids like you\u2019re a Pok\u00e9mon. (Picture: Coconut Island Games)\nNeedless to say, these battles and vaunted skills are just hyperbolic caricatures of real life. But they\u2019re also heavily rooted in reality. \n\nChinese Parents excels at treading the fine line between the real and surreal. All of the scenarios it picks manage to feel simultaneously relatable and comical. \n\nAnother scenario in which Chinese Parents manages to evoke this absurdist feeling is in a mini game involving trying to pick the best moment to accept red packets from your relatives during Chinese New Year. The gist of the game is that you have to pretend you don\u2019t want to receive the money -- but of course you really do -- and it then becomes a delicate dance between rejecting and receiving. \n\nAnyone who\u2019s ever been in a situation like this will immediately recognize the feeling evoked here. While this tradition of push-and-pull can actually be very annoying in real life, the gamified version in Chinese Parents is much more enjoyable. \n\nMini games like Face Duels and Red Packet Battles attest to the ingenuity of Chinese Parents. The developers were able to find the most comical aspects of growing up in China and the most effective way of gamifying these practices or traditions. \n\nAs a game reviewer, I appreciate when a game\u2019s mechanics feel more inspired by real life rather than forced. And as a Chinese millennial, I find the developers\u2019 absurdist outlook empowering.\n\n\n\nIn order to get the red packet, you have to tap your space bar to keep the smiley face within the highlighted range until the time runs out. (Picture: Coconut Island Games)\nBy now you\u2019re probably wondering how the English translation relates to a Western audience. There\u2019s certainly a lot of juicy nuance lost in translation, but the game still offers a competent translation of something that might be difficult for foreign audiences to relate to. \n\nThe translation tries to be both idiomatic and loyal to the source text, which isn\u2019t an easy task. But while the game largely succeeds at expressing its self-aware humor in English, it still feels a little too indie or amateur at times, including blatant typos and errors that could have been caught with some professional proofreading.\n\nThese flaws are forgivable, though, thanks to the developers\u2019 delightful sarcasm. Chinese Parents also has a unique style. The game\u2019s art is at once adorable, kitsch, doodly and meme-littered. The style is effective at starting players off with low expectations but slowly winning them over with candor and authenticity.\n\n\n\nThe game has a lot of replay value because when you finish, your character gives birth to another potato-looking baby with a better chance at success than your first-generation character. (Picture: Coconut Island Games)\nBest of all, no matter how over-the-top the comedy in Chinese Parents might seem, the game\u2019s protagonist always feels relatable and likable. No matter how you play the character, whether as an overachiever or a bottom-dweller, he or she always retains a self-deprecating sense of humor. \n\nMany Chinese gamers would describe Chinese Parents as a \u201cdiaosi\u201d game. The term diaosi started as derogatory internet slang but evolved into a popular self-ascribed title for anyone who considers themselves \u201ca lovable loser.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, Chinese Parents is a beautifully crafted satire that takes you into the hearts of Chinese millennials. Behind the veneer of sarcasm is a level of introspectiveness that highlights the feelings of both helplessness and amusement in a high-pressure society that prizes deference and dignity above all else. \n\nWith China increasingly trying to cover up its vulnerabilities and look unassailable to the rest of the world, Chinese Parents gets you an inside look, letting you experience China as just another lovable loser.\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND", "timestamp_created": 1562416433, "timestamp_updated": 1562416433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570679366588592529", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53763530": {"recommendationid": "53763530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134103617", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 396, "last_played": 1689855450}, "language": "english", "review": "good fun when your bored", "timestamp_created": 1562401803, "timestamp_updated": 1562401803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53759089": {"recommendationid": "53759089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007041549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1563003986}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly addictive.", "timestamp_created": 1562398245, "timestamp_updated": 1562398245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53759029": {"recommendationid": "53759029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050149997", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1564884627}, "language": "english", "review": "you can live the life that you never had", "timestamp_created": 1562398196, "timestamp_updated": 1562398196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53729512": {"recommendationid": "53729512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233085612", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1438, "last_played": 1675905599}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would dishonour my family again.\n\nThe game is fun and scaled well for enjoyable playtime.

For example all the same characters are available to romance every time. So I could marry someone, have their kid, and then the kid could...marry their...parent? I don't think a little randomization is too much to ask for there.\n\nTechnical stuff/suggestions - the filtering for the skills you practice each turn simply doesn't work. I can filter for Imagination and still get skills that have nothing to do with Imagination. I think overall it would be better to have an option for a grid/list display where you can more easily compare the bonuses from each skill. Also some kind of progression map for eventual careers would be nice too, even if its just something that is unlocked/uncovered over multiple playthroughs. Lastly I think it would be cool if there were permanent changes you could make to a game save over generations. Like if there were skills/careers that you could unlock over generations, or if you could build on a career path over multiple generations. \n\nOverall I think this is a game with a lot of potential that was made as a fun little project. With a few tweaks and some more content, I think this could be a genuinely good game. If anything, I would really like to see more done with how successive generations work; there's a ton of potential there.", "timestamp_created": 1562205272, "timestamp_updated": 1562205272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53429889": {"recommendationid": "53429889", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964471157", "num_games_owned": 1111, "num_reviews": 268, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1562190987}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good, sat a whole 6 hours playing this game.

It gets old rather quickly though. I barely managed to finish two playthroughs.

It's a game where you take control of your character for the first 18 years of their life. You carefully manage your abilities, your parents expectations, friendships, romances and your stress level. There are over 100 endings and each time you achieve one, you can start over as your son or daughter. Your gender is random. \n\nPros:\n\n- large variety in choices and endings make for many different playthroughs. \n\n- is often relatable even for a western country. While I grew up in a less strict environment, the high school ending exams were our rite of passage in its own and this game does remind me quite a lot of that. \n\n- every playthrough will take an average of about 2.5 to 3 hours, meaning for the price that you'll pay, you'll likely get a lot of time out of it.\n\nCons:\n\n- luck plays a large part in it. Luck also plays a large part in life, however you likely won't end up in the best place without some luck on your side. \n\n- there are several different mini games in the game, however the one that will be used the most will be the stats raising game.

It's like reviewing a religion or something. If you're not part of the Chinese main/sub culture. Chances are your enjoyment of the game will be greatly limited. Because this game rely heavily on that resonance of the Chinese culture. That [b]\"ah hah\"[/b] moment when you recognize something you see in game as something you've personally experienced. Strip that away and the game itself is actually pretty complex but repetitive.\n\nBasically, you playing a kid, who miraculously have the freedom to organize his schedule from birth (which, if I may add, is a freedom no human child on Earth have). And every round you can do this, sarcastic quotation mark [i]'puzzle'[/i], where you click a bunch of color pieces to gain some stats. And then you get to assign 6 task that you'll do this round, each of which will grants you additional stats, some of which have some negative penalty (i.e: leisure activity usually causes your parents to be disappointed at you). Your main goal is to get your stat as high as possible given the time constraint so that at the end of the generation, the kid can find a good job and a good husband/wife (as far as I can tell after 2 generation, homosexuality isn't an option yet).\n\nMy main problem with this game is that firstly, sometimes I feel that my control with this game is rather loose. I can actively select which stats I want to gain by popping more said type of puzzle pieces each round and assigning more relevant task. But there is a lot of stuff that is completely random as well. Each round there is a few random event that will either reward you or punish you at random. And whether or not I gain an active skill from practicing a task is also random as well. Once a classmate got hurt and somehow I lost some constitution and I'm just like, why am I losing stats for something that happened to my classmate? Seriously, if you don't have the mindsets to struggle through this kind of grinding, just stay away from this game, because this game gets really repetitive really fast and you're constantly struggle to get your stat up to the point where you'll get a good ending. And then you start all over again with a new kid.\n\nTL;DR: This game is aimed at the Chinese audience. As a Taiwanese currently resides in Canada, I can enjoy this game to some degree. But I honestly can't imagine anyone who isn't Chinese enjoying this game. If the developers are reading this, I hope that more mini games gets added to this game. i.e: more variety of mini game to increase stat rather than just one single game. And more mini game for other activity as well. Maybe even mini game that will give you positive outcome in random event instead of just randomly punishing a player just for the RNG.", "timestamp_created": 1556344441, "timestamp_updated": 1556346368, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 224, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635989964008331299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50276719": {"recommendationid": "50276719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100190036", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 595, "last_played": 1613443409}, "language": "english", "review": "boring", "timestamp_created": 1555988716, "timestamp_updated": 1555988716, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.329400628805160522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50248716": {"recommendationid": "50248716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384485185", "num_games_owned": 1001, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1362, "last_played": 1555278708}, "language": "english", "review": "\u6316\u8111\u6d1e\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\u72ec\u7279\uff0c\u65c1\u767d\u4e5f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u7279\u957f\u56fe\u9274\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u5237\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fde\u7eed\u4e24\u5468\u516d\u8fde\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u90fd\u6ca1\u5237\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u5b98\u65b9\u80fd\u7ed9\u4e2a\u653b\u7565\u8bf4\u660e\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u662f\u4e2a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6982\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff1f\n\nAn interesting and novel game.

Along the way, you'll have to decide which personal attributes to develop (through playing a light-puzzle game), decide what to study, who to hang out with, and try to balance the expectations of your parents with your own happiness (slack off too much and you'll provoke their ire, study too hard and you could suffer a nervous breakdown).\n\nThe variety of fun little mini-games keeps things from becoming too repetitive. I especially enjoyed the \u9762\u5b50\u5bf9\u51b3 (face/pride battle) sub-game, where a neighbour or relative makes caustic remarks about you in order to make your mother \"lose face\". You have to defend yourself by boasting about your son or daughter's talents. Whoever has the most hit points left at the end wins the battle.\n\nOverall, this game is a satirical, but affectionate, look at Chinese childhood, so I'm not surprised by how popular it has been with Chinese gamers. You're probably wondering by now, is this worth buying for non-speakers of Chinese? The answer, unfortunately, is no. Being a largely text-based game, I can't see anyone without at least a foundation in Chinese getting much out of it. For those that can read a little, I have written a basic tutorial here to get you started:\n\nhttps://www.chinese-forums.com/forums/topic/57941-chinese-game-review-chinese-parents-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%BC%8F%E5%AE%B6%E9%95%BF/?tab=comments#comment-449690\n\nI think it's a shame that this game is currently inaccessible to non-speakers of Chinese, as it is a lot of fun and would help foreign people develop a greater understanding of everyday Chinese life and culture. If the developers are looking to do an English translation and require any help from a native speaker, I'll be happy to help. \n\n\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7279\u522b\u597d\u73a9\u3002\u53ea\u53ef\u60dc\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7edd\u5927\u6570\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u65e0\u6cd5\u73a9\u513f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u60f3\u8981\u505a\u82f1\u6587\u7248\u672c\u7684\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8054\u7cfb\u6211\u3002\u6211\u5f88\u4e50\u610f\u5e2e\u5fd9\u3002\u6211\u662f\u82f1\u56fd\u4eba\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1550821360, "timestamp_updated": 1550821360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661810576915740967", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49033811": {"recommendationid": "49033811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065451813", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 505, "last_played": 1596217707}, "language": "english", "review": "YEAHHHH\n\nGET THIS GAME!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1550335238, "timestamp_updated": 1550335238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483870983123779297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48985998": {"recommendationid": "48985998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845378772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1662793789}, "language": "english", "review": "It was good at first.", "timestamp_created": 1550146470, "timestamp_updated": 1550146470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529411792755126953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48942559": {"recommendationid": "48942559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879464807", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1588008026}, "language": "english", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u5f88\u771f\u5b9e\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1549954046, "timestamp_updated": 1549954046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48890824": {"recommendationid": "48890824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307132752", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1549604517}, "language": "english", "review": "Fine games I love the idea.

It contains so many 'netas' or, memes exclusively belonging to the Chinese. Even if you can master mandarin (which I think is very difficult), you may not enjoy the game either as it requires you to have a very deep understanding about Chinese culture, education system, societal problems, and concerns, etc.\n\nFor me, I think the game is worth the price only because A) it is cheap and B) it is a meme compilation and reflects my personal real life. The game mechanism is still somewhat simple and lame. It is not like that you are enjoying life as a kid but actually you are forced into sections of small puzzles that can be boring over time. In other words, the game is even more tedious than the real life as time passes. Hence, you are very likely to get bored after two or three saves.\n\nHowever, the devs are great in listening to the community and do have patches every two and three days. Now it is near the Spring Festival in China (something like Christmas), but they are still releasing fixes and updates.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would not recommend to non-Chinese players. but if you really want to play this and know how Chinese kids grow up in reality anyway, I am glad to help by maybe doing some translation for you.\n\nUpdate: about the English version of the game\n\nI think currently there are no plans for official English because there are only four people working on this indie game. Bugs & new features are prioritized rather than a translation.

It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that almost all my classmates were playing Chinese Parents shortly after it was released. As a Chinese student, I also had a curiosity about the game, but it turns out that I set the bar too high. \n\nTrue, this game is inspiring, with events & characters that are easy to attach to. More importantly, it criticizes the current educational system in a sharp way. However, the playability drops rapidly when I played for a few generations. The gaming style is underwhelming, and the game play becomes repetitive and tedious. After playing for hours, the only fun thing to do is collecting various special skills (in order to unlock the achievements.) \n\nBTW, my gaming experience could be biased because I didn\u2019t choose the path of Gaokao (NCEE) in high school\u2026\n\nStill, I\u2019d like to recommend this game, since I feel the enterprising spirit of our developers. After several updates, they greatly improved the art style, added more humanized adjustments, and finished the daughter version with brand new characters, storylines, and occupations.

It's a barrier that's not easy to cross.\nThat being said, today I'm glad to see the dev team is still updating this, having the enthusiasm to take this game to what it potentially might become, and

Rightnow, this game would be boring for anyone who does not speak chinese but is extremely recommended to those speaks chinese and wish to awake their experience during their young.\n\nWhat a fasinating game and I just could not even close it after starting the first round. \"Tiger Mom\" is the theme of the game and the game is truely a simulator of a typical modern chinese family. It cruelly reflects an inevitable game -- GaoKao (college entrance exam), that you may not want to play -- though it is \"all\" your life in the game. The \"rest of your life\" in the game, which is the the final result for you baby in game, though, is not even directly associate to your college entrance exam score. Actually, your inherited wealth and gifts from your last generation in the game affects more.\n\nHonestly, when playing this game, I was almost brought back to my childhood. Espeically in part that how the game vivify the peer pressure I used to endure.

The game would be much better if it added more randomness/unpredictability.

The game was about parenting, to raise your child 'Chinese Style', lol!\n\nThe game started with you as a new-born baby, ended after you finished high school. One playthrough takes about 2 hours more or less, some of the stats will be inherited to your next generation, so the replayability is there for you to try out different of life for your kid.\n\nAfter spending 20 hours, 11 generations, overall fun game, the graphic is cute, UI is clean and easy to understand.\nHowever, there are few things I wished to be improved.\n\u2022 [i]Autoskip for weekly schedule. No more space bar or mouse spamming.[/i]\n\u2022 [i]No female?[/i]\n\u2022 [i]How exactly you play the [b]Essay-Writing[/b] minigame? The tutorial doesn't explain well.

That's boring.[/i]\n\u2022 [i]The money you get from working, helping your parents cost too much energy, and too little money in return, not worth it.[/i]\n\nAnyway, good game and hope to see many

New game+ basically offers you small stat boosts to sucessive generations).\n\nThere are also 3 stats that affect the status of your child.\n1. Stress\n2. Parental Approval (for the filial child)\n3. Self-esteem / mental wellbeing.\n\nToo much stress can and will crush your child's well-being.\nToo much parental disapproval can and will crush your child's well-being.\nYour child commits suicide when their self-esteem/mental well being goes over the threshhold*.\n\n*I literally did not notice that on my first playthrough and my child commited suicide in high school year 1 after non-stop school activities and 0 recreational activities.\n\nSome other topics of interest -\n\nSaving Face (Mi\u00e0nzi)\nRed packets of money (How to receive it, lest your parents takes it from you for themselves)\nAn unrealistic mini dating sim is also included (7 girls are included as of this writing)\n\nThe Chinese social environment is far more complex than in the what is understood in the US (As I consider the US social norms to be more \"transactional\" and until recently, less deceitful).\n\nOverall, \n\n'Chinese Parents' is a very interesting cultural sim game - I highly recommended for any players interested in modern Chinese culture. \n\nFinal score: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1538813387, "timestamp_updated": 1538813513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 172, "votes_funny": 24,
