I love love love the graphics. I was very sad to reach the end of available gameplay, and am currently going through little witch in the woods withdrawal. \n\nEllie, our little witch apprentice, is quite the character - an impatient mischief-maker with a heart of gold. The dialogue between her and her talking hat is amusing, to say the least. \n\nStory-wise, Ellie is supposed to be going to a town to apprentice with a senior witch, but during the journey, the train has an unexpected stop, and because she hates being on the train to begin with, she decides to take a midnight trek through the woods to visit a tree she saw from the window. She ends up spending the night in an abandoned witch's cabin and misses the train leaving the next morning. But no big loss, because she didn't want to go to that town anyway! She finds a village and begins helping the people there, as a good witch apprentice does, although she has to pretend she has a senior witch overlooking her training (her hat fills in for the senior witch lol). The goal is to rebuild the town, which was decimated by some mysterious vine, and bring back the old villagers. \n\nGameplay includes exploring the countryside, discovering plants and animals and harvesting supplies from them to use for potions, and doing various quests for the villagers. Ellie has a notebook she carries around in which she records the plant\nand animal life. Achievements and more information about each entry are given if you meet certain requirements such as collecting a certain amount, collecting during a certain time of day, or if you find rare specimens. Rewards are given with increases in rank, and Ellie gets gifts or money for completing the book at certain intervals, like 25% complete and so on. \n\nGameplay mechanics worked well for me on PC, although the keys used to play were a little strange - using the arrow keys to move, z as an action key, d to open your notebook, etc. I got used to them, but they aren't exactly intuitive. Perhaps I could change the config, but I didn't try so I can't comment on that. \n\nI had only a few issues while playing: \n\nEvidently, you are supposed to befriend the villagers, but I'm unsure if this is an aspect that isn't included in the game yet, or if it just isn't something I can tell is happening. You have options to have various conversations with the villagers, and it says you have become closer to the person when you do them, but this repeats on an endless loop as far as I could tell, and nothing special happened after several such conversations. There was no way to measure friendship level. \n\nThere were a few bugs: some text that didn't fit in the dialogue box, one of the quests opened a blank visual window that hung around and blocked conversations until I finished that quest, and when I was given the witch's broom, I was unable to ride it right away, although once I slept that issue resolved. Not sure I see the point of the broom though, as it seems to go slower than Ellie can walk XD \n\nOne other complaint I have is that the dialogue is a little... excessive. It's humorous at times, but I don't want to read through 20 text boxes every time I have a conversation with someone. There were points where I was barely reading them at all because I was bored and just wanted to get on with the quest and collect some bunny fur. \n\nAt the end of the available content, I was given the ability to upgrade and decorate the witch's cabin, which I was excited about. Unfortunately, there were no more quests available, and it would've been tedious to play just to fill orders for the merchants (which refresh every wed and sun) to earn money to decorate.  \n\nI would absolutely recommend this game based on what I've played so far. My complaints are ultimately minor and didn't affect my overall enjoyment. I'm definitely looking forward to future content (I want to decorate my cabin, dang it!).", "timestamp_created": 1700063693, "timestamp_updated": 1700063693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150153580": {"recommendationid": "150153580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979731319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 416, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1700026593}, "language": "english", "review": "fun relaxing and easy.", "timestamp_created": 1700026630, "timestamp_updated": 1700026630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463800907135009766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150150919": {"recommendationid": "150150919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287194682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 495, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1700086609}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very good cozy game that does everything right. you are a witch. you spend your time doing witch things and helping villagers in ways that **visibly improve the town!!!** This game does a lot of things very well that others don't.\n\nWe don't have bloated \"life sim\" mechanics. No, you can't farm, nor fish, nor play 20 different minigames, because that's not the point! why would a witch farm?! There is clearly inspiration from games like stardew valley, but just like stardew's improvement of the harvest moon franchise, this game knows what to take and what to leave behind. It makes the world feel incredibly complete and leaves the gameplay loop concise. \n\nThe movement of your character is also very good. your walk isn't slow, and there's a sprint. Then you have brooms, that let you move quite a bit faster but take resources to maintain, as well as having floatier physics. It's not like the controls are show stopping, but they are better than most. \n\nGathering resources is different for each type, as it's mostly magical creatures, and most also have a couple secrets to make gathering easier / more lucrative. There's an overflowing level of charm and care put into these little critters. \n\nThe potions you make have actual impact! Many of them can be used to get a large amount of a specific resource, and/or for puzzles throughout the map. You honestly rarely sell potions, instead making and selling magic candies that are specifically created for non-witches. Again, this makes the gameplay feel great: your potion making progress has clear benefits to your future potion making, it's not all about money. \n\nGathering items spends energy. Crafting potions notably does *not* spend energy. This little improvement makes the gameplay loop amazing, as even if you exhaust yourself picking items, you can spend the rest of the night crafting potions rather than twiddling your thumbs. \n\nThe story is good, especially the main character. Thank the heavens, she's not a silent self insert protagonist! She has a personality, and is generally mischievous but well meaning. The other villagers and characters you meet are also well written and have cohesive character traits. Currently a friendship/affinity system is maybe in the process of being added, but it's not really important because, again, we have well written story and characters. \n\nSpeaking of characters: town improvement! Sidequests and main quests improve the town in ways more significant than just unlocking new items in the shop. You build houses, add streetlights, etc. and change a decrepit town containing 3 people into a moderately larger one. I know it's more work on the developer's part, but the building improvement mechanics are amazing in this game. \n\nThe grind isn't that heavy, for the most part. This is definitely a personal preference thing, but it's not particularly difficult to get a large number of any resources, as long as you are willing to commit a day to collecting them. Yes, later upgrades get more expensive, but in a \"takes several in game days\" not \"takes an in-game season\" type of way. \n\nCurrently, the Beta build of the game has massive feature (and story progression) improvements from the stable base game (which is still amazing), but is expectedly buggy, so it's up to you if you want to play the beta from the get go or not.", "timestamp_created": 1700021149, "timestamp_updated": 1700021149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150082965": {"recommendationid": "150082965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283068849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1606, "last_played": 1695248989}, "language": "english", "review": "My cozy game escaping reality", "timestamp_created": 1699911354, "timestamp_updated": 1699911354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150078060": {"recommendationid": "150078060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105352605", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1699904256}, "language": "english", "review": "The control scheme makes it unplayable.

I love going to new areas and having my little character draw each new one with her quill! the writing is fantastic, the art is stunning - detailed, rich, enchanting - and the market system is balanced and fair.\n\nmy gripes so far are not enough to prevent anyone from getting the game, but things to be aware of:\n- everyone in the reviews say that the keyboard layout is weird. it's... WEIRD. and you can't change the layout. I was stuck on the home screen pressing random buttons until i figured out what worked. and pay attention - because pressing shift to tiptoe is told to you once. if you forget it... it's not listed as a feature in the settings section either. you get used to it over time, but I hope the devs consider changing the layout or offering the option for the player to customize the keybindings to fit their preferred play style.\n- the game is in early access so it is to be expected that there are certain QoL features that are lacking. there definitely could be a better way to process ingredients and potions to save time. in addition, it would be nice if ingredients that are stored in the chest in the basement would be automatically factored into processing machines and the cauldron without having to pull them out manually every time. \n- the game saves after you wake up for the day and start to move out of the house. the character and screen freeze for a few seconds before letting you know it's saved. it is slightly game-breaking and clunky - I wonder if this save could be moved to the dream animation that plays for a few seconds while your character is sleeping?\n- it would be nice to use a mouse to be able to select specific things of interest in the environment. for example, trying to weed out one of the ruined houses and accidentally clicking on the house over and over and over again and prompting the dialogue box to pop up over and over. just a little annoying!\n- okay this is my *biggest* gripe. you cannot go to sleep before the clock hits 8pm. even if you are out of stamina. you cannot send the day over to the next manually. even if there is nothing left to do in the game story wise. I guess you could nap to regain stamina, but sometimes I'm just done with that day and want to move on to the next. it takes a bit of control from the player and seems so frustrating when it is 7:50pm in the game and I am just standing by the bed, idle, waiting for the time to turn over. \n\nall this being said, I fully believe the devs will take care of this game and polish it up to be something truly extraordinary. it is already one of my favorite gems of a game and has brought me so much joy! it's been so long since I was so invested in a game like this and I cannot wait to follow it's progress and see where the devs take this GEM! if you like stardew, kiki's delivery service, teenage exocolonist, strange horiculture, and any potion-making game of your liking - you will love this.", "timestamp_created": 1699673050, "timestamp_updated": 1699673050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149879043": {"recommendationid": "149879043", "author": {"steamid": "76561199141379461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "playtime_at_review": 896, "last_played": 1699638687}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun, it's pretty, it's whimsical.

Satisfying gameplay~\nART~ This is the best early access game I have ever played. First of all, the art in this game is hands down the most beautiful pixel art I have ever seen. Even if someone usually doesn't like pixel art, I feel like it would be hard to be anything but charmed by this. \nCHARACTERS ~ Beyond the art, the substance of this game is truly present. The main character, Ellie, is so spirited. Her personality comes alive immediately and is so endearing. The other characters also feel very distinct and lovable. \nSTORY~ RPG as a young witch who is on the train on the way to her apprenticeship, but there is an interruption. While the train has been stopped, she gets off to explore around the area and finds an old witches house and the remains of a village named Wisteria. The land has been overgrown with magical vines and most of the residents have moved away from the village. Ellie , spirited and kind-hearted as she is, promises to stay and do what she can to help this town (since she ended up missing her train anyways). \nGAME PLAY~ This game has such fun game mechanics. You are involved in every part of magical study and practice- from identification of different plant/animal species, all of which have their own environments, mannerisms, and methods of gathering materials for use. While there is no combat in this game (which was not a problem for me, I actually preferred it), you still get good tension by having to use stealth to sneak up on certain creatures and not scare them off, with a reward of sweet, sweet endorphins when you manage it. You can prepare ingredients in different methods such as roasting and extracting, and ultimately brew them in potions that you can use on yourself or to interact with the environment (such as using potions to get rid of the vines, or to grow plants as platforms that you can walk on to access other areas). \nYou can also sell potions and take on optional daily orders for in-game currency. \nVIBE~ The vibe is spot on with this one, and really makes the game. I have never played a game that feels so magical as this. The music is gorgeous and pairs well with the mysterious vibe and natural beauty of this game. The plants and creatures are different during the day as they are at night. It is so satisfying to see this environment transform and come alive.  You really feel like you are a witch, studying these plants and animals, filled with so much wonder and awe. \n\nI really, really recommend this game. It is well worth the price. And if you are worried about it being early access, don't be! I have gotten over 13 hours in so far and the developers are just going to keep adding more environments, characters and story. But there is plenty here already to feel fleshed out and immersive. Little Witch in the Woods has fully captured my heart, and it is truly a one of a kind experience. I love cozy RPG games, which usually mean games that are farming sims to some extent. It is very refreshing to see this cozy game come out that totally breaks the mold and is an entirely different experience, without combat or farming, but is not lacking at all for that. <3", "timestamp_created": 1693902665, "timestamp_updated": 1693902665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145692023": {"recommendationid": "145692023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053557945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 514, "last_played": 1693889963}, "language": "english", "review": "is a super cute fun game thats easy to understand and fun to play, ives played for over 8 hours in just the beta and cant wait to buy the full game once i have the funds", "timestamp_created": 1693888891, "timestamp_updated": 1693888891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145689938": {"recommendationid": "145689938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198442129106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 818, "last_played": 1693892392}, "language": "english", "review": "A very atmospheric game with a great story line.", "timestamp_created": 1693884607, "timestamp_updated": 1693884607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145668807": {"recommendationid": "145668807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177772410", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1693855158}, "language": "english", "review": "Super cute and comfy atmosphere.

I honestly feel like it was all very unnecessary and took away from the gameplay. It seems that nearly any time you need to pick up something, go to a new area, the hat is talking to you and the \"little witch\" is talking back . You get to a abandoned witch's house and start cleaning up the place and everytime you add an item to your inventory, its a conversation with the hat. Each time you clear some cobwebs, the witch is complaining about cleaning. Each time you remove weeds outside, she is complaining to the hat. The music , the concept , animation and everything is great - the dialogue just does not stop and it felt like I was in a cartoon for 7 year olds.

I was collecting extra ingredients every day just in case i would need them and bam quests ended so im left with a chest full of extracts and branches. I know it is in early access but still doesn't have optimised mechanics, and receives updates pretty sparsely. I still enjoyed this relaxing game and don't mind my purchase since it's supporting the devs. Still would suggest people to wait for a sale instead of paying full price. Keep in mind my review is about live version and i did not try the beta version and if any of the issues i mention are already fixed in beta my apologies.\n\nSome issues that were just annoying imo:\n1- When you walk you can go any diagonal direction. But when you're sprinting you cannot run diagonal right+down or left+up which makes going around pretty slow and frustrating. Also sometimes when shaking a tree the progress bar gets interrupted for some reason, so you have to restart it.\n2- Food is soo soo common which is nice I guess but as a punishment the max energy you can recover from food ticks down as time passes which makes big energy foods very obsolete. By the time i use up 200 energy, my max limit falls as well and half of a pie or bread energy goes to trash. make food more expensive and rare if that means you will remove or slow down the max energy cap decrease.\n3- STORAGE!! Nothing stacks more than 10 (20 for building materials) and you end up having to hoard ingredients for buildings, quests, potions, upgrades etc but nothing nothing fits! Storage shouldnt be source of such pain in a relaxing pixel game imo, i was even turning everything into extracts and candies for better stacking but still had storage issues. When you expand your bag you do it only 4 slot at a time with ridiculously expensive gold price. When you expand your chest you again upgrade it only a couple slots at a time and need gold, branches and rocks too. Branches are common enough you can find 20+ a day but rocks are way less common.\n4- Which brings me to my next point: prices of items are very out of balance. When you want to sell simple potions/candies that are not demanded by a daily quest they sell for such a low price (around 20 gold iirc might be wrong) it is just never worth it. But if you want to buy a rock it is 12 golds! but a food from arden that recovers whole 200 energy is only 25 gold. \n5- Don't know if it was a bug or it was just not developed yet but spoilers incoming. [spoiler] I made dream recall potion and drunk it around 3pm-ish after fixing fountain and finishing all quests until talking to people didnt give me anything new. Thought the cat said when you progress you can drink the potion and visit me or something along those lines and I was trying it for the first time. Never visited the cat for a second time and thought the end of the early access quest line would be progressed enough. But that night just nothing happened i only got the cute sketch dreams didn't meet cat and wasted my potion :( [/spoiler]\n\nLastly would love it if we got story and non story achievements. They make me feel like I actually progressed through a game and make me happy :) Will be waiting for the next big update to pick up the game again!", "timestamp_created": 1689700479, "timestamp_updated": 1689700754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142307393": {"recommendationid": "142307393", "author": {"steamid": "76561199212215398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1692838971}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun but only if you're using a controller.

I felt i was inside a ghibli kind of scenario. I found so interesting how Ellie goes around learning about the source of different materials she does. So the only bad things about the beta is that are many bugs still so after a while I kind of dropped it until they release the full version. \n\nAlso I would recommend that Ellie could improve not only her house, also her lab, cleaning it a bit to be able for her to create a brand for her witch shop and you could change the house sign outside for something more fun... I am remembering kiki from ghibli studio. \nI feel the UI should also improve each time you start a conversation with someone to check the level of relationship you are with them. Now the game just let you know Ellie got closer to them but it is easy to forget about it later. \nI remember also that before the new updates, once you fix the hole at Ellie's house, the new house was much cute and nicer as it wasn't a box, now you have a customizable house, but because it has no windows or chimney or kitchen, it looks like a box...  \n\nAmazing game though, I think it has a bright future as zelda did when it was pixel art.

When I first heard about it, I was very excited for the concept, However, having played for a few hours... I just can't get myself to go back in the state that it's in.\n\nFor some positives, the game is beautiful. There is an incredible amount of effort in the sprite work and artwork for all the characters, and the various environments, and even some of the menus. The witch shop girl especially is just a beautiful piece of pixel art. The soundtrack is also fine, nothing great but not notably bad.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay and writing just don't live up to the standards the art puts forward. It's very obvious that this is a team that does not natively speak English and have run the text through some automated translation program. You can get the gist of most things, but dialog comes off as clunky and unnatural in English. But even when you get the point of the dialog, it all feels... empty, is the best way I can describe it. Another review I read mentioned how bored the character kept saying they were at the start, and I felt that. I have zero connection with the plot due to how it is conveyed, and how you kind of just get plopped in.\nThe gameplay doesn't feel much better either. From what I can gather, the primary gameplay loop is to collect resources, brew potions, and sell them to merchants. You then use the currency to buy more potion recipes (To open new areas) or upgrade your potion brewing equipment/backpack ( to hold more potions). I guess I might not fully understand what being a witch is, but being in an endless loop of brewing potions is not really what I expected. Especially because it seems every part of those potions needs to be gathered out in the wild, you can't even grow your own materials. That on top of two loading screens being between you and the cauldron  makes it feel tedious, and just not fun.\n\nI have tried numerous times to get myself to open this game back up, but I just can't bring myself to do it. I will probably try the game again when it releases fully, but for now I'll just wait. Maybe this just isn't the kind of game for me, as someone who might have been expecting something more Stardew-adjacent. But other than admiring the gorgeous artwork, I can't justify the time investment of playing the game.", "timestamp_created": 1685222645, "timestamp_updated": 1685222645, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680623948574066162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139057545": {"recommendationid": "139057545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142186052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1685155903}, "language": "english", "review": "This is so cute!

This would be less frustrating if the game hadn't been out for a year with this being a known bug. Beyond freezing there have been one or two other bugs that require a restart to the software that seem to have been known for quite a while as well based on a quick google search.\n\nThe English translation also isn't very great and can make the story/task difficult to understand at times, but I could definitely look past that if the game wasn't nearly impossible to play. \n\nPros: The art is great, the characters and story are adorable, and this is definitely a cozy game. If it were playable I'd recommend it to all my friends.\n\nOverall, I do regret paying $15.99 for a game that does not work.

Honestly, I'm just glad they gave her a personality at all. so many of these relaxing simulator games feel a bit unnerving because of the dead-eyed protagonist, but not this one! \n* The music is pleasant to listen to, and the sound effects are high quality but not jarring, so don't forget to turn up the volume.\n* The quest log was nice, I especially liked how it showed you the exact character you needed to go to next, just in case you didn't feel like running around going through every characters every dialogue.\n\nCons:\n* Too short! I want to play more, but I finished the main story in about 6 hours, I could have done it faster too, but I was taking my time with it. This one can be forgiving because of the whole 'early access' thing, so it wasn't unexpected, but I was hoping for just a little bit more for 16 USD. \n* there were a few moderately bad audio bugs (music stuttering and sounds being 'staticky'), and a lot of visual errors on some characters (fox kid I'm looking at you).\n* it can be a bit tedious at times, like seriously the prices on some of the upgrades are ridiculous and there's no way I'm spending that much time grinding to make money and resources for barely any improvement. the only upgrade that was actually useful was the first extractor upgrade and inventory and that's it, everything else is a waste of time because the cost far outweighs the reward (compounding the \"why bother\" mentality is the short playtime (again)).\n* you can buy books from the merchant, one of them is in Korean, just a heads up.\n\nOverall this is an adorable game with a lot of potential, which is currently being bogged down with its somewhat tedious gameplay loop and useless 'rewards'. However, it's still present and relacing experience that I genuinely enjoyed.  I really am looking forward to where this is going!

It just feels slightly short to have gotten as far as I have in 6 hours (not speed running btw, mainly just running around picking up random stuff and getting used to the map).

In addition there were no significant consequences to not getting back to bed before you pass out (12am). It was an endearing story, which is yet unfinished. I enjoyed learning about the village and the characters within. Everything you need for tasks are available around you. I did notice that there was at least one side quest post beta game completion (as noted with a thank you screen). There is the option to continue after the main quest. You can continue to make potions and candies which allow you to make money or potentially solve situations that will come in the future.  I hope to see this game find its completion as I would love to learn the complete story of this village, the villagers, the main character, and the other more mysterious characters we met or have yet to met.

However, in my opinion, it lacks more main content and a more robust gameplay loop. Since it's an early access game, it's understandable that it's still lacking, but it's worth noting nonetheless. \n\nThe game would benefit from quality of life changes such as better pathing, player hitbox, more durable broom, and improved NPC interactions. \n\nOne of the changes I hope to see is a more complex potion crafting system. Currently, it's okay, but I would like to see more intricate recipes added later on or perhaps multi-step recipes.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 9 out of 10. It's a fairly fleshed out game that simply needs more time and devotion to become a great 10 out of 10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1678364558, "timestamp_updated": 1678364694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704198837280273438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134342197": {"recommendationid": "134342197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217216229", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 874, "last_played": 1687835967}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game like i love my boyfriend<3", "timestamp_created": 1678358405, "timestamp_updated": 1678427409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134329805": {"recommendationid": "134329805", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993475161", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1677789822}, "language": "english", "review": "Love everything about this but it's short.

Honestly I like this Little Witch game but a lot needs to be ironed out through further development. \n\nGood things first: The game is absolutely adorable. I LOVE the art style and animations and the music is cute and soothing too. Although things can get a little repetitive it honestly doesn't feel boring and the crafting/potion making system is fun and simple enough to learn. Love that you don't lose items if you mix a potion wrong either. I think the overall story-line is good and I'm excited to see where it goes and if we can travel to other destinations via the train eventually. I think that would be fun. I also like all the characters and critters so far, they're all very cute, I'd love some plushies or merch of them. I also never had any bugs where I got stuck or lost a save or anything.\n\nThe Bad: The controls are absolute trash. They do have controller support...but that sucks too. Nothing really makes sense and it's frustrating that you can't remap keys/buttons. Really need that implemented ASAP.  As some others said you get used to it but that's just because you HAVE to if you want to do anything in game. It never really feels intuitive or comfortable. (I get that it's early access but the mapping just doesn't feel comfortable from the start) The writing for cut scenes is way too much and kind of annoying, especially the train scene in the beginning of the game when you really want to jump in and explore. And especially when Ellie is talking to her hat. I have skipped multiple dialogues and not missed anything at all. \n\nAll in all I DO think this game is super cute and fun to play baring some of the dialogue and beginning train scene. I think anyone would have fun with Little Witch.

So that'll be a great aspect to add too besides just the farming-type content.\n\nMy one complaint so far is that the broom is a little annoying to control because it accelerates, so it's easy to bump into trees/bushes when trying to steer, but that's a very minor detail.

Sometimes the controls are a little confusing. Like, when moving things from my chest to inventory, I naturally try to use the arrow keys to move between those spaces and grab what I need, getting confused as to why I can't before I realise I need to hit the TAB button to get from my pack to the chest and back again. Making potions took a bit of getting used to mainly because of the heat sensor. There's 3 little flames to indicate the hottest setting, so for some reason I thought that was setting number three before realising that, when it asks you to set it to heat 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it was talking about each notch on the heat detector. Easy to figure out that one and not ingredients were lost the first time I screwed it up, but numbers on those notches would help get it the first time.\n\nYou also have to use odd keyboard controls to make it work. Press Q or W to make the heat go back and forth while using E or R to stir left, not stir, or stir right. I feel like that could be simplified by just letting me use the arrow keys to scroll over the potion menu and using the Z or ENTER button to select what I want, or even a mouse option to click on those controls. Luckily those controls are written at the bottom of the screen every time, so I can always see what to do, even though I'm always looking down because I can never remember off the top of my head. It's a mild complaint, but it feels like switching that up could make menu navigating a little more streamlined and user friendly. \n\nAlso, the \"hit\" detection is a little off at times. Sometimes I can be right on top of something that's grabbable, with the little arrow above it, and the Z button won't quite work. I have to move around a little to get what I need. Also not a big deal because it's still pretty close on and I don't have to wiggle around much to get what I want, but it happens enough that I notice it. Sometimes to go back I'll also hit the esc button out of habit before realising the game wants me to press Z or X instead, including on the front menu screen where the train is rolling by, and the save screen. I'll press ENTER over the save option before remembering I need to hit Z.\n\nIt's all nitpicky stuff so far, but the game looks pretty polished with the exception of a few minor places, so until I find something else you almost have to be nitpicky, but it would be nice and let me fall into this game easier if these were addressed. Otherwise, beautiful game. When there is music, it's soft and fits the tone, I wish there was more of it. I might be too early in, but I noticed some spots that sounded a little empty with the exception of train sounds or pages flipping the first time I was in the Witch's workshop. Beautiful, pleasant music when it is there, though, and the graphics are adorable. I love watching Ellie running around in her little chibi pixel art, and THANK YOU for making the run option with the Space bar. I played another game where running was SHIFT and I didn't realize how much I needed the space bar until I played that game. Ellie running with the Space Bar control is so much more comfortable for my hand. And the little flowers everywhere, the birds, the fox, and even the grass all are just precious.

Lets do a quick, spoiler free, pros and cons list.\n\nPros: \n- VERY cute pixel art style! It consitent and really really well done. \n- Dreamy OST that fits the game very well\n- Simple, but enjoyable gameplay\n- Charming characters that are fun to talk to and have wonderful personalities\n- Good story imo! I was quite intrigued the whole way through\n \nCons:\n- Definitely an early access game, that's for sure. Mild bugs but nothing game breaking that I experienced\n- Control scheme uses keyboard exclusively. Works just fine, just takes a lot of getting used to. After playing the whole game through I still wasn't really used to it til the very end, and even then, not really.\n- Somewhat Repetitive gameplay loop with gathering ingredients. Especially early game ones (looking at you, maple herb)\n- Limited OST. Just a handful of songs. Good ones! But they are all pretty short as well.\n- Some of the writing (characters speaking to one another, etc) does not flow well. Some grammar and spacing errors, but more than that it feels like characters aren't exactly talking to one another? Just sorta, saying things out loud in each others presence if that makes sense. They lose their personality sometimes which is a shame.\n- A map feature would be very very welcome, but there isn't one at the time of writing.\n- Crafting takes quite a while. Upgrading your tools essentially just lets you craft one more item at a time per upgrade, and upgrades get expensive very quickly. Upgrading doesn't let you craft new things or anything, like how I assume it would when I started. It became worth the upgrades *just* to skip the \"jump hip hip hooray!\" animation every time you make a potion.\n- Due to early access, some items will be useless and not worth collecting, even at the current endgame\n\nOverall I still think the game is worth it. I see many people \"want\" to give it a positive review but currently cannot due to the games state of completion and the like. But I think people know what they're paying for here. It's not a terribly expensive game either, and I doubt the price will change when the game is complete.", "timestamp_created": 1674969181, "timestamp_updated": 1674969181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131770431": {"recommendationid": "131770431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111286390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 411, "last_played": 1681935239}, "language": "english", "review": "So cute and fun, a really sweet RPG, can't wait to play the full game!", "timestamp_created": 1674959477, "timestamp_updated": 1674959477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131728812": {"recommendationid": "131728812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031939584", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1673509038}, "language": "english", "review": "Moar please", "timestamp_created": 1674916467, "timestamp_updated": 1674916467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131728290": {"recommendationid": "131728290", "author": {"steamid": "76561199074476233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1674863954}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to like this game as the artwork is so adorable and the main character is so cute.

Like many others have mentioned, the dialogue is very clunky, and there are many grammatical and spelling mistakes. Personally, I also feel like there is WAY too much dialogue, especially for repeated interactions. I lost interest in the story very quickly, as I didn't want to read through any of it. The dialogue menus for shopkeepers especially are also a bit confusing and unnecessarily complex. I had some brief trouble figuring out how to fill potion orders, because it is a separate option from selling potions in a completely different part of the dialogue menu. \n\nThe gameplay itself is decent enough, although it still has some issues. One of the most notable problems is that the notebook doesn't always open when you press the control (D), although it usually fixes itself if you open one of the other overlays first. I also really dislike the stamina system, as it isn't super intuitive and can leave you stranded in the middle of the woods unable to pick fruit to replenish it, forcing you to return to the witch hut at the pace of a snail (unless you have fuel in your broom). This makes the process of gathering ingredients, which is already a very repetitive aspect, that much more irritating. \n\nI found the level of guidance/handholding at the beginning to be a bit odd. There is little to no introduction to the controls (which are by no means standard or intuitive). However, it also feels a bit restrictive in terms of how much exploration it lets you do on your own to start. I found myself discovering areas and figuring out puzzles before I was meant to, and then still having to go find the necessary dialogue before I was allowed to progress. Then later on, the game begins to feel a bit stagnant as you are just left to grind for money to upgrade/buy things. \n\nIf there's one good thing about this game, it's the environment. All of the areas have a comfortable amount of detail, and the pixel art is well done. The plants and creatures are interesting, unique, and fun to interact with.

When I first started playing, i ended up putting the game away 2 hours in and didn't touch it for a while. The main reason is I was getting absolutely drowned in dialogue and for a good chunk of those 2 hours i felt like i was watching a movie that every now and then gave me the option to actually stop and play the game as well as uncover the story for myself. I came back to it recently and honestly I'm glad I gave it a shot because just a bit further and I was put into environment I wanted in a game. I explored, learnt things myself without a guide, interacted with the town and from time to time listened in to the bickering between the main characters. The inclusion of little side quests that force you to always be stacked up on items and the selling/buying system made me really happy to indulge in. I felt like I was exploring for a reason and i was a part of the world outside of just the main quest. \n\nWith that being said there are a few little things that do bother me, mainly the controls on keyboard. If you're someone that finds it hard to adhere to new controls like me, you may want to consider connecting a controller instead. I wish there was an option to change your keybinds to fit everyone's personal needs and comfort. With the point that I am in the game, some characters also feel rather bland, and sometimes dialogue feels unnecessarily long and repetitive.\n\nOverall its a great game.

However, you can tell this game is not finished and there are some bugs to work out. Here are some of my thoughts after playing the early release version. \n\nDialogue: \nLike most games in this genre there is a lot of dialogue, especially at the start on the train (as others have mentioned). There were some translation issues, so carefully reviewing and condensing the dialogue for the English version would be great. \n\nMore specifically the dialogue controls and options could be smoothed out. You currently have three options at the start \"personal stories\", \"chit-chat\", and \"shop options.\" I think the personal stories and chit chat option can be condensed into one option. The reason is because you also have to open special dialogue about certain topics and it starts to get a bit cluttered. You use these options to get more information about the world and important hints about side quests. You acquire \"key phrases\" that you can use with other players to get more information. Sometimes this information opens up the side quest option (by hitting tab) and other times it does not. It might be nice for players to have a section in the journal that logs these key phrases as the game gets longer. For the demo it was okay because you have limited people you can speak with about these key phrases, but if the game play gets longer and there are a lot more characters this might be useful to add. It would just be a section in the journal that recaps the convo, highlights the key phrase in red text, and then the person you need to speak with also in red text.  I have seen this mechanism in other games. \n\nControls: \nThe controls are a bit cumbersome using the keyboard (I did not try with a controller) and can probably be simplified. Mostly the issue was selecting and using items from the inventory. Perhaps the coding can be improved in the later versions of the game. Currently, you have to hit several keys in order to use an item (ex: hit S to open inventory, then Z to select, then Z again to equip, then A to put in your hand, then Z to target, then C to throw a potion at a plant). For me, it did not make the gameplay more immersive and I found it a bit clunky. Perhaps after you equip the item the controls can be simplified to autotarget nearby objects (ex: plants) just like how the feather pen works and then just hit Z again to throw/use a potion.\n\nI liked the how the cauldron controls are done. You add ingredients, select heat level, and what direction you need to stir. That is a pretty fun and cute experience.  It might be nice to add a window when using the cauldron where you can have your selected potion or candy recipe up at the same time underneath the ingredients window. Right now, you have to open the book to check your recipes, then go to the cauldron. This is a minor point. \n\nPricing of items: \nAs some others have mentioned a lot of the items are very pricey for the game. It does force you to go collect items and build your inventory in order to make potions/candies to sell for gold or luna coins. Then you can buy items or upgrades for the village or your workshop. However, the prices are a bit steep in my opinion. As others have mentioned you have a limited amount of resources that spawn in the game per day. So you will have days that you are just waiting for items to respawn to collect, then extract/roast, and then brew in order to get to the next step. While collecting resources and crafting items is a main feature these games, it can get pretty repetitive. Some of this can currently be bypassed by purchasing resources (sticks, rocks, etc) using your gold in the village. Currently, you cannot buy potion/candy ingredients for from Diane which would be helpful. You also get a very low price for selling potions/candy even when you do the special delivery option (only available once per day). This really ends up being the only option as selling the potions or candy without the special delivery option have very low prices. Therefore, a lot of your game play time is spent collecting items to get enough money to move forward. Some people might say this adds to the games experience, but I think there is a balance in how much time you spend collecting these items and the payoff you get for doing it. I would solve this problem by doing one of the following 1) decrease the price of upgrades and blueprints 2) increase the value of selling potions/candy for both the regular and special delivery options 3) Make the upgrades to the extractor, cauldron, etc to yield more products at the start rather than just allow the player to extract 2x extractions at a time (this was not worth the price of the upgrade).\n\nOverall: \nThat all said, I really liked the game and enjoyed playing. The premise of the game is everything I have been wanting for a while. I think the finished version of the game has a lot of promise. The story is very charming and I would love to play the final version when it is available!", "timestamp_created": 1672321281, "timestamp_updated": 1672321281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129590253": {"recommendationid": "129590253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104131696", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1672180566}, "language": "english", "review": "Great chill game.\nBut it gets very repetitive after a while.

I do wish some of the dialog is shorter though. There are points where you'll read characters talking for a bit, pick up something, and then they talk even more. I think the game is going for more story than a lot of crafting simulations do, but I think it could be balanced a bit more. Tutorials are super important but I shouldn't be sitting there wondering when I'll even get to play the game or if i have to wait just a bit longer for characters to finish explaining a mechanic or world-building. \n\nA good example of the dialogue being a bit intrusive is early on in the game you're shown a new area, but you need to be back to a train by morning. Its 10pm, so morning is far aways off, but your witch hat will bug you about being late every 30 seconds or so. I get that i can explore later but i never felt like i should be hurrying. I feel like instead of a pop-up dialog , something like an arrow could have worked, or just simply a note somewhere to remind you of your task. Small things like that would help the game flow between story and game-play a bit better.  The story itself is great, there are just moments where it feels like it drags on slightly too long or pops up too frequently, if that makes sense. \n\nSo right now we have a game where the story is good, and the gameplay itself is promising, it just doesn't know when to let the player just play and have fun, and when to sit the player down and go off about the world and its stories. I wouldn't call it boring, but there are times i wish i could do more things. I have a feeling this does get better once the world is explained and you unlock more game mechanics, but i wish there was more balance.", "timestamp_created": 1672209099, "timestamp_updated": 1672209099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129489765": {"recommendationid": "129489765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392993939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 599, "last_played": 1691624103}, "language": "english", "review": "first of all, i am a sucker for anything pixelated and cute, so this game fell right down my alley. the art and music is so beautiful and i love the concept. i don't like games that are too complicated and ones that make me dig my brain a bit too long; so this really hit the spot. i was able to do 99% of the quests without having to rely on the wiki, which is great for me. definitely a chill cozy game. \ni saw a few people mention how long the dialogues are at times, and i definitely agree. there should absolutely be a way to skip over them faster because some interactions feel never ending. many games have a skip option for cut scenes, i feel like this could be easily integrated. \noverall, i am not a great game reviewer, but i love the simplicity and cuteness of this game, i rarely get sucked into games because i usually get stuck and frustrated, so this was really perfect for me and i do recommend it to anyone who is looking for a casual feel-good game.", "timestamp_created": 1672204041, "timestamp_updated": 1672204041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129479088": {"recommendationid": "129479088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203032304", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 562, "last_played": 1683781867}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is cute and easy to play, a good way to relax after a long day.

Still, I enjoyed Little Witch in the Woods very much; it scratches the Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing itch very well. Really looking forward to the final release. I hope the dev team considers all the feedback from early access players and their Discord to make the game even better!\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Art and design:[/b] The art style is adorable, with a wide range of expressions and animations. Unique character designs and sprites. I love watching Ellie run or ride her broomstick around the woods! The critters are also really cute. The team working on this game has put so much thought and care into their worldbuilding, environment, and game design - it doesn't feel like it's trying to copy Stardew, like many other games in this genre. Little Witch in the Woods has a style and feeling unique to itself, and I love that.\n    [*][b]Gameplay:[/b] It's honestly really fun and relaxing to run around and gather materials, brew potions and candies, and fulfill quests. The mechanics are refreshing and unlike other games - this isn't a farming sim or a townbuilding sim. Though it's very simple and can get repetitive, I enjoy the gameplay cycle of going around the village every day to see if anyone needs my help, and becoming more familiar with the world by exploring. \n    [*][b]Controller support:[/b] This game is best enjoyed on a controller, imo. I played it entirely on controller and had a seamless experience - not entirely sure how it feels to play this with a mouse and keyboard, but other reviewers say it's less enjoyable since you can't rebind your keys. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Boring dialogue:[/b] There's a limited number of scripted lines, which get repetitive and boring to run through. As others have mentioned, the intro to the game on the train is a bit long and boring. I don't mind the banter between Virgil and Ellie, as I think it's fun, but I can see how others could find it hard to get through. I do get a bit tired of the small talk chitchat between Ellie and some of the villagers.  \n[*][b]Early access[/b]: Because it's in early access, the game is definitely incomplete and there's not enough to do, or there are things in the game that serve no purpose yet/lead to dead ends, i.e. the \"Shop\" option doesn't do anything for Rubrum, Roy or Entie. There are also a number of bugs, like Rubrum disappearing randomly, and quality of life issues like no save slots, expensive upgrades with no way to track in your jounral what resources are needed for those upgrades, and the limited number of resources you can gather each day vs. the number required for recipes (ex: the world only spawns 3 PomPoms each day, but you need 4 pompom feathers to create one ingredient for recipes). However, the dev team is diligently working on updates and adding new features for the final release, so I'm really looking forward to those. \n [*][b]Localization issues[/b]: I was able to tell within the first 5 min of gameplay that this game was originally developed for a Korean audience, which doesn't bother me that much since I can speak Korean and can get the gist of what the original lines might have said. However, some of the dialogue is really awkwardly or inconsistently translated, and in some cases where you have reply options, the English gets cut off in those boxes so you can't even see what the full sentence says. The only option for reporting these translation issues currently is via their Discord server.\n    [*][b]Price:[/b] I received this game as a gift from a friend, but I wouldn't pay full price for it currently. There's just not enough content and polish to consider it a full game - so you won't really get your money's worth unless you're trying to support the devs and buy in early to avoid the price hike when it gets a full release.\n[/list]\n\nIn its current state, it's an 7/10 for me, but I could see it easily getting a 9 or 10 when it's complete... which could easily take a year or two in my opinion. But I'm eagerly awaiting the final product, and cheering on the team while they work.\n\n\uac8c\uc784 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud300\uc5d0\uac8c: \ud639\uc2dc \uc601\uc5b4 \uc6d0\uc5b4\ubbfc \ubc88\uc5ed\uc774\ub098 \ud3b8\uc9d1 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc790 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uc2dc\uba74 \ub9d0\uc500\ud574\uc8fc\uc138\uc694 ^^ \ub313\uae00\uc774\ub098 \ub514\uc2a4\ucf54\ub4dc \uacf5\uc9c0\ub85c\n\uc774 \uac8c\uc784 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc88b\uc544\ud574\uc11c \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4\uba74 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc2f6\uc5b4\uc694! \uacc4\uc18d \uc751\uc6d0\ud558\uace0 \uc644\uc131\ud488 \ub9ce\uc774 \uae30\ub300\ud558\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud654\uc774\ud305!", "timestamp_created": 1671874853, "timestamp_updated": 1671874853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801736295223236084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129146718": {"recommendationid": "129146718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230318144", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1672616170}, "language": "english", "review": "I just started the game.

First off, this is not a farm sim where you create a character and do Stardew-type things. This is the very specific story of Ellie, a witch apprentice, who has to figure out witch life in the forest. There is some collecting you will do for potions, currency to earn to unlock additional recipes and purchase ingredients, but so far it's all staying closely connected to the story.  Which isn't a bad thing!  Sometimes you just want a cute pixel art story game with not-to-difficult puzzles. \n\nWith only about 5-6 hours released of a (currently planned) 20-hour game available, I can't comment too much about the full story; however, the pixel art is gorgeous, music is well done and nice to have in the background, movement is smooth, and tool use is easy to get the hang of quickly.  The one drawback for me is the dialogue, which can be circular/repetitive at times and appears on the screen a bit too slow. I find I keep clicking to try to make it appear faster and sometimes it just really doesn't, which can be tedious after a while. It's also a bit more juvenile than I expected in parts, for Ellie and a few others, but maybe that's because one of the characters is a literal kid. Since there's a lot of feedback regarding this, I'm hopeful the devs address dialogue content and speed as they work on various updates. \n\nOverall, I'm happy with the game as I've seen it so far, and look forward to playing the full release as Ellie tries to help her forest friends, meets new people, gets to use more potions, and has more dynamic interactions.\n", "timestamp_created": 1669744358, "timestamp_updated": 1669744358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127571670": {"recommendationid": "127571670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079931025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1297, "last_played": 1670947530}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1669741454, "timestamp_updated": 1669741454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127547119": {"recommendationid": "127547119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382017706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1700331939}, "language": "english", "review": "muito fofo", "timestamp_created": 1669731053, "timestamp_updated": 1669731053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127509560": {"recommendationid": "127509560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109481573", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 113, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1700228527}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly relaxing game with cute and witty story.\n\nI was worried about the ingredients gathering for potions,  but it is NOT a grindy collectaton!

How could I not play a game with someone who shared my namesake? Soon after I was absolutely obsessed with the game. I started out strong and played non stop for a few days before I fell off as many others do. However, I more recently with the update and beta options decided to try again, as I'd been waiting patiently for the full release.\n\nThe new beta version was so much better! It even worked great on the steam deck with some adjustments. Overall the game is an adorable little adventure about a witch who can't stand boredom, and her calling towards a village in desperate need of help. After an incident created by her own desire for adventure, Ellie finds herself trying to save a nearby village after it's destruction left it almost abandoned. Taking it upon herself to find a way to bring the village back to it's original glory, she decides to set out and get her hands dirty to do the job.\n\nThe story so far is adorable and warm and sweet. It was sometimes difficult to find the proper way to gather materials and prepare them for both requests and exploring, but I soon found that upgrading my equipment and keeping a stock pile of the more common ingredients was a huge help. Gathering things was always fun, though somewhat frustrating when I didn't realize the easier way to gather materials. Some of the potions and parts of the encyclopedia weren't exactly clear on how to properly gather materials. Pom Pom Feathers and Smile Bubble's were particularly hard for me to figure out how to gather them efficiently. After trial and error and some research I was able to find an efficient way to gather them, but I do wish there would have been a way to gather hints or something in regards to the uses of potions. \n\nI did find certain parts of my day in game upsetting, but that was less an issue with the game, and more that I wanted to have more time in the day to do things before the curfew hit. I couldn't help but want to squeeze every bit of time allowed to search for new and cooler things and ingredients. Sometimes I found myself growing sad that I was finishing up a story point, unsure when I'd fully be without another goal. I didn't want the story to end! And just being the early release version of the game, to have me sad the rest is still to come is a definite positive to me. \n\nAltogether if you like story driven indie style simulation games then you're in for a treat. Aside from having an intriguing story that has yet to be finished (as of this review at least), Little Witch in the Woods has beautiful scenery, fun exploration mechanics, and a cast of characters that both make me laugh and smile. It's an amazing game that I only happened to find due to the heroine having a matching name. And honestly, I am more than glad to share my name with our little witch.", "timestamp_created": 1669622862, "timestamp_updated": 1669622862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127348181": {"recommendationid": "127348181", "author": {"steamid": "76561199257055702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 751, "last_played": 1676745078}, "language": "english", "review": "I got quite sucked into the game!

With that being said, if you're looking for a game similar to Stardew, this is similar with some major differences. Keep in mind that this is alpha so things might change, but here were the key takeaways I have after finishing all available content so far:\n1) It is not a farming simulator. You forage for everything and you make potions and other witchling things with the stuff you gather. It looks like tools will come later, but so far you have gloves, a bug net, and a quill (for building your encyclopedia).\n2) You don't change the layout of your land or build buildings (except story-gated ones in the nearby village). There is no customization with placement. \n3) You already start off with all the apparatuses you need in your home - you have the ability to upgrade them.\n4) It is heavy in story. It doesn't just drop you off at your location and say good luck -- it takes you through cutscenes, dialogue, etc.\n\nWith that being said, I do like it. It's easy to get the hang of. I'll probably play the full version once it's out. But it's not a \"grow your own herbs\" and chill thing, and there was more dialogue than I would have liked. There is a puzzle aspect to it too, which I enjoyed. My least favorite aspect was that the foraging made me feel like I was racing against the clock to get any story done (seemed like a 10 minute in-game timer to every 20 seconds or so - you wake up at 8am and you pass out at midnight with a repercussion of sleeping in until 10am with an energy deficit the next day).", "timestamp_created": 1669437551, "timestamp_updated": 1669438228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865863680839538574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126943304": {"recommendationid": "126943304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053065971", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1663844106}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this from a lovely friend as a gift and enjoyed every second of it.

"review": "This game has a lot of good components - I like the characters, art, music, and story! Such great ideas with magic and nature and adventuring in the woods. But the early promise of an epic adventure game rather quickly quickly nose-dives into a tedious and monotonous linear task-driven gameplay that is more like a boring job than a game. A couple of days in, the tasks on my list don't have much point or payoff. The puzzles are easy; potion-making moves the linear plot forward one very small step at a time. I'm bored. There's a lot of complaints about the dialogue, but it's easy to skip and that's not the worst problem for me by far.\n\nI was on the fence of whether I should write a review or not, as I've played a couple (baffling?) \"games\" this year that just didn't feel like games to me, and this might just be a (new to me) genre I don't like. Stardew Valley is dull, an adventure game minus the adventure. There's a game about unpacking, no joke, and it's popular (?!?). Ultimately, I paid for this game due to overwhelmingly positive reviews, so I think it's only fair if I'm honest about my disappointment.\n\nThe team who developed this game is clearly incredibly talented. I'm positive that the people who created this is fully capable of writing a slightly better story. Add some tweaks to the gameplay - way more adventure and way less pointless tasks - and this could be a great game. But if they intend it to play as-is, it's a style of game I hope to avoid in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1669372909, "timestamp_updated": 1669372909, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333343267440796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126789060": {"recommendationid": "126789060", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075053456", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1669371871}, "language": "english", "review": "Little Witch in the Woods, as of right now, is a fantastic beginning of a game.

That's when I saw this game, little witch in the woods!\n\nNow, the first thing that came in mind was that it was a cute, pixel graphic game. There already are plenty of cute, pixel graphic game out there on the internet, but what this game has isn't in aany other cute, pixel graphic games. It had passion in it, the animations that are made with the pixel-graphic made sense, the creators had really put a big thought to link the accurately movment to the pixels. All the other pixel games that I have made never had this.\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay and the story, it's basically on a different level from the games that I have played. There is this normal system, which is the wuest system. There is main quest, which you do to continue the story, the character quest or as I like to call it \"sub stories\", which is smaller quest that tells us about all the character in the game, and lastly there is the delivery task, which is just for money. Sadly, when it comes to the main quest and the \"sub stories\" you won't receive any rewards when completning the quest, but it may or may not be added in the fully release. But the quest ain't just for the rewards, it is mainly for the satisfaing story.\n\nThe story and the character build is also facsinating. Usually in any other games they tends to do only an easy character build and then focus on the main story, some also focus on the character stories. Now, this game has really done well with the character design and their build, which is rare in my case. I was trying to look for a game where there was fantasy, which a great gameplay and also where the character were made with the devs heart and mind. This game has it. They really thought about all the character, gave them specific roles in the game and the story.\n\nI am hoping that this game will soon gets it full release in the future. I really want to see what more they add and I gladly will recommend this game to others.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1669202634, "timestamp_updated": 1669202634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126275284": {"recommendationid": "126275284", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216985979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1695652813}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor juego de brujer\u00eda que he probado para PC.

Every few minutes or entering a new area, ensues long dialog that serves little purpose, aside from consuming time, like the introduction dialog of the game: one minute in and I was already skipping it so I could gain control of the character as fast as possible. I understand there is a lot of things to get out there so the player can understand the basics of the game, the story and other things, but I think in this case it should be a little more \"show and don't tell\". \n\nAside from that, the graphics are really nice, the color palette is also very well thought, and in general it has a very cohesive vibe.

Too many \"hold button\" to act, though. Lots of potential already realized, but held back.\n\nSaying that the game's english translation leaves to be desired is an understatement. You can understand the flow of things, but the amount of oddities and the frequency of them are enough to muddle things. You'll hear people say \"you can speak comfortably\" all the time, and the book with the recipes will have stuff like \"Stir the ladle don't stir\" to tell you the stiring direction, which, depending on where you look, might change from \"Clockwise\" to \"right\". It's easy to tell the developers have little grasp on english. If you can forgive that, the rest of the game can be a flip of a coin.\n\nDay and night cycles changing behaviour of fauna and flora, different ways to interact with the fauna and flora yielding different results... mechanics wise, it's quite a treat. Then you have to deal with \"hold\" prompts on situations where you shouldn't need ALL THE TIME (it's not about situations that are irreversible and critical, or are going to put you into a fixed cutscene that will take a whole minute), no way of doing processing resources or making potions in batches (at least with un-upgraded gear), and things to upgrade that don't tell you nothing about what will change with the upgrade. There is promise, but lack of QoL and excesive use of hold prompts is a pain.\n\nAnimations, art and characters wise, it's awesome. The main character is funny as heck, as non-standard as you can get, being the kind of person that might light something on fire if she has the slightest belief that it will burn in a strage color. The animations are cute and funny, characterizing everything so well. Ellie is love, Ellie is life.\n\nIt kinda hurts me to give a negative review, but this game is basically one decent translation review and one QoL pass away from being the best thing you'll have in terms of a short and sweet, cute and funny potion making game ever. The base for the game is great already, there is no need to extend gameplay with obtuse prompts.\n\nI'm definetly hoping to see either 1.0 or sooner update rolling out and making this awesome, so I can change this to positive. If you think that it's a good bet, the price ain't that high, so it might be safe to believe that this will turn out great..", "timestamp_created": 1667931880, "timestamp_updated": 1667931880, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125150278": {"recommendationid": "125150278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035282587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 787, "last_played": 1695663900}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly cute and fun to play.

I personally don't mind how it as i think it helps you know who the characters are and gives you more of a feel of being inside that universe. Once you get off the train and the story starts playing out, the game becomes much more interesting.\n\nThis game has a very cozy vibe to it and has similar aspects to Stardew Valley. It has a nice mix of side quests to the main quests to help the Villagers of the town and break up the monotony a little bit. I admit, you have to do a lot of running around to find ingredients for potions, but you get the hang of it after exploring the areas and it's really nothing too different from the running around you do in SDV. Eventually you end up getting a broom, so you can travel a bit faster too. \n\nI read a previous review that states there was no way to upgrade any of your tools etc., but there are ways, they just take quite a bit of resources. The developers may have fixed that issue since the other review was made though. For upgrades, you can go to Blaine to upgrade your extractor, roaster, cauldron, etc., you go to Kyla to upgrade your storage that's inside your workshop, and you go to Aurea to upgrade your backpack space. It takes quite a bit of grinding, but as long as you do Blaine and Aurea's daily potion quests, it moves along pretty nicely in between the main story activities. \n\nI'm definitely interested to see how this game progresses.

However, I found it tedious to get into - the long dialogue-heavy intro, the character movement being somewhat slow, then being shown possible game mechanics in the house but not being clear on when/how to use them. Only met 1 villager NPC so far. Tried to come back to it to see the main gameplay loop and get into it, but just haven't gotten enough motivation and interest to do so. \n\nI think the game's beginning could borrow from what Stardew does well: show 1-2 core mechanics (like farming, or potion-making, or something) for the first in-game day or two. Pace the tutorials for the other mechanics in a way that doesn't feel confusing. Have the character start meeting NPCs early on, to build the player's connection with the game world. Improve the sprite moving speed to be a bit faster. Don't overdo the dialogues that don't build relationships or advance the story.

I really liked the \"magic\" part of it, meaning that you can craft potions and also use them independently of quests, e.g. to gain more materials from creatures or to solve little puzzles. It is also cool, that some of these puzzles are up to you to solve, so there are only hints in the encyclopedia or the surroundings. \nBut I have to agree with the other comments, that the gathering of the materials and the crafting of the potions gets repetetive after some time. In the Early Access (EA)-version you also have to craft the same potions or candys almost every day, because the daily quests of the venders do not really change over time (in my case only 3 different types of candy). \nNevertheless, I think it is already a really good game and it has potential to be even better in the final version, if there is more variety in the daily quests and maybe an option to accelerate the collection of materials: e.g. a garden, where you can grow a limited amount of plants or keep a limited amount of creatures or if someone or something could help you with the gathering.\nBesides, I liked the story, because there are quite some mysteries and background stories to be solved.

So let's get into it. \nThis game is similar to Stardew Valley in that you talk to townsfolk weather it be business related or just passing by with a greeting. You make potions from the resources you gather around the area to both sell to and solve problems for said villagers. In order to create these potions you have to gather resources from around the area and brew/craft them in the basement of the witches house. This brings me to my first issue. You will see within the first couple in-game days that this become VERY tedious. Some may say \"that's just part of the game!\" \"Monotony is the key to feeling accomplished once you're finished!\" \nNot entirely untrue, however there is no \"end goal\" to this monotony. You don't gather materials to eventually obtain an easier method of doing so. You are forced to walk and gather every single day so you can progress and do it all again next time you need to brew another potion. It get's old pretty fast, especially considering there is absolutely no promise of upgrading this aspect f the game. (I am aware of the broom, it's just another thing to repair every time it breaks.) It would be like if Stardew Valley gave you the sprinklers that you can unlock, but after a number of days you had to go around and refill them with water. There's both an easy and a hard way to solve this. I'll start with the easy.\nIf the game allowed for some form of fast travel it would cut down GREATLY on the exponentially tedious task of gathering materials every single day. It wouldn't even have to be easy to obtain. Even if it was something that needed to be unlocked it would be better than being forced into it every time. \nMy personal suggestion (and more involved/difficult) would be adding some form of growing the specific ingredients you find yourself needing the most. Maybe a sort of greenhouse that can have the available storage upgraded. Or you could only grow basic ingredients that you have found before in the map and you could only grow the more complex one's after it was upgraded. Anything is better than what is currently being showcased.\nAs for my next major point. The games music is rather charming, don't get me wrong. I enjoy the tracks for most of the areas. Now, I can't say I enjoy them played on repeat for hours on end. Stardew had the right idea with having the music run its course and then stop once it was over for the day. Not to mention there is a very prominent lack of variety in the tracks. this is an easy obvious fix and I don't intend on rambling too much about it due to the game being in early alpha I am certain this will change in some way or another.\nThe final and most massive problem for the game has to be the dialogue. It's just so h o r r e n d o u s l y awful.\nThere is a massive plethora of run on awkwardly structured sentences. The main character often is redundant on what she says. A disgusting amount of banter between Ellie and her hat is just completely unnecessary and annoying. Tons of time in this game is spent reading completely ridiculously unrealistic dialogue.The story that could have been told in a one minute cut scene at the beginning of the game is stretched unbelievably long to the point of snapping your attention span like a chickens neck on a dairy farm. It's genuinely like aliens who have never spoke to anyone made this game and are trying to replicate real human speech.    IT    IS    BAD     ... \n\n\nNow, with all this being said, yes, I do understand that this game is in VERY early development. and the dialogue and game play is subject to change. I just wanted to point out the things that I at the very least expect to have some attention drawn to them. Because as it stands I cannot recommend this game to any of my friends. The problems are just far too frequent to justify its price right now. I have seen nearly finished games to up for around $15 - $20. And I do not give games a pass on low polish just because they are cute in style. The thing is, there's a lot to do still. And I do hope this game is given more attention before it is officially released.

I was first sceptical at the beginning but with over 6 hours of game play so far I am satisfied and have vastly enjoyed my time spent on this game. If you are a fan on Stardew Valley, Terraria or Animal Crossing this is the game for you. While, being jam packed with quests and story lines it is quite peaceful and creative to play. For the cost, I am very happy. I definitely this is worth $22.95. It isnt the cheapest game out there but by far not the most expensive.\n\nIn my opinion there is plenty to explore and I haven't encountered any bugs or faults with the game which I was impressed by seeing it is still developing as I play. \n\nLittle Witch in the Woods is underrated. I strongly recommend getting this in your next purchase. \n\nRated: 8/10.\n\nEdit: Many other reviews mention locked key binds, which personally, I was completely fine with when I got a hold of the controls. However, flexibility to edit key binds or use of controller would be a nice touch and allow for more accessibility and user preference - as the game uses zero mouse the entire way through.\n\nSecondly, there doesn't seem to be a pause option.

Though, it isn't a story that should be taken serious the whole time. Still, a very good point in my opinion!\n-The vibe of the game is calming;\nA really laid back game that isn't asking you to be on the edge of your seat 24/7. A great time waster after a hard day of work. Or as a game to play while chatting with friends!\n-Graphics are just right;\nNothing too much, nothing too little, I like it.\n\nCons:\n-Has some rough edges;\nCertain things like Text popping up when transitioning in a cutscene and being able to select everything at any time while walking around can be a bit confusing or frustrating.\n-Performance is questionable;\nGames like Stardew Valley are a lot more friendly on the FPS department. Not too bad, but it is a point that can be improved on for sure!\n-Sidequests forced while playing main quest;\nWhile working on your main quest it can sometimes push side quests onto you without really asking for them. In my opinion it would be better to keep it optional. Something I can live with, but expect to be getting these often.\n-A slight edge of repetitiveness;\nAs of right now, it is mostly the same tasks you have to do to continue the game.

The character design & landscape are both incredibly cute and unique. I know this seems like a stretch but the atmosphere and gameplay actually really remind me of the first Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. A cat comes to you in a dream and asks for your help to save the town? Classic Mystery Dungeon. I enjoy the style of gameplay offered where you have 1-2 repetitive daily quests, but at the same time you have to manage your time to progress the story or unlock updates to make your life easier. If you are a fan of cute pixel RPGs this is absolutely the game for you. It is already a 10/10 in my book and I'm very excited for future updates.\n\nSome reviews mention that the dialogue is too simple or too long. I personally disagree, considering most cozy games have a lot of dialogue with getting to know & doing favors for characters being a big part of the game. However, I do think that adding more visuals that display character traits (like what already happens were characters build sandcastles/inspect trees/etc.) would make the characters seem more complex. So I think that was smart for the devs to release that in their next update.

Maybe a lot of these issues will be addressed in the full release, but as of right now it's pretty rough. The number one thing that bothered me about this game is how poorly translated the dialogue is. I know this is a Korean game and you can tell by the way things are translated and the way the characters constantly reference age and speaking formally vs informally. To someone who speaks both Korean and English this will make sense, but to the average English speaking player a lot of the dialogue would be completely nonsensical and annoying to get through. It takes me out of the game a lot to see such repetitive and poorly translated dialogue which detracts from the overall game play. I feel like the quality of this game would skyrocket if they improved this. As of right now the NPCs are also lacking in personality and say basically the same things over and over. I would love it if you could improve your relationships with characters, because the way the game is now there is basically no incentive to talk to any of the NPCs unless you're fulfilling a quest. \n\nI also found the potion-making (which is pretty much the main point of the game) to be a little repetitive and boring. It would be cool if they made some sort of mini game for the potion making rather than the way it is now. \n\nOn a positive note, I love the visuals, exploration, the creatures, and gathering materials. I think this game has a lot of charm and potential, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it until they fix some of these issues (especially the poorly translated dialogue. At first I didn't notice it too much but as the game went on I couldn't ignore it.

Obviously this game is spilling over with Charm. The protagonist, Ellie, is fun and bubbly and her hat Virgil is a wonderfully down to earth foil. In fact I enjoy the personalities of all the NPC characters and I would love to see them fully fleshed out in the full release.\n\nSomething else I'm quite fond of is the crafting and scavenging functions in the game. I enjoy the simple yet satisfying potion brewing experience and the notebook is a nice touch. Resource collection feels fluid and non-tedious and seems well balanced at least for the potions currently included in the early access. \n\nThere isn't enough I can say about the sprites and pixel art in the game, it is top notch in every regard. The fun and bouncy design of the characters, flora, and fauna all add to the relaxing and welcoming charm that this game oozes. I especially enjoy the character dialogue portraits and the notebook renditions of certain models. The soundtrack is lovely as well. The music fits the vibe of the game perfectly. \n\nOnto some things I think could be improved. I enjoy the interface for the most part but I think the crafting/storage menus could benefit from a free floating cursor and a drag and drop style organizational system. As is it can be difficult to organize storage and items the way you desire.\n\nI have also noticed some performance issues related to entering and exiting areas that require loads. Frame rate drops occur frequently, specifically when the game saves upon leaving the house in the mornings. Some optimization would likely solve this issue. \n\nI appreciate the attempt to include puzzle aspects to the game but some of the puzzles feel repetitive and boring but this may just come down to a lack of content and therefore limited options. I'd like to see the forest weights puzzle expanded on. It was the best example of progressive puzzle solving in the game. \n\nFor me this is neither here nor there but if you're coming to this game expecting the same level of world exploration as a game like Stardew Valley you will be disappointed. The story here is relatively linear and contained to a small set of locations. I don't mind this seeing as the game is more narrative focused but it isn't your classic farming/crafting game at least not at this point in time. \n\nThe dialogue is also rather clunky at times and some glaring grammatical errors may pull you out of the story. \n\nI Recommend this game and look forward to future updates :)", "timestamp_created": 1659917382, "timestamp_updated": 1659917517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120237841": {"recommendationid": "120237841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315287586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 415, "last_played": 1659900735}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cute and tranquil.

In the release, they keep basically making it seem like Ellie is an idiot and hates reading despite being the 2nd best witch in her class? It doesn't make sense and it's a bit irritating to keep bringing down the main character like that when it's clear she shouldn't just be an idiot.\n\nI want to be able to recommend but I do think there's a lot that makes it too repetitive and grindy and I'm actually really sad about it.  I enjoyed the demo very much and was glad to see more NPCs and options of things to do.

Here goes :)\n\nPros:\n- Cuuuute! Love the art.\n- Stardew Valley-like game (with an element of visual novel) but you are a little witch that sells potions and saves a village. It is less stressful than Stardew since there is (at this point) no chances of getting killed and the consequence of missing bedtime is only that you sleep in two hours more the next day :)\n- I have finished the early access part, but I see that there is a lot of potentiel for new quests, characters and stories to unfold. There was a bit of a mystery cliff-hanger that I am looking forward to see unfold!\n- You never get lost in what to do or how to do it. The game guides you well for a relaxing and progressing gameplay.\n\nImportant cons:\n- The English translations are poor. Note that they are totally understandable but just *weird* sometimes, because there are phrases directly translated in a way that just doesn't work in English (e.g. the phrase \"you can speak comfortably\", which is always answered with something like \"Thank you, then I will speak comfortably\" and then they go on to speak the same way as they spoke before and about nothing special in particular.)\n- The dialogue is often repetitive and over-the-top cute (e.g. lengthly thank-yous for being such an amazing little witch). In general there seems to be a lot of work still needed for the dialogues to make them more to-the-point and engaging.\n- The controls are annoying because you can only move with the arrows and not WASD. I hope this changes.\n\nLess important cons:\n- Haven't found any need for all the food I have gotten from villagers yet.\n- Storage/backpack is too small. Hope the option for increasing it will be implemented soon because it became annoying at a point.\n- It takes too many clicks to end a dialogue with the shopkeepers, which you will do a lot.\n\nOverall I enjoyed it a lot and I hope to see it improve and expand so that I can play it more!", "timestamp_created": 1659201675, "timestamp_updated": 1659201675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119752941": {"recommendationid": "119752941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036216228", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1658035809}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are getting this to play in English I don't really recommend it yet.\n\nIn general the game is really cute, and the concept is a lot of fun.

I fucking love this game. Am I allowed to say that? I FUCKING love this game. I bought it because I love the forest aesthetic and Stardew Valley vibes - but my goodness. The art style, animations, character designs, and pure amount of joy and serotonin I get from this game is incredible. And it's all unique!!! I can guarantee you won't find another game like it anywhere on Steam or elsewhere. This is already one of my favorite games on steam and i'm not even finished yet!!!! I only have two suggestions for the developers and they're really small / self-serving.\n\n1. The controls. When I looked up \"little witch in the woods\" on google, the very first search result is how to change the key binds. Now I'm 8 hours in to the game so I've gotten a little used to them, but for new players its hard to learn! I would love the option to change keybinds in settings so players can use familiar controls (such as shift to sprint, ctrl to crouch, i/e for inventory, e/enter to interact, etc.) \n\n2. Affection system. I would *love* to see an affection / friendship system added into the game. All of the characters are amazing and wonderful and I love interacting with them, but I wish there was a reward for being so invested in the characters! (other than Enite's delicious pies!). This is a very selfish suggestion as I really just want Arden to open up to the character more and to get sappy dialogue with Aurea as well as discounted prices if you're nice to the villagers ;)\n\nI absolutely adore this game and can't wait to see more. I'm only at [spoiler] the beginning of building Roy's house and just meeting the White Cat God - [/spoiler] so I know I'm not done with the game yet. But I can't wait to see more (more of the village, expanding the lore of this universe, etc). I am 1000% invested and in love with this game, can't wait to see it blow up.\n\nTLDR; buy this game, you wont regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1658827771, "timestamp_updated": 1658827771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119488618": {"recommendationid": "119488618", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123326668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1061, "last_played": 1672718496}, "language": "english", "review": "best game bruh,  got 17hrs out of 5hrs of gameplay. def recommend tho baes <3", "timestamp_created": 1658813253, "timestamp_updated": 1672950667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119471894": {"recommendationid": "119471894", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042655255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1684149483}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it.

A trim in some areas might do the game some justice.\n2. The control scheme was very hard to adjust to. You cannot remap the controls, but I wish that you could.\n3. Some of the buttons when interacting with characters has cut off text that you cannot read. (Like when interacting with Diane)\n4. I wish that you could pin recipes or that tasks actually tracked how many items you have/need. I caught myself having to check three different windows multiple times just to know what exactly I had to do. If you added a \"create job\" function for upgrades and whatnot, that would be helpful. Right now the player just has to memorize how many pieces of how many materials they need.\n\nAll of that aside, I am really excited for this game.

The characters are so enjoyable, hilarious, and fleshed out, and I have absolutely fallen in love with every single one of them. Last but not least the game play is smooth and easy to use and makes gathering materials more enjoyable. There have only been a few issues throughout the game like major grammatical errors/multiple misspelled words in one sentence (mainly at the beginning), characters glitching in and out of existence, text appearing before a scene changes, and music not looping properly leaving the player in silence for at least a minute.

I am really looking forward to seeing how this game progresses and it\u2019s admirable that the developers want to have players be involved with the final result.\n\nPros:\n\nThis game is adorable. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling every time I encountered a new character, part of the map, and creatures. (My personal favorite was the Blue Bubble Lizard, absolutely adorable).\n\nThis is a comfort game, for sure. If you enjoy games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing to wind down, this will likely have a similar effect on you. I loved foraging and the whole workshop concept. I felt like I could spend hours just crafting potions and other items.\n\nI didn\u2019t find any part of the game to be particularly difficult to the point of getting stuck, it was rather smooth sailing which I also believe could be ideal for people that are looking for a relaxing game that won\u2019t get frustrating.\n\nCons:\n\nThe controls are a bit awkward, it took me a while to adjust to this. Not a complete deal breaker, but might be worth adjusting for the final game.\n\nOther notes:\n\nI would love to see mushroom foraging in the future. Maybe this is in the works because there\u2019s details about certain mushrooms in a book you can read.

Though the game play has a lot of repetitiveness to doing tasks, it has a fulfilling reward for your work as you progress through the game. The puzzles I would say are on the easier side, which is fine, but I'd still like a bit of a harder challenge in thinking about what potions I need to apply to progress through the puzzle. I will say even though I enjoy the repetitive game play I know some may not so do be aware of this if you're thinking about buying it.\n[More in depth thoughts]\nThe characters have good dialog, though not a lot of it if you try to have a longer conversation with them similar to Stardew Valley's conversations, but still with more variation. The music is does its job pretty well, though some of the songs feel a little lacking in composition due to the use of one or two instruments being used at a time for long portions or the song. (though they are looped so it could just be I've listened to it to long) But just because it's simple doesn't mean its bad, I just think more could possibly be added to add variety in the melody. As I said earlier the art style is very cute (which is actually how this game caught my eye) and I really enjoy it! the characters are all really unique in design and the outfit design is very good. I'm pretty passionate when it comes to art ,so things that others may not think about in the art I really appreciate. (I also noticed the Ellie waddles like the bullets in Enter the Gungeon, don't know if that was intentional or not, but I still appreciate it.\n[Ideas for improvement]\n- there are a frequent errors in the text boxes that need to get fixed\n- Character models disappearing mostly Rubrum when he leaves town to build his castle\n- add more main game play mechanics for the player to have fun with\n[Ideas being: cooking, decorating,fishing, maybe even some sort of broom flying minigame? (farming, though I don't really see this happening)\n-more unique quests from the towns folk\n\nI know developing a game is hard and it's easy for a player to be nit picking & biased, but I understand that this game is still in early development.

It's cute and relaxing; I loved the townspeople and a lot of the ideas for the crafting mechanics and upgrades, and I'm very interested to see where the underlying story goes from here. \nI don't normally leave reviews but I decided to leave some constructive feedback/ ideas for changes since the full game is still in progress:\n1. the foraging system can get pretty old very fast, since everything is in the same location and resets every day. It would be better to have this more randomized but for certain items have a way to grow them yourself. Plus, some ingredients are needed in larger quantity for extraction but are much more limited in how you are able to obtain them, the feathers especially. \n2. you may want to explicitly say when the character \"pass-out\" function is. It ended up being a terrifying trial and error for some time, lol. \n3. the storage system was a little confusing to me, as I had two chests but only one of which i could actually use for the most part, and the expensive upgrades to the one were only for one line of slots, not another page. \n4. I would appreciate it if we could pull up the recipe book in the potions crafting menu\n5. Please let me pay back that witch lady. Please it weighs on my conscious lmao\n6. I think it would be nice to add in little events with the townsfolk, like cooking with enite and arden, or making tea with rubrum, etc. A gifting system might also be nice. \n7. I would appreciate a little customization in terms of our house and the area around it!\n8. We were supposed to be able to interact with one character repeatedly if we crafted a certain potion and consumed it before sleeping, but it never worked more than that one time- probably something put into the full game but just wanted to point it out here\n\nBesides (1) those are really just some nitpicks and I really enjoyed this game overall!!", "timestamp_created": 1657997571, "timestamp_updated": 1657997571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118917952": {"recommendationid": "118917952", "author": {"steamid": "76561199370863560", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1682695542}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games i have played and it was very fun.\nThe theme and story line is so fun and entertaining, there is always something to do and new things to explore.\ni personaly played non stop for 2 days until i finished all the houses and got ale the material in the book.\n\nLove this game and cant wait for further updates and gameplay!", "timestamp_created": 1657997196, "timestamp_updated": 1657997196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118910426": {"recommendationid": "118910426", "author": {"steamid": "76561199084584926", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1658219902}, "language": "english", "review": "Ive played about 7 hours in this game in early access.\n\nSo far I love it,\nIts a simple game and good to play whilst watching anime or movies to fill the time. \nNot difficult to grasp how to do things either. \n\nThe art style is what originally drew me to the game itself and now I am in love with the story as well. \nI dont want to bring out any spoilers to those who have not played this game yet so I wont go into detail about the story line however the dialogue is not overly long but not too short either, there is humour to it whilst also sticking to the plot.\n\nI do think there could be some improvement into the products that are sold to the witch and vise versa, there is a lot more that could be added early game side quest wise that would also allow you to add more products to be purchased, in my opinion with would extend game play for side quests. add a little story about why the person needs the products and that would in tern make the player want to complete it to hear the rest of the story etc etc. (the reason I say this is because after 7 hours I have made the same 3 products for the sellers each day but thats just my input).

I wanna meet them all~ \nAlso, their designs are unique and very very pretty \u2665\n-The experience while exploring is so smooth. I love seeing the cute mobs running around!\n-The journal is really detailed and complete, super helpful!\n-You can figure out things yourself without the game telling you, and that's great.\n-You'll make some decisions that will actually be reflected in the game. \nSmall ones, but they still count! \u2665\n-There's always something to do; From gathering or making your potions, to side quests.\n-The days are not too long, nor too short, and you can save anytime!\n\n... Well, I think we could say I love everything about it, haha. \n\n[b] There's also a couple of things I'd \"change\": [/b]\n\n-I think the font would look nice if it had that \"pixel\" style, too (mostly talking about the clock and the UI), but everything is super well placed and it still looks good, this is just a personal opinion.  \n-I've also seen a couple of typos in the dialogues (nothing too bad), but since the game is in early access and it's getting updated constantly, I think they'll get fixed soon!\n\n[b] I can't wait to see the game finished, and I really hope they add achievements and badges, that'd be amazing.

As someone who loves Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and Story of Seasons, Little Witch in the Woods scratches that casual rpg, craft and collect, puzzle-solving itch in adorable pixel graphics and in-depth world building. It's a little rough around the edges, but the developers have sound core concepts for an early access game. My Pros and Cons list (spoilers ahead!):\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\n- Rich ecosystems featuring animals and plants with unique behaviors and collection methods\n- Intricate world-building\n- Choose your own pacing\n- Relatively engaging quest lines\n- A fun and quirky cast of characters\n- Adorable graphics\n- Tests your puzzle-solving skills\n- The BROOM\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\n- Controls on keyboard are slightly clunky, especially with the broom. Space and shift are way too far from each other. I really hope the devs let the player map their own keys in the future!\n- Minor glitching. At least when it comes to the little fox, because he randomly appears and disappears sometime.\n- Dialogue. This is a major pet peeve of mine as a creative writer with a special focus on dialogue. This is especially prevalent in the intro cutscene, where the conversation jumps back and forth between topics (namely talking about the MC's boredom and info that advances the plot), while introducing information about the world that seems ham-fisted. I really hope the devs fix this in the full release, since dialogue plays a heavy role in characterization and the game places heavy emphasis on relationship building with the NPCs. \n- Wading through tons of dialogue every time to reach the special orders section from Diane. This is especially frustrating when I try to submit the requested potions and there's a new special order that day, because the dialogue I have to go through (even with holding down ctrl) is even longer. It becomes tedious. I hope further down the line, there's just an order board where all the available orders\u2014what you have to submit and when is the deadline\u2014is incorporated into the game. Something similar to the task board outside of Pierre's Store in Stardew Valley. \n- Collecting ingredients becomes tedious after 9 hours of playing. The methods to collect them are fantastic enough as is, so there's no need to improve on that front. However, having to travel to their unique locations to collect them becomes old after a while. Maybe there could be a limited farming feature in the future? Kind of like how players have a mini garden in the Sereniteapot for Genshin Impact. It doesn't grant high yields of materials due to the small number of plots, but it gives the players some breathing room when it comes to collecting materials they commonly need or can become annoying to obtain in the long run. \n- Constant back and forth to check ingredient stores and required materials necessary to craft something. I find that this is a major issue ALL games in the farming/collecting/crafting genre suffer from. I'd love to see a system where you can tag recipes you've already learned (whether it's a potion, or an upgrade for your cauldron/storage/etc) and have an overlay in the corner that keeps track of how many of that particular material you have in your backpack, or backpack AND storage. Kind of like in classic MMORPGs where they have a ticker in the corner that keeps track of your quests. Maybe this could be an upgrade you work for in game?\n\n[b]Musings for Possible Future Features[/b]\n- Right now, it doesn't seem like the shop feature has been implemented for Roy. I mentioned earlier how collecting ingredients can be tedious after a while, so I'm hoping Roy will be selling ingredients harvested from plants. Maybe he can sell seeds for the limited garden idea?\n- A map would be great. This might just be me, but I still get a little turned around by the game's map despite having 14 hours in the game at this point. This would be especially helpful if it can show the locations of all the different materials you can get in game. Maybe unlocking parts of the map can occur when you first interact with the signpost in the area? And the markers for where you can obtain materials can appear as a toggled option once you collected a certain amount?\n- Broom upgrades. I would love to see this. I adore using the broom, but I find it drifts too much and it runs out of durability way too quickly. So I'm hoping there will be a way for the player to improve their broom in-game. \n- Other biomes and locations! I'm honestly excited to see what the devs come up with. The forest-mountain-waterfall biome for the early access are fantastic enough. So what can the devs come up with for a winter wonderland? A beach? Crystal caverns? A cloud city? A volcano? A haunted castle? (I'm honestly curious how they would incorporate a haunted castle, something classically horror and man-made, in a game with an emphasis on cutesy graphics and the wonders of nature)\n- Future upgrades for the devices in the potions lab to craft/process multiple different potions/materials at once. Right now, the upgrades increase the quantity of the same material that can be processed at once, so I'd love to see future upgrades that allow you to process different materials at once. \n\nTo recap, this is one of the best games I've ever played and can't WAIT to see the full release for. I love the unique behavior of the flora and fauna and the way they make the world more magical\u2014pun intended. The characters are varied and easily likeable. The pixel graphics are fantastic. You decide the pacing, and there's enough quests and tasks in the main and minor story lines\u2014not to mention the mystery element to the plot!\u2014to keep the player engaged for a LONG time. There's just the issue regarding dialogue and something to keep track of materials to hammer out, but overall, this game has a ton of potential and I am seriously glad I came across this!!!", "timestamp_created": 1657433272, "timestamp_updated": 1657440290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118546070": {"recommendationid": "118546070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164122666", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1657419068}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.

Is this game perfect? Not at all, but that's part of what the \"early access\" tag means, and players should respect that as such. With that being said, here's what I see:\n\nPros:\n- Extremely cute and well drawn pixel avatars of characters\n- Beautiful artwork with landscape and interactive elements\n- Likable characters with cute and interesting backstory\n- A relaxing feel where you are not pushed to complete the main quests within a certain time frame\n- PLENTY of side quests for those of you who enjoy doing random extras (like me)\n- Creative recipe and potion/candy cooking setup dependent on specific ingredients and settings to make correctly\n\nThe list of pros I could definitely continue with for a bit, because they strongly outweigh the cons. However, as a recommendation, here are some things that the game could stand to improve on:\n\nCons:\n- Script - very drawn out, does not feel like natural English conversation (As a note to the developers, consider working with a script writer to determine what is necessary and what is not. That will help clean up the script to be more engaging to players.)\n- Occasional lag in button reaction time\n- Occasional interaction problems where element being interacted with will show a lack of button press (the gauge will go down instead of up when trying to do something like shaking a tree for branches)\n- Button mapping - Although I myself adjusted to the selected controls, it might not hurt to allow customizable button mapping for other players who prefer the WASD format.\n\nI sincerely cannot wait for the next phase of development on this game.

The area you play in, the hut, animals, even their names are cute. The fact that you keep a journal of the things you've encountered and that you get to explore. The pixel art is nicely done, I especially loved the scene with the giant tree and Blue moon butterflies.\n\n-Dislikes:\nNot really a huge fan of the controls, although you get used to them. I had some difficulties rearranging my things from the inventory to the box, and the dialogs were written oddly at some points (maybe that's just me Idk). Ellie's comments frustrated me a lot. Instead of her being carefree I just got the feeling she's reckless and spoiled, always getting what she wants. It would also be great if there were some shortcuts while listing through the journal. I also found some of the quests a bit unclear which made me kept wandering around the woods aimlessly.", "timestamp_created": 1657180806, "timestamp_updated": 1657187114, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118370733": {"recommendationid": "118370733", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070372275", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1659907267}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely adorable.

It is super cute, soothing and healing. I absolutely adore the pixel art, every animation looks stunning and i loved the mechanic of potion making. I've seen few people pointing out wrong English spelling but i haven't encountered it. Everything was as it should be. \n\nThe only issue that i've had was Rubrum suddenly being invisible. You could talk to him and he would appear soon but he just wasn't there. It happened only three times and haven't done anything to gameplay so i won't treat it as a big flaw. \nOtherwise the game was super fun to play. I really like the dialogues and characters - they all have their charms. I think my favorite one besides Ellie might be Kent. His suspicious and mysterious character plays a really big role in the story-telling, at least for me. \nThe early-access story already finished and i can't wait for the full release. I already want to go back into this chill, magical story and meet other villagers of Wisteria. There's also so many secrets for us to discover.\n\nGathering ingredients and recording them in a journal is really well-made. Ellie drawings are super cute and the journal really helps while making potions. I really enjoyed Mandrake's sound effects while picking up. \nThe whole process of collecting isn't boring at all and using broom to move to places faster is really useful. \nI also really like the map. For early-access it's really big i think and i hope we'll get to see even more beautiful places in the future. \nA big plus for the beautiful background music ! It's really chill and enjoyable <3\n\nI'd recommend this game  to literally everyone. I myself am not a big fan of so-called \"slow\" and chill games but Little Witch really changed my point of view.

It's more story driven than other games I've played where crafting and gathering are the primary actions you take outside of your interactions with npcs.

The localization of the story is pretty good, despite being a little literally translated during jokes about formal speech and a could of idioms. It would be exciting to see another pass at the english localization to perfect those moments, but they certainly don't break me out of having a nice time with these sweet characters.\n\nThe art style is cute as heck.

But I am willing to keep up with it because I assume this will be changed with updates.\n\nThe thing I am most excited for is fleshed out characterisation. For now most of the characters feel, robotic? As in their dialogue feels unfinished and not natural or flavorfull. This (for now) doesn't help with figuring out quests, because you have to talk to the npc's to figure out what your next quest is, yet their dialogue feels so unreal that I can't always figure out what they (or more so the game) wants me to do. \n\nBut even with all that robotic dialogue, I WANT TO talk to the npc's, the game is great at making me want to do things.

I will note that I used a Steam controller, as the game controls were easier to navigate that way (rather than using the keyboard). Overall, I liked the main character Ellie & her quests.

And particularly with Diane, it is slow-going having to back out through every sub-menu until finally being able to say \"Good Bye.\"  Having a Good Bye or immediate Exit button on each dialogue menu would be helpful. \n\nOther controls took a few minutes to figure out (such as throwing or drinking potions), I think because the cues on screen may blend in with the background too much... I also have a somewhat large monitor and didn't realize at first that additional information was sometimes appearing at the bottom of the screen. \n\nI am looking forward to learning more about Ellie, the forest, and the village. I know this is the first chapter, so here are things I am hoping to see/do in the full game:\n1) visit the flower shop and interact with Roy there\n2) learn more about Arden's past \n3) maybe go foraging with Roy and/or Rubrum for tea ingredients... and make tea! \n4) definitely looking forward to opening up more of the map, and adding more plant & creature information to Ellie's journal\n5) Hopefully have more Witch reference books to add to the Witch House library.

I love the nice, relaxing background music and I actually caught myself not needing to play my own music in the background while playing, which is rare.\nI love the art style, it reminds me of Stardew a lot, and Stardew is one of my top 5 games, so it is definitely a positive. The character design has been great so far, every new character is a pleasure to look at.\nThe dialogues could definitely use some improvements. There are a few grammatical/spelling errors here and there, and some sentences are a bit confusing and do not sound natural, but it does not take away from the playing experience.\nI am enjoying the lore, the story, and the game mechanics. An options for skipping dialogues could be useful. Also, some sort of relationship building  with other characters through dialogue and different friendship levels could be fun!\nThe only negative thing that is a bit annoying are the controls. The key binds are really random and do not make sense, and there is no option to rebind them, at least I did not find one.

I'll happily revisit the game and update my review after EA, and I look forward to seeing how it improves.\n\n~~~~\nPros:\n~~~~\n*Little Witch is rated A for adorable. The pixel art, animations, character design, conversation portraits, names of plants and animals, activities like chasing pumpkin pups or blossom birds, even just the basic concepts of many things in game, like the fact that you brew magical candy. It's all so cute.\n\n*A cozy cottagecore vibe is the game's other main strength. It doesn't want you stressing about crop schedules and remembering when someone's birthday is or which villager likes to eat amethyst, it just wants you to relax, and it is pretty good at fostering that relaxation as long as it doesn't get in its own way with clunky controls and unwanted dialogue interruptions.\n\n*No combat! At least none that I've encountered yet. That's more of a sub-point to the last one, but worth mentioning on its own. In a world innundated with games about fighting, it's nice just to be nice for a while. If there is some kind of combat later in the game please correct me in the comments.\n\n*I liked that a couple of quest-related mandatory long walks across the map were skipped with cutscenes. The world is pretty cute and worth exploring, but less tedium is appreciated now and then.\n\n*Lastly, and it's a small thing, but an unexpected VA11-HALL-A reference at the start made me giggle.\n\n~~~~\nCons:\n~~~~\n*Sometimes the game isn't cute and it's jarring. Newer Disney and Pixar movies blend some adult humour into kid friendly films really well, and Sunny Side Up should take notes. Ellie's sense of humour tends more toward crass or juvenile than subtly mature.\n\n*Little Witch leans heavily into a retro game vibe, and sadly there are areas where that detracts from the game. The controls are spot-on old school, and distractingly bad for it. Arrow keys to move, Z to select/activate/do everything, Q-W or E-R to scroll through things, S to open one menu and D for another (with no button to smoothly swap between them without backing out), X to cancel. Inventory management is awful just because of the controls involved, and potion brewing, one of the game's main activities, is similarly badly handled. It's a constant annoyance to contort my hand to get anything done and a session any longer than my two hours as of writing this review will definitely leave my hand cramped if I don't switch over to playing on my Azeron soon.\n\n*The worse sin however is Little Witch's bad writing. Dialogue is sometimes stilted, frequently repetitive or abrupt, and overall amateurish. Many characters immediately declare their motivations and history, and when they don't there's a clearly labeled button to prompt them to do so. Inexplicably there is also a button dedicated to prompting NPCs to spout the kind of meaningless jibber jabber you automatically tune out or skip whenever possible in games where very litte effort was put into the dialogue (and  it pains me to write that as a person who enjoys the roleplaying aspect of games and often hears out everything NPCs have to say\u2014I'm not usually a dialogue skipper). Virgil, Ellie's talking hat companion, is a modern day Navi, ever ready to interrupt you in the middle of something with a reminder that you haven't mashed the \"skip dialogue\" button in a while. All of this is pretty unforgivable for a game that bills itself as being all about the story.\n\nSo, if the gameplay is intentionally spare to focus on the story, and the story makes you want to skip everything, you have to ask yourself what's left? Well gosh, it's just lucky that it's so darn cute.", "timestamp_created": 1656173093, "timestamp_updated": 1656173093, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 326, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839303135871887207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117590180": {"recommendationid": "117590180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832295944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1658459530}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this is a very cute game, that is relaxing and stress-free for anyone who plays it.

Whilst there is a certain amount of resource farming, I would say  it's not too onerous - more on the \"today I am collecting X and Y\" kind of plan - most plans and upgrades can be achieved in a few days most. I did the shop quests every day and I found time to do everything else and also if I was missing something it was easy enough to scrounge up almost always within the same day. \n\nI've not noticed anything have a time limit (and I've played through the whole thing in about twice the time The Internet says it should take), so I haven't noticed any deadline goals, such as in Stardew. \n\nIt has a built in \"don't hoard excessive amounts\" factor built in - which I really like, as a video game resource hoarder. It made me actually PLAY the game and gather as I go along and have fun doing it as well as have a focus. Instead of going \"well once I have everything I can conceivably need then I will Have Fun...\" and then essentially spamming out all the story in 10 minutes. This works really well with the achieveability of the goals you want so you don't HAVE to harvest the same resource every day for a long term stockpiling project (eg Hardwood in Stardew where once you've cleared the farm you really DO need to visit the secret forest every day if you have a project planned). \n\nThe music is lovely and relaxing too. The art is adorable. \n\nCons:\nMy one big criticism is the conversation trees. There's a lot of buttons to go through for most interactions - doing the daily shop quests I found myself just mindlessly mashing Z a lot. \n\nThe opening dialogue is also very long and clunky - again I ended up mashing Z far more than I should.\n\nFor the love of anything please let me sort my inventory\n\nObviously it is early access but I would quite like some achievements scattered in to the mix for additional side projects to do. \n\nTLDR: a fun and soothing game, highly recommended", "timestamp_created": 1655770256, "timestamp_updated": 1655770256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117278277": {"recommendationid": "117278277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044386862", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 548, "last_played": 1655329298}, "language": "english", "review": "For the short amount of time that I've played it, I've had a good time with it.

This is not a farm sim, but it has a lot of the foraging concepts. Instead of using the ingredients to make mayo or yogurt, you're making potions. The game has a lot of potential. Two major cons: dialogue and price. The dialogue is brutally long and pointless half the time. Especially the intro. It took a lot to work through that intro and not give up. Literally the only reason I didn't give up was because I paid $15 for it. And $15 for early access is a little pricey. I was expecting more content.

Personally enjoy the difficulty of some of the farming, its fun that they run away some of the creatures. Maybe add more side qeust or events allong the main qeusts so that the player gets to choose what to do. It would be really fun if you let the player decide what to prioritize. maybe running more big qeustlines allong the main one. I like playing all the side qeust, it gives me a break from the main qeust, and usually side qeusts are less predictable on its outcome wich i find really fun. Also I dont feel punished if I mess up a potion. the game is very foregiving now. \nIts honestly very addictive this game. Ive been farming creatures and playing for quite some time.

The broom durability is quick to decrease! With mud and branches it would only last so long. If we can upgrade our brooms durability to actually last long or a way to upgrade our workbench so we can make the broom last long. Ellie can only run so far before her bar also decreases and needs to eat/sleep.\n\n2. With delivering potions to Diane or Aurea for luna coins/gold coins it would be helpful to chose the potion to make depending on the amount of coins given. It felt repetitive finding the same kind of potions for the same amount of coins/luna. \n\n3. The curfew! I was in the middle of catching butterflies and frogs with my net but 12am hit and everything goes black T.T It happened often which you would think I would get use to it, but honestly when potions are needed it's the curfew that snatches my chances lol\n\nThese are little things!

Look up. As it stands in early access, I currently have 35.4 hours. This game is absolutely fantastic! I did not realize it was in early access because all I saw was a cute witch game and hopped right on. Then I saw \"Thank you for playing The Little Witch In The Woods\" and realized this game was early access. I realized how much I loved this game when I was so disappointed I had to wait for more. Early access is good for feedback though, so here's what feedback I would give:\nI love the writing. It's super cute! Sometimes I feel like the characters do talk about things they should know about themselves that they don't need to repeat that could be implied instead of said. That would improve the quality of writing in this game and make it come across more cohesive. \nI also love the world building. The pen and paper to hit new discoveries is definitely amazing! I would be excited to see more hidden areas in the game, as well as a larger map. A big part of the excitement of this game so far has been the question \"What will I discover next?\" I would be so excited if more of those moments were added. I also notice that when it comes to identifying specific items with the quill, it doesn't work because you're climbing on branches. Also as far as glitches go, Rubrum randomly disappears sometimes which can break immersion in the game. It's pretty often this happens. \nI love the system for making potions and candies.

Also if you happen to harvest a material near another sprite it might disappear\n\n3:The game isn't complete but the story line is super interesting! I am super excited to see what comes next!\n\n4:The communication mechanic is sort of confusing the only important option is the store options and the chit-chat/personal story options are pretty much the same thing. Maybe it will be important later? I also noticed the text fits a bit weird in the text bubbles.\n\n5: I wish you could change the key binds within the game, fortunately for me im left handed but i can imagine how frustrating this game might be for right handed folks\n\n I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys gathering and crafting games!

The game has no overall time limit, however there are two portions of the game that are time-restricted. The game presents a very light, cute art style, and a very calm atmosphere. The interactions within the game seem to be intended to not rush the player, you go at whatever pace you feel the need to.\n\nThe game is in early access, and as such is a rather short game. The near 9 hours I have on record at time of writing this review was by no means the quickest time to complete the game.\n\nThe game is designed in such a way that progression is linear, but rate of progression is not intended to be constant. You chose how long it takes you to progress. If you want to spend the day doing everything you can to progress faster you may. Otherwise if you wish to spend a few days just gathering ingredients for potions and storing them, that's also an option.\n\nIt is in no way meant to impart stress, or any feeling of urgency, while you enjoy the atmosphere.\n\n[b]Technical/Mechanics:[/b]\nTo say the game is not optimized for keyboard, in my opinion, would be wrong. It is designed around the QWERTY layout as that is still the most common layout globally. There is no current way to remap controls. If you play on something other than QWERTY then you may run into some hardships with the game. I did not play this with a gamepad so I have no input on that. In my case my BACKSPACE is on the bottom of my keyboard near my left thumb, this meant it was difficult to easily move faster, the sprint button is SPACE, however sprinting is hardly necessary in the game.\n\n[b]There is no mouse support for the game. There is no need for mouse support in the game. Controls are either KB or Gamepad[/b]\n\nThe rest of this section will be marked as a spoiler in case people would rather figure these mechanics out for themselves\n\n[spoiler]Each day of the game starts at 8AM. This is the first time restriction in the game. So long as you sleep between 8PM and 12AM the next day will start at 8AM. If you are not in bed by 12AM the game forces you to sleep and start a new day, in this case the day starts at 10AM, costing you 2 minutes of potential play.\n\nGame time progresses at 1 hour per minute spent playing and progresses in 10 minute intervals.\nTime does not update until the 10 seconds have passed for the 10 minutes. So you have 9 seconds between each interval before updating to the next.\nAs a playable day is 8AM-1150PM you have 13 minutes and 59 seconds given to each day.\n\nThe second time-restricted portion of the game is the daily quests. You have from 8AM (at the earliest, but whenever you choose to start the quest is your start time) until 6PM the following day to complete these. In total giving you 23 minutes and 59 seconds to complete the two daily quests. These quests can be completed within the day you receive them assuming you start them first.\n\nYour personal inventory, and your at home storage, are fairly limited at the start. Your personal inventory, after about 6 quests with the first daily quest NPC you meet, can be upgraded by that NPC. Your storage upgrades come later.\n\nThe game does have a stamina gauge. When the stamina is out you are not able to gather or sprint, however you suffer no other consequences. Eating food allows you to regain a portion of your stamina, which would allow you then to gather more or sprint home.\n\nThe second daily quest NPC is what allows you to upgrade your workshop. These upgrades will allow you to process multiple of each ingredient as well as craft more potions at a time. That NPCs daily quests give you the currency needed to perform those upgrades.\n\nCertain creatures that are hidden or hard to see will have sound cues when you're nearby.\n[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1655062039, "timestamp_updated": 1655062312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862296462059020996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116882641": {"recommendationid": "116882641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260081224", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1598, "last_played": 1681864936}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend playing with a controller, after I read the reviews I didn't bother using the keyboard.

First of all, the art-style is adorable, I love the way the characters are drawn when they're talking or interacting with others, the mechanics and potion making are also very cute and visually appealing. The game does have a few issues, including the fact that the characters do not have enough facial expressions (I mean in the more detailed drawings of them during interactions), there should be multiple stills used they should also be a bit more exaggerated, especially since this is an anime-style game (which are usually known for their wide variety of facial expressions). I also think that the characters' dialogues should have a bit more personality during interactions, for example maybe they could give Ellie a nickname whenever they talk to her or they could be more excited sometimes when interacting (write some sentences in full caps or use more exclamation points) it would also be very nice if the player had an option where they could choose what Ellie says in response to some characters; it would also be very helpful to some people in the game where if they need a hint/they're stuck in a part of the story there's one character which they could ask whenever they want.

I have been waiting for over a year for this game to come out. I'm so happy they decided to have an early release. I binged this early release version on my days off, and played nonstop.

For the the longest time I did not realize she was speaking to another character. I thought she was having a conversation with herself.\n-There was a bug with the lantern quest where my inventory was full, and I was not able to receive the map. Luckily I found the lantern anyway, and was able to continue on the quest.\n-I think the potion making is great. I had a blast with it, but I think it would be a lot more fun if there was a way to combine the book and cauldron interface together, so you could easily reference what ingredients you need without having to exit out of the cauldron page and go back into the potion book. It would also be easier to make multiples of the same potion all at once for those daily quests when you have duplicates of ingredients. \n\nI can not wait for the game to fully release!

Maybe, when the game is more stable, they could potentially create seasonal versions of the map and village with mini holiday quests for things like new years or halloween.", "timestamp_created": 1654881628, "timestamp_updated": 1654881628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116775635": {"recommendationid": "116775635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836806062", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 543, "last_played": 1654880568}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed playing the early access of this game.

Well I can see a lot of people are complaining. Maybe because I don't play game that much, and obviously there are still many little details that bugs me and needs to work on. HAHA PUN.

That being, price, it's expensive, A LOT, I mean, in Brazil it's costing R$30,99 wich is more than stardew valley, hell, it's almoust the same price as some Triple A games when they are with discount and for a game that don't have more than a hour and half of fun to ofer, it's not even close to worth it.\n\nSecond, the dialogs, I'm not much of a \"story caring\" person (if that's exist) so, don't being capable of skipping the dialogs make me so damn bothered cause they keep talking the same thing every single time and not being capable of skiping it, is a torture.\n\n\nThird and the one who bothers me most, the inventory space , itens stack and management, they are terrible. I mean, having a max stack of 20 for wood, 10 for apples and etc, this is the wrost thing possible in a griding game, mostly when you need to upgrade your storage chest forcing you to trow away itens and regraiding the same thing over and over again.  \n\n\nFourth, Ellie speed, she is... SLOW, a lot, looks like her legs are broken and she is dragging herself, at least, the broom is pretty fast and you recive it very early in the game.\n\n\nLastly, and the one that bother me the less, controls, since i'm a avid emulator player, i'm used to this type of control.

There's no combat though, it's overall relaxing and more focused on gathering and storyline. \n\nIt's obvious that it's not finished yet as the storyline cuts off abruptly, but I didn't mind as getting to that point took me 16 hours of gameplay. There are some errors in the text, but nothing too bad. The controls were the most bothersome and I hope the developers are going to change this for the final release - there are a ton of different buttons to memorise for stuff like scrolling through various menu options and I kept messing it up, very counterintuitive. If it allowed for using a mouse, the controls could be much easier. Sometimes clicking through repeating lines of dialogue until I can get to the part where I deliver the quest item was tedious too, so I'd have preferred having a shorter way to navigate the NPC talk menus when I'm just buying or selling. Oh, and I basically never used the broom, maybe I'm just not adept at the controls but I didn't find it much faster since I kept bumping into stuff. The character has a nice walking speed so I didn't mind much.\n\nIf you hate Stardew Valley and aren't up for repeated farming of ingredients, this game might not be for you. I enjoyed the gathering and crafting and leveling aspects, and the storyline and characters are cute, so I am glad I bought it. The little codex with the creatures and plants is an adorable concept.\n\nReading some of the negative comments, I don't necessarily agree with people's complaints about the \"fetch requests not being motivating\". For me, advancing the storyline, getting cutscenes and helping the villagers was motivating and felt meaningful, and the quality of life improvements you can buy were nice enough to want too. If you don't find that motivating enough, I guess it's not for you, sure. \nAs for the game being difficult because \"some animals are only found certain times of day\" and \"you have to really plan ahead\", I can only say that Stardew Valley is much, much more complicated than this (to the point where reading the wiki is near essential) and that seems fine too.

Little Witch in the Woods is an adorable game with amazing music, environment, and characters. \nThe early access only has the prologue and chapter one of the story so there is a bit more story than what is out now. However, I know the story is not what some people like, it can be summed up in fetch and crafting quests. With limited inventory space, those quests can be annoying at times, but I really like it. \nApart from leveling up your crafting tools, there is not much stuff to do other than the story and character quests. Compared to stardew, Little Witch in the Woods lacks freedom and stuff to do between quests. But it does not mean it is not good and that I don't love it with all my heart. It is a different game with its own unique story and cute world that deserves to be considered.

The art, the animation, the lush environments, and aesthetic themes are so charming. However, it breaks my heart to say I cannot recommend this game in its current state. \n\nThe core gameplay mechanics of crafting and socializing with NPCs is one I love, but this game fails to properly engage the player with these mechanics in a meaningful way. In an attempt to impart major lore and overarching narrative, the tutorial stages of the game become cluttered with rambling dialogue and a linear quest progression that feels more restrictive than it ought to be. \n\nI think it was a mistake for the developers to start players off with such tedious and slow progression. Inventory space is comically small for the various crafting ingredients and multiple stages of item refinement required to craft a single item. Ingredients themselves all have a unique, but time-intensive gathering mechanic that does not have incremental improvement. The pacing of refining materials is locked behind progression. You start off only crafting items a single unit at a time and it takes too long and too many different resources to improve.\n\nThis pacing feels unnecessarily punishing and is a physical strain on the hands as there are several inputs required by the player in any given step and no way to automate these processes. Too many elements of the game have a stamina or breaking mechanic that creates conflict in managing your resources and inventory space. Quests are time sensitive. Certain resources and NPCs have limited availability throughout the day and night cycle. Time management takes a lot of trial and error. You'll find yourself frequently exiting to the main menu to pause and plan out your next steps.\n\nThis isn't even scratching the surface on the game's other more obvious technical problems. The keyboard controls are a joke. They hurt to play and cannot be remapped. The developers should take responsibility and warn players that the game is not optimized for keyboard and mouse. Even if you are using a gamepad, there is a lot of un-intuitive menuing and you are not paused while doing it. \n\nThe unintentionally stressful gameplay really does not live up to its warmhearted, soothing story theme, and really need serious rebalancing and reworking before I can recommend anyone drop money on it.", "timestamp_created": 1654548790, "timestamp_updated": 1654550092, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698130309581756592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116589618": {"recommendationid": "116589618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987002899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 475, "last_played": 1700601583}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1654544390, "timestamp_updated": 1654544390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116587717": {"recommendationid": "116587717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044848797", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1654540835}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing but an absurd amount of clicking through screens and screens of dialogue before you get to any gameplay, even before being able to move your character.

This would introduce new terrain/creatures/ingredients/NPC's that might help evolve the gameplay experience. \nOf course this would mean A LOT more work, and i'm already thoroughly impressed in what the makers of this beautiful little game have already created. \n\nAlso, I need a Squishychub in my life.", "timestamp_created": 1654492358, "timestamp_updated": 1654492358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116558493": {"recommendationid": "116558493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202307056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1678040560}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished the early access of this game, and I really loved it! The art style and character designs are amazing, and the world is really cute and fun to explore. It was a surprisingly long early access version that really captivated me, but there were a few specific things I feel like could be improved for a more final version of the game (I'll try to keep this as spoiler-friendly as possible!).\n\nFirst, the dialogue. As many others have noted, it's tedious to get through, and I have skipped passed important information numerous times and had to try to figure out controls or directions after the fact. It seems like the dialogue may have originally been in a different language and translated directly over to English because of the manner of speaking the characters have . If this is the case, I think it explains the clunkiness of the dialogue; both the literal translations of words plus the manner of speaking that is also directly translated over may lead to awkwardness in the dialogue that ends up causing us to skip through dialogue and missing important information.\n\nAlong with the potential direct translation, there are a couple of moments when dialogue could be excluded. For example, you will work on a puzzle in order to achieve a direct result (unlocking an area). Once you complete the puzzle, the game shows us that the area unlocked, but then Ellie and her hat have four or so lines of dialogue asking if something happened and then confirming that something must've happened. The dialogue here isn't necessary though, because we knew the objective coming into the puzzle and saw what happened as a result. It's something small, but following \"show, don't tell\" will help the dialogue issue even more.\n\nLastly, the only other thing that bothered me was the amount of stamina restoration items you receive when, so far, the game hasn't given a reason to use those items yet. I only gather ingredients when I need them and focus on the quests rather than constantly making rounds to gather things. Even when I did try that strategy, I quickly ran out of storage space and didn't end up using all of the ingredients I happened to save by the end. So, with my limited storage space and stockpile of commonly-used ingredients, I really didn't have room for the fruit and other recovery items since I never used them.\n\nAnother issue with the stamina is that I usually had plenty to do everything and more that I wanted to do in a day and found myself having to kill time before I could go to bed. Basically, just got bored.\n\nIn my opinion, sprinting around and/or certain actions should cost more stamina. It would make sense for players to struggle to be able to do EVERYTHING in a day, forcing players to prioritize quests and tasks over others and also making the player panic a little if they are out too late at night and it hits 11pm. \n\nAll in all, the game is very unique with great characters, a great world, and interesting controls. I'm sure that, should there be a final version of the game, it will be amazing.

It's a darn shame article writers continue to mention Stardew at all online. This is a gather/craft/quest focused RPG. You upgrade your facilities, your stash, your inventory and your ability as a potion-making witch. You gather ingredients for your potions and unlock new areas to explore to help you do what needs to be done. \n\nThe controls are clunky, but they are easy to get used to with a little patience and practice. -- My hope is that controls will be customizable as time goes on, but now that I've put so many hours into this key profile, it's really quite intuitive.\n\nThe Korean to English translation isn't consistent. -- Minor grievance to me, but some might find it off-putting.\n\nThere is a lack of variety in daily quests. -- As the player progresses through the game and unlocks more areas with more ingredients, the daily quests don't change and stay on par with the main quests' demands. I spent too much time in the beginner area farming older materials for daily quests imo. This left me feeling rushed trying to get daily materials while still trying to get what was needed for the main quests and side quests.\n\nPotion book is unwieldy when you are wanting to make a lot of the same kind of potions in one sitting. -- Please have the potion book remember the last ingredients, heat and stir you used. Also add the ability to favorite recipes that you use a ton. Keep it limited to 3 recipes or something. Maybe also keep it an upgradeable thing that you unlock with currency, or perhaps introduce player levels dealing with recollecting recipes so you don't have to constantly check your book. Given that there are daily quests, it gets old very quickly to go back and forth in the book and the inventory. *I'd like to add a disclaimer that I have not upgraded the cauldron, nor have I explored super in-depth into the upgrade systems in place. Perhaps some of these things already exist and I just don't know about it yet.\n\nTravel and mobility is great. -- You don't feel burdened by travel mechanics in this game. Default move speeds are generous. The broom is quick, but be careful maneuvering too quickly in tight spaces.\n\nStorytelling is fun and engaging if you give it a chance and skip the fluff. -- No complaints about the amount of dialogue. It's skippable, so why would I complain? I skim read to get the gist of what's going on and spam skip the fluff that many people would probably find endearing. So far, I've enjoyed what's going on in the story set up. I'm sure I'll read everything when the game releases!\n\nThe gathering mechanics are what shine to me. There's small amounts of uniqueness to how you gather certain items and that keeps things fresh. There's variety and inspiration behind the ingredients for sure! Some ingredients require a bit of brainpower and trial and error to obtain. This is really awesome for those who love to puzzle out how things work.\n\nI am very glad I decided to support this game. It may be early release, but I've already put more than enough hours in it to make up the cost.

It would be immensly helpful if Players could rebind the keys. right now the Keylayout is very weird, unlike any I have every seen and it does make playing a bit complicated when you have remember to press z instead of e for doing stuff. If Players could just rebeind their own keys, that would probably be best.\n2. It is clear that this isn't a game that was originally in english. Most of the Dialogue is fine and understandable, but it often sounds a bit unnatural in english when the Characters keep referring to the Player and themselves in third person. It is ust not something that is done in the english language and it sounds very stiff. And there were a few instances where I actually couldn't follow the Dialogue entirely, because it became very convaluted and seemed to aprubtly end.\n\nThese two things aside the game is very charmin, the music is pretty and I like the Ingredients gathering and Potion crafting system.

Making maple essence was the only ingredient I really dreaded needing because it's used often (or at least in the recipes I made a lot), and it's kind of annoying to get because it's slower and out of the way.

The art style is cute, the music is nice, the atmosphere is relaxing! The game is similar to Stardew Valley, as many have mentioned but like the kiddie pool version of it. There's no where near as much world and nowhere near as much to do, which can be expected from an early access game.\n\nHowever for the most part, all you're going to be doing in this game is tickling a few creatures and whacking a few plants to get materials to make potions that either advance the story or get you coins. Day in, day out. You unlock a new area, in the story, you get a new ingredient, you make a new kind of potion that either advances the story line or can be made for daily quests for coin. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.\n\nThe only break from that, is that you have a few areas and 'secrets' that require certain potions to make to explore. Which returns you to that grind to get the parts to make it. It was fun for maybe the first hour or three but soon it becomes a daily chore that has no purpose. The easiest way to put it for you Stardew Players is, it's the game if you buy a Member Ship card and have to farm corn over and over to pay for the village upgrades. The monotony hits quick and the game instantly loses any appeal it had.\n\nAnother thing many players complain about is the dialogue, I personally had no problem with it as for awhile I was invested in the story but there is no skip option and there is a LOT of dialogue that you cannot avoid. I would recommend if the developers either A, added a skip option for the players who aren't interested or B, added a some of the dialogue in little gab windows that pop up near the top of the window so they can still move and play while the main character is yapping to her hat as 9/10 times, they're saying something that doesn't really NEED to be up in the players face.\n\nTLDR; The game has potential, it's cute and fun but at the present it's lackluster and monotonous after a while with slow grindy progression and a very small amount of gameplay. \n\nThe game will probably improve drastically when it's finished and has more interesting content to take part in, but for $16 it's little more than a flash game where you interact with creatures and plants to make keys that advance the plot or give you money.", "timestamp_created": 1654280249, "timestamp_updated": 1654280249, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 371, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866532683372497559", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116421944": {"recommendationid": "116421944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087104295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1680559937}, "language": "english", "review": "\u25b8amazing story and pacing..! the art and aesthetic is very comfy and I enjoyed playing through it for around 10 hours..!\n\n\u25b8the controls are a bit wonky since WASD isn't used for movement, but it's still learnable..! \n\ncomfy/10!", "timestamp_created": 1654261278, "timestamp_updated": 1654261278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116420974": {"recommendationid": "116420974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055139780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 791, "last_played": 1653686771}, "language": "english", "review": "What a cute little game!

It is more a click-along story or movie that introduces you to the main characters and their background, and sets the plot. It is well made, and has many funny comments. But it is lengthy, and might be a barrier for people who do not like to read lots of talk bubbles in a game, just to start.\n\n\nMy personal wish list:\n- reconfigurable controls, like switching the yes/no or do/cancel activity at least\n- re-check the assignment of items to storage places. imo all potions/candys/.. should go to the potions storage\n- also storage management: please allow larger stacks in inventory and storage\nMaybe also the possiblity to acquire different outfits?

You can't use the mouse to click on menu stuff (even the main menu), but that's bearable compared to having to navigate using the arrow keys when you play a hundred other games that follow WASD. \n\nFor people who are not too much into random banter between characters, you will have to suffer through an inordinate amount of small talk (or \"chit-chat\" as the game puts it) before getting to the point. I understand that the devs put in a ton of work into the conversations and it should be appreciated, but also please understand that there are people like me who only get to play in short bursts and cannot spend time swimming through 34 lines of conversation just to be allowed to get to the one line that tells us to make this or that potion to move the story along. (I won't complain about typos or grammatical errors as others have since I didn't really pay attention enough for it to bother me.)\n\nSpeaking of moving the story along, the game takes its sweet time slow walking you through how things work, but is also incredibly lacking. You normally want to hit the ground running and just start crafting a bunch of potions and build your witchy business up, but nope, you have to go through the tutorial, one quest at a time. Every single feature is locked behind a quest. But somehow the quests will not just tell you straight up what you need to do, you have to go about it in a roundabout way, talk to everyone in town, before you are finally taught how to do the most basic thing.\n\nBUT, if you manage to put up with all that, and eventually get to the part that (mostly) allows you to do whatever you want, it is ok. The game, like I said, is adorable and if I could play this on my Switch lying down, instead of in front of my PC in between work stuff, I would have more patience for it. As it is, if you are like me, I do not recommend it in its current state.", "timestamp_created": 1654227889, "timestamp_updated": 1654227889, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116405925": {"recommendationid": "116405925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074296317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1694060796}, "language": "english", "review": "I adore this little game!

The style is adorable and I really love the story so far. There are a few translation issues but they are few and far between. I see that a few people say that the gameplay is repetitive but I personally love that! The potion making and material gathering is repetitive but very enjoyable and calming. The potion materials have different ways to be gathered and it adds the tiniest bit of nuance between each item. It is a very dialogue heavy game but the story is interesting so I enjoy all the dialogue and find myself constantly talking to characters to try and find new character interactions, side quests, and general information about the world and characters.\n\nPros:\n- Cute game\n- Fun story with a great cast of characters (and more to look forward to in the full game).\n- Enjoyable gameplay\n\nCons:\n- The keyboard controls do take a little getting used to but if you're like me and start playing this game religiously the controls become super easy and second nature.\n- The few translation issues take you out of the story for a second.\n\nPersonal Question:\n- Upstairs in the With's House the bookshelf we investigate also has a window like it has the function of a chest but I haven't been able to find what could go in it. Is that supposed to happen? If it is another chest what does go in it?\n\nThings I would like to see in the full game:\n- Some kind of broom upgrade so that is needs to be fixed less often/doesn't break so fast.\n- A way for us to know how much potions cost if we've sold them before. That would be really handy.\n\nAll in all, a super fun and cute game that I highly recommend!

I don't see the awkwardness everyone else is seeing.

Really love the character designs, the art style, and the gameplay. I'm also one of the players who loved the abundance of conversations and honestly, I kinda want more. But that probably comes with the fact that there are only a few NPCs to talk to at the moment, so the amount of conversation really helps make the town feel more authentic. Also, I did play the game in Korean, and I know Korean language can feel much more compact on the eyes for reading, so there's that. \n\nPros\n- Amazing and distinct art style\n- Intuitive UI and gameplay\n- Interesting map designs that encourages exploration\n- A female protagonist that actually sounds like it wasn't written by a weeb\n- Heart-warming conversations that don't feel forced (at least in Korean language)\n- Demonstrates potential for variety of gameplays like puzzles, exploration, collecting, etc. Excited to see how much they can develop on puzzle ideas especially.\n- ROY\n\nCons or more like my hopes\n- Would love to see more depth in the relationship with townspeople. Like some people suggested, having a friendship stat and getting individual events would be awesome, even without romance mechanics.\n- Some more customization options would be great. I feel like the game already teases this with a few events, and I love how subtle those were compared to just giving the players some pop-up choices. Would be great to add some more personal flavors to the house & town & Ellie's looks.\n- Minor inconveniences like not being able to sort items is a little tiring. It's acceptable now with the limited variety of items in the EA but it could get overwhelming in the full release.\n- Upgrades for the witch house feels a little underwhelming for the cost, but could be just preferences....? I personally feel like I'll just press everything twice instead of upgrading since I wasn't really collecting more ingredients than I can handle. Perhaps this might change if there's also an upgrade for collecting stuffs?\n\n\n\ucd5c\uace0\uc5d0\uc694 \uc774\ub7f0 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ub9e4\ub044\ub7ec\uc6b4 \ubaa8\uad6d\uc5b4\ub85c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub2c8 \ub108\ubb34 \ud589\ubcf5\ud574\uc694\u3160\u315c\u3160 \ub108\ubb34 \ub530\uc229\uace0 \uadc0\uc5fd\uace0 \ubb34\ud574\ud55c\ub370 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub3c4 \ub193\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc774\ub7f0 \uc774\uc57c\uae30 \ub108\ubb34 \ud544\uc694\ud588\uc5b4\uc694... \ub300\uc0ac \uc4f0\uc2e0 \ubd84 \uc808 \ubc1b\uc73c\uc138\uc694 \uc9c4\uc9dc...", "timestamp_created": 1653929115, "timestamp_updated": 1653929115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601328909397125244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116248798": {"recommendationid": "116248798", "author": {"steamid": "76561199175103029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1695943554}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful little game!

But feel good to use when used to them.)\n- No way to adjust control bindings.\n- Ability to skip time, which isn't used often, but oh boy when it's needed it is super useful.\n- Cut-scenes leave you at the beginning of the area they take place in and most often only start when entering said area. (Helps with disorientation)\n- Very few bugs encountered in early access.\n\nOnly problem I kept facing was wanting more time in the day, but nothing is super rushed for time in this game.

You play as Ellie, a young witch who is bored of school and learning and wants to get out to strengthen and develop her skills and understanding.\n\nThe main aim of the game is to create Potions and Candies, done so by using items and materials that can be gathered from the main area, and utilising them to continue exploring other areas to fill up your Encyclopaedia and support the World and NPCs. Little Witch has a gathering system like that of Stardew Valley, but includes the Potion/Candy Creation System, which uses various tools to prepare the materials, and the Cauldron to create the Potion or Candy.\n\nThe game starts with a lengthy introduction to Ellie and the story of Little Witch in the Woods, all set on a train, whilst you get use to the controls and how to interact with characters or items within the world, and you're introduced the dialog system of having chatting options, questioning options, and side-quest options. The introduction helps set up the feeling and experience of the game and provides a strong start for the player.\n\nThe game itself is very engaging, and you\u2019re always going to feel like you\u2019re doing something. This is through providing motivation in terms of upgrading work tools, to creating Potions/Candies for daily hand ins. Little Witch makes you feel like there is something to do, even if you do not think there is. Some gatherable items can only be gathered at certain times of the day, to interacting with NPCs within the area and getting to know their interests.\n\nAlthough still in Early Access, there can be a few bugs in terms of interaction with items or gathering, however most of the game plays very well and has been a very enjoyable experience. The main story ends off after following the main quest line and some main objectives have been completed, so there is a sudden halt to the story, but you\u2019re still able to continue playing free roam. Below is a Pros/Cons list of the game from my point of view:\n\nPros:\n- Great Potion/Candy Creation System \u2013 although simplistic -, but includes different ways to create Potions/Candies through Cauldron Heat and Stirring options\n- Great puzzle system, which is simplistic enough in terms of how to utilise potions or candies\n- A so-far cute and easy-to-get-into story, but offers enough mystery to encourage you to continue and explore further\n- Great art style from the locations and areas to the sprites of the characters, and includes a Date and Day/Night cycle \n- NPCs help make the game feel alive, and offer a variety of personalities, through normal interaction to shop usage\n- Clear instructions towards what to do and how to progress, and offers a menu to show progress of quests\n- Quests and Side-Quests always encourage you to do something, whether it be for gathering or creating potions/candies, however, you do not feel the need to rush anything\n- An easy to access Encyclopaedia system, encouraging you to write down gatherable materials and wildlife around the area, whilst holding Potion/Candy recipes\n- A simplistic inventory and storage system to hold gatherable materials and crafted materials\n\nCons: \n- English translation can be confusing at times when it comes to reading dialogue, with some mistakes in terms of words or spellings\n- The Prologue is very lengthy and can be slow\n- Although nap system is a good implementation, it is limited to where you can nap and for how long\n- Inventory and storage system could have a \u201cSort\u201d button or include options to sort inventory/storage\n- There is a lack of an Autosave system for the moment, so before quitting, make sure to save\n- A set controls scheme in place for Keyboard and Mouse, which can lead to hands aching due to placement of keys/controls, or dis encourage players that are not used to RPGMaker controls\n\nOverall, I have had a positive and enjoyable experience with Little Witch of the Woods, and have completed the main story/side quests that are accessible within 8 hours of game play. I look forward to Little Witch's updates and am eager to see what they will implement and how they will improve the game.", "timestamp_created": 1653845317, "timestamp_updated": 1653845317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116203454": {"recommendationid": "116203454", "author": {"steamid": "76561199287717907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1684258211}, "language": "english", "review": "This is definitely a cute little exploration/farming game!

Ellie. \n- Good Quests list, everything is explaining quite clear in it own regards. \n- Game mechanic seems simple enough\n- BGM is good, very relaxing\n- UI is okay-ish since everything is in one-reach, you don't need to do anything much to access Inventory and etc. \n\nImprovable takeaways \n- NPCs sometime disappears right in front of player. \n- Gathering Material sometimes seem a bit off, especially while shaking a tree you could suddenly stopped and need to hold Z once again.\n- Key Binding Option is needed. \n- Stamina should be able to increase by some craftable potion/candy.\n\nNOTE: I face some FPS dropping from time to time, I do not know if this is normal or not (CURRENTLY RUNNING WITH RTX2070 Super) hope it will be fixed by the time this game is released.\n\nOverall the game is very cute and soothing, and the environment gives me a relaxed vibe. \n\nPersonally if the key-binding can be changed I would rate this \"9/10\" since the game is still in Early Access, so for now I would rate this \"8/10\"", "timestamp_created": 1653843024, "timestamp_updated": 1653843185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116201202": {"recommendationid": "116201202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122464290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1653841371}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely going to keep playing if they release more content.

(2) the control mapping is awkward, and there's no way currently to re-map them. I'm a mouse + keyboard user, but I definitely default to the traditional WASD. You're forced to use arrow keys to move around, while WASD is relegated to other functions.

However, once you really get into the game, you appreciate the witty and well written conversations between the characters -- some speech is redundant but most just adds to your immersion \n- The game is very good at steering players in the right direction without revealing too much and ruining the story\n- Roy. Who doesn't love the juxtaposition of a stoic man being a flower lover? \n- The soundtrack is super relaxing and cute \n\nCons:\n- I would recommend playing with a controller as the key binds for keyboard can be a little confusing if you are not familiar with these type of games -- however, the game is by no means unplayable with the default key binds, it would just require a little time to familiarise yourself with them \n\n\nHopes for the full release:\n- Friendship levels with villagers and potentially a love interest? (which is likely as one potion speaks of creating a romantic atmosphere) -- I would like to give gifts to the villagers and learn more about their interests \n- A way to improve the stamina function -- I like how your max stamina depletes as the day goes on, however, once you get further into the game and have more materials to gather it can be a little irritating to see how quickly it dries up. Of course you can just eat food but, if you have spent the day gathering, you can't fill up the whole bar to full again so, maybe they could introduce a temporary increase in stamina potion or an increase in endurance when foraging and bug catching? \n- There are upgrades in terms of machinery (extractor, cauldron and roaster) -- I would like to see an upgrade in gathering, maybe a luck boosting potion that increases the likelihood of drop rates from animals or double the amount of plants/fruit picked \n- Maybe a broom upgrade - using sturdier materials to increase the durability (not necessarily the speed as I think it has a good gauge on that part already) \n- When you craft a potion it can either be correct or incorrect -- I would like to see the animation on the successful potion be a little more colourful? It is currently a grey-ish colour and doesn't really scream successful potion -- WITCH IT UP! -- make the cauldron explode and be over the top!!! Potentially unique potion animations per potion (I do realise this would be very hard to develop but, it would be amazing to see that level of detail) \n- Introduce the self-save option a little earlier in the game -- it can just cause stress as players feel like they can't leave the game when they want for fear their progress will be erased \n- I would love the game to potentially explore Highlion either at the very end of the game or as a follow up game -- to see where Ellie was going to stay and what her life would have been like if not for staying in Wisteria -- Furthermore, playing as Ellie's mother and seeing her relationship with Virgil would be very interesting as a sort of prelude game to this one. \n- There is a lot of unexplored history of Ellie's time in magic school and Ellie's mother so, a flashback would be really cool to see -- or flashbacks to certain events in magic school that got Ellie into trouble (the story behind her finishing 2nd in her year but also being rebellious is a fun trait so, seeing more of that side to her would be very cool)\n- Definitely interested in more villagers! as well as more lore building around the town and universe in general \n- Maybe one of the characters should warn Ellie that staying up past 12 is dangerous and she should sleep before then (since you faint in game after 12 am) \n- Maybe add a baking function -- it could be funny that a witch would need to use a basic oven to make food and not via their cauldron \n- Waiting for Rubrum to brew and pour me some tea as well as buy Roy's flowers. \n- Potentially a change in outfit (obviously not the hat (Virgil) as they are our companion) -- maybe a different look for our broom or a new cloak (purely aesthetic) \n\nAll in all, for a game in early-access, I think the Little Witch in the Woods is very well made, you can tell a lot of love went into this game as it gives you an overall feeling of happiness and relaxation.

My memory is not good remembering every materials& steps needed for each potion :'3\n- I think the night cycle is too dark and can be lighter, but maybe it's just me. It makes the glow effects more pop up but a bit hard to see other stuff that's not glowing.\n- Maybe a teleport tool and a map we can open anywhere?\n- Have issues with the pumpkin terrier monster that kept running, difficult to catch. In one case it's not dropping material because it's too close to the edge and disappears.\n- Climbing with the vines there are some positions we can get stuck to. A bit difficult to manuever.\n- Since it's a linear story driven game and not a sim maybe need something for endgame content, so if the story finishes there might be some things to do.\n\nI guess that is all and if the dev read this I hope you'll consider my suggestions.\nCan't wait for the game's full release!", "timestamp_created": 1653710088, "timestamp_updated": 1653710088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116117808": {"recommendationid": "116117808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087560673", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1654283812}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to see where this goes loving it so far.", "timestamp_created": 1653706774, "timestamp_updated": 1653706774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116116331": {"recommendationid": "116116331", "author": {"steamid": "76561199177794157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1654650608}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little game where you play as a cheeky witch.

I expected a stardew-inspired game, but they really focus more on a linear story built around crafting and exploration. I really liked the balance of being able to do what you want, but having key story points built around you as you craft and explore. Crafting itself also isn't very boring because there are layers to making a spell. First being gathering the ingredients, then creating essences/breaking down the ingredients, then combining them and setting the fire level and stir direction to create your potion or candy. It sounds a bit wordy in text, but it works and really lends itself nicely to the feeling of actually making a potion. The characters are super cute and well designed and all have their own personalities. I love the dialogue between the hat and your character as well. There is some good humor in the writing that keeps the story engaging.

I REALLY love this game. its cute its fun the crafting is easy to understand imo and its simplistic nature is perfect for a silly game. It'd be weird if a fun game had super complicated recipes.\n\n I only have a few things I'd like to see in game and I'll rank them based on how much I'd like that to happen (on a scale of 1-10), my reasoning and whether or not I think it will happen (0 being never and 5 being its a need)\n\n1. Upgrading your witch hut. I really love acquiring and upgrading things in video games, in fallout and skyrim I spent an unhealthy amount of time building settlements and finding any collectables for display at my house. Or like in stardew valley where most house upgrades are for looks and merely to decorate. Great Seratonin boost to see how much I accomplished. Maybe Kayla/Kyla could sell furniture and Roy could sell vases and hanging plants like the in game ingredients or food. A kitchen too to make your own food for energy. 10/10 would LOVE    3/5 could get in the way of the story plus the little patch of land is small but outside looks dont always matter and being able to cook for energy would be so fun. \n\n2. Character customization (you probs saw this coming) again a useless in game seritonin boost but its so fun customizing your own character and feeling like you are actually playing but this game seems to clearly follow Ellie. I was wondering if it mattered to the story if she had black hair or could change into regular clothes instead of dragging that robe through the dirty forest. She was on a trip so naturally she'd have extra clothes? The reason I ranked it so low on likelihood is because of how much work it'll be to add customizations to the sprite that pops up very often and not just on your character, I mean in the text boxes. thats already so many animations as of right now in early access. 8/10 would like to see it\n\n3. Friendship bars. I'm gonna rank this 0.1/5 immediately because it seems the friendship is very story driven. I would say maybe they could give you items every so often but they seem to be set up to already begin to do that, like Enite already gives you pie, Rumbrum is always brewing tea so maybe down the line you get some, you get candy from that stranger in the woods it just seems like a story driven system. 5/10 I'd be happen to have it but I wouldn't mind either way.\n\nBUGS\nI haven't experienced anything major just a few small annoyances\n\n1. the terrier guys that you have to chase: while filling the bar is they happen to get out of range right as you finish it starts you over and that usually happens after I've been chasing for a while. Once I chased him for a solid 2 minutes and he dropped nothing but he did the little disappearing thing when you succeed. that bothered me a bit but not game breaking 10/10 bothers me alot when  it happens but I over collect so it's never for an emergency when I'm trying to get it. 4/5\n\n2. the twigs falling interrupts your progress. very minor annoyance and the game already lets you collect faster after being partially harvested. 3/5  5/10 I stand off to the side to avoid it happening so I would be happy if it was fixed but I dont mind\n\n3. In the quest to find the prickly vine core, it gives you blue chalk but my inventory was full so I had no clue where it went for quite a while, I just happened to look in my lunar chest on accident to see it in there. There might already be a little pop up that says (item moved to lunar chest) but I missed that if it did and I was sad I couldnt figure out what was wrong. 5/5 must have. 10/10 would love to see\n\n4. The roaster, I had completely forgotten I was suppose to get the handle from the merchant so I spent a lot of time doing my quest to \"get to the point where I get the handle\" and when every recipe Ineeded next required the roaster I had to look it up. I do have memory issues so this may not have been a problem to many other people but maybe add it as a small side quest or a little notebook thing we could have to log what we did each day like in the old days of pokemon (or new its beein a while since i played). 5/5 must have 10/10 really would like to see.\n\nI did not expect to write this much about it but I just love this game so much and can't wait to see how awesome it becomes.", "timestamp_created": 1653685204, "timestamp_updated": 1653685664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116105716": {"recommendationid": "116105716", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987789711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 821, "last_played": 1670560619}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game for a fun play-through, similar to other rpg games but very well designed.

I found myself just smashing the Z button to get through some of the longer parts. \n-Controls are a little odd, I've never played a game with these specific controls so I often found myself miss-clicking trying to open my menu or select something. \n-It's a little frustrating getting some of the ingredients as it's not super intuitive (at least for me, the feathers are kind of a pain)\n-SUPER small storage when the game starts. \n-When it hits midnight it just kind of resets to the next day? \n\nOverall, this game is so cute, and I really loved playing it.
