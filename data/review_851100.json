It just assumes you have had the time to research into whatever this Touhou stuff is, and if you haven't - too bad. Zero accessibility in terms of picking this game up without having looked at other titles. The English translations for both dialogue AND very important tutorial instructions are riddled with typos and grammatical errors that make understanding the game mechanics basically impossible. Did I mention apparently this only has 5 levels? I also read that they rolled out a DLC boss after selling out to Microsoft, but only made it available for consoles, and NOT on Steam. Sounds like a sell-out scam to me. \n\nIf you are a fan of whatever franchise this is.....maybe you might like it? \nBut if you like real metroidvanias......do not buy this. It is not a metroidvania and it is not a quality game. Sorry to Team Ladybug......but you cannot expect me to pay 17.99 for a game and then not even hire an editor for the English. \n0/10 do not recommend. If you want a bullet hell metroidvania that is similar in visual style but actually has a lot of content and isn't falsely advertised as a metroidvania, look at Rabi-Ribi and the sequel Tevi that will be coming out soon.

[b]S[/b].\n\nIt's definitely one of those games that's short but sweet, but that's not a bad thing by any means. Touhou Luna Nights isn't my first endeavor the world of Zun's bullet-hell series, but it's certainly the most unique one I've had so far. It should be prefaced that Luna Nights is a fangame, but an incredibly polished on that stands in its own right as one of the greatest metroidvania games ever created.\n\nLuna Nights really shines in its gameplay. You play as Sakuya Izayoi, the time-manipulating maid from Touhou 6. Your primary tools are thrown knives and the previously mentioned power to stop time. I've never seen a game use the ability to stop time in quite the same way, but it's somewhat comparable to SUPERHOT if you have experience with that series. The game features the graze mechanic from the original Touhou games that allows you to regain resources but with a twist: grazing in stopped time doesn't recover your health, only your MP and time gauge. This makes every battle, but particularly the game's 5 or so bosses, a dance of risk vs. reward. If you can dodge the bullet-hell-like attack patterns without stopping time you can regain a significant amount of HP, but you can always stop time, which freeze most projectiles, to play it safe. I love the gameplay in Luna Nights and it's far and away my favorite metroidvania (maybe even game in general honestly) in this regard. Easily a 10/10, something truly unique.\n\nThe story is passable but not particularly compelling. You'll need a cursory knowledge of the Touhou franchise of you want to follow along, but I'd recommend you play Embodiment of Scarlet Devil first if you want to really understand everything. It isn't that it's that complicated, just that many characters from that game appear and it's cool to be able to see the characters from the original game brought to life in Luna Night's beautiful pixel-art style. Honestly, I think the story gets a 3.5/5, it isn't bad, but boring and the stakes are practically negligible. \n\nThe art is fantastic. Even with, in some cases, hundreds of projectiles on screen you can clearly see what's going on. The game has a sort of chibi style to the characters, which is charming and sets it apart from other games o this type. The UI design is absolutely amazing, and it has such a distinct style to it that I love. Easy 5/5 here, it isn't my favorite game from a visual perspective but there isn't anything in particular that I don't actively like, it is perfect for what it is.\n\nThe music goes very hard. 5/5, this game somehow managed to improve on Touhou 6's soundtrack in some places.\n\nAll in all, 23.5/25, 94%, the game gets an [b]S[/b] ranking. Go play it if you haven't already, even if you're not a fan of the Touhou series this game is amazing. Even at full price this is a buy.", "timestamp_created": 1697843935, "timestamp_updated": 1698371640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148561409": {"recommendationid": "148561409", "author": {"steamid": "76561199529272815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1697908755}, "language": "english", "review": "Mommy Dio!", "timestamp_created": 1697832594, "timestamp_updated": 1697832594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148556542": {"recommendationid": "148556542", "author": {"steamid": "76561199500331003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 131, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1700510254}, "language": "english", "review": "is good game", "timestamp_created": 1697826548, "timestamp_updated": 1699054971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148428742": {"recommendationid": "148428742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009267371", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1697675975}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has its flaws, and it feels like there was more planned than the dev was able to do. For example, there's a line about equipment, but there's no equipment system; and though all the gems list attribute-related effects they allegedly provide, they don't actually do anything except give you something to sell. Leveling up also doesn't appear to do anything; it certainly doesn't increase Sakuya's HP, MP, Time, or attributes. Enemy variety is a bit limited, but that's counterbalanced pretty well by the size of the map and number of areas to explore; this is a bite-sized Metroidvania, not a full-sized one.\n\nThe bosses tend to overstay their welcomes, in my opinion, but that's not to say they aren't impressive; they just have entirely too much health for my taste. Most of the time, a boss doesn't start using a new attack until halfway through her health bar, and maybe starts tossing out another new one after that about 3/4 of the way through; this leaves each fight feeling tedious and repetitive, in contrast to the way bosses' attack patterns flow smoothly from one to the next in official titles. Obviously, Luna Nights isn't a bullet hell, it's a Metroidvania\u2014but it could have maintained that same smooth flow by knocking off a hefty chunk of each boss's total health. That being said, the boss themes are faithful and high-quality remixes of the originals, and the bosses' attack patterns themselves are quite a treat for the eyes, not to mention a pretty stimulating challenge to evade the first couple of times you see them.\n\nThe controls have a few irregularities, too. Double-jumping has an inexplicable inconsistency in its height; occasionally, you'll have to try the same jump a second or third time, even though the height you're starting from hasn't changed, just to get enough height to reach a platform. More commonly, you'll find Sakuya refusing to turn in the right direction, getting hit from behind while flinging knives at nothing. Both of these issues crop up just often enough to be noticed and yet rarely enough not to make the game significantly harder than it needs to be.\n\nDespite these flaws, it generally feels good to play. The animation is smooth and detailed, the sprite work and backgrounds are both top-notch, the levels don't go overboard on time puzzles, and aside from a certain palpable over-reliance on selectively-intangible floating enemies in one particular area, even the individual rooms feel distinct and interesting.\n\nThis isn't the greatest Metroidvania ever made, nor the greatest Touhou spin-off ever made, but it is a fun and fairly well-polished budget game.

The biggest issue is it's just really short. Actual in game time was a bit less than five hours to beat the main game, and bonus stage, and 98% the map (just one spot that I know where it is, but don't care enough to go back to given how annoying level traversing can be here).\nSo if you want a game you could beat in a day, or two, this might be it. For the cost they ask, not really worth it, if it's on a 50% off sale or something, and you want touho metroidvania then ok though.\n\nOnto the game itself. Core gameplay is... ok, decent at times, though has it's issues. It's a very button spammy game, so tying your fingers up on the controls can happen, and the default controls caused me quite a few mistakes/confusions given how they are setup. But after playing it I can see why they chose that... still, relearning control norms for such a short game gives me mixed feelings.\nWell, at it's core the combat is decent, sometimes very good, othertimes quite slow. There's only a few bosses, they tend to be decently interesting to fight, but also most of them are just kind of easy. Though the bonus stage final boss is a decent challenge, worth maybe an hour. The second \"final boss\" I ended up beating fully on my first run, without any deaths for example. Even though it was a later on one.\nThe boss fights are honestly where this game is at it's best, though the problem is there aren't a lot of them, and it's padded out with a lot of slow map exploration. Many areas are slow, with time wasting mechanics where you must wait for X or Y to finish or circle around to move on, so some parts take minutes to get around just because of that, and if you die... you respawn back and must come back through it all again... \nGeneral map exploration was the most annoying part of this game, at multiple points I kid of dreaded having to explore or progress through the world just because it was often more annoying or frustrating than fun or challenging to me.\nSo I had decent fun on most bosses, but just a meh experience in the world itself.\nI would rate it on the lower end for a metroidvania overall, but the bosses and core combat when actually usable in some of those boss fights was at time very good. And while standing at a sharp contrast to other general gameplay mediocrity or even lackluster parts. So because of those few key moments and boss fights in the game I do feel I want to recomend it, there's some great moments there, but overall it will be diffused by a not great world and exploration, and just being a frankly very short experience. $20 for 5 hours of play (my timer says 6, I AFKd in game at some points to do other things) is pretty steep feeling, since it wasn't all the best of the best or anything. So my thoughts are, when on sale, give it a go. There is gold here, but only a bit mixed in with the rest, but still worth checking out for that.\n\nFor the developers, a decent attempt, but ya it just felt like it needed more. And making the world itself a bit more enjoyable or faster to navigate through, with fewer slow annoying gears and traps and barely moving platforms between save points, the better. The core combat on bosses is solid enough that if you focus on that, I'm sure you could definintely make another game with hopefully a bit more budget and thus content to really make something I'd love, but for now it's just got that mixed feeling, but hey, there are those great moments in it that still put it above most other random games by a decent bit, so take pride in that.\n\nFinally, bugs. Found a few here and there, jump when near a ledge/edge doesn't seem reliable, even if not far enough to fall, but still towards the edge jump doesn't seem to activate reliably, or in a few other cases. If something outside of the game force tabs/focuses you out of it, then the resolution/screen size breaks and you just have a super tiny window in the center of the screen, that you basically need to restart to fix. And (minor spoiler warning) Remilias third phase with her final dialogue and then moves around 20% health left doesn't always trigger. First time I beat her, she never activated it for some reason. Few other mostly more minor bits that I've mostly forgotten as unimportant while/after playing.", "timestamp_created": 1695166155, "timestamp_updated": 1695166155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496774196624755859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146586196": {"recommendationid": "146586196", "author": {"steamid": "76561199081782828", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1122, "last_played": 1699285502}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing art good music\nhad a blast playing 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1695127082, "timestamp_updated": 1695127082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146493968": {"recommendationid": "146493968", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976855149", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 267, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1695166643}, "language": "english", "review": "Press pause to win.

Takes inspiration from the Castlevania side more and the combat system does share a couple similarities with Order of Ecclesia. Overall presentation is fantastic. You also don't need to be familiar with the official games/characters to enjoy the game.\n\nGame controls wonderfully and your abilities will be put to use not only for combat and traversal, but puzzle solving as well. Sakuya has the ability to temporarily stop time around her to graze for resources, dish out damage, and to move to a more desirable location. It's required for some puzzles, but for bosses and other combat scenarios it's entirely optional. For your first playthrough, be sure to utilize it, but after that, use it less and less or even avoid using it all together to challenge yourself if you wish. You won't be having a lesser experience if you rely on time stop as there is a satisfying gameplay loop with it and there is a limit to how much you can use it. The power-ups you can collect are really cool additions to your tool set too with some familiar moves with a new twist, like the double jump that also fires knives underneath you, or something entirely new, such as the ability to use your thrown knives as platforms while time is stopped (which is honestly one of the coolest abilities I've seen in a Metroidvania so far).\n\nThe bosses are a highlight for sure. All being faces mostly from Touhou 6: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. They are represented really well here through their dialogue, animation, and fights. Quite a few of their attacks are also derived from their fights in the official games, but redesigned to fit the new game genre. Even with the ability to stop and slow down time, they can make short work of you if you aren't careful so you are likely to lose to each of them a couple times before you finally take them down. The true final boss took me multiple attempts to beat, but to be fair to myself, I somehow arrived underleveled so that's on me. If you find yourself struggling too much for your liking, enemies drop gems on death which you can trade for things like full HP/MP restores, time stop upgrades, instant level-ups, etc. Though you are rewarded for hanging on to them as they improve your stats slightly; it won't be much at first, yeah, but it does add up over time.\n\nLast subject I better focus on is the game's shortcomings. While I do enjoy most of the abilities you gain in the game, I wish there were more of them; a good chunk of things you'll find for progression just open new kinds of doors. Backtracking can be a pain if you need to get through a puzzle or platforming challenge you've already done before. And, while this isn't a huge deal for myself, you can finish the game in about 4 hours and I was able to collect all achievements within 10. I think I'd rather have a shorter game with some good ideas rather than a longer game that overstays its welcome. Regardless, I feel I still need to mention this.\n\ntl;dr - Do not need to be familiar with source material to enjoy. Fantastic gameplay and bosses with cool abilities utilized in all sorts of ways (combat, traversal, puzzles, accessibility). Though it's on the shorter side and some instances of backtracking could require redoing platforming challenges/puzzles.

The game isn't extremely polished (some obvious settings like different volume configuration for music and in game sound are missing), and has some balancing problems (there's a couple places where you go on too long between checkpoints, and the initial bosses feel a bit too easy), but the uniqueness of the upgrades it uses and how those (at least the half that aren't just door keys) interact with combat makes it a really interesting experience.

If this moment excited you even slightly, you would be oh-so unprepared for the constant stream of excellent game design that follows.\n\nThe game's world and characters are based on ZUN's longrunning Touhou series of danmaku shooter titles, which definitely docks some points for originality. While undeniably charming, the story itself is nothing more than a series of clich\u00e9s and references, with a general humorous tone that helps alleviate a bit of the derivativeness. You play as Sakuya Izayoi, a maid summoned to another dimension by a vampire named Remilia Scarlet, who takes away your ablities in the process. What follows is a journey to regain your power, as well as finding a way back to her world. That being said, a deep yearning to achieve some seriously original game design can be felt strongly throughout.\n\nSakuya's main method of attack is throwing knives forward or downward diagonally when jumping. This attack is tied to a magic bar. When a knife is thrown, magic is consumed. Beginner players will most likely find themselves regularly depleting their magic bar, unable to throw any more knives. It's rather unusual of a explorative 2D action game like this to restrict your fundamental, and so far, only method of attack. The magic bar does refill itself, albeit very slowly. Shortly after you meet the game's merchant character Nitori, who also gives you a powerup allowing you to stop time completely, and this is where the game becomes truly magical.\n\nWhile time is stopped, all enemies cease moving and Sakuya is able to navigate the screen without a care, and more importantly, position a limited number of frozen knives in front of enemies, which is what really separates this game's time-stopping mechanic from other games. The fun of suddenly stopping everything and then positioning knives tactically in front of different enemies, even in different directions, is bliss beyond words. Then, upon restarting the flow of time or exhausting the newly required time unit found in the center of the HUD, you get you to witness your enemies suddenly terminate before your eyes. Besides simply being a more efficient means of offense, the time stopping mechanic also allows you to \"graze\" enemies, by getting very close to them without making contact. Doing this draws in pink cards from them, refilling your magic bar, another moment guaranteed to widen the initial smile on your face.\n\nOnce becoming accustomed to the constant dance of stopping time regularly to set up attacks, and graze nearby enemies to refill the required energy to do so, you've understood the flow of gameplay. It should also be noted that the grazing mechanic also works in real-time (accordingly more difficult to perform) but works as a method to refill your health bar instead. This mechanic is actually lifted from the main Touhou titles, but I would argue that it feels so much more special than a simple nod to the source material given how beautifully it was conceived and implemented in this game. Not being content with underutilizing the mechanic, the developers also provide sparse puzzles in certain rooms, which challenge you to pause for a moment to consider how you can use your aforementioned time slowing, along with the time stopping in order to get through unscathed. They also smartly introduce obstacles that play with established conventions, like platforms and enemies that move even in stopped time. It's really brilliant how the mechanics are gradually introduced, and then layered on top of one another. This is something I wish the game had more of, but what is here is still interesting.\n\nI've almost forgotten that this game is also advertised and regarded as a \"Metroidvania\" title. It's true, many of the staples of the genre are here and accounted for: the map system revealing the rooms you've found, the color-coded areas, and of course, the secret rooms. Though, I've seen many reviewers are players alike criticise how linear this game is compared to its peers. The game is surprisingly less open-ended than one would initially assume, with usually only a few multiple paths at a given time, often linking up to each other, and plenty of colored doors blocking you until you get the appropriate key. I do not find this design detrimental to the game in the slightest. In fact, I would go as far as to say it doesn't matter what players expect a \"genre\" to be, and I applaud it for breaking convention with a more linear approach, while maintaining some exploration. It's the best of both worlds: players who like exploration can search for the inessential powerups and players who would prefer to view the game as a more traditional 2D action platformer can do so. I prefer to view it as the latter.\n\nWhen it comes to my gripes regarding the game, I would start with the level mechanic. Much like in the Koji Igarashi produced Castlevania titles, you gain experience when defeating enemies and your stats increase throughout as you progress. Given that I prefer the more focused action portion of the game, I feel like this was an unneeded feature. Thankfully, unlike many other titles, it never really feels overpowered. The game only slightly powers you up, and the enemies constantly grow in strength and numbers (which can get frustrating in some rooms it you lack patience). Ultimately, I would much prefer if the game didn't include such a system, and just focused on the core gameplay which is so good. There are also various special abilities which consume a greater amount of magic. Many of these are useful in the different situations, but they are all outperformed by a single ability called Thousand Dagger. This ability is so ridiculously efficient and powerful, it effectively diminishes the game's brilliance if overused. I wish the developers retooled this one some more.\n\nSeparating the game's main areas are the fantastic bosses, featuring a great cast of stylish characters. These fights do a fantastic job of incorporating great action, as well as the game's puzzle elements when trying to figure out how to avoid some of the bosses' seriously intimidating attack patterns. The developers knew these bosses stole the show, as a boss rush mode is included after clearing the game. Unfortunately, the boss rush is a ridiculously easy due to the fact that you maintain the levels and abilities obtained throughout your playthrough. All-in-all, an absolutely fantastic 2D action game that begs to be replayed, with mechanics that truly captivated me.\n\n[b]Rating: 7.5/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1688709167, "timestamp_updated": 1691545880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141495323": {"recommendationid": "141495323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198460170392", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 780, "last_played": 1635697921}, "language": "english", "review": "(\u2e1d\u2e1d\u2e1d\u2578\u25b5\u257a\u2e1d\u2e1d\u2e1d)\nomg knife barrage into \ntime stop\ninto uber boss rush", "timestamp_created": 1688700004, "timestamp_updated": 1688700004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141339336": {"recommendationid": "141339336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092725293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "playtime_at_review": 1169, "last_played": 1700098973}, "language": "english", "review": "actually one of the best metroidvania games i have ever played. music bangs and game is very fun.", "timestamp_created": 1688523611, "timestamp_updated": 1688523611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62105262279510498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141327812": {"recommendationid": "141327812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277959838", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 675, "last_played": 1688508407}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would touhou again\n\nThis was my first touhou game and it will not be the last.

Time manipulation is implemented EXTREMELY well when it comes to the platforming and combat of the game. So many unique ways such as water being turning solid when time is stopped, and objects/enemies having certain properties that can change their behavior around time stopping. Examples would include ignoring, being in reverse, or only moving when time is stopped. \n\nCombining both time slow and stop makes for interesting gameplay where some players can choose to slip through and dance through tough areas or scrap their way out using the tools at their arsenal. Either way, both ways of progression lead to satisfaction due to how areas are designed to not be easily overpowered by the mechanic of time manipulation. \n\nProgression feels very nice to go through and experience, bosses allow for mass amounts of creativity of how to approach them, leading to different playstyles and trying out strategies to eventually overcome and be rewarded by the satisfaction of learning the patterns and how to respond to the attacks. Eventually you weave and slide in a dance with the bosses to take them out, and it's truly beautiful. Though I will say some enemies seem to have stacked as heck health nearing the end of the game which is a little tedious. On the note of that the game isn't too long, cracking down in maybe around 4 hours but the replayability value of the game is pretty good. \n\nTLDR: VERY GOOD METROIDVANIA worth picking up if you're a metroidvania fanatic or someone looking for a game featuring the world of Touhou to enjoy. \n\nalso sakuya's bizarre adventure funny haha.", "timestamp_created": 1688456671, "timestamp_updated":

Luna Nights. It's a true masterpiece, believe me. This game takes the bullet hell genre to new heights, like you've never seen before. It's tremendous, folks, simply tremendous.\n\nNow, this game is heavily inspired by the Touhou series, which is a fantastic Japanese franchise known for its cute girls and intense bullet patterns. Touhou Luna Nights captures that essence perfectly, just like I capture ratings in the polls. It's got the charm, the action, and the memes, believe me.\n\nWhen you step into the shoes of Sakuya Izayoi, the maid from the Scarlet Devil Mansion, you know you're in for a treat. The game throws wave after wave of beautifully crafted bullets at you, making your heart race faster than a politician on the campaign trail. The sheer challenge is like negotiating a trade deal with China. You've got to dodge, weave, and time your moves perfectly, just like I do when facing the media.\n\nBut here's the best part, folks: the time-stop mechanic. Sakuya has the power to manipulate time, just like I have the power to make America great again. With this ability, you can freeze enemies and projectiles, turning the battlefield into your own personal dance floor. It's like holding a rally with thousands of supporters cheering you on.\n\nThe graphics in Touhou Luna Nights are beautiful, folks. The pixel art style is like a fine piece of art hanging in the Trump Tower. The attention to detail is tremendous, and the characters are so cute, it's almost like they're real. I'd love to have a few of them as campaign advisers, believe me.\n\nAnd let's not forget the music, folks. The soundtrack is catchy and energetic, just like my speeches. It keeps you pumped up and ready for action. When the boss battles kick in, it's like facing off against Crooked Hillary herself. It's intense, it's exhilarating, and it's what makes this game so special.\n\nNow, some people may say that Touhou Luna Nights is a niche game, but let me tell you, folks, it's for winners. It's for those who appreciate skill, strategy, and a touch of madness. If you're a fan of Touhou, bullet hell games, or just good old-fashioned fun, this game is a must-play.\n\nIn conclusion, Touhou Luna Nights is a tremendous experience, folks. It's got the challenge, the charm, and the memes that will make you feel like a winner. So grab your keyboard, fire up your PC, and get ready to show those bullets who's boss. This game gets my highest rating, just like I got the highest ratings in the history of ratings.

time-stopping abilites alone are what make this Metroidvania unique and fun! You really can't go wrong with this one.

Throwing knives is also just fun, there's many different ways to do damage, and you're always able to hit bosses.

playthrough takes about 5-7 hours, and about 15-18 hours to get all of the achievements. there are lots of little tricks and techniques that you can use to help in many aspects of the game to speed things up, the only point i felt the game was unfair was during the extra stage, where there were a few points that were very frustrating, but possible. this game is worth the money!",

Coming from a 100-hour-long visual novel series and Monster Hunter, I am [i]incredibly[/i] thankful for such a merciful runtime.\n\n(ii) - I cannot recall a time prior to the Extra Stage when I had any major difficulty with the stages or the bosses, so I - as someone  - will allow myself to be so bold as to say that this game's not too mean so long as you take full advantage of its mechanics... which does not sound helpful in the slightest, does it? \n[quote=my stupid ass]uhm actually the bideo gane's not hard when you know how to play the bideo gane[/quote]\n\n(iii) - Time manipulation is a ton of fun. It's a well-executed core mechanic that ostensibly lets [b]you[/b] dictate the pace of your battles. You're even rewarded for not relying on it too much with greater grazing bonuses. Speaking of, [i]grazing[/i] or narrowly avoiding projectiles makes its way into this game from the traditional Touhou shmups which is nice. Grazing translates to MP which you need to perform an attack, special or otherwise. This works well because it encourages you to get into the thick of an enemy's attack and turn the tables on them. It's a much more exciting flow of things than gluing yourself to the edge of the arena and waiting for your MP to recharge.\nBosses (which are the entire cast of EotSD minus Koakuma and Rumia) can be tough, but none of them had me dreading fighting them again and again in Boss Rush mode. They're a joy to fight, the lot of them. I suppose it is precisely [i]because[/i] the game is so focused that their fights are polished to a mirror sheen.\n\n(iv) - The pixel art and animations are very nice to look at, but the music's the real star of the show. They're all remixes of tracks from the shmups and they're all [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWITITpjA8s]fan[/url][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g39jVVyCVVM]tas[/url][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cjGITlCdw0]tic[/url].\n\n(v) - I just ain't built for shmups so my affinity for Touhou mostly stems from its music, the gajillions of illustrations inspired by its zany characters, and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q16KpquGsIc]that one insane YTPMV feat.

The background music are very good and perfectly fit every stage and boss fight. Game difficulty quite challenging, just need to be patience to recover mana and time stop ability. As a Touhou fans, i would highly recommended this game, is it worth to play. \n\n\nExtra Note :\n100% Achievement are not really hard, if you play a lot and know very well about the how the enemies and the bosses work. For me personally, the hardest achievement are \"No Continue for you!\", the part when you trying to take the purple key. This goddamn key waste a lot of my time while dying several time and keep reset the game by close the game instantly. Without this tricks, or else i will never get the achievement. \nThe main character are personally my favorite character in Touhou, Sakuya Izayoi my 1st waifu by knowing her through her BGM in Youtube. So basically this game are Touhou version of Castlevania, one of my favorite game franchise, especially Castlevania SOTN. What a good old time, base on my Game Hour.

While the game is quality which I'll take over quantity, this has to be mentioned. For reference, I beat the game, including it's postgame stage at around 4 to 5 hours.\n* somewhat linear in that you beat stage 2's boss to gain access to stage 3, beat that boss to get to stage 4, etc etc. I don't think this is a flaw, I'm just mentioning it. There's still multiple rooms to choose from in each stage to be clear.\n\nCons:\n- the map could have been a little more helpful with item locations in areas you've explored. Even a Super Metroid dot would have sufficed to reduce the amount of wandering around to find that one wooden box.\n- I felt like I was being punished when I unlocked the ability to reach higher locations and backtracked to an earlier unreachable area to see what I'd find. Just before reaching it, you have to get through a slog of platform puzzles that take a while and there's a save room right after. Turns out I reached that new area only to be greeted with a locked door. I had to then slog through the platform puzzle rooms again because i already saved in that area. If there was at least an item to pickup there, it would have felt rewarding.\n\nOverall I had a fun experience playing this game.

smooth. the music slaps hard too, very very well made music. the difficulty curve is a bit much if you're new, but you should adjust. stage 5 and the extra stage have lots of annoying enemies and platforming, so the later half of the game is a little unfair a times, but only a little, it can be worked around. the enemies have contra syndrome though, so if you slightly off screen them, they respawn instantly. but overall the game is a blast, an easy 9/10 imo. very well worth the 20 dollar price tag (cad). plus sakuya being the main character is great, may or may not have a sakuya bias.",

except theirs a bunch of bullet hell games what all for some reason are only in Japanese? not this game though, this games a banger from the ost never getting boring to stopping time like the funny British bisexual vampire who lives in Egypt in the body of his former step brother who uses his funny ghost thing to fight a really strong teenager... Dio, the ability to stop time is a broken one but this game at least to me finds a balance with that, I found most of the challenge was using time stop to platform while also having to deal with a variety of enemies which all have different kinds of skills complemented with different objects that can hit you while you try to platform.\n\nIts a shame time stop isn't a more commonly used ability in games because its a really cool ability, the story isn't too much to write home about, its a plot that does what it needs to do and that's good enough, the game itself is quite short being able to be beat within 10 hours but even with that its still really good and I would love to see more games like this with characters using interesting abilities like in this game.\n\nI hope if theirs ever a game like this with fun abilities the character will be able to blow things up... Yes, like the funny serial killer who lives in a small quite town Morioh thats located in Japan and wants to live a quite life, blowing people up and stealing there hands using his funny ghost thing called killer queen (not associated with the band Queen), trying to kill a bunch of teenagers and there mentor figure \"not so teenage man anymore\" Jotaro Kujo... Yoshikage Kira I also hope they too will be a hot maid anime girl.\n\n(Tldr: game gud, maid girl Dio! get game.)", "timestamp_created": 1672815831, "timestamp_updated": 1672815831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130085390": {"recommendationid": "130085390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393209460", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 725, "last_played": 1687009230}, "language": "english", "review": "\u015eahane s\u00fcper h\u00fcber bir oyun.

But it has a great level of a casual accessible fun-filled flair to it with still a memorable challenge. It should first be noted this a fangame of the popular bullet hell series and general world Touhou and is centered around the character Sakuya Izayoi, who is one of my favorites. A lot of the positive reviews are likely from fans. \n\nBut that alone I don't think accounts for it-I see this game in tops in same metroidvania spheres in terms of boss fights, I see multiple well praising critics. Sometimes a game gets overwhelmingly positive reviews for being just so refined at every level (for instance, Hollow Knight). This... isn't one of them I'd say.\n\nThe levels aren't great, art is bland at times, it is the most primitive form of a metroidvania and is very linear, the movement isn't wholly concordant with the levels, the lore is nonexistent, and the game is very short. But somehow none of that really matters. If that were a central focus, a more involved intricate exploratory game, then there would be problems. But somehow framing the game as more simple minded but interesting fun makes it perfect for its purpose.\n\nIt's like a fun gimmick game on the XBox store which is there for a good time rather than dedicate all your focus on.\n\nCENTRAL GAMEPLAY\n\nThat central gimmick is time manipulation. Now now, time manipulation is up there in 'have run out of ideas' sphere. But it makes sense with this character and is utilized beautifully.\n\nThere are 3 meters: health, mana, and time. Health is well health. Mana is used in normal mode to use all your weapons. You can use special weapons which require more. Mana replenishes slowly.\n\nYou can slow down time-this is not the same as stopping time and does not use your time meter. When time is slowed, things move slower but you move same speed. This helps you dodge but nothing fundamentally about the game\nhas changed so I'll still count it as  'normal mode'.\n\nYou can also stop time. This uses up you time meter slowly depending on how long you've used it. It is spent faster the more you move. Additionally, in this mode, doing attacks uses time but not mana. When in normal mode, time replenishes\nby itself quickly.\n\nThe final piece of this puzzle is grazing. In Touhou, grazing is when you go near bullets, which helps give you points. In this game, it helps replenish mana, time, and health. When you are in normal mode, grazing gives you just health. When you are in time stop, it gives you primarily mana and time although some amount of health I think. What this means is you generally need to utilize time slow to help yourself heal by dodging, need to keep a steady time meter so you can use it to refill your mana which is drained quickly and dodge attacks, and need to keep steady mana so you have other attacks to go off of so you don't use too much time so you use time.\n\nSo it is wonderfully balanced and dynamic system, and the game is about able to keep these in balance. At first, it has this very interesting feeling of a 'stop and go' playstyle-it helps give you time to sort out all your options and almost like a dynamic puzzle, figure out what to do. Where to dodge, how to attack, how to balance your meters, etc. and makes it the closest to a strategy metroidvania. But, as you get familiar, it feels more fluid and natural-like you know what attack is coming up and so these are just another mechanical tool to switch between.\n\nThe movement on the whole feels fluid and nice and well matching with the time controls especially in gathered abilities later.\n\nBOSSES\n\nThe boss fights are a particular highlight and frankly some of the best I've seen, making clever use of both the time slow and time stop mechanics and with a generally coherently yet distinctive felt series of abilities that make sense with their character. It never feels like just a different string of the same attacks, that each character is offering something new. Now, a difficulty with talking about memorability is bosses is at first they're hard-then you learn them and then it feels 'simple'. But judging as a whole, I think it still feels fluid and well designed even after you know them. And, I really love the boss rush mode. Because the nature of this game seems to boil down to 'optimizing', making it about getting your time of beating them down is great and adds a whole other layer. Because time stop slows down the game, you can start asking of how you play without it. There is thus more replayability in that area I'd feel and I feel I'll come to it again.\n\nART AND MUSIC\n\nVisually, the game has this soft pixel-art feel with an overall great composition. There are various points though where it is particularly bland, or has bad edges (basically all of stage 1s design including the enemies, most of the rest of the areas feel really nice though). Sometimes enemy design is a bit clashing but on the whole lots of it is good. The music naturally borrows the renowned melodies of the character theme songs in the Touhou franchise made by ZUN and puts it in a kind of castlevania feel, it has this 'soft pixely' feel that fits very well with the art that makes it feel distinctive and fitting.\n\nLEVELS\n\nNow, when in comparison to lots of the real great forms of level design in other games, it may begin to feel normalized and numb to. So it's hard to tell difference between good and average. Here, the level design doesn't feel the greatest at times. Sometimes it's too flat, sometimes it's too many pointless corridors not designed with your movement nor attacks in mind, there is lots of negative space. There are some interesting platforming sections making use of your time ability that I like, although I do wish it were more 'integrated' in a room rather than feeling like just a series of obstacles stringed together. When you get more abilities, few levels seem designed with it in mind-for instance, the dash. I think a lot more coherent movement+diverse enemy+level design would have greatly helped. The world design also suffers a bit, having many one-off areas, not the greatest teleportation hubs. On the whole though, to me it's fine enough. It's nothing game ruining. It's average and good. It is well varied and never overstays its welcome. \n\nEXPLORATION\n\nAnd of course, on the metroidvania front, I mentioned it's very primitive. Often you encounter something, check other unexplored area, its exactly what you need and is a dead end, and all you can go is go back. So, maybe it doesn't wholly feel in some areas (especially stage 1) that there is a world to support what is often one boss fight right after the next. This will make the game feel especially short, given the few boss fights, and may leave you wanting more.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nSo, given all the positives and the numerous flaws, would I recommend? Well, I beat the main game very quickly, maybe in 6 hours, and all bosses 10 hours in. I got all the items 16 hours which was just routine 'check hidden wall' maintenance and other trivial tasks. Yet, somehow it never felt boring and I feel like I'll want to revisit. The fluid gameplay, top tier bosses, interesting mechanic, just nice feeling art and music, and more simple minded fun kind of atmosphere made it one of my favorite gaming experiences yet. I do wish there was a bit more there in some areas because I truly do think it could go *a lot* further. (Hollow Knight probably spoiled me)\n\nBut let me put it this way-another game I played was Guacamelee-it probably had some of the better levels, enemies, and world. Yet, I didn't care at all to 100% that one. It felt too blocky and not interesting enough in gameplay for me, the bosses meddling good. This game in its simple minded fun gets through with fine enough level and world and focuses its efforts on one very interesting, great feeling gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1672606436, "timestamp_updated": 1672606792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739667713642120361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129829265": {"recommendationid": "129829265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083351443", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1673837665}, "language": "english", "review": "The timestop mechanic is SO much fun.", "timestamp_created": 1672550300, "timestamp_updated": 1672550300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129778949": {"recommendationid": "129778949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198446853680", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1683116181}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u043e\u0436\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a :3", "timestamp_created": 1672495795, "timestamp_updated": 1672495795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129742548": {"recommendationid": "129742548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367980039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1699228590}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u00bfCansado de juegos inflados de contenido porque si que nunca vas a terminar porque los desarrolladores son unos hijos de puta y lo hicieron todo mal a proposito?

They way time being stopped is genius as you will unlock the ability to use knives as platforms, run across water, and throw a ton of knives while the time is frozen and then unfreeze time killing people with a bunch of knives. There are water physics which can change things a bit when time is stopped and its really really good. The art style is beautiful, and the entire game I feel stays around perfectly, even though the final push for the purple key I found was super annoying to get to the final area, and that the extra stage was quite annoying and the big part of them were the two final bosses.\n\n9.5/10 If you are a metroidvania fan absolutely play this, if you are a Touhou fan absolutely play this.

It's a fan-game and not danmaku (well it has the tag but it's not mainly danmaku) This game plays like castlevania and metroid. Therefore the \"Metroidvania\" tag. Unfortunately the game is a little short but still enjoyable. \n\nIn this game you play a woman called \"Sakuya Izayoi\" (In the main touhou games by ZUN the protagonists are Reimu and Marisa. They also appear in this game) and you are in a false, virtual dimension of the main place \"Gensokyo\" which is the land of touhou. This dimension is created by her mistress \"Remilia Scarlet\" which is another girl but unlike sakuya she isn't human and has wings ( She look very human though ). Now your objective is to clear the stages from the bad guys and sometimes interesting events happen. For example someome suddenly appears and then there is funny dialogue. Seriously sometimes i giggled from what they say in this game xD. Across the map you unlock many items that help you in your adventure. Sakuya has the ability to slow down time and even stop time. Durring a time stop you can throw your knifes. Does this sound familiar? Sakuya is literally like Dio from Jojo but female and a maid lol.\nIf you beat this game, there is still things to do. Just like in the official games you can enter a \"Extra Stage\" that includes an extra boss. If you Defeat that extra stage you also unlock a boss rush mode. And even after that, you can still do achievements. So if you want more of this game you can attempt getting all the achievements because then you did everything there is to do.\n\nI recommend this game if you like:\n1. Touhou\n2. Time manipulation \n3. Metroidvania / Sidescroller\n4. Maids\n5.

almost dropped on a couple of occasions, though in the end I was happy I didn't.\n\nThe start is pretty weak, the first quarter or so of the game leaves you without good mobility options and neglects to interact with the core time manipulation mechanics, even. But once you get to the double jump, movement starts actually being enjoyable, and once the puzzle/trap sections start involving parts that actually react to time stops in ways other than \"everything stops,\" you start having to think a bit. It's fun, and I really wish there'd have been more of that, it's probably what I enjoyed most of all.\n\nA close second is the boss battles, which are all pretty great. My one complaint, if anything, is that a couple of them involve some patterns that are really finnicky to dodge(more on this in a bit) and one pattern that I literally could not comprehend how to get out of.\n\nIf there's anything I do absolutely loathe about Luna Nights, though, it's the Graze mechanic. If you get close enough to an enemy without being damaged by them, you get HP, MP, TP(Time Points) back. If you do this while timestopped, you only get MP and TP. The problem is that \"close enough\" is \"literally inside their sprite,\" which contributes to hitboxes being baffling eldritch entities that I will not for the life of me ever comprehend in this game. Related, a couple of traps in the game(and one boss attack move) also involve \"spirals\" where part of the spiral goes into the background, other into the foreground, and I always felt it was hard to tell what parts I could safely dive through while timestopped/slowed.\n\nIn relation to that, Luna Nights also has some of the most aggressive knockback-on-hit damage of any platformer I've played. Sometimes it'll literally throw you into different screens entirely, and there are also a couple where the super finicky last jump, if you take a hit, means the knockback is liable to set you back all the way to the start of the screen.\n\nRelated to \"setbacks,\" I have rarely seen a game with such actively malicious(or random? maybe it was just rolling a die to determine?) placement of save points, fast travel points and heal points. Not a single fast travel point is ALSO a save and/or heal point, and they often involve traversing multiple screens to get to those things. I would've loved to take a jab at finding all the secrets and a couple of other things, but hell no, it would've involved WAY too much super-unfun navigation to accomplish.\n\nThe map is also really bad at indicating where you need to return with upgrades to do things, not even marking locked doors. As far as I can tell there wasn't any way to mark areas, either.\n\nSecondary abilities were also... bad, there were two I ever used(for their auto-aiming abilities) since Sakuya herself can really only attack up, left, right(there's no direct down attack, even) and some flying enemies love to hide inside walls/floors, the game could've used a bit more balancing in that regard.\n\nAnd then there are... the RPG mechanics. They are bad. They are super bad. They are probably the worst thing about the game, especially since the game happily lets you screw yourself over by not explaining them until about halfway through. Essentially enemies drop stat boosting gems, that at first you are only told is money, but then after you've likely spent a bunch of them as money, you're explained that they're stat boosters.\n\nWithout collecting a lot of these you have no passive health regen, your passive mana regen is INSANELY slow, grazes are unrewarding and time points regenerate super slowly. So this can be a bit of a \"fuck you\" to the player at such a point in the game. And even then, if you want to collect enough of them to matter, you will need to grind literal HUNDREDS of enemies.\n\nWithout some severe rebalancing, the game would've been much better off just having a higher base damage, time/mana/HP regen and time pool.\n\nDespite all these complaints, I am still recommending Luna Nights, because while there are things that don't work, and things that work badly... the developer clearly has good ideas. The mid/late-game puzzle areas often show fun, interesting and varied creativity, relying more on puzzle comprehension than puzzle execution(timing, reflexes) and once you have the double jump, the mobility really flows in a satisfying way.\n\nAdditionally the soundtrack(while being, admittedly, mostly arranges of Touhou themes) is really good and the sprite and background work are just amazing. Hats off to Patchy and Nitori in that regard especially, amazing stuff.\n\nDo keep in mind the game is like... four or five hours long unless you really get stuck on a fight and need to grind or need to obsessively push through everything in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1666807080, "timestamp_updated": 1666807080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124336870": {"recommendationid": "124336870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330284115", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1666466744}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun but nothing crazy.

Are you a Metroidvania fan? If you're one or both of these things, then Touhou Luna Nights might be the quick fix for you!\n\nSince I'm more of a Touhou fan, I will speak more from that prospective. This game is the epitome of what the Touhou fan community can achieve (and I must stress that this is [b]a fan game[/b], not an official game). Even if you've never heard of Touhou or played an official Touhou game before, Luna Nights serves as a good standalone game or can serve as a great introduction to the series that has had a strong fan following for almost two decades now! If you've been on the internet long enough, then you've definitely listened to the classic pieces such as \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\" or the fanmade \"Night of Nights\" before and you get to listen to them again in this game, alongside many other Touhou songs!\n\nThe story is simple: Remilia creates a pocket dimension that is an exact copy of the Scarlet Devil Mansion to have some fun without causing any trouble in Gensokyo. Her maid Sakuya, the main character of the game, plays along (not that she's given a choice) by exploring the fake mansion, but eventually has to convince Remilia to return them to the real dimension. All other inhabitants of the real Scarlet Devil Mansion (except Koakuma) appear as bosses. Other Touhou characters that appear in the game are: Nitori, who sells items to Sakuya that can help her along the way; Akyuu, who records Sakuya's actions and acts the the game's primary save function; and Marisa, who is her own standalone boss alongside the Scarlet Devil Mansion inhabitants. The post-game segment also features Reimu and Cirno as their own separate bosses.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Touhou Luna Nights is a Metroidvania platformer that incorporates bullet hell mechanics that Touhou fans that have played the official games are familiar with - namely the graze mechanic. In official Touhou games, grazing projectiles adds to your score. But in Touhou Luna Nights, grazing is important for regaining HP and MP, the later of which allows you to use different power-ups after finding them scattered throughout the mansion. And Sakuya's ability to manipulate time also paves the way to two different mechanics; freezing and slowing down time for a short while. These mechanics can help you solve puzzles and make fighting enemies and bosses easier, and you can increase the period that time will remain frozen as you progress through the game.\n\nThis game can get a little grindy the further you are to the end as enemies will get harder as you progress through the game. This is alleviated by the previously mentioned power-ups you find along the way and a level-up system. The more enemies you kill, the more XP you gain to level yourself up and get stronger. It will test you patience and I highly recommend that you kill all enemies you encounter early on if you can so that you don't have to grind as you get closer to the end.\n\nThere are two criticisms I have for this game though. One of them regards Cirno, one of the most popular and recognizable characters in the series. She wasn't originally in this game upon its initial release and it wasn't until 2020 when she was added as a boss. But it looks like your fight with her is the [i]only[/i] encounter you will have with her in that playthrough and save file. She doesn't even appear in the boss rush. If the developers ever come back to this game, I hope they will fix this oversight.\n\nThe other criticism is its length: it's too short. The story and post-game can be completed in approximately six hours. You'll have a lot of fun with this game, but it'll leave you wanting more content by the time you complete it.\n\nBut overall, Touhou Luna Nights is a fun little adventure filled with charming characters that fans are familiar with and first timers will learn to love, but its length leaves some things to be desired. I would love it if Team Ladybug made another Touhou fangame that explores another setting and features other characters in the Touhou universe.\n\n9/10 - Great game and love letter to the Touhou

Sakuya's signature ability is stopping time, and this is your main tool throughout the game.\n\nGameplay is great - standard Metroidvania fare with the ability to stop time. All of your abilities are projectile-based, and in stopped time you can stack up a whole bunch of them and let them loose all at once. Incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe core of gameplay is also the \"graze\" mechanic. If you \"near miss\" a projectile or an enemy, coming close, but not close enough to actually get hit, you get health and ammo. This promotes fast, aggressive play - but because you can just STOP TIME, it never gets too hard. Frankly, it's a cakewalk even compared to mainline Touhou games - treat it as a more of a power fantasy than a challenge.\n\nAs for graphics and music, not much to say you didn't already know. The game is absolutely gorgeous, as can be seen from screenshots. Everything looks great and the level of detail is kept right up until the very last level.\n\nAnd the music is Touhou remixes. I have listened to a remix of U.N. Owen Was Her?, remade entirely with Medic and Scout noises from TF2, and I will still swear on my life I've never heard a bad Touhou song or remix. It's an entire album of absolute bangers.\n\nJust play the goddamn game. It's cheap, not very long, and will leave you wanting more.

If you remember the heyday of Castlevania on the Gameboy Advance and Nintendo DS, this fits right in - it's got a lot of the usual Castlevania stages, but like each of those games it has a unique hook. In this case, the hook is time control, both slowing it down and stopping it. It makes extensive use of this mechanic both for combat and some really interesting time puzzles.\n\nOne thing to note is that the big difference between Touhou Luna Nights and Castlevania is the Touhou tone to the game. Instead of an apocalyptic battle of good and evil, the story of Touhou Luna NIghts is really about a bunch of super powered friends having friendly challenges and rivalries in a Castlevania castle.

Not this game- this game was developed by a small team and with a likely much more limited budget. It is far more deserving of the Symphony of the Night spiritual successor title than Bloodstained. There I said it.\n\nThis game is absolutely incredible and I found it completely by accident by scrolling through a list of overwhelmingly positive titles and I saw a Touhou game (Which confused me). I have played some Embodiment of Scarlet Devil and I listen to the music occasionally, but that is about the extent of knowledge on the Touhou franchise- but my word if this game doesn't entice me to go play more of the franchise.\n\nThis game is a proper metroidvania. It kicks your ass, you figure it out, and you apply those skills to fights later, and all of a sudden you're a pro at playing this game and now you want to speedrun it.\n\nThis game follows the formula:\n\n- It teaches you by slowly introducing mechanics to you one at a time.\n- You apply those skills en masse when they eventually combine them.\n- In failure it teaches you even more about what to do the next time you do a fight or encounter.\n- It does not waste your time since saves are at the boss gates.\n- It's got excellent synthy music to keep you motivated and interested. (And if you like Touhou music, prepare your body, some good arrangements in here).\n- Tight controls and mechanics.\n- Actions and fights are repeatable.\n- Once you have gained mastery you feel overpowered, nothing feels better in a game than when that happens.\n- It\u2019s not painstakingly long, 5-10 hours on your first run depending on your skill level, and it appears (from speedrun dot com) < 1 hour if you git gud on repeat runs.\n\nI also like the fact that it's not just Touhou themed in characters, settings, and music- but they brought in the mechanics- like they sprinkled some bullet hell in, learning placement / when to move vs staying put, and grazing for HP/MP recovery. It is an outstanding and well thought out game that stays true to the core games mechanics and the general vibe summer.\n\nTo be clear I'm not without minor complaints:\n\nStory Is Pretty Meh / Non Existent\nThis is sorta on brand for Touhou and I don't hate it- at least it's not lying to me about the importance of it with some shitty excuse plot. Let's be real, no one actually cares about why you're killing Mother Brain in Super Metroid. You just want to play the game, fight shit, kill the animals, and fuck off. Truthfully it is sort of a breath of fresh air when you just got done playing a 120 hour plot driven RPG game. So for me not really a complaint. However, it might be for you, but I also think you\u2019re looking in the wrong category. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nTime Stop / Knife Jump\nYou can get stuck with time stopping because you jump with your knives or use your knives. Actually the whole knife jump + time stop thing could use a rework it's a bit jank.\n\nExtra Area / Bosses\nI think the extra area was too easy and too short, with that said I did enjoy the final fight with Reimu. I just wish the extra section was just a bit harder.\n\nGoddamn though, if this game isn't near perfect in my eyes. This is the sort of games we need- not grossly overfunded (and late) kickstarters or games with movie level budgets and development / release cycles that teeter on approaching the inevitable heat death of the universe. We need more of this.\n\nThank you for making this game and know your work is appreciated by some of us. I would love a sequel that is far larger than this game with even harder content. However, it is unlikely at this point based on some of the things I\u2019ve read.\n\nFor everyone else, buy this game, play it, you're gonna love it. If you like metroidvanias you have no excuse not to play this game. It\u2019s relatively cheap, it\u2019s fairly short so it\u2019s not going to waste your time. It's a better use of your money than a lot of other games (or worse, DLC) on steam.\n\nFinal Note: If you love this game, write a review, tell your friends to play this game because that is the only way we might get to see more excellent content like this.\n", "timestamp_created": 1660870626, "timestamp_updated": 1660870626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120809283": {"recommendationid": "120809283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082390118", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 895, "last_played": 1660781530}, "language": "english", "review": "I am the true Touhou that we made along the way", "timestamp_created": 1660781645, "timestamp_updated": 1660781645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120807853": {"recommendationid": "120807853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120705021", "num_games_owned": 867, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 814, "last_played": 1659693472}, "language": "english", "review": "The graphics, game mechanics and arranged music from Touhou 6 are excellent!

As a standalone game, there wasn't much of a story to begin with and some of the dialog was oddly translated, but you don't really play this game for the story.\nI think it can be mostly summed up as \"Cute Girls Doing Cute Things\" but with anime superpowers involved.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThough this game might look and feel like a Metroidvania, it is every bit of a Bullet Hell Shmup at heart.\n\nYou'll often end up in situations where you're surrounded by screen-filling attacks and the only way out is to slow down time to be able to dodge out of the way, which this game refers to as a \"Graze\".\nThe Graze system isn't for everyone and can take some getting used to, but it's an interesting mechanic once you've got it down.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive, and *most* of the time mistakes feel like they're actually your fault as opposed to bad game design.\nSakuya has a cool moveset, though some of the level design decisions made regarding how late in the game you unlock certain abilities seem a bit odd.\n\nMy main complaint with the game is probably that Sakuya is *incredibly* squishy and will very easily die in just a few hits. There is technically a story reason for why she's as weak as she is while the other characters/bosses have health in the 10k HP range, but spending 5-10 minutes whittling down a boss's HP bar when you can only take maybe 5 hits from full health without Grazing seems just a liiiiiiiiitle unbalanced.\n\nNot only that, Sakuya takes a ridiculous amount of knockback from *every* hit so you're often sent flying somewhere that you don't want to be. That, combined with the period of invincibility that you get after being hit being ridiculously short, leads to many situations where you can effectively get juggled by enemies and die without being able to do a lot about it.\nThe screen just before the secret boss is filled with so many screen-filling enemies that juggle you back and forth that I pretty much spent a whole game session just getting past that one room alone. Yeah, that was a post-game room and was literally the last room in the game, but it seemed a little excessive.\n\n<edit- Spoilers?>\nAfter playing around with a save editor, it Is possible to turn Sakuya into a walking tank like the other characters in the game but getting her to that point requires a ridiculous amount of grinding that most players won't do. I 100%ed the game at level 25 and that was playing at a casual pace and I don't consider myself to be particularly good at the game. S-ranking Boss Rush mode seems to want Sakuya at at *least* level 40 with tons of money put into upgrades if the Achievement Guide is any indication and I doubt anyone but the most hardcore of players would be willing to do the amount of grinding necessary to make up 15+ levels of grinding for money on such a short game.\nIn this regard, my main complaint as far as gameplay balance seems to come from the fact that you need to gather a ridiculous amount of gems to have any real noticeable effect on Sakuya's stats and there just isn't enough content in the game to collect the number of gems needed in a normal playthrough without grinding.\nThere is no New Game+ option to allow you to continue collecting money and experience so achievements like the one for beating the game without dying seem like more of a slog than a challenge worth attempting.\n<end edit>\n\nMy only complaint with the controls is that it's sometimes too easy to attack in the wrong direction. Sakuya has the ability to move in the opposite direction from where she's facing while in a certain attack animation, and this can lead to you attacking in the wrong direction if an enemy jumps behind you and you aren't super careful.\n\nIn short, this game is absolutely worth your time (pun intended), especially if you're a fan of the Metroidvania genre.", "timestamp_created": 1658709825, "timestamp_updated": 1658799767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119398862": {"recommendationid": "119398862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122865294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1636595809}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best metroidvania games I've played in recent times.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1658688048, "timestamp_updated": 1658688048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119358370": {"recommendationid": "119358370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315425656", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1697404199}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Despues de haberle completado los logros la verdad es que me parecio unos de los juegos mas entretenidos que jugue. no es sencillo, pero tampoco es super complicado de completar.\nMuy buen juego la verdad", "timestamp_created": 1658630934, "timestamp_updated": 1676234885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119353984": {"recommendationid": "119353984", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996367014", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1658554787}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple, but fun, metroidvania", "timestamp_created": 1658624214, "timestamp_updated": 1658624214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119212250": {"recommendationid": "119212250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150273939", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1661395128}, "language": "english", "review": "spamming thousand knives makes any game a masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1658425959, "timestamp_updated": 1658425959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119201984": {"recommendationid": "119201984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131654836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1183, "last_played": 1616157399}, "language": "english", "review": "You fight Lolis with superpowers, except this time in a metroidvania instead of in a bullet hell game.", "timestamp_created": 1658413808, "timestamp_updated": 1658413808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119164543": {"recommendationid": "119164543", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125328216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1645154127}, "language": "english", "review": "Touhou Luna Nights is a really great game, a short one, but it's a really good experience.

"last_played": 1660867625}, "language": "english", "review": "This game. Is very short. Speedrunning it, you can complete it in less than an hour, even a hundred percenting it. Casually on your first playthrough with no prior knowledge of the game, you will most likely take a more standard five hours, but most of this is spent on the obligatory backtracking Metroidvanias are known for. Counting full completion, realistically closer to eight hours. Most backtracking is good, some is bad, but I will get to that later. Another thing too is that this game is nearly twenty bucks, but for the more gifted platformer, this game will hardly give them much bang for their buck. For the more ungifted platformer, however, you may possibly see a more realistic ten hours before full completion, especially if boss fights are not your cup of tea. You will certainly get a lot from this game in that regard.\n\nIt also lacks a lot of post-game content past a Boss Rush mode. Not even a couple New Game+ styles such as maybe starting a new game with all your abilities, but have to find collectables again. Or even cooler, enemy difficulty is ramped up a bit. Maybe even both. And the aforesaid \"some is bad\" moments in backtracking attributes to its sadder attempt at giving itself replay value. I do not mean the Jewel collectathon, which I actually liked. But rather, secret doors rebuilding every time you move to another area. I find that to be petty. They should stay broken. It is just an attempt to give them an excuse to have the player run around longer, which was already fine with the Jewel collecting or even going back for abilities like I did on my first playthrough since I missed over half of them initially. Lastly, for what I will say in this paragraph for now anyway, it feels really sad to not have this kind of game feature co-op. Maybe I got spoiled because of The Amazing Mirror, but Metroidvanias with co-op are so fun. I want more of them to be co-op and this game is not under the guise of your typical corporate mollycoddling where Nintendo will continue their traditions with Metroid to \"keep it safe\" as a single player experience, likewise with how the closest Konami ever did it with Castlevania was Portrait of Ruin having co-op for Boss Rush mode only. Touhou Luna Nights had plenty of room to have co-op since it was only catering to a smaller audience and it would not have been risky. I would have even settled for it only being usable with Parsec, though having separate screens would be much preferred. I technically have one more thing to scratch on, but I will save it for the end since the buildup to it is more important.\n\nNow then, the moment you have been waiting for. But wait, I am sure you are confused now. \"Why did they give it a thumbs up with this many negatives?\" Well, my friend, that is because [b]EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE GAME IS GREAT.[/b] I love the atmosphere, the engine is very tight, the music is incredible and I have a very specific bias of this being the first Touhou game I ever experienced, so nearly all of this is fresh to me completely. Touhou Luna Nights may have very well spoiled me in Metroidvanias because I just loved messing around with it. I beat it on Steam and immediately wanted to support the game a second time and beat it on Switch as well. I could not be pulled away from it for so long. I even watched my friend beat the game who was a seasoned Touhou fan and seeing them love the game so much warmed my heart as it made me realize how much it caters to their fan base. The writing was interesting to watch from start to finish. It hardly felt tedious at all past the aforesaid obligatory backtracking, but you can cheese it easily on the second playthrough onward.\n\nThis game single-handedly convinced me to enter the Touhou lore altogether and I had only vaguely known the franchise for roughly four years, but not too much past seeing some of its characters in VRChat as my first true exposure to them and knowing of the tracks Night of Knights and Bad Apple. Every time I saw anything MMD related to them, it was still just those two tracks. But every other track in this game was completely brand new to me. And I love their renditions of them. In fact, I love nearly every track in the game and I am very picky on my musical tastes, so that means a lot coming from me. I have not played a video game in years where the atmosphere of a boss fight was so perfect I felt like I was actually there for a second. In particular, fighting Remilia, her telling you of her fake world, fighting you, being proud of what you have achieved and the music almost perfectly building on all the right moments of the fight. Honestly had me in some tears and that was a weird emotion to feel well playing an action video game. But it was just so powerful. I loved every second of it.\n\nAnd speaking of what I said earlier, this is where the biggest crash of my positives begin. I felt this exact same way about another fight, Cirno. To my knowledge, she was the first Touhou character I ever laid eyes upon, so she holds the most nostalgic attachment to me in that regard. Not that it necessarily makes her my favorite, but her fight was fairly unique in its setup (no pun intended). From my understanding of her lore, she is a character picked on a lot and is overall incompetent, even showing that a bit in the cutscenes. But, she puts on enough of a show to convince Sakuya to respect her effort and her track has a really nice \"triumphant\" feel to it as well, almost like Cirno wants to prove she can at least leave a dent in Sakuya and the aftermath cutscene is her reward. Only for it to comically fall apart after Sakuya respects her being near the end of her journey and Cirno quite literally brings up if that was the first stage. Hence, why she says Remilia sent her. But on the bright side, Cirno is still harder than Meiling, so I would respectfully put her as a second stage boss myself.\n\n\"Where is the crash?\" Here it is. Cirno is somehow completely omitted from the Boss Rush mode entirely. Based on my research of this, I just have no clue why, but she is not there. My previous criticisms I will not label as big because it is me expecting the game to give me more than what it did, such as the aforesaid co-op I wish it had. But, a [b]big[/b] criticism I will give this game is being the first Boss Rush I ever played to not have every single boss included. It just feels like a massive oversight and it is amazing it has not been addressed. There are not even mods of the game to properly return Cirno to it either, so what you see is what you get. For those who want to fight her multiple times, I suggest a second save file that specifically ends before the Cirno fight. Her pattern is fun, the music is great and the only real downside is you can not do it with all of your abilities like you can in Boss Rush. Specifically, only losing Dash Spike and Bound Knife, which are not really necessary to beat her if you just spam Thousand Daggers like everyone else does, but can at least add some flavor if you fight her without using that broken weapon. Ice Magatama is just to get around fire barriers and serves no significant purpose by being in your kit in Boss Rush. Maybe people would think she is too easy, but Meiling is dirt easy in Boss Rush. And re-balancing the rank system for the achievements would not be hard at all.\n\n[i]To summarize:[/i]\n+ Great sprite work.\n+ Incredible soundtrack.\n+ Very solid game engine.\n+ Charming writing.\n+ Fun replay value in regard to Boss Rush mode.\n- Not having any kind of New Game+ features, such as Hard Mode, play with all your abilities, etc.\n- A smaller nitpick, but not having co-op.\n- [b]Cirno being absent from Boss Rush.[/b]\n- Very short if you are a seasoned platformer.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to try this game if you love platformers and especially Metroidvanias. I have played many in the genre and this game is hands down my favorite. If twenty feels a bit much for it, wait until it is ten on sale.

The time stop mechanics are incredibly well integrated, being absolutely necessary for survival. Graze an enemy while time is normal to get back HP, graze while they're frozen to gain MP... attacks eat MP, or during time stop it consumes clock time. Double jump throws a couple knives at the ground, and helps you restore MP faster cuz you can recover knives stuck in walls/floors. The \"get even higher\" special is jumping on your time-stopped knives. Just so damn clever, see. \n\nAreas are short enough that your walks between warp zones aren't too bad when going back to find more stuff.\n\nOnly real complaints I have are:\n\n- After you get the \"get higher\" power your knives become a bit of a liability... they act like walls, so throw them at the wrong time, or double jump while stopped, and you have yourself a tricky situation where the knives are locking you into position.

esquivar todo lo que te suelten sin descanso pero no es un problema en este juego por una simple mec\u00e1nica que nos har\u00e1 parar el tiempo, haciendo que el bullet hell no sea un infierno de balas como su nombre indica y sea cosa de pensar en cada momento cuando activarlo para parar el ataque que se deja entrever que es imposible de otra manera. Tambi\u00e9n se usa en todo momento fuera de los jefes para puzzles sencillos o incluso para facilitar el combate de ciertos enemigos. \nPero hay algo en este juego que tira por la borda todo y es su sistema de \"estamina\", en este juego lo llaman [i]MP[/i] y lo que hace es que cuando gastas munici\u00f3n esa barra ira disminuyendo hasta que quede a 0 y su \u00fanica forma de recuperla es parando el tiempo en circunstancias adecuadas, recogiendo la munici\u00f3n que quedo clavada en alguna pared o gastar las gemas que conseguiste para comprar \"pociones\" que recargue tu MP. Con los jefes pasa una cosa y es que no paran de lanzarte ataques y que muchos de estos aun usando la mec\u00e1nica de parar el tiempo te podr\u00e1n dar porque son muy inconsistentes y realmente no seria un problema si no fuera porque el sistema de MP te alarga exageradamente el combate teniendo que pasar por muchos ataques sin que tu le est\u00e9s haciendo nada de da\u00f1o.\n\n[h1]M\u00e1s puntos negativos:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]La mec\u00e1nica MP esta mal dise\u00f1ada alargando los jefes y haciendo que est\u00e9s expuesto a muchos fallos sin poder hacer nada mas que esquivar y recargar munici\u00f3n a paso de tortuga.\n    [*]El mapa es una completa basura no puedes marcar nada ni tampoco es intuitivo es un completo caos. El peor mapa que he visto en un metroidvania.\n    [*]El teletransporte mas cercano a la tienda esta demasiado lejos que antes te da para varios intentos en un jefe que ir al teletransporte m\u00e1s cercano para quedar al quinto c*** de la tienda.

Dice que presiones el bot\u00f3n de mover pero eso igual activara la opci\u00f3n de jugar, no tiene sentido la verdad.\n    [*]Como metroidvania es muy decepcionante, es muy lineal y las habilidades solo sirven para avanzar.

rese\u00f1a pero solo te dir\u00e9 que es hermoso. Un estilo de juego muy din\u00e1mico y viciante, es como estar danzando en cada pelea de jefes, tiene su reto. \nUn hermoso metroidvania y uno de los mejores que si te encanta TOUHOU, un poco la dificultad como reto y la acci\u00f3n muy din\u00e1mica te va a encantar, su sistema de recuperaci\u00f3n de Vida y Energ\u00eda es una gozada porque trabaja con el movimiento de riesgo recompensa de \"rozar\" a los enemigos, agreg\u00e1ndole un sentimiento de adrenalina ligera y satisfacci\u00f3n colosal sobre todo en las batallas contra los jefes, que dios, las primeras veces que te las pasas son memorables y muy bonitas. De lo mejor que he podido jugar en el estilo sin duda.\nQue decir de lo visual es hermoso el trabajo de pixel art, pero rayando en el arte, as\u00ed de lindo es a primera vista.\nLa m\u00fasica es una gozada y m\u00e1s si eres un fan de la m\u00fasica del mundo de Touhou, aqu\u00ed particularmente durante el gameplay y los jefes queda de manera sublime para acompa\u00f1ar y amenizar tu aventura.\nPara mi gusto su duraci\u00f3n me ha dejado satisfecho y ha sido excelente casi lo termino al 100% solo dej\u00e1ndolo justo en 99% de una, y lo jugu\u00e9 varias veces incluso en varias plataformas y controles, teclado y gamepad y en ambos me fascin\u00f3, me encant\u00f3 tanto que lo compr\u00e9 para consola y computadora. y la primera vez que lo toqu\u00e9 no pude dejar de jugarlo en todo el d\u00eda hasta que mi cuerpo no pudo m\u00e1s.\nNo he hablado de otro aspecto genial de este titulo y es que ademas puedes pausar el tiempo e interactuar con est\u00e1 mec\u00e1nica de administrar el control de las situaciones y librarte de ataque o generarlos de manera muy \u00e9pica con todo el arsenal de armas que vas juntando a tu disposici\u00f3n durante tu avance por los mapas con sus peque\u00f1os puzzles de plataformas y zonas ocultas. Mejorando cada vez m\u00e1s tu poder y el tiempo que puedes pausar.

Esto sum\u00e1ndole una acci\u00f3n tremendamente satisfactoria y muy din\u00e1mica entre tambi\u00e9n sus pausas y jugar con ese equilibrio del tiempo.\nLa verdad la historia principal est\u00e1 muy bien y su duraci\u00f3n jefes epicardos, escenarios muy buenos. Muy entretenido y divertido.\nToda una experiencia la verdad destacar algunos Jefes que son bellisimos y que incluso casi a mitad de juego y poco m\u00e1s adelante bien podr\u00eda acabar quiz\u00e1s y ya ser\u00eda feliz pero est\u00e1 lleno de muchos, una peque\u00f1a historia muy genial y unos plot twist la verdad muy \u00e9picos y disfrutables. \n\nXD Me pas\u00e9 el juego sin usar los consumibles de la tienda XD no s\u00e9 ni en que momento pero fue genial.\n\npodr\u00eda hablar todo el d\u00eda y m\u00e1s sobre el juego, pero simplemente lo am\u00e9 as\u00ed bien fanboy yo f\u00e1cil le pondr\u00eda un 10/10 (\uff61\u2665\u203f\u2665\uff61) y as\u00ed siendo objetivos te dir\u00eda que es un muy buen juego que deber\u00edas probar. c: \nSe lleva mi kokoro <3 y espero Team LadyBug nos traiga m\u00e1s jueguitos as\u00ed porque su estilo es re genial.

Have a takoyaki party this weekend!\n\nHere\u2019s what you need:\nEggs. Eggs make up the majority of the batter and help it get crisp.\nFlour. Flour binds everything together into a very loose batter.\nDashi powder. Dashi powder is what gives the batter it\u2019s flavor \u2013 it\u2019s a simple shortcut way of incorporating dashi (Japanese soup stock) into the base. You can buy dashi powder in the Asian grocery store or online. It adds a bunch of flavor and umami.\nSoy sauce. This is just to add some extra flavor.\nOctopus/tako. The reason why we\u2019re here! You can buy already cooked tako at the Asian grocery store in the seafood section. Cut the tako up into cubes.\nGreen onions. These add a bit of freshness to the takoyaki.\nTenkasu. Tenkasu is tempura bits! They add texture and aroma. If you don\u2019t have any (they sell them in bags at the Asian grocery store) then you can sub in rice krispies.\nTakoyaki sauce. A thick brown sweet and savory sauce.\nKewpie mayo. This is essential and gives your octopus balls that iconic look.\nBonito flakes. These flakes are what make your takoyaki look like it\u2019s dancing! They are delicate, paper thin shaved dried fish that wave around from the hot steam. They are super savory.\nSeaweed. A little green sprinkle of powdered seaweed.\n\nHow to make takoyaki\nMix. Mix the batter up with a whisk making sure there are no floury bits.\nPrep. Prep all of the fillings. Cut up the octopus, slice the green onions and make sure you have everything at the ready: a little dish of oil, all your ingredients, some skewers to flip the balls, and a plate to serve on. Heat up the pan.\nPour and fill. Generously oil the pan with a brush or a paper towel dipped in oil. Give the batter a whisk then pour into the individual compartments all the way up to the top. It\u2019s okay if they overflow a bit. Add in the fillings and let cook until the edges start to look more solid and opaque.\nFlip. Use your skewers to turn the takoyaki 90 degrees. If they don\u2019t easily move, they need more time to crisp up. Once they\u2019re at a 90\u00b0 angle, pour in a bit more batter to ensure a super round ball. Let cook, stuffing in any excess batter that\u2019s outside the ball, then turn again. You should have a round ball. Cook until the balls are crispy and brown, moving the balls around from mold to mold to evenly cook (this is because most pans will have uneven heating). As the balls crisp up, it will be easier to flip them.\nSauce. When the balls are golden and crisp, pop them on a plate and brush with takoyaki sauce and squeeze on some mayo.\nTop. Finish with a sprinkle of bonito and aonori.

The enemies and monsters within are also all unique, and the variety keeps me entertained when exploring a new section of a level, and speaking of which, the hidden rooms containing secret spell cards and power-ups also brings me satisfaction whenever I happen to stumble upon one.  \nThe boss fights are amazing - The music I love to listen to, and the storyline which unravels I believe is quite interesting (especially considering I know nothing about Touhou or its universe). Gameplay-wise, the mechanics of the many bosses can be quite confusing and difficult to figure out, but nonetheless it all adds to the satisfaction of whenever I manage to finish a boss at the end.\n\nOverall, I love this game; I cannot seem to argue negatively about it.", "timestamp_created": 1646504762, "timestamp_updated": 1646504762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111578488": {"recommendationid": "111578488", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026599056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1678317981}, "language": "english", "review": "tOUHOU", "timestamp_created": 1646467406, "timestamp_updated": 1646467406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111431148": {"recommendationid": "111431148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156047544", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1658090874}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet, great fun all around.

The characters (with the exception of Akyuu) are all well known and relatively popular. Since the game's world is detached from that of the main Touhou series, the story is self contained and doesn't end up contradicting anything in the main series. I had seen the final boss before playing, but I did not expect the plot twist at the end.\n\nOf course, that's all about the story, but the gameplay is also great. When I first saw the game, I didn't expect it to reach the same level of bullet hell that Touhou does, but the later bosses (ESPECIALLY REIMU) proved me wrong. Graze is a great translation from the main games and serves as a great risk-reward system, offering health, mp, and time, in exchange for a large risk in getting hit. Again, when I first saw the game, I thought that stopping time would completely break the game and make it really easy. However, the inclusion of green and purple bullets prevents that issue, not to mention that graze is less effective when time is stopped, encouraging the player to play risky. If I had one complaint, it would be that the secret rooms can be hard to find. The inclusion of the lost holy sword, which is an endgame item, removes this, as, when it is active, the sword will automatically reveal secret rooms, meaning that an endgame sweep of the map isn't tedious. The music is great as always, and it's varied enough to not get grating while you play.\n\nOverall, if you've been on the fence about trying Touhou, this is a great entry point to see if you're interested in the world and characters. Even if you're already a fan of the games, the game is worth trying to see how all of the mechanics are translated into the metroidvania format.\n", "timestamp_created": 1645457165, "timestamp_updated": 1645457165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110696449": {"recommendationid": "110696449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969187384", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1686751647}, "language": "english", "review": "S,MAOPsdnasoncxalMNIPHDVEWPQFJQEAWODHjs[alx[oqncwpfjmvqepivahbsncxo[k wdiaghabvew[pkfweiGBFVW[OWJCMENIOCBqwocjsdvWISHBVNP]vrwjbowhngp]wjeDOGOHWE]pvdsj[ohcnwqwpwfhsaochhbv", "timestamp_created": 1645452282, "timestamp_updated": 1645452282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110660702": {"recommendationid": "110660702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173594838", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 801, "last_played": 1645907546}, "language": "english", "review": "Epic", "timestamp_created": 1645394129, "timestamp_updated": 1646339896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110659879": {"recommendationid": "110659879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085690286", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1006, "last_played": 1645383660}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Divertido y entretenido\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1645393162, "timestamp_updated": 1645393162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110648421": {"recommendationid": "110648421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001337105", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1691285372}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best paced games I've played to date.

There is a challenge to be found in both the combat and the map puzzles\n- Excellent pixel artwork, both for the characters, items, and level aesthetic.\n- The time stop mechanic is very fun, and fairly balanced. Sure, you can demolish bosses in boss rush after becoming fully upgraded using it, but throughout your regular first playthrough it feels balanced enough.\n- The story is very simple yet fun; it isn't intrusive nor does it take up the majority of the game. And people unfamiliar with Touhou can still enjoy it.\n- Boss rush mode is a fun way to raise your level.\n- Very nice music, all of them being remixes of classic Touhou tunes.\n\n[h1] The Good: [/h1]\n- You can enjoy this game without knowing a single thing about Touhou. Like me. Coming into this game, I only knew about the strongest and smartest fairy Cirno from memes (don't worry, she's in this game) and that Bad Apple video. Nothing else lmao.\n- There is a really nice variety of enemies. Some are \"reskins\" of older enemies, but are done so in a way that makes them a step-up from their older and weaker counterparts and keeps the game interesting.\n- There are different kinds of skills that you can find and unlock to make your kills more efficient. A few of them are kinda useless imo, but others are incredibly fun to abuse.\n- There are DOOM-style secrets of hidden passageways found in normal-looking walls that creates an incentive to search around the levels for bonus stuff.\n\n[h1] The Bad: [/h1] \n- There are a few bugs that can softlock you and force you to start from a save point. Thankfully, these moments are rare. My word of advice: don't time stop when you're inside water.\n- Cirno isn't in the boss rush. Why.\n\n[h1] Notes: [/h1]\n- I had no knowledge of this funny Jojo reference lady with the time stop and knives is, but she's kinda cute.\n- I also had no idea that this was a fan game. In fact, most Touhou games in the Steam store are fan games. Guess I gotta play to real stuff now.\n- I wish Cirno was in the boss rush segment. Please make it happen.\n\n[h1] FINAL VERDICT: 9/10. \"1, 2... 9!\" [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1642728460, "timestamp_updated": 1642728483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108402336": {"recommendationid": "108402336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076253908", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1690255492}, "language": "english", "review": "Knife maid.", "timestamp_created": 1642700757, "timestamp_updated": 1642700757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620530188083648682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108377589": {"recommendationid": "108377589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803509747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 786, "last_played": 1642671334}, "language": "spanish", "review": "kono Dio da 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1642669261, "timestamp_updated": 1642669261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108360932": {"recommendationid": "108360932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061904975", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1198, "last_played": 1642640786}, "language": "english", "review": "Good metroidvania for people who may be interested in Touhou.

To start off, wanting to get into the Touhou series, I was recommended this game due to already being a big Castlevania SOTN fan and to start soaking in all the info about these characters, names, personality, music etc. So, I played, from beginning to All Clear with 100% of the map covered and oh boy it was a journey. Now to some topics I want to talk about:\n-STORY: I found the story to be pretty enjoyable and easy to understand for someone who just started the series with this game. I feel it was satisfying enough to explain why this was happening and why go through this journey. \n\n-CHARACTERS: I would say that characters in this game was fun to get to know to say the least, but most of them I wish I could\u2019ve got to know more of. I wish that many of them would appear more often throughout the game instead of just appearing for a boss fight then never seen again. However, I really enjoyed Sakuya as a main character and was able to get a lot of info about who she is and her powers. I say she definitely the star of the game and best girl \n\n-SETTING: I really love the setting of the game mostly because of it giving nostalgic feelings of CastleVania SOTN but still stands to me as its own place and not just a carbon copy of the castle. \n\n-MUSIC: OMG, this game soundtrack was amazing. While I do know mostly all these songs comes from the original series, I really enjoyed this newer rendition of these songs as my first time hearing them in general. One thing I can tell about the series in general is that their music is top notch and defiantly deserves all its popularity.\n\n-GAMEPLAY: IT\u2019S LITTERALY SOTN\u2026.. with some very fun mechanics. I found the gameplay to be absolutely fun due to playing like a mertoidvania game, but it's time mechanic was something so refreshing. I feel they struck gold with time stop due to being a mechanic that was able to make some fun puzzles and be a lifesaver in battle at the same time. The weapons in this game were also fun. Though definitely the Thousand knives were my most used weapon by a long shot, the other weapons like holy sword, shield and chainsaw were also super helpful and save me a lot as well. The graze system in this game was also a lovely addition, I love how dodging in this game felt so rewarding due to graze, especially on later bosses where I was able to gain health back during these. Speaking of which, the bosses in this game are definitely the most fun part, it really puts use of everything you acquire and learn thus far into action which I love. Last thing is that Sakuya handles very well, and all her movement was spot on, no issues there (at least on a ps4 controller).\n\n-DIFFCULTY: I\u2019ll say is average compared to other games in the genre, not too easy but not too difficult. I say it manageable if it\u2019s your first ever mertoidvania game, but I will say the spike from regular enemies to bosses are a bit high but after a couple of tries, you will start getting the hang of how-to doge each attack. Also, there isn\u2019t too much health/save points/teleports locations but would say it's enough, maybe a bit more teleports especially could\u2019ve help \n\n-NEGATIVES: While I am basically praising the game to death, there are some things that I did dislike about the game. My main issue with the game to me at least is the length of the game itself. I feel this game was a bit too short for me, I really wish there was at least 2 or more areas and bosses to explore/fight. While I do have 8hrs in gametime, some was spent just casually walking around/grinding, so really could\u2019ve beaten the game in around 6 and a half. I really wanted this game to be longer, but it wasn\u2019t the end of the world due to me still feeling satisfied at the end. Another negative is some of the items and abilities you get throughout the game being very under used or obsolete. Why the stun knife is the first weapon you do get, I definitely did not used it since it didn\u2019t really help to much and everything else out class it. The bounce knife, the LAST weapon you\u2019ll get, also had this issue of already being obsolete compared to others. With abilities, I found the screw knife to be under used, I think you only use it 4 times, and also dislike you get the dash ability so LATE in the game. Last is I wish they would\u2019ve focused very early on about how gems truly work. I didn\u2019t really need the shop though since I never bought anything but would still be nice if others can use it without costing important resources to your stats.\n\nCONCLUSION: Even with the negatives I mentioned above, I still love this game to death. It\u2019s Gameplay and Music is what I would consider making this game a must play even if you never played a mertoidvania or touhou game. While this game isn\u2019t a bullet hell unlike the main entries, I feel this game should defiantly be praise as a main entry and an entry for others to get into the series. It defiantly borrows a lot of what made SOTN great, but I still feel Team LadyBug created something super unique and turn it out amazing. With that, I\u2019ll say I give this game a 9/10 and do hope will get to see a sequel with Sakuya still the MC, and by the same staff. \n", "timestamp_created": 1642305159, "timestamp_updated":

\"Castlevania: Symphony of The Night\" but with Touhou characters instead. That's pretty much what this game is all about, a \"metroidvania\". Despite the homages this game is making (the games being very difficult), this is not a hard game. But it can be a fun challenge for the casual gamer. And even if you don't know the story behind the Touhou franchise or the characters, the gameplay is what makes this game a very good one to play.\n\nThe ability of stopping time and using the items that you collect through the game without spending or wasting any points while time is stopped, it's a very fun mechanic. Some enemies can be tough to beat as the game progresses, and some levels will drive you mad at times. \n\nSomething curious about this game is the fact that it has a shop, but you don't really need to spend any money on said shop. If you are good at the game, you can find all the skills and items that you need to beat the game through the map, hidden in secret rooms, without spending any gems. But gotta say, the last bosses will require you to get many of items and upgrades in the game. \n\nIn my opinion, a criticism I can make to this game is that when facing the bosses, evading and dodging some of their powers can heal you and refill your skill points and time points pretty quickly. This makes the boss fights very easy once you understand how they work, and makes the items in the shop useless. It is also a very short game that you can probably beat like in 2 or 3 days. But despite these minor flaws, the game is very fun. \n\nI say get it on a sale. It is entertaining, the pixel art and animations are fantastic, the music is great, the \"time stop\" mechanics are addictive and unique, and if you are a Touhou or a Castlevania fan, you are definitely gonna enjoy it. An entertaining short game, fun bosses with a bit of challenge at later stages and a very nice soundtrack.

It\u2019s interesting but also this set of mechanics makes it more fiddly and hard than precise and satisfying. Near-hits replenish HP, MP and the timer, which can be exchanged for a time-freeze and any movement or attacks during it. While the time is frozen the radius of near-hits becomes pretty big, but now they replenish only MP in limited amounts per threat. And yes, you can camp near some stationary enemies to replenish your HP by two points per attack. You will. Some save-points are pretty far apart and the fourth level is filled with spikes and rotating blades of all configurations.\nSo this is less of an action game, and more of resource juggling and precise planning of a route. During the early game, it is necessary to stop time near every petty enemy to replenish MP \u2014 since the second level, the game has flying enemies which are evading the basic attack and non-guided magic. And the basic attack drains MP too anyway. The time-stopping plays an animation instead of being instantaneous. It should be at least faster. There are several environmental hazards or boss attacks that can be avoided only through time manipulation. But it\u2019s impossible to tell which parts of the art-assets are hit-boxes. And the result is unpredictable \u2014 sometimes those let the character pass other times they deal damage. And the worst part is the abundance of particles in the animations and the similarity of the colours between the character\u2019s attacks and enemy\u2019s. During a fight, the challenge is to actually see where is the danger in this blinking mess covering the whole screen. The picture is pretty often entirely unreadable. It\u2019s not as much of a precision game as a war of attrition. The combat is more complex and drawn out, than plain hard. Even with the high damage from enemies, it\u2019s always about accumulating mistakes than missing one fatal blow.\nThe game has JRPG levelling, but it\u2019s more pointless than ever. It\u2019s very hard to notice any improvements from a new level. The EXP requirements curve is very temperate but even the late-game enemies rarely bring ten points or more. The most effective way to grind is to find a gathering of 2xp \u201cboars\u201d near a replenishing station on the first level and just pop in and out of the room while spamming homing magic.\nInstead of pure cash enemies drop gems, and those can even improve the character\u2019s stats. But the % are so low that there is no actual benefit to it. I never saw the declared HP regen in action even after collecting several hundreds of emeralds. Not even a single HP. It\u2019s better to just sell the gems to the shopkeep and buy several upgrades for the gauges and spend the remaining on the expensive HP\\\\MP potions. Some magics make most boss fights trivial, but if the player fails to notice those or can\u2019t find the unlocking cards, end-game boss fights will require the usage of potions. But unlike Dracula X 2 medkits are used in real-time without any menus. With the same interface as Rodoss and SMT games but without a breather to orient oneself in the stupid inventory.\n\nThe saving and replenishing stations are automatic and are triggered just by walking through them. Now that\u2019s a real quality of life improvement over Akumajo Dracula games. And the replenishers even have a mini-game. The character drinks a canned drink and drops the can, so the player can time it to be dropped into nearby rubbish bins for 10 coins and an achievement. But i still see no reason why save stations, replenishers, teleports and shops aren\u2019t combined into one room. Instead, there is only one shop but it sells consumables to summon it anywhere, even into a boss fight. Now that\u2019s weird, why would anyone do that instead of calling the delivery into a clearly telegraphed save room right before the fight? Which only proves that all four stations should be combined into one, instead of wasting the player\u2019s time on commute. The checkpoints replenish all the gauges on death anyway. It\u2019s as if the game proposes to the player to off themself when they reach a safe point, just to not run around with 10% HP.\n\n[i][b]\u0418 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0451\u043d\u043e\u043a is lucid dreaming.[/b][/i]\n\nSo, this is my first Touhou game and i severely disliked the series because i don\u2019t understand the lore. I even opened a wiki and it doesn\u2019t have the series\u2019 storyline. And yep, this game didn\u2019t help at all. It\u2019s easy to get the events from the in-game dialogues, but that didn\u2019t tell me anything about the world. And this all is diegetically a game anyway and isn\u2019t related to the main series, these non-events aren\u2019t even canon. The whole writing is childish, but not in the bad sense, it\u2019s childish in the diegetic tone of the english translation.\n\nThe stupid tired pixelart is pretty cool-looking and the style of the animation is unusual and attention-grabbing. The protagonist is noodly and has a silly gait. The heal and save station aren\u2019t separate rooms, unrelated to the environment, but a part of it. Even if a foreign one (diegetically). Though, the lower border of the screen has some pointless smoke of mismatching resolution.\n\nDespite being their first full release it is a small and simple game, with limited wares in the store, like a variation on their Tensei-satellite-product. And only after playing something lesser you can appreciate something better. This game is a bit above average, but it is clearly grindier and inferior to the much tighter Shin\u30fbmegami tensei SYNCHRONICITY PROLOGUE and way smaller and simpler than the Rodosu-to senki \u2014Didoritto\u30fbin\u30fbwonder labyrinth\u2014.", "timestamp_created": 1640899587, "timestamp_updated": 1640899613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106931165": {"recommendationid": "106931165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332297635", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 846, "last_played": 1596613582}, "language": "english", "review": "stopped time, tried to kill a useless gatekeeper, got shit on instantly when time resumes", "timestamp_created": 1640896540, "timestamp_updated": 1640896540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106919994": {"recommendationid": "106919994", "author": {"steamid": "76561199191310745", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1792, "last_played": 1656170127}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever no joke", "timestamp_created": 1640886803, "timestamp_updated": 1640886803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605128169059753418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106876699": {"recommendationid": "106876699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198843329233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1698638461}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful visuals and aesthetics, outstanding sound design and great game play.

The graze mechanic and time stop/slow mechanic allows for some very interesting combat/platforming scenarios and overall satisfying gameplay. The bosses are easily the best part, and each feature a moveset that will force the player to engage with the aforementioned mechanics in order to dodge attacks, deal damage, and maintain proper levels of HP and attack points. \n\nThe aesthetic design is nice as well; the characters are waifus, the enemies are cute, the backgrounds and foregrounds have a nice pixelated/modern feel and everything feels very readable. The dialogue is nothing more or less than you'd expect from a Touhou game.\n\nThat all being said, this is an incredibly short game. It uses a lot of cheap difficulty tactics, such as save point spacing and boss rushing, making the late game more frustrating and tedious than engaging. Also the player cannot damage enemies or projectiles while they are off screen, which is annoying considering everything offscreen is still \"active\". \n\nThe secrets in this game are hidden behind walls you have to throw your knives at, and are usually nothing more than a pocket of jewels, increases to your HP/MP, or new special attacks. While secret walls are a staple of games like Metroid, Castlevania, and Hollow Knight etc., there is virtually zero indication for them in this game, nothing which draws the players attention in a meaningful way, and I discovered about half of them just by engaging in combat with the enemies and happening to hit the wall by missing a knife throw. \n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a fun, challenging, cheap metroidvania kinda game with an interesting and satisfying combat loop, Luna Nights is worth a playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1640827331, "timestamp_updated": 1640827331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106838793": {"recommendationid": "106838793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029479612", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1640902393}, "language": "english", "review": "I have never touched a Touhou title prior to this one so as a complete newbie I had blast with this game.

For a metroidvania(or search action game, I guess) there's not that many unique upgrades, but the game squeezes so much mileage out of the mechanics it does introduce that it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe game is also extremely fast-paced and lets you feel really powerful once you get a good grasp on the grazing mechanic to replenish your resources. Some of the later bosses seem crazy at first but you can just melt them once you learn their patterns to most efficiently leech mana/time and convert into damage.\n\nThis game is VERY short though(I think I beat the main story in 3-4 hours-ish, but there's a bonus stage for another 1-2 hours and a boss rush. Doing all achievements took me 16 hours total), which is a shame because I like its mechanics so much.", "timestamp_created": 1639251103, "timestamp_updated": 1639251103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105611084": {"recommendationid": "105611084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235705020", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 844, "last_played": 1642638384}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es bueno pero me ense\u00f1o a no comenzar el juego hasta que tenga los logros", "timestamp_created": 1639192021, "timestamp_updated": 1639192021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105599704": {"recommendationid": "105599704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301905226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1628850037}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a fun metroid.

side.\n\nWe control Sakuya Izayoi through an imaginary space filled with strange enemies, roadblocks, upgrades, time gimmicks, bosses, and everything you expect from a good metroidvania.\nThe world is rendered in a beautiful pixel art, the art direction is way too good, reminescent of classics such as SotN.\nThe music is flawless, its really hard to mess up touhou remixes, and team ladybug surely didn't.\n\nSakuya controls very well, you throw straight knives with the attack button, and can aim them either upwards, or in diagonals while in the air and use special weapons you find hidden in the map a la Castlevania (but you can carry them all at the same time), she can also slow down time and completely stop it for a while, all these abilities are capped by her SP and TIME resources, even so she is kinda really powerful if you know how to use her powers, which even when heavily weakened due to plot reasons make most enemies a joke.\nIf you have played Touhou you may know about Graze, in Luna Nights grazing enemies and their projectiles is one of the only ways to heal, a nice risk vs reward, but open to abuse if you go near a screen transition and graze an enemy, move between areas and repeat for a full, but slow heal.\n\nPlot is concise and not too deep, you are here for the gameplay and exploration after all.\nThe bosses can be challenging when fought at lowish levels, but with a few tries they go down without much trouble\n\nNow, onto the bad things\n-Game is really short, first run only took about 5~6 hours counting the extra stage\n-After you beat it you lust for more game, but there isn't anything else to do\n-Gem farming for minimal stat boosts takes an insane ammount of time\n-Only really challenging boss IMO was [spoiler] Reimu 2 [/spoiler], almost everyone else fell on the first or second try, and without using healing items.\n-Shield subweapon is kinda useless?\n-Screenshots in store spoil the bosses although it's not too hard to guess who you will face if you have played the ZUN games\n\nA great game that could have exploited the time control mechanics much more with a bigger map and more content in general, when the credits rolled a tear rolled thru my eyes, knowing that I wouldn't be able to experience this for the first time again.\nOverall score: 7/7 I NEED MORE", "timestamp_created": 1638869258, "timestamp_updated": 1638869258,

out myself as a filthy weeaboo nerd.\n\nTouhou Nights is a game where you play as a time travelling maid who has to clean up an entire mansion filled with monsters. Only the mansion is an illusion and your employer is trying to kill you for fun.\n\nIt makes sense in context, I swear.\n\nThe game is basically a metroidvania with the design of a good mega man game. It has a neat time gimmick instead of items, which actually makes the game more interesting. Gaining abilities for your time powers is pretty nifty since it doesn't require navigating menus and such to equip them most of the time, instead you just add a new kind of ability to stuff you already do. Like being able to climb on top of knives during stopped time, or being able to slide kick under stuff. It makes the travel pretty seamless, and its never a bore to go from place to place due to the enemies being fairly varied and the time stop mechanic allowing you to brute force through areas you don't like dealing with or enemies you don't like fighting.\n\nThe art style might be pixelated, but man do they make every pixel count. Bosses have very unique animations for everything, including Marisa who does a spinning landing onto her broomstick every time she comes in for an attack, and they animated every second of that spin. The attacks are pretty easy to see, although dodging is definitely a challenge for some of them. Makes the boss fights feel fair even if you might lose to them a couple of times.\n\nSo should you get this game?\n\nWell if you're a Touhou fan, I'd say absolutely. The game is a gem and its a fun addition to the Touhou franchise.\n\nIf you're a newcomer, I'd say a cautious yes. The game is really fun, but some of the plot will go over your head if you aren't at least passingly familiar with who all these characters are. Either way, its still worth a try if you see it on sale or are a fan of well made metroidvanias.\n\nI for one am an absolute simp for Touhou. Got the first games back in my high school days when I didn't have a lot of people to hang out with or money to buy games. The english release was free, so...I picked it up to try it.\n\nAnd now, here I am, in my 30s writing a review for a game about anime girls beating each other up.\n\nAh well.\n\nTLDR: Its a good game with good music and well designed abilities and levels.

Like I said before, the entire gameplay concept of this game is DIO- ok, being serious, youll be stopping time all the time (what) and doing all kinds of tricks, especially after all the upgrades you can get. Because of that, youll be feeling like the coolest person on earth.\nOne thing that is really impressive is how the mechanic of stopping time is not that broken, like, youll have a hard time against some bosses. It is done by limiting how much time you can stop time (what) and wasting your \"time\" on certain actions, like attacking and walking. Progressing through the game will allow you to have more time to stop time (what) and have more knives available when time is stopped, which is a really cool and clever way of dealing with possible broken machanics.\nLike I said, the game is short on time, the story is not something that complex and well thought (still not a bad one) and can be quite easy if you are familiar with metroidvanias. But still, it's a great way to pass the time and enjoy every second you are playing.\nThe music is a banger and Im listening to it right now as I write this, so yeah, the music is pretty good, espacially the final boss'.\nIn general, a  solid 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1636602663, "timestamp_updated": 1636606040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102564821": {"recommendationid": "102564821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116155263", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1663550855}, "language": "english", "review": "I want a Sakuya fumo now but they're too damn expensive\n\nIn all seriousness now that I've actually beaten the game it's a pretty damn good Metroidvania.

Regular enemies range from super easy to somewhat difficult and sometimes enemies or traps will be immune to time shenanigans. There are some neat time puzzles involving fluid dynamics too, but I think where the game really shines is the boss fights and the time mechanic.

depends on you but in my opinion is good.\n+Fighting is kinda weird at the beginng but gives a lot of sadisfaction when mastered.\n+The spirit of 2hu is very well reproduced and using Sakuya is just like i would expect (all those ZA WARUDO and daggers make the game get extra points if you are into that).\n+No forced level ups because too weak stat wise to beat that boss, something a lot of metroidvania lost in this days.\n+++++++++Cirno.\n\nCONS:\n-Game is sadly as much fun as short.\n-Soundtrack is not for everyone and someone may get bored about the same \"overused songs\" and would prefer something new, depend on tastes.\n-Fighting is not for all and you may not like it at all if you prefer something more \"shoot'em up\", later you get a skill that can be abused a lot and with a trick you can pretty much attack forever but by doing so the game may lose some of its shine for someone.\n-If you don't like 2hu and its characters you may not enjoy this game.\n-No real utility for the level ups (aside probably just for the Boss Rush) is something the Level up lovers may dislike.\n-Some sections may be quite frustrating for someone, the \"stages\" can feel harder than the actual bosses sometimes.\n\n\nIn the end:\nLuna Nights is a fun game but very short, not for everyone but surely a good game worth to be played.", "timestamp_created": 1635757047, "timestamp_updated":

Cannot recommend it for a number of reasons:\n\n1. The runtime for the game is incredibly short for a metroidvania. I finished the base game in less than 5 hours, and this includes some idling time.\n2. The level and world design is very dull, with only a few platforming ideas explored and an uninspired level layout (especially for a metroidvania) that has you go to location A to get key to open location B for every single level (and only 5 levels on top of this).\n3. Other than for the bosses, the combat is way too easy, as you can essentially cheese every enemy with the time stop mechanic. The only difficulty outside of boss fights comes from artificially difficult platforming sections that are over littered with enemies. This is more painful than challenging, but thankfully only appears in the last level.\n\nThe bosses are the only redeeming aspect of this game in my mind, so if you only care about good boss fights and money isn't a factor, go for it.

Nevertheless, The game is really damn fun, which is why my biggest problem may be the fact that it's a little on the short side.

However the awesome soundtrack and anime pixel drawings of characters and enemies makes up for any negativity I have towards this.\n\nIf you can get this for a decent price definitely treat yourself to this title.

You can sort of design how you annihilate an area of enemies with time-stop and setting up projectiles. Rest assured, even with time-stop the game is not a boring cruise.

There are no extra ending or anything to achieve (other than the \"no continue\" achievement).

Si sois asiduos a la franquicia, reconocer\u00e9is todos y cada uno de los temas y no podr\u00e9is evitar que se os escape una sonrisa cuando los reconozc\u00e1is.

With that said its time freeze mechanic and take on energy management was refreshing. The game's short length meant the game didn't outstay its welcome and hammer me with those flaws to the point where flaws overwhelmed the good side of the game.\n\n[h1]Combat (7/10)[/h1]\nThe game's combat fluctuates between 5/10 and 10/10.\nJumps and movement in general sometimes feels floaty and combat heavily relies on both and this is one of contributing factors to that fluctuation. \n\nCombat is about throwing knives and stopping time, but there's another aspect that makes it more fun: energy management. Knives you throw (and skills) use up MP and you can recover it by moving in close to enemies (or even their projectile attacks) and leeching a limited amount of their mana. \nWhen you stop time, your time meter starts running out and skills/attacks use time meter instead. Leeching becomes easier, but it also gives less MP as portion of it goes to recover time meter.\n\n[b]STARTING EXPERIENCE (7/10)[/b]\nThe game starts out fairly simple. You throw knives, jump and slow down time (mostly a useless gimmick, really). That's it. It's a great starting point to have, to give players time to adapt to controls and skills, but I thought it was taken too slowly. \n\n[b]BOSSES (9.5/10)[/b]\nAs you reach your first boss the game shows it can do a lot more with combat than just \"shoot\" down enemies that are slowly approaching you. Bosses are where this game shines most of the time, because each boss is kind of like a puzzle. You can freeze them with your time-stopping ability and on some bosses you must know when to stop time. Some bosses spam projectiles at you and by stoping time you leech the energy of those projectiles sometimes doubling or even trippling your time-freezing meter.\n\n[b]MOST OF THE GAME(8/10)[/b]\nAs you explore most stages the combat is not difficult, but sometimes requires paying attention to avoid damage. I think it's a good spot to be in for \"mindless\" section of the game, but at the same time, I wish there was just a tiny bit more risk and engagement in there. \n\n[b]ENDGAME/POST-GAME(5/10)[/b]\nThrough most of the game enemies can be frozen and/or easily killed if you notice and take action. The game trains you to deal with enemies in that specific way. Then at some point you enter one area and ALL enemies are either immune to time stop, super tanky, sneaky or all 3 of those. It's a huge pacing issue. It's like one moment you're playing a tactical shooter game and next moment you're thrown into bullet hell game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay combat aside (7/10)[/h1]\nThere's a lot to explore and many items to find. Most items are fairly uneventful (like tiny MP upgrades), but when I found those rare useful ones it made up for all of the bad ones.\n\nAt first you simply run around opening new pathways, but later areas start introducing traps, spinning blades and similar things that interact with your time freezing. Those stages are like mini-puzzle areas.\n\nThen there are few stages that take those mini-puzzle areas a bit too far and you have to keep in mind how 3 different traps interact with your time ability as you rush though an area.\n\n[h1]User Interface (4/10)[/h1]\nUI is in follows its own style and is very minimalistic. For example: You can see the items you own, but you cannot select them to see their descriptions. Consumables exist, but they are activated as skills. Speaking of skills, you have to roatate through all of them (incl. consumables) to find the one you want.\n\nSo yeah, I liked the look, but hated how impractical it is.\n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\nI can recommend this game, because its mechanics offer something no other game does and boss fights are awesome. With that said, don't expect a very polished experience. The game is fine, but it cannot compete with more popular games of the genre in terms of quality.", "timestamp_created": 1630166992, "timestamp_updated": 1668294636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597149074077606201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98389527": {"recommendationid": "98389527", "author": {"steamid": "76561199117003506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 481, "last_played": 1686935306}, "language": "english", "review": "best game i've played so dar", "timestamp_created": 1630164662, "timestamp_updated": 1630164662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98374884": {"recommendationid": "98374884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021439491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 224, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1104, "last_played": 1593597295}, "language": "english", "review": "it's hard to find really good looking pixel games but this is one", "timestamp_created": 1630146478, "timestamp_updated": 1630146478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98249984": {"recommendationid": "98249984", "author": {"steamid": "76561199045609213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1629960920}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ESTA ENTRETENIDOP ME GUSTO L", "timestamp_created": 1629961006, "timestamp_updated": 1629961006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98175700": {"recommendationid": "98175700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083197998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1629843071}, "language": "english", "review": "The overall presentation is great and the boss fights are really fun, but there are a lot of things which make the moment-to-moment gameplay of this game needlessly frustrating.\n\nFor example, in this game, by getting close enough to enemies and projectiles, you can \"graze\" them, regaining some missing MP and HP. However, this mechanic feels incredibly inconsistent; not every enemy or projectile can be grazed, and there's some sort of limit to the amount you can graze a single enemy or attack. The game doesn't tell you what can be grazed or how much you can graze it, and grazing standard enemies doesn't restore a lot of meter, so this mechanic is incredibly awkward to use outside of the boss fights.\n\nThe metroidvania aspect of this game feels pretty half-baked, as well. About half of the progression items you find throughout the game are keys which let you open specific colours of door, which feels pretty underwhelming. The map isn't very useful; items and upgrades aren't marked, nor is there any way for players to mark points of interest manually. Fast travel points are also extremely spread out. These issues make looking for secrets or anything you missed super annoying.\n\nEnemies at the end of the game become complete bullet sponges, which is a problem because your basic attack consumes mana. After fighting a big enemy, you can end up having to stand around for several seconds waiting for your mana to refill.\n\nThe game also features a few instances of unfair level design. The most egregious example is the falling chandeliers; the only indication that a chandelier will fall when passing under it is that it has a broken chain. However, most of the chandeliers in the game are placed so that the game's UI partially or completely obscures the chain.\n\nNot a bad game, but not one I'd readily recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1629845853, "timestamp_updated": 1629845853, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483829259872436523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98124740": {"recommendationid": "98124740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026549448", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1629770254}, "language": "english", "review": "This was good.

As any great indie, it is relatively short and very well-polished - the gameplay is built around time stop ability, and there are just enough variations to feel deep yet not overwhelming.\n\nThis game is difficult, mind you - mostly in a fair way, leaving you conscious of your shortcomings as the player. It is best seen in bossfights that are all preceded by a checkpoint and a way to recharge health (a welcome feature in a game that will kill you a lot), as the movesets are looped and devoid of RNG aside from certain attack patterns. Just like in Dark Souls (you knew this comparison was coming, didn't you), you get to learn your foe over time, but with the time stop and virtually no distance between the save point and the boss arena you will not waste that time artificially.\n\nThere are a few moments of frustration, of course. The game occasionally asks you to retrieve a key item, presenting you with a gauntlet, then asking to backtrack through it to come back out with the item. While a fair challenge, it is one that will often drag out and become boring. Beyond that, certain enemies will knock you off the screen into a different room, resetting themselves, and some are fast and agressive enough to demand a time stop to tackle or skip them. It is a lovely benefit of the core mechanic on its own, but the final level and the bonus stage have a couple infuriating enemy placements, and often close enough to the checkpoint to warrant a reset if you get hit (and you are likely to). And yet, despite the length of this rant, it is justified for the endgame areas, isn't it?\n\nThe art and music of the game are above all possible praise - I cannot do them enough justice. It is Touhou, after all. The story is not too far above being just an excuse for the gameplay, though it utilizes the existing characters well - and a person unfamiliar with lore will pick up most important things (\"Sakaya is a maid, Patchi has asthma, Marisa is a thief of precious things\") quite easily.\n\nTo conclude this disproportionate review, this game is gorgeous, worth buying, and worth studying.\nGameplay: 10/10\nArt: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nStory: 6/10\nTotal: \u2468/10, strongest game", "timestamp_created": 1629748576, "timestamp_updated": 1629748576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98063906": {"recommendationid": "98063906", "author": {"steamid": "76561199077615721", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1693538850}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool game just that platforming is bad until you get knife jump", "timestamp_created": 1629674626, "timestamp_updated": 1629674626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97962796": {"recommendationid": "97962796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140469227", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1118, "last_played": 1626810527}, "language": "english", "review": "The games good, just short.", "timestamp_created": 1629531071, "timestamp_updated": 1629531071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97959945": {"recommendationid": "97959945", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066299949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1629874104}, "language": "english", "review": "This game's mechanics are the best I've ever played.

You could not ask anything more from a 2D action platformer.\n\nDescribing the game as \"Metroidvania\" is a little untrue. It's basically all the good parts of a Metroidvania (some branching paths and exploration) but minus all the bad parts that usually entails (so there's no endless backtracking as you swat down the same mooks you've killed a million times already, THANK GOD). It's closer to a 2D side-scroller that allows for a little backtracking. The map is a nice size, not super huge and overly complex like most Metroidvanias.\n\nThe best part is that the game doesn't try to artificially inflate the runtime with endless backtracking and wandering around. It's fairly straightforward and always rewards you with new and exciting challenges in every room. I couldn't ask anything more as far as level design goes.\n\nAlso, the sprite work is fucking fantastic. You can freeze literally any frame in this game and each character will be doing something badass. This game looks amazing 100% of the time and it's clear the artists put a lot of care into their characters. Speaking of style, I like how the game starts off super Japanese-looking (the first level is a Japanese bathhouse) but then it gradually shifts to a more European aesthetic (European-style castles, libraries, etc.) Hell, the main character is a European-style maid. So the feel of the game is actually quite the fusion, despite the anime aesthetic.\n\nSpeaking of characters, I think it was an excellent choice to have the game feature Sakuya instead of Reimu this time. The time-stop mechanic is integrated beautifully into the gameplay. Nothing's more fun than pretending to be Dio as you Za Warudo your enemies and surround them with a death trap of throwing knives.\n\nIf there's anything not to love about this game, I'd say that it's the runtime (about 4-5 hours). It's clear they were going for quality over quantity on this one. Of course this is the preferable choice, but the climax and resolution left me wanting more. \n\nAlso, I'd say the difficulty level is extremely low compared to what you would expect from a Touhou game. You can beat most bosses on the second try. Once you obtain Thousand Knives, you can sweep most bosses easily by barraging the enemy with knives during active time, immediately freezing time, collecting graze, and then spamming the enemy with knives in stopped time as well. The game kind of puts the onus on you if you want a more challenging experience (deliberately forgoing certain skills, etc.)\n\nAll in all I loved it. I have to say I was truly amazed when the credits rolled and I saw only a handful of people could put together a game as amazing as this.

It is a love letter to Embodiment of Scarlet Devil and is very faithful to the source material; the characters and dialogue feel perfectly inline with the main series of games. The soundtrack to the game is also purely comprised of remixes from the mainline games, with many tracks being taken straight from EoSD and a couple being borrowed from Imperishable Night and Mountain of Faith.\n\nThe game's central mechanic, being able to slow down and stop time at will, is also handled exceptionally. Being able to dodge otherwise undodgeable attacks and setting up tons of knives and watching them pile tons of damage on a boss is incredibly satisfying. By the end of the game I was stopping time and setting up attacks almost as much as I was playing in real time. I'd honestly love to see more games utilize time the way Luna Nights does.\n\nThe highlight for me, though, were the boss battles. Attacks are done in the same order every time you fight a boss and there is almost no randomness to how the attacks operate, much like the bullet patterns in a bullet hell. Learning the patterns and finding optimal ways of dealing with them felt like a puzzle at times and finally beating some of the harder bosses was incredibly satisfying.\n\nOverall, a great game for fans of the franchise or Metroidvania fans looking for something different.", "timestamp_created": 1627067110, "timestamp_updated": 1627067110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96165208": {"recommendationid": "96165208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281567539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1675924560}, "language": "english", "review": "i lobr thi dd s i lov oi i lovr i love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1626923439, "timestamp_updated": 1626923439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96157224": {"recommendationid": "96157224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182806678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1626973478}, "language": "english", "review": "Shortie beauty :(", "timestamp_created": 1626909707, "timestamp_updated": 1626909707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96156509": {"recommendationid": "96156509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357071233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 687, "last_played": 1634415266}, "language": "english", "review": "It awesome metroidvania it just really good and the ost is a absolute banger \n", "timestamp_created": 1626908415, "timestamp_updated": 1626908415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96152413": {"recommendationid": "96152413", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082267239", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1627495785}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1626901794, "timestamp_updated": 1626901794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96150182": {"recommendationid": "96150182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109078163", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 780, "last_played": 1667689972}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game even for people that aren't super into touhou.

of the Scarlet Devil Mansion who has been suddenly plopped into a replica world of Gensokyo at the whims of her mistress. Robbed of her time manipulation powers, you then play through the game to gain back your abilities in expected metroidvania fashion to confront your mistress and ultimately find out why you've been dropped here.\n\nA lot of the gameplay gimmicks the game will throw at you has to do with Sakuya's ability to slow down or stop time and each level introduces enemies and platforming puzzles that all make good use of this gimmick that increases in difficulty the further you explore the mansion. Couple this with the buttery smooth movement and control you have over Sakuya and you have what culminates into a challenging yet fun and fair game that never felt frustrating.\n\nAlthough the game can indeed be finished within about 6 hours, the experience I've had with it has been nothing but a delight that I've had no problem with revisiting the game for another playthrough or another run at doing the boss rush mode.", "timestamp_created": 1626611611, "timestamp_updated": 1649097903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95941465": {"recommendationid": "95941465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344644647", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1696948691}, "language": "english", "review": "god I joined this game late but it is a fun change to the original style of touhou and a great metroidvania title with a pretty good soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1626584747, "timestamp_updated": 1626584747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95922068": {"recommendationid": "95922068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198825293114", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 3447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3447, "last_played": 1612161442}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was a lot of firsts for me.

Once you get the hang of the timestop mechanic (which you should trust me) it becomes interesting of how you can combat common enemies and boss fights. Luna Nights also encourages players to get up close and personal with its graze system which if you get close enough and dodge attacks you can gain health back (MP if you freeze time to dodge) but get hit and and the potential HP or MP goes away. The boss fights themselves are no slouch, requiring you to use all tricks you have at your disposal especially with the final and extra bosses. Aside from gameplay, I pretty much enjoyed the sprite work and really enjoyed its soundtrack which is what Touhou games are well known for having.

That being said, I already had an understanding of what Touhou Project is, and I think a basic understanding of the characters/setting really improves game enjoyment. It definitely isn't required, but maybe watch a youtube video or something before playing this game.\n\n[h1]Am I going to be able to beat this game?[/h1]\n\n[b]Likely.[/b] With the exception of the extra boss, I had little trouble getting all achievements. Most bosses will take a few tries to get used to, but time manipulation makes dodging attacks very simple and rewarding. Additionally, the amount of potential grind is near limitless. If struggling with a boss, you can just brute force yourself and grind a few levels. I beat the game around level 30, and the maximum level is 99. I think that this game can be beat by any decent player with enough time.\n\n[h1]Is the game too short?[/h1]\n\n[b]Depends.[/b] After getting all achievements I would say I got my money's worth. 12 hours isn't a ton of time to put into a game, but I enjoyed every minute of it so I almost am happy with its length. Its short length meant I didn't ever get tired of the gameplay, although I certainly could have gotten worn out had the game gone on too long.\n\nOverall, this game is really a must play for anyone who likes metroidvanias or platformers or action games.

As the time-stopping, knife-chucking battle-maid Sakuya, you jump and run and shoot your way through a greatest hits of some of the most recognizable faces of the Touhou mythos (so basically just Embodiment of Scarlet Devil... Not many deep cuts here). The unique core idea to the game is that you can stop and slow time at will during combat and platforming, which leads to a bunch of nifty puzzles and cool combat moments. The way you heal is also a genius adaptation of a mechanic from the source material, in that you regain health by [i] almost [/i] getting hit by enemy attacks.\nIt's all a lot of fun and keeps every area, enemy and boss feeling very fresh.\nThe story is fine, though it really assumes some basic familiarity with the setting. It's a pity, since the gameplay is more accessible than the original shmups. Don't let a lack of knowledge put you off if you don't know anything about Touhou, since the game is still fun on it's own, but newcomers to the world will defo be confused...\n\nThe biggest criticism you'll see of this game is that it's too short, which is only the case if you're really good at 2D platformers, or if you go in expecting a massive 30 hour Metroidvania. I took about 9 hours to beat it and I feel like I got my money's worth. If you're a dab hand at this type of game, you might feel a bit cheated though...\nMuch of the playtime was due to the challenge, especially some of the later bosses. It's not an easy game at all, though it's not any kind of ballbusting Kaizoid hell-game either.\nMy biggest complaint is that the game isn't very good as a metroidvania. Backtracking through the tough later levels to find a breakable wall you missed is no fun, even if those levels were enjoyable the first way round. It's more of a linear arcade platformer with light backtracking and missable upgrades.\n\nAll round, this is a great little title.

You feel super swag if you run through rooms without fighting anything in stopped time. The gameplay is SO satisfying, and bosses let you play around with what you have instead of limiting you.\nThe story is pretty straightforward and you don't need to know jack about Touhou before playing it, making it good for people who just want a Metroidvania experience. It has some pretty interesting twists for those who are fans like me, though.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game to everyone, though understandably I don't know if it'll be worth full price to a player who doesn't know a thing about Touhou.

The combat is really fun and the time mechanics are really cool, especially with how they are implemented in boss fights. It's a Touhou game so the music is really good.\n\nThe main issues I have with the game personally are the way the dash mechanic is implemented and some enemy placements. There are several rooms in the game where trying to rush through will cause you to get hit by an enemy and get launched back into the previous room. It's not a major problem in the game but just kind of annoying given that this game feels very much like a speed game. The dash mechanic very much feels like an after thought, and it controls very weird. Can't say much for keyboard controls, I played with an Xbox controller, but double tapping in a given direction felt very clunky when you're constantly moving around the screen in different directions.\n\nOverall, cool game.", "timestamp_created": 1622128663, "timestamp_updated": 1622128663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92668258": {"recommendationid": "92668258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038488459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1622112423}, "language": "english", "review": "This game kinda bangs. \n\nMy familiarity with the Touhou franchise is basically Night of nights and Cirno and even with just that I had a helluva a good time playing this game. The gameplay is tight and responsive and the grazing system combined with basic attacks taking mana introduces a super fun risk reward style of gameplay which sets it apart from other games in the genre. Sprite art is absolutely gorgeous even when blown up on a big screen and conveys all the needed information without cluttering the screen. Music is only bops and features my favourite trope of the characters/main theme playing in the final battle. The bosses are all fantastic and incredibly enjoyable to fight and that perfect level of challenging but not too difficult to become frustrating.\n\nThe cons though are the game is incredibly short which by the price tag and seemingly very small team isn't that much of a surprise however its still kind of a bummer. The level design leaves something to be desired making the game overall feel more like an action platformer than a proper metroidvania. Enemy hit boxes can be a little ambiguous which makes it difficult to properly gauge where you can safely graze (thankfully not a problem in bosses) and the game itself doesn't really play around enough with the time stop and slow down mechanics, only really exploring it at the end game. \n\nThe story I'm not really qualified to talk about too much as again I know Cirno and night of nights and that's my touhou knowledge but from an outsider perspective it's mediocre at best and seems to just exist to push bosses at you and progress the game but that's fine. \n\nOverall games great can recommend; one of the better modern metroidvanias.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1622114196, "timestamp_updated": 1622114196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51776653528213501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92665153": {"recommendationid": "92665153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025490757", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1622183808}, "language": "english", "review": "Great metroidvania.

Touhou Luna Nights is an incredibly fun and energetic metroidvania. The combat system is so fast and frenzied, but also requires precision and control to ensure you don't run out of MP (the energy that allows you to attack).  Luckily you can absorb this by \"grazing\" nearby enemies.  Combined with being able to temporarily slow and stop time, I loved every moment of action in this game.\n\nThe atmosphere was also pleasant, with colorful scenery and a soundtrack to get you pumped up for battle.  I'm not at all familiar with the backstory as this was my first foray into the Touhou world, but I enjoyed the storyline nonetheless.  Ultimately everything had a lighthearted feel.\n\nBe aware that this game does NOT shy away from difficult bosses, especially toward the end of the game.  There is no difficulty setting, nor a way of fumbling your way through the last few battles. The bosses have very definite patterns, and you will have to 100% learn those patterns to defeat them. However, Touhou Luna Nights does it perfectly - the first fight, you feel there's no hope of ever defeating them. The next few fights you start to see the ways of getting around each attack. And after a few more fights, you can replay the battle as much as you want and never get hit.  \n\nI can only think of a couple things that I wish the game did differently.  One, though I would definitely classify this as a metroidvania (there are at least 4-5 different environmental obstacle types that require powerups to pass), I wish there were more.  But, I think that relates more to the second issue - the game is too short! But I think that's a testament to how good it is.  It's so much fun to play, you're sad when it's all over and wish there was another 10 hours of game play.\n\nThough short, Touhou Luna Nights is totally worth the money though, especially if you love fast paced metroidvanias.

(If you aren't, tbere's enough exposition you should at least understand what you're doing and why at all points, although some details - like just why it's raining and just what the significance of that is - might remain elusive.) It could plausibly have been a side-story at some point in canon Gensokyo history. And if there isn't an actual tea party displayed in an ending, there's at least the presumption that tea - and company to go with it - shall be forthcoming.\n\nThe audiovisuals: The music's mostly well-made versions of character and location leitmotifs Touhou players will immediately recognize. Obviously good, though if you're not the speedrunning type some of the higher-energy pieces might feel a bit tiring after a quarter-hour on the same song. The art is good: the animation does a good job of characterizing everybody, and there's notably a good use of particle-type physics to handle water (which matters here) and knives, among other things.\n\nThe game balance: Not too easy, never too vicious. Like other attempts to convert things from top-down free flight into a platformer, everybody's ridiculous offensive abilities are toned down enough to make the game playable, and when necessary bosses are \"extended onto\" to better telegraph their attacks. You have health instead of lives, scarce yet sufficient checkpoints and healing stations, and two stat systems which are balanced so that you can get through the game smoothly without ever actually having to think about grinding, but grindable to make up for minor deficiencies in player finesse. (The game, even in in-universe terms, is designed to be \"winnable\".) There are a few weirdnesses in the layout of the game resources and balances, but they're minor and have explanations in the setting, if not obvious ones.\n\nYou're playing as Sakuya Izayoi, and for Touhou fans that's going to be a major attraction of the game. [u]It fulfills this premise.[/u] While you won't have everything available from the start, you start out with some of your knife collection and able to fight, glide if not fly, and indefinitely survive underwater. You can manually recover thrown knives (for a refund of some of the mana you spent to throw them) or not; Sakuya's ability to almost reflexively recollect them out of spacetime as needed is preserved. The game implements a version of the main series' grazing mechanic: finesse at avoiding most attacks means you'll steal power out of them, and most enemies and many boss attacks let you recover health as well if you're good enough.While the spell cards (sub-attacks) you'll acquire during the game are also greatly toned down from their original out-of-game versions, they're all fun to use and none are outright necessary (scored boss rush after completing the game excepted, and that only for the achievements). I especially enjoyed playing with the two not-quite-knives added into this game, one of which is a \"why hasn't Sakuya been using this thing all along?\" and one of which makes perfect sense to be there given the setting, plot and characters involved but again is something you might not have seen coming.\n\nAnd yes, you'll regain Sakuya's power to mess with time. And yes, while you're in a place which can still find ways to challenge you (after all, the cast knows what you can do), this is just as abusable as anybody could hope for. It's not quite balanced, but this is also part of the fun. The game does a good job of making diverse ways your power interacts with the environment without making the power itself fiddly to use. It makes traversing the game world interesting without usually ever reaching the frustrating stage. (And if your dreams of playing as Sakuya included throwing a knife, stopping time and using the airborne knife as a platform, yes. So much yes.)\n\nIn terms of combat, well, yes. You can do every brutal and unfair trick you'd expect. That said, you don't have to (again, getting achivements off the post-game boss rush is an exception). There are creatures who are a nuisance to fight \"fairly\", and there are boss attacks which will be very hard to cleanly avoid without at least slowing time down at points or having movement abilities that shouldn't be unlocked on your first meeting (and this game doesn't really do anything to encourage sequence breaking). But if you prefer to elegantly and perfectly duel as a maid, you're covered.\n\nAll in all, this is everything I could have hoped for given the premise of the game. I don't think it's perfect (some of the music tracks could have benefited from longer arrangements, a few tiny details like can physics aren't quite perfected for playing with and now that I know the full story, a couple elements in the timeline don't quite mesh without any of the usual explanations for why really working), but it's certainly worth its original purchase price and probably sets a standard for Touhou platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1620339260, "timestamp_updated": 1620339260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492781668901443481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91516200": {"recommendationid": "91516200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055778524", "num_games_owned": 627, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1627851216}, "language": "english", "review": "HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS IS SO RAD.

At no point did I feel like the design wasn't as good and consistent as the rest of the game. But that's not to say this game is without flaws.\n\nDespite being a metroidvania this game is very linear. You have to defeat the bosses in a very set order, and the only real metroidvania quality it has is having to backtrack once you get new abilities to get new items and other unlockables. I felt this game was a massive weak point and let me down a decent bit. \n\nBut, the game more than makes up for where it lacks, because man I've not had this much fun just progressing in a metroidvania as I had with this game. Usually its the destination the matters, the adventure. But this game every enemy is a treat to fight due to its brilliant combat system.\n\nIts greatly built around the MP bar and your time meter, to throw knifes it uses MP unless time is frozen then it takes away from your time remaining until it unfreezes. Your MP regenerates over time very slowly, so if you want it back faster then you have to get close to the enemy and graze their attacks to regen MP. It also recovers HP providing a very daring high risk high reward gameplay style.\n\nThe ability to stop time is very fun to play about with and with the different special attacks presented to you your options for sandbox are absolutely insane. Coupled with the fact that with good knowledge of the map and good platforming you can chain your time to last for insane amounts of time and get very high rewards for having a deep understanding of the game and environment. If you know a section of the map and need to quickly get around there is no need for tedious fighting against enemies you've already fought, freeze time and run right past them. However, the balance to this is if you don't know the layout and don't know where the enemies are you will run out of time very fast and find yourself surrounded with no means of defence, so don't get greedy without knowledge of the situation. \n\nThe boss fights are the strongest part of the game, each fight felt extremely well polished and greatly enjoyable. It incorporates bullet hell elements and showers down projectiles like the mainline games. This especially shines in the final boss-fight and makes for a very challenging and adrenaline filled fight. It has a good balance of well choreographed attacks and having to learn patterns making a fun experience that doesn't keep you fighting till you're no longer having fun. \n\nThe playtime is rather short, upon writing this review I have completed the game bonus level and all and gotten every item. I have also explored the map but for some odd reason the achievement wont unlock. However, for a \u00a314 game its well worth the price as each hour will be as good as the last\n\nIn short, buy this bloody game", "timestamp_created": 1619905396, "timestamp_updated": 1619905396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91241745": {"recommendationid": "91241745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049964784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1681146476}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game!!

I've had my eyes on this for a while and having the pleasure of experiencing it finally was a treat. The short & simple version of this review is - I enjoyed my time with it and found great enjoyment out of it. Should you get it? If you're looking for a new challenging metroidvania platformer themed around Touhou - definitely! Full price or not - this game is worth a play.\n\nTo those who want something more detailed - read on!\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nTouhou Luna Nights' story is definitely leaning on the simpler side of things. It's rather straightforward and for the most part - it's out of your way during gameplay. The basic premise is interesting though, playing as Sakuya in a fake version of the Scarlet Devil Mansion made by Remilia. I appreciate it being there as something to drive the player forward and continue progressing as it gives you a clear and defined goal. The character interactions between areas are pretty entertaining, although this is one area this game falls apart in I feel - it's not very friendly with those who aren't Touhou fans with references & dialogue that will just fly over most players' heads if they aren't already acquainted with Touhou in general.\n\nFor the record it isn't a dealbreaker - you can enjoy the game just fine as is without necessarily being a Touhou fan but I just kinda wish the interactions between major characters were more...obvious to a newbie sometimes. Still, even not accounting for that - it's still entertaining stuff & easy to follow along with pacing most players will find comfortable enough.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nThe meat & potatoes of Touhou Luna Nights is really solid. The way this game plays is really good. There is a lot of stuff to take in and I feel as though the early-game is really tough as you need to properly adjust to all the mechanics. The main gimmick of Touhou Luna Nights is being able to stop time - early on you're given a clock & given the meter at the top of the screen you can freeze & unfreeze time as you please. That's oversimplifying it but the entire game is built around the premise of you having to either freeze or slow down time to get things going and that leads to some exhilarating puzzle-solving sometimes. Another fairly important thing you'll be doing in this game is a thing called Graze - getting close to an enemy either to restore your HP or your MP & Time Gauge. The former is for when time isn't frozen and the latter is for when time is frozen. This is one mechanic I found incredibly finicky to get working consistently unless I freeze time as it's never clear how close you are supposed to be to the enemy. Sometimes they can be social-distancing from you and you still trigger a graze, other times it feels like you have to smash your face into them to trigger it - it's incredibly inconsistent and I never really found it reliable, except during boss battles.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is something else though. I won't say it's the most difficult thing out there - quite far from it, I've certainly played harder games, but Touhou Luna Nights definitely isn't an easy game. It WILL kick your ass, especially during boss battles. I won't spoil the characters if you haven't already spoiled them for yourself, but the boss battles are going to be your true test of skill and they will lean heavily on trial & error gameplay. That's not to say the rest of the game isn't hard though - it is. There's a lot of things in the general level design that will test your ability to utilize time & general acrobatics, although this is one area I feel this game falls apart in a little bit. Sometimes you'll encounter corridors of nothing but holding either left or right and the entire room is just filled with enemies. This is particularly problematic towards the end of the game and it just feels incredibly lazy.\n\nControl-wise I didn't really have that much of an issue playing it although having to readjust to some...interesting default controls was a little bit tough. For context - I used a PS4 controller to play this game, so for me - X was shoot, square was to stop time & circle was to jump. Pretty weird for me to adjust to given how other metroidvanias have it basically the complete opposite of that. It is possible to rebind the controls though so it's not really an issue. The controls are rock-solid despite this - they don't feel slippery or imprecise though knockback on getting hit is incredibly annoying and you'll have to be dealing with it a lot. Aside from that - they're pretty good.\n\n[h1]Graphics, Music & Optimization:[/h1]\nThe game has a very distinct pixel-art style to it and I genuinely can't get enough of it - this game looks great and nails the look flawlessly. Each environment has a satisfying amount of depth to it & the character art is also done really well. Nothing really stands out as being egregious & the animations are also really fluid. It's obvious there's been a lot of love & care put into the game's art and glancing at everything there's going to be one or two details that will stand out.\n\nIn terms of music - the game mostly has rearranges of Touhou themes & they sound great. While I can't exactly say some of the themes \"fit\" certain areas, I'm glad that the music filling in the explorable areas is great. It doesn't disappoint in any sense, especially the character-specific themes during boss battles. Get the soundtrack if you have the spare cash for it, it's a treat to listen to! In terms of sound design there's not a lot I can comment on. It serves its purpose and it's not terribly outstanding.\n\nOptimization-wise this game has no issues. I haven't encountered any during my 8+ hour playthrough, even when it came to 144hz+ compatibility - the game runs absolutely flawlessly with no stutters or framerate dips or any graphical issues to speak of so it gets a solid pass from me.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nI recommend Touhou Luna Nights as a purchase. For $15 you definitely get your money's worth in a fun metroidvania Touhou platformer. With a challenging difficulty curve, great music & amazing pixel art graphics Touhou Luna Nights is a game worth purchasing, despite its shortcomings with level design & finicky mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1619802412, "timestamp_updated": 1619802412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710244894027709961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91162976": {"recommendationid": "91162976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001490367", "num_games_owned": 642, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 919, "last_played": 1619844419}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]Time-Stopping Chief Maid\u2019s Bizarre Adventure[/b][/h1]\nTouhou is a franchise with long history as it keeps introducing and expanding fan community around the world by games, music, or other media. Touhou Luna Nights (TLN) is a one example of fan popularity which I think it\u2019s worth knowing its origin before actual review.\n\n[Quote][h1]So, What\u2019s Touhou?[/h1]\nIn short, Touhou Project is a franchise of 2D vertically-scrolling danmaku (or bullet hell games), originally has created by single person known as \u201cZun\u201d (programming, art, music) since 1995. Touhou story mainly sets in the sanctuary of gods, spirit, fairy, and youkai called \u201cGensokyo\u201d, isolated from real world. Each story is self-contained and involve incident where shiner maiden has to resolve by beating up the culprit. Each incident always ends up peacefully by \u201cSpellcard Rules\u201d as it keeps youkai in control without casualty or destroying balance of Gensokyo.\n\nEven Touhou ownership is retained by Zun, he freely allows and encourage fan product as long as they respectfully follow his guidelines.[/quote]\n\n[h1]Another Day, Another Incident[/h1]\nTLN is a Metroidvania Touhou fangame developed by indie Team Ladybug. Unlike most of Touhou games which player usually plays as Shrine Maiden, player will take full control of \u201cSakuya Izayoi\u201d (an elegant chief maid who serves under vampire sisters named Remilia and Flandre Scarlet of Scarlet Devil Mansion).\n\nThe incident takes place in a parallel Scarlet Devil Mansion where Sakuya\u2019s power is stripped away. Sakura shortly finds out that the space is created by her own mistress for amusement. She has to acquire her power back (ability to manipulate time) and find the way back to real Gensokyo.\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2428156579[/url]\nSimilar to most Touhou games, TLN has self-contained story that involve one particular incident, but doesn\u2019t take anything way too serious. Even non-Touhou fans can still enjoy both story and interesting characters as the game occasionally introduce throughout the game from engineer kappa, Nitori to magician, Marisa. Each character shares a bit personality, ability, and background that respect original vision of creator. Some have fewer screenplays that demands newcomers to know more.\n\n[h1]Maid on the Run[/h1]\nSpeaking of Metroidvania, TLN follows similar gameplay and map design like Super Metroid, but comes with its own gimmick of Touhou setting. You will navigate through platforming in different environments ranged from temple area to gothic mansion complex. The map is much more compact and simple, but full of detail and layout are mostly distinct of each other. The game also marks notification to help player keep track their progression via ESC menu.\n\nI will come across various types of enemy and platforming that will test your combination of skills, reflex, and timing. The exploration also rewards the upgrades like max health, extent ability gauge, and unlocks new moves / skills that you can revisit and reach hidden room.\n\nThe interconnection between areas, Torii gate (fast travel), and overall pacing make in-game traversal feel enjoyable and less tedious.\n\n[h1]TIME, Sakuya? Is it really that TIME again?[/h1]\nSakuya\u2019s signature weapon is her throwing knifes. Every attack consumes Sakuya MP gauge. The combat focuses on ranged weapon while managing MP and avoiding touching damage. Later, you\u2019ll be introduced to Sakuya\u2019s eternal clock (pocket watch). This tool play major role in both combat and platforming puzzle. She can stop \u201cTIME\u201d and resume as long as TIME gauge doesn\u2019t run out. During TIME stop, the gauge slowly depletes depends on amount of action you perform, but it replenishes overtime or gain by \u201cGraze\u201d system.\n\nTIME stop expands the variety of level gimmicks and creativity that will engage players to observe environment and adapt. For example: some objects / traps only react when TIME stops as you need to carefully plan to use skill and get through, stop TIME to burst your knife damage at once or reverse some boss projectiles, and more creativity.\n\nMoreover, you can also hold attack button to enter \u201cSnail Time\u201d which basically slow time for a couple seconds. It\u2019s useful alternate beside main power and solves some tricky puzzles.\n\n[h1]Graze, Graze, Graaaze![/h1]\n\u201cGraze\u201d in Touhou refers to the concept of moving player close to enemy hitbox / projectile to gain bonus score. In TLN, Sakuya will recover gauge based on TIME condition.\n- She recovers HP, MP and TIME while grazing in real time.\n- She slightly recovers MP and TIME while grazing in TIME stop.\nGraze system is high-risk high-reward mechanic that engage offensive playstyle and memorize set of attack sequence. Especially boss fights where they are ruthless and throw everything at you, but fairly telegraphed and definitely the most fun aspect of the game\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2428157812[/url]\nOn the other hand, graze and TIME stop in TLN is one of most generous system in Touhou games. It keeps your survivability as long as you learn where to position Sakuya and prepare for incoming attack. Amount of projectile in TIME stop also greatly affect MP recovery rate, allows you to continue flow of normal / special attack loop.\n\nI personally think the design is balanced and intend to support accessibility of average players while encouraging perfect / challenge play for hardcore Touhou fan. You can even beat most bosses without using TIME and special attack.\n\n[h1]Progression / Extra Contents[/h1]\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2428156509[/url]\nDefeating enemy will grant you experience point and jewels which are used to convert into in-game money in Nitori shop for consumable items and upgrade. Character progression is straightforward where your stats slightly increase on every level and manually saved on phonebooth. The level cap is 99, but there is no point to grind to maximum. Beyond Lv.40-50 with mastering graze, you\u2019re pretty much untouchable maid. \n\nTLN also offers extra stage featuring two secret bosses and boss rush mode which unlock after you complete main story and extra mode respectively. It could take around 7-10 hours for 100% completion depended on your pacing.\n\n[h1]Audio / Soundtrack[/h1]\nAudio and sound effects are pretty solid as it gives strong arcade vibe. Touhou music is originally combination of various music genres by ZUN. It\u2019s hard to describe because Touhou music is very broad, full of modern electronics to traditional magical folk with emotional shift in tone and melody.\n\nTLN uses remix version boss themes from main Touhou games. More upbeat and tone shifting while preserve original tracks respectfully. It overall creates music variation that not just represents character background, but also surprisely sense of enjoyment, excitement, and refreshing.\n\n[h1]Graphics / Performance / Flaws[/h1]\nTLN is powered by Mogura Engine 2 which is in-house Engine developed in GameMaker Studio 2. It features beautiful details and fluid pixel art along with colorful visual assets. It has very low PC requirement and stable performance without any crashes or game-breaking bugs.\n\nMy only complaint is startup option only recognizes default key even they are changed in main settings. Startup / graphical option also should be pair in main menu. \n\n[h1]Closing[/h1]\nTLN somehow reminds me of another Touhouvania - Koumajou Densetsu (2009), but more dynamic and friendly system. \n\nTLN is a memorable fun experience and love letter to Metroidvania crafted by people who adore Touhou universe and heartily want to share similar experience to newcomers in different form of gameplay. It also reminds me how large and dedication of Touhou community around the world influenced by one man work.

Even then, Touhou Luna Nights is absolutely worth your money and your time.\n\nThis is the first Touhou game I've ever played, so I have little knowledge of the characters or the world outside of the occasional doujinshi. The story isn't anything to write home about; it's standard fantasy fare without any heavy topics or deep life lessons. Barring that, everything else was simply fantastic.\n\nThe art from the character designs to the environments was genuinely great. The enemies were diverse and interesting to fight with almost no copy-paste content. The bosses were all phenomenal and the time slow and stop abilities, coupled with the \"graze\" mechanic ties the combat all together. While we're at it, let's put in some banger renditions of the coveted Touhou soundtrack to complete the package.\n\nThere are a few nitpicks I have though. There are some parts of the movement that I'm not an absolute fan of, such as pressing crouch and jump causing the slide attack instead of simply doing crouch and attack. Graze can also be a bit too rewarding, especially when coupled with some especially strong abilities, namely Thousand Dagger, but you can find that out on your own time. As mentioned before, the story isn't anything special and the game's length is pretty short. That being said, none of these problems greatly take away from the game at all.\n\nLuna Nights is a small, yet radiant nugget of gold among the many competitors of the indie game market. As someone who is comparatively impartial to the Touhou series, this game's quality is astonishing to say the least, and deserves every ounce of praise that it has received.

Getting S rank in boss rush mode will likely take you a little while longer, but by that point you'll probably have figure'd out the easiest way to deal with bosses is by using 1000 of your daggers thrown at them faster than Sakuya's enemy can blink.

As her maid Sakuya, you get sucked into the world and your objective is to brutally murder as many Touhous as you can. There's not a ton of plot to delve into. The pixel art is gorgeous and animates smoothly, and the detailed backgrounds add a lot of character to the game. The soundtrack has the familiar frenetic Touhou sound, with hints of Michiru Yamane's grandiose Castlevania work. It's personally not my favorite, but it never got on my nerves either. \n\nYou attack in Luna Nights by throwing knives, which expends MP. As such your attacks are limited, but this is where it gets interesting. Much like grazing bullets in shmups, Luna Nights' first core mechanic allows you to graze enemies/projectiles to earn more MP/HP. I was hesitant at first - it reminded me of Secret of Mana's dogshit combat where you have to attack then turtle to refill your attack gauge. Now that I'm writing, I realize Luna Nights is kind of the inverse of that idea. Either way, it works out brilliantly. Combat becomes a balance of risk-reward in an idea similar to Bloodborne, where attacking immediately after you lose HP gives you a chance to earn it back. Playing aggressively is essential. Luna Nights' second core mechanic is freezing time. When time is frozen you can still attack, but your knives suspend in air until time continues. Instead of spending MP your attacks lower the time gauge, but you can earn this back either naturally or by grazing while time is frozen. You also have a limit to how many knives you can throw so you can't just murder bosses within seconds (thought it's pretty effective on common enemies). Attributes like HP, MP, and the amount of knives you can throw during frozen time can either be bought or found by exploring the map and breaking fake walls. You can also find special secondary skills that function like Castlevania subweapons, but they take up MP instead of having a separate meter. At first I stuck to the homing knives, but I became partial to the chainsaw arc-projectile near the end. You can switch between them on the fly which allows you to experiment a little.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, they're top-notch. There are only six overall (with a bonus seventh and eighth) but I enjoyed them all immensely. They take a few minutes to beat and at first I thought they dragged on a bit too long for my tastes, but it ended up adding to the tension. Each boss has a cycle of 3-4 unique attacks on top of a stronger attack they get when you whittle their HP down enough. The patterns are fairly simple but keeping calm and dodging consistently is the real trick. Fighting regular enemies is also fun, but not nearly as great as the boss battles. I think Team Ladybug realized this as instead of brainless corridors full of enemies they add a lot of clever platforming segments that require freezing time. As the game progresses you encounter hazards/platforms that react differently to frozen time - moving in reverse, moving regardless of time, and only moving when time is stopped. You also unlock new abilities that add to the platforming - some genre staples like double-jumping and sliding, but also really cool moves like using your knives as platforms while time is stopped. None of the platforming is too tricky but it goes a long way to adding variety to the game. The game itself is roughly 5-6 hours depending on how good you are. I understand it's better to end on a high note instead of overstaying your welcome (and the final boss battle is a very high note) but I still found myself wanting more. I think the game had enough momentum to support an extra hour or two of gameplay to tidily wrap things up; however I did enjoy every single minute of what I played.\n\nLuna Nights is absolutely worth the hype, and it's a steal at $18. I definitely have Team Ladybug on my radar now. Their next game is based on Record of Lodoss War and looks functionally similar to Luna Nights with more of an RPG emphasis. It's still in Early Access so I'll wait on it to get the full experience.

I say \"nearly perfect\" because there are a small number of tiny little nitpick issues that are more personal gripes than actual problems, and when I say small I mean I can count them on one hand. They're so insubstantial I won't bother going over them.\n\nIf you are a fan of the metroid/castlevania style games, you want this game. If you really like the Touhou universe, especially the characters, scenery, and music from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, you want this game. The unique mechanics they included are brilliant and just really fun to use. The fact that even your basic attacks are tied to MP means you have to think and plan your attacks instead of just mashing wildly. The mechanics of slowing down/stopping time and how the world and attacks interact with that power make for some really interesting moments. Better yet, bosses can actually be defeated without using any of the time manipulation powers, though it is significantly harder.\n\nThe grazing mechanic brought over from official Touhou games is genius as well. Getting extremely close to either an enemy or bullet without getting hit will cause a \"graze\" and allow you to actually regenerate HP and MP. This mechanic is necessary as otherwise there is no good way to heal on the go, and just waiting for your MP to regen passively can take quite some time. Using the slow time ability can help get more grazes in a pinch, but stopping time changes how it works. While time is stopped, attacks and enemies can only be grazed a limited number of times. Grazing a frozen object is easy, so it only regenerates MP and a bit of your TIME gauge which is spent by doing any actions while time is stopped. A lot of mid/late game bosses can actually be quite challenging if you don't rely on the graze mechanic.\n\nThere is a shop to buy items from, but as the game explains you don't just earn the gold needed to buy them from defeating enemies. Instead enemies drop gemstones which you can then sell for gold to buy items. However, the gemstones have a secondary use, granting you very small boosts depending on the type of gemstone. So at times you have to make a choice on if you want to maintain all of your beneficial effects or buy one of the upgrades from the store.\n\nThere are a variety of passive abilities and even active \"spell cards\" that you can find around the world. Movement is smooth and tight, a majority of the enemies are unique, the bosses are amazing and even follow a mostly standard Touhou style progression.\n\nI enjoyed this game so much I've played through the entire thing about 3 times and its one on a short list of games I've completed 100%.

Innova bastante en el genero de los metroidvanias, bebe mucho de la saga principal de los Touhou y el genero de los bullet hell lo cual resulta en una serie de mecanicas muy interesantes y bien implementadas. Habiendo conseguido todos los logros del juego puedo decir que lo he disfrutado en cada momento y seguramente lo seguire jugando para exprimir aun mas la diversion que ofrece el titulo.\n\n[h1][b]Rese\u00f1a Larga[/b][/h1]\n\n[hr] [/hr]\n\n[b]Puntos [strike]negativos[/strike]:[/b]\nTouhou Luna Nights es un t\u00edtulo que muchas veces se cataloga como un metroidvania lo cual, si bien es cierto, puede generar idea equivocada del juego que veo necesaria aclarar. La obra es totalmente lineal, la exploracion se relega a ser una manera de volver por items que nos han quedado en zonas ocultas y no en una manera de conseguir que el jugador decida, en cierta medida, cual sera la secuencia del juego como suele ser usual en los exponentes de este genero. Esto no es un problema en lo mas minimo pero es necesario advertir a quienes esten esperando un juego que les de cierta libertad para decidir sobre el orden de los sucesos. \nTiene una duracion muy reducida, aproximadamente 5 - 8 horas de juego, lo cual puede ser un problema para muchos.\nLa historia es meramente un complemento y pasa totalmente a un segundo plano, si estas buscando un juego con una narrativa extensa y desarrollada Luna Nights no es lo que buscas.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Puntos positivos:[/b]\nLa jugabilidad es excelente, supieron implementar perfectamente las mecanicas del manejo del tiempo no solo en las peleas sino tambien a la hora de interactuar con el entorno y los propios ataques de Sakuya. Su punto m\u00e1s debil es que la mecanica inicial de ralentizar el tiempo se queda obsoleta muy rapidamente, putualmente en el momento que obtenemos el reloj para detener el tiempo, y queda relegada a servir como un medio para resolver uno o dos puzzles m\u00e1s adelante.\nLa mecanica del Graze incentiva al jugador a ser mas agresivo es sus acciones y a exponerse ataques enemigos si quiere ganar HP/MP, caso contrario se vera en una situacion donde no pueda atacar y se vera sobrepasado por los continuos ataques enemigos.\nLos jefes, probablemente lo mas importante debido al estilo de juego que nos propone esta entrega, estan muy bien logrados. Cada uno se siente muy unico y tienen una dificultad bien escalonada. Las batallas son muy entretenidas y son lo suficientemente dificiles en general aunque personalmente hubiera deseado una pelea mas de una dificultad mucho mayor ya que siento que falta ese jefe de una dificultad MUY elevada.\nLa banda sonora el juego es de una calidad espectacular, muchas de las canciones salen casi directamente de titulos de la saga, como Imperishable Night, por lo que si conocen los OST de la misma sabran de la calidad que estamos hablando.\nEl apartado visual es simple pero hermoso, los escenarios y los personajes poseen un estilo de arte pixelart muy interesante y llamativa. No hace falta decir que estan basados en una tematica netamente oriental. Los efectos tambien estan bien logrados, la lluvia, el movimiento de los estanques de agua, etc.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nEn sintesis, Luna Nigths es una entrega muy recomendable que tiene muchos m\u00e1s aciertos que errores. Ademas tiene un precio muy accesible, nada mejor que un juego muy bueno y barato.

Seeing that it was a Metroidvania, and knowing what Team Ladybug is capable of when it comes to Metroidvanias, I bought it immediately.  I'm glad I did.  There's a lot in common between this and Wonder Labyrinth.  Both games ooze quality. Both games are beautiful with tight controls and nice, smooth animations at 60 fps.  The time stop mechanic makes for some interesting action puzzle solving amidst the more straightforward action metroidvania-ing.  You also have to pretty carefully manage your MP, because each attack consumes MP, and once you're out that's it.  You can no longer attack.  Thankfully you can restore your MP via vending machines and a \"graze\" mechanic that reminds me of certain bullet-hell shooters that give you bonuses for getting close to enemies and projectiles.\n\nI 100% recommend Touhou Luna Nights for any fans of Metroidvanias or quality video games in general.

The plot of the game is relatively simple. As in a nutshell, a mistress who can manipulate time has to fight enemies and escape some sort of \"game\". Along with the simple story, the art style is entirely pixels. Which makes the game appear more vibrant (personally) as it has a nice touch to the overall game play. Speaking of the game play, it is pretty darn good. I suggest that those who enjoys playing metroidvania, should play this game without a doubt. There are different abilities which have their own uniqueness that you can collect throughout the game, which gives the player a more enjoyable experience. But there is only one thing that I do not like about this game, and that it is short. Depending on the player, most could quickly finish the game within 3 sessions.

Adem\u00e1s, \u00bfno es genial detener el tiempo y llenar de cuchillos a nuestro enemigo?\n\n[h1] \u00bfC\u00f3mo se juega? [/h1]\n\nEn general, se utiliza la mec\u00e1nica de detener el tiempo y ralentizar el tiempo para resolver puzzles que parecen imposibles, pasar zonas llenas de trampas y derrotar jefes y enemigos, estos \u00faltimos pudiendo ser algo injustos, pero con su m\u00e9rito, ya que bueno, \u00bfmencion\u00e9 que podemos manipular el tiempo?, oblig\u00e1ndonos as\u00ed a sacarle todo el provecho que podamos a nuestros poderes.\nSu desaf\u00edo es bastante moderado, no es f\u00e1cil pero tampoco es muy dif\u00edcil y perder nunca me result\u00f3 frustrante en ning\u00fan momento, es cuesti\u00f3n de ir aprendi\u00e9ndose los enemigos y adaptarse al juego. Estoy seguro de que van a morir un par de veces antes de lograr derrotar a alg\u00fan jefe. Adem\u00e1s de que el juego tiene sus puntos de guardado incre\u00edblemente bien medidos. Es un juego bastante justo en cuanto a dificultad.\nHay que mencionar que el juego premia muy bien a la gente que es curiosa y que explora los niveles, con mejoras de salud, man\u00e1 y nuevos ataques especiales. No es realmente un juego complicado y es bastante lineal, pero no del todo, siempre que queramos podemos volver a anteriores zonas para explorar lugares a los que antes no pod\u00edamos acceder, como todo buen metroidvania. De todos modos, es un juego que sabe mantener incre\u00edblemente bien el ritmo y pocas veces (por no decir nunca) nos vamos a sentir perdidos. \n\n[h1] \u00bfC\u00f3mo se siente? [/h1]\n\nMe gustar\u00eda destacar su hermosa banda sonora, la cual son todas reinterpretaciones de temas de los juegos originales, con nuevos instrumentos y con ciertos efectos que la hacen sonar modernizada, lo cual no le queda nada mal y dir\u00eda que hasta me parecen mejores que las originales. Pero entiendo que haya gente a la que le parezca taladrante.\nIgual le quiero le quiero reconocer m\u00e9ritos a su apartado art\u00edstico, con ese pixelart tan de moda con personajes muy bonitos, bien animados y coloridos al igual que los enemigos y escenarios. Aparte de gozar un muy bonito apartado art\u00edstico no pide nada de requisitos, as\u00ed que tu patata con dos cables lo va a poder mover sin drama. 2x1\n\n[h1] \u00bfQu\u00e9 tal la historia? [/h1]\n\nNo quiero hablar mucho sobre la historia, ya que juega un papel muy importante en la conexi\u00f3n entre ''juego'' e ''historia'', intentando unir estas dos justificando y uniendo cosas que suceden en la historia con la jugabilidad. Me encanta como intenta justificar todo, evitando as\u00ed disonancias entre el juego y su historia. Tambi\u00e9n noto las ventajas que tiene una historia simple y bastante fant\u00e1stica.\n Es cuesti\u00f3n de que lo juegues y lo notes. Es un ejemplo de que no hace falta una historia super compleja ni emotiva en un videojuegos para que funcione y encaje bien con la jugabilidad. (A\u00fan as\u00ed, no le estoy sacando m\u00e9ritos a las obras que s\u00ed se animan a ese tipo de historias) Aunque supongo que lo de la historia va un poco m\u00e1s sobre gustos.\n\n[h1] Conclusi\u00f3n [/h1]\n\nMe parece un juego bastante sobresaliente, y estoy seguro de que no soy al \u00fanico que le parece as\u00ed, tan solo es mirar ese 97% de rese\u00f1as positivas. Es un metroidvania perfecto para las personas que no conocen el g\u00e9nero y les gustar\u00eda probar alg\u00fan juego del estilo, porque como dije, sabe mantener el ritmo incre\u00edblemente bien y es dif\u00edcil sentirse perdido. Algo malo que podr\u00eda decir del juego, supongo que es su duraci\u00f3n, se termina haciendo un poco corto en comparaci\u00f3n otros juegos del mismo g\u00e9nero, pero para m\u00ed no es un problema.

I really did. I love Touhou, and I love platformers, and this game's got tons of good reviews, so I thought I'd have a good time but I really didn't.\nThere are good parts, to be fair. The art is fantastic, and there are tons of nice stylistic choices like how the rain in the first area slows / stops so you can see the individual droplets. Some of the puzzles related to stopping / starting time are really interesting. It controls great for the most part too. The music is okay, but not good enough that I'd listen to it over the original music from EoSD. But that's about all the good I can say about this game.\nThe issues I have with this game fall into two fairly distinct categories: how it is as a game and how it is as a Touhou work.\n\n[u]How it is as a game[/u]\nFor starters, this isn't a metroidvania, regardless of what people say. If anything's preventing your progress, you'll find a key or upgrade that lets you continue in that same area. You don't need to backtrack to earlier areas at any time unless you want collectibles (which for the most part don't make a difference but I'll get to that later). That's probably a good thing, because the warp placement makes no sense at all, mostly placed on the edges of areas instead of being centralized for easy access.\nUp until the third area, the game's fairly mediocre. You control great, but no enemies pose any challenges, so it's pretty boring. From the third area onward, the game seems to be incentivizing you to skip all the enemies by stopping time and running past them, because you can graze enemies to continually refill your time meter and all you get from killing them is money (which doesn't matter, I never went to the shop) or EXP (which as far as I can tell does nothing). This trend continues through the whole game. As rooms become more cramped and enemies become stronger and bulkier, you learn it's far easier to stop time and ignore everything than it is to bother fighting, which will have a much higher chance of you dying. At that point, all the collectibles and cool spells mean nothing. Why bother getting +10 MP or a shiny new spell if you're never going to use it against an enemy?\nOn a side note, Snail Time doesn't need MP or time points to activate, which seems odd considering the massive effect it can make on gameplay.\nThe bosses are even more disappointing, again due to the imbalance of the graze feature. Every boss is depressingly easy, because not only are most of their attacks laughably pathetic (Meiling's \"super\" attack is literally just one of her regular attacks but with a much longer startup, for crying out loud), but they all have one attack that you can abuse to gain tons of graze outside of stopped time, which basically refills half your health for free easily. They all also only have like three to five attacks at the most (even the final boss!), which combined with an HP pool that could bear to be cut in half and your base attack requiring that you use your MP, which recharges at the speed of a snail, means that 70% of bosses are you just dodging their attacks with ease while you wait for your MP to recharge. Collectibles yet again make no difference because the extra HP will just be full all the time, the extra MP will just reduce how fast it takes for you to drain it to zero, and the special moves all take more MP than they're worth as far as I can tell (though apparently Thousand Knives is overpowered to the point of being super unbalanced, but that just changes boss fights from \"boring slog\" to \"spam without thinking\", so that's a totally different problem). The game tries to disincentivise usage of the time stop during boss battles by firing attacks that only move in stopped time, but they don't bother doing it alongside attacks that move normally so the second that you see those attacks you can just stop time, let them fly offscreen, and just continue. The final boss is even more awful, because in addition to everything above, she has two phases and dying on the second phase because you don't know how to deal with the lasers the first time you see them forces you to take two minutes wearing down the first phase again, and aside from the cheap kill when the lasers come out the first time, said final boss is just as pathetic as the other bosses for all the same reasons.\nThe game's also super short, clocking in about 3 hours (probably more if you go collectible hunting, but why would you when they do almost nothing?) for a first playthrough. I can't really justify paying slightly under $20 for an unfun and boring journey that you can knock out in one night.\nAlso the game crashed against the final boss when I tried to graze her second phase in stopped time, so that's neat.\nIn summary, this game incentivizes you to skip all of its levels through timestop and slows to a crawl during bosses with attacks that pose no threat and an awful MP system.\n\n[u]How it is as a Touhou work[/u]\nTouhou games are characterized by fun bosses where you have very little room to move and are always engaged with exciting and difficult new attacks. It's a series where you have to die a lot and persevere to eventually grasp the satisfaction of finally defeating the difficult spellcard you've been stuck on for god knows how long. In stark parallel, bosses in Luna Nights are hilariously easy, incredibly lenient, and honestly boring because you're always running out of MP and have to sit around doing nothing, a notion that's alien to any mainline Touhou game. Whereas the levels in Touhou games are challenges that you have to path out that are ultimately just leading up to the fun bosses, the levels of Luna Nights are obnoxiously difficult, orders of magnitude harder than the bosses, if you play them straight, and are total meaningless filler if you skip them with time stop.\nSo this game completely messes up the design philosophy of the actual Touhou games, but that was probably obvious by how the actual Touhou games are fun and this game isn't.\n\n[u]And now for some Touhou-related nitpicks![/u]\nNone of these are really anything gameplay-related, but they bother me so I'm putting them here.\nI could complain about how all the characters are from EoSD with exceptions that barely matter, but that's just me being irritable with the overrepresentation of one game in Touhou fanworks rather than Luna Nights itself. Even so, it hurts whenever I see another fangame that focuses on the SDM instead of a group that's more developed / could use more development, like the Undergrounders or Eientei or Myouren or literally any non-EoSD game.\nPlus the game kinda makes limited use of / misuses the characters it has. Meiling does literally nothing interesting, but she gets a pass because she's the first boss. Marisa at least has Earthlight Ray, Master Spark, and some slave-type spell, but she's missing her trademark star bullets. Patchouli uses all her elements solo instead of ever combining them. [spoiler]Nitori[/spoiler] uses a weird mech instead of her neato backpack. [spoiler]Flandre[/spoiler] uses massive crystal wings instead of leaning into her huge retinue of interesting spellcards, with the only one making an appearance predictably being Laevateinn. Finally, [spoiler]Reimu[/spoiler] uses the paper end of her weapon instead of the kicks and whacks that she's more known for.\n\nThis is a really good-looking game.

I'm happy to report that no knowledge of Touhou is required to fully enjoy the game.  Quite frankly, I feel like this game has gotten less attention than it deserves probably due to the Touhou branding putting off people unfamiliar with the franchise. Rock solid Metroidvania designed around the fascinating mechanic of being able to slow or outright stop time at will. With great music (It is Touhou lol), beautiful pixel art, super tight controls and fantastic boss battles this is an easy recommendation to anyone who likes the genre. People who've played Rabi-Ribi in particular will feel right at home with the bullet-hell inspired bosses.\n\nGame is on the short side, and honestly easier than I'd have liked (turns out being able to stop time is pretty good) but the price is right for the length and quality.
