It was always a demo version hosted on various websites, as at the time she didn't want to spend money on a full version of the game. I bought the game back on Christmas of last year as a part of a bundle deal that included Insaniquarium as well as a bunch of other early PopCap games. I had never gotten to experience the entirety of what Insaniquarium had to offer. So I decided I was going to do my younger self a massive favour and finally beat the game. \n\nEven after these (to date) 22 years have passed it's still such a classic! The game may have originally came out in 2001, but it still holds up to this day. The game never gets old. I'm happy my curiosity had gotten the better of me that day in late December upon remembering the game's existence.

Originally released in 2004 by PopCap Games, it has gained a loyal following and remains a popular choice for players seeking a light-hearted and entertaining experience.\n\nThe game revolves around managing an aquarium filled with various aquatic creatures. Your primary objective is to feed and care for the fish, ensuring they grow and multiply while fending off alien invaders. As you progress, you can purchase additional fish species, upgrade your tank, and unlock new items to enhance the gameplay.\n\nOne of the standout features of Insaniquarium Deluxe is its charming and vibrant graphics. The visuals are simple but lively, with colorful fish and quirky animations that bring the aquarium to life. The soundtrack and sound effects complement the gameplay perfectly, adding a delightful layer of immersion to the experience.\n\nGameplay in Insaniquarium Deluxe is accessible and easy to grasp, making it suitable for players of all ages and skill levels. The core mechanics involve feeding your fish by dropping pellets into the tank, collecting coins they produce, and using those coins to buy more fish and power-ups. As you progress, you'll face increasingly challenging levels and encounter various obstacles, such as alien attacks and hungry predators, which add an element of excitement and strategy to the game.\n\nInsaniquarium Deluxe offers multiple game modes, including a story mode with different levels to complete and a virtual tank mode where you can customize your aquarium to your heart's content. Additionally, there's a time trial mode that tests your efficiency in managing the tank within a limited time frame.\n\nWhile Insaniquarium Deluxe provides hours of enjoyable gameplay, some players may find it repetitive over extended periods. The core mechanics remain largely the same throughout the game, and once you've mastered the strategies, the challenge may diminish. However, the game's replayability is enhanced by the sheer variety of fish species to collect and the customization options available in the virtual tank mode.\n\nIn conclusion, Insaniquarium Deluxe is a delightful and engaging game that offers a perfect balance between casual fun and strategic thinking. With its charming visuals, catchy soundtrack, and addictive gameplay, it's easy to get hooked on the world of Insaniquarium.

I recently found out about it again from a youtube channel, and so I got it on steam to try it out once more. \n\nBack then, I didn\u2019t fully grasp how the game worked and I found it to be too hard so I stopped playing it. But now, that I\u2019m much older, I expected to beat it but I didn\u2019t. \n\nThe game really punishes the player in a lot of ways, and levels close to the end after around 4-4 started to take upwards of 16-24 minutes to beat. I didn\u2019t want to put myself through much more torture so I stopped playing. I won\u2019t be playing this game ever again.\n\n\nThe Good\nThe artstyle is very good. It\u2019s unique and cartoony.\nThe music is alright.\nThe unique characters that you unlock were cool and weird in some cases. I liked that.\n\nThere\u2019s some kind of pet simulator mode where you can take care of fishes. You can buy special fish that may appear each day? You can also use it as a screensaver, I think.\n\n\nThe Bad\nThe gameplay is good but you had to click so much. My right hand started to hurt from all the clicking, and I had to take a small break. I truly feel that no one should be playing this game to click so much. I really think that you could damage your hands by playing this game. At some point during my time playing the game, I started using an auto-clicker program. But what\u2019s interesting, is that even when using auto-clicker, my hand had some phantom-limb thing going on. Like just the thought of playing this game made my hand feel uncomfortable, even though I wasn\u2019t clicking anymore. My right forearm still feels a little hurt as I type this.\n\nThe game crashes by alt tabbing out of the game.\n\nThe game crashes by pressing the windows key.\n\nThey limit the pets that you can use to 3. So many pets aren\u2019t good. Like the ones that feeds your pet or the fish making one, they take so long to do it that it\u2019s really pointless to use them when you can make those with just a click.\n\nLevels take too long and the points needed to beat a level keep getting higher and higher. Like, yes, as a game you should have that, but the devs were cruel and evil in doing what they did. Basically, for each level you have to get the required amount of points three times. So say you\u2019d have to get 10k, then you\u2019d have to get it 3 times. With the bosses that come in, and who can easily kill your best characters, it makes the game unforgiving. Because those expensive fish, don\u2019t run away from the bosses. They just do their own thing and get killed. I think the devs are dumb to have made levels take so long to complete. It makes me wonder if they even played their own game. And I honestly doubt that they beat their own game. It\u2019s so stupid.\n\nThe octopus boss sucked.\n\nThe star potion I hard to use. Even though I drop it into the tank from above, most of the time no one eats it and then it explodes on the ground. It\u2019s just a waste of money to use, but you are forced to use it for some levels. \n\n\nConclusion\nI don\u2019t think I have anything more to say about this game. I\u2019m just so done with this game and I want nothing more to do with it.\n\nWhat sucks, is that, the game has some really great ideas and could have been a very good game but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a hard game that is cruel and torture to play. There\u2019s just no way that a sane person could beat this game without seriously hurting their hand by giving it carpal tunnel or using auto-click.

Delightful Aquatic Fun - Insaniquarium Deluxe Review\n\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nInsaniquarium Deluxe, a charming and addictive aquarium management game, delivers a delightful and whimsical experience that will keep you hooked for hours. With its simple yet addictive gameplay, colorful visuals, and quirky characters, it offers a refreshing break from traditional gaming genres.\n\nThe core gameplay of Insaniquarium Deluxe revolves around nurturing and caring for your own virtual aquarium. Players start with a single tank and a few basic fish, and their objective is to feed and grow the fish while fending off various challenges, including hungry aliens and pesky predators. The mechanics are easy to grasp, allowing players of all ages to jump in and start having fun.\n\nOne of the game's strengths lies in its variety of fish species and pets. From vibrant guppies to exotic and whimsical creatures, each fish has its own unique characteristics and behaviors.

These upgrades not only improve the aesthetics but also provide practical advantages in managing and protecting your fish from various threats.\n\nWhile Insaniquarium Deluxe is a joy to play, it does have a few minor drawbacks. The game's longevity can feel somewhat limited, as the core gameplay loop can become repetitive over time. Some players may also find the difficulty curve to be slightly uneven, with certain levels or challenges posing more frustration than enjoyment.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of additional content or updates may disappoint those seeking long-term replayability. However, considering its accessible gameplay and lighthearted nature, Insaniquarium Deluxe remains an excellent choice for casual gamers or anyone looking for a relaxing and entertaining experience.\n\nIn summary, Insaniquarium Deluxe provides a delightful and addictive aquarium management experience.

I remember how I stumbled upon their games in 2005. I was in elementary school, looking for free games to play on the school computers. This was before schools started to buy invasive software to block websites and spy on students. Not only did my entire class fall in love with the game, but my teacher did as well. We would all talk about it, put up fish decorations, and write reports on the game.\n\n[h1]The UI & Theme[/h1]\nEven though this was the first PopCap game I played, it's always refreshing to see the familiar PopCap starting screen. Insaniquarium has the usual selection of adventure mode, time trial, high scores, but comes with something special. You're given a virtual tank that allows you to buy fish for a screensaver. I've tried for many years to make it work on Linux, but I can't seem to make it work consistently. I have so many fond memories of the virtual tank, and seeing how much money I could get with the screensaver up.\n\n[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]\nStarting the adventure mode, the game does a fantastic job introducing you to the mechanics. You start out with a single fish, and feeding it allows it to grow. As it grows, it drops shells, which act as your currency. You can use those shells to buy more fish, upgrades, and the three egg pieces you need to complete the level. The upgrades can be anything from being able to drop more food at once, upgrading the quality of the food, and increasing the damage of your ray gun. The ray gun allows you to defeat the aliens who come throughout the level to eat your fish. Shooting them in the head does double damage, and depending on where you shoot them, they move throughout the tank. Losing all your fish means you failed, and need to restart the level.\n\n[h1]The Loop[/h1]\nAfter you buy all three egg pieces, you're given a companion to help you in the next level. You can only have three, and eventually four, and they all do something different. My strategy was to buy the fish that give you money at the start to rush the tank-specific fish. Each tank has a special fish that gives you the bulk of your money. I felt the best way to win was to use the money making companions to get them out as fast as possible, as they gave more shells than the starter guppies. After beating each of the four tanks, you're allowed to play a bonus mini-game gives you shells for your virtual tank. Essentially, shells drop from the top of the tank, and they all have different values. Clicking the same shell up to ten times doubled the value each time.\n\nAfter beating all stages, you have to beat the final boss. Instead of fending off aliens from your guppies and fish, you have to defend all the companions you've gotten throughout your playthrough. I've tried for many years to save them all, but I don't think it's possible. Either way, once you beat the game, you unlock bonus mode. Bonus mode allows you to rack up shells for your virtual tank by playing through the game again, but giving a special stage after every level.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nInsaniquarium will always have a special place in my heart. I wish we saw more of the game, but after what EA did to PopCap and Plants vs. Zombies, I'm happy for the game to remain as is. This game is easy to understand and fun to play. I'll always come back and beat this game every couple years or so, and I encourage you to do the same, at least once.\n\n[h1]Completion Record[/h1]\nAbsolutely. It's short, it's sweet, and the completion goal is very obvious. Completing the game feels like what you're supposed to do. I found that beating it alone left me unsatisfied, and it has so much more to offer. Add this to your backlog, and complete it.", "timestamp_created": 1678499309, "timestamp_updated": 1678499526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

Pets are essentially your \"helpers\" in this game. Each one has a special skill or utility that can help you in levels. Some of these are Stinky, a snail that can grab gold dropped by fish for you. Prego, a pregnant fish that spawns Guppies (cheapest and most basic fish you can buy and a staple of this game) constantly without requiring you to buy them. Zorf, a seahorse that shoots out level 2 food pellets for your fish whenever they are hungry (these 3 being my favorite Pets).\n\nThroughout this game and as you advance through its \"worlds\" (different aquariums with different backgrounds), you'll have to play with different mechanics, such as alternate Alien fish with different abilities, mechanics that can change such as giving your fish potions to give you more valuable drops or having to feed fish Guppies or other fish to get even more valuable drops and etc. While the variety is good, it can get repetitive very quickly, even more so considering the money you need to get to go to the next level increases steadily for each level, so for later levels it can really feel like a grindfest.\n\nAlso tied to repetition, this game has a lot of clicking involved in it. You click to drop food pellets, you click to get gold, you click to buy upgrades and egg pieces, you click to shoot aliens, etc. You click a lot, a [b]LOT[/b] in this game. My hands were constantly tired of clicking on later levels, which often led me to using Pets to help on that problem. That being said, I haven't spent more than 30 minutes on a level so even though they are quite click-intensive they don't last for long, so you can take a breather between each one of them.\n\nThis game has other game modes such as Time Trial, where you try to collect as much money as you can before time runs out, Challenge mode where you deal with constantly growing inflation and more and more powerful Aliens and Virtual Tank, where you use shells, a currency that is obtained by playing to buy and take care of your fish as if they were real fish. You can also take screenshots of them and even use it as a wallpaper, which is interesting but I'll be honest. I'd rather use shells for obtaining the pricey extra pets.\n\nInsaniquarium is a very charming charming game made by Flying Bear Entertainment and published by PopCap Games. I'll be honest, I have a soft spot for this game. I remember playing it over 10 years ago and having a lot of fun. I find it extremely charming and quite lively, even though it can be quite... \"insane\", and I guess that's part of the appeal, in the end.

Deluxe is a story driven action packed hectic survival oriented resource management game, where you click to drop food that feeds a fish. This game then opens to another realm of complexity once the fish that you fed drops a coin that you can use to buy even more food. The game trickles these complex, thought heavy mechanics across the games long playtime, so you never feel overwhelmed over not knowing the many ways to progress. However, you will still have an incredibly hectic and difficult time as alien raids will attempt to destroy your sustained ecosystem of crazy fish. These aliens can be tackled with a ray gun, which your feeding ability gets replaced by once an enemy is detected. This ray gun can be upgraded using the game currency, coins, and for a hefty sum you could purchase the ability of auto-fire and increased damage. This game doesn't only excel at combat, but you fell under pressure even when no enemy is visible. This is because every critter and fish are ticking clocks that upon running out of time, die. The game ends if you run out of fish, as you no longer have any source of money to buy more fish. The way to keep their internal clocks from running out, killing all under your watch, is to buy food as stated before. This is not the only function of money, as you can then buy a seconds fish which increases your income greatly. But this increased production comes at a risk, the more fish you buy, the harder it is to feed them, and the more you have to urgently click their dropped coins before they disappear to try and not lose out on margins of income. Once you obtain enough money however, you can buy upgrades to your food, making them higher quality and giving the ability to spawn multiple. The way to break the cycle of feeding, fighting, and buying, is to buy all 3 egg pieces, which promptly ends the game. Only a fool would think that this is the end of the experience, as the egg hatches into a helper minion selectable before each mission. You then go on defeating more threats and micromanaging your finite resources until you obtain a 4th helper. This is when the game drops a hard choice on you. You can only take 3 per mission, which means that you will have to leave some of your agents enclosed while you do the challenge. This poses a moral challenge as you have to decide to either use new people every time so they don't left out and spice the gaming experience, or you stick to a hardened strategy and leave all the others to rot, never giving them their chance to shine but you end up getting through the levels faster and succeeding easier. Moral challenges like this are littered throughout the entire game, causing you to reflect on how you treat people in the real world and vice-versa. This can draw an insightful lesson of being friends with people, not because they are helpful or that you can exploit them, but hang around with people that genuinely need it. The game then switches over to a more complex feeding system, as they introduce carnivores that drop diamonds instead of coins, and this extra financial boost is required to obtain the ever increasing price of the egg pieces. During this time, even more absurd and complex enemies spawn, such as enemies that you kill by inflating with your fish food, enemies that go into states of regaining health on shot instead of decreasing, and even enemies that fire homing rockets towards your fish that need to be deflected with advanced aerial defense mechanisms, or with your laser. The feeding and collected mechanic gets even more complex as it introduces hierarchies of fish that give birth to other fish that get eaten to feed other fish that get eaten to feed other fish that produce treasure chests. The concept of expensive fish that produce a lot provides another hard choice, to either buy it the second you have the money for faster times, or wait until you can buy it and have some money left over. The problem with the former is that if you make an investment in your high quality ultravores and an alien raid arrives, killing your beloved fish, then you will have to repeat the slow earning process, or even need to restart if it causes a game over. But if you do the latter, you might end up spending a long time just waiting until you have enough money, just thinking about how much money you could get with the ultravore if you were to buy him. All of these complex mechanics and more are wrapped up in the incredible ending, where you defeat the mastermind alien behind all of the crazy attacks. The battle takes place with all of the special units collect among the levels, and you have to protect them as he slowly eats all of your favorite characters as they wait defenseless, waiting for you to step in as a mist of blood replaces where they once lived, where they once laughed, where they once loved. Upon defeating this evil guy you are greeted with a tear-jerking credits screen including some of your favorite characters, such as: Green fish. Red fish. Blue fish. Yellow fish. Purple fish. Crab. Orange fish.\nTo sum it up, Insaniquarium! Deluxe is a masterpiece of an experience, a true concept that was way ahead of its time. This game does what most games can't and makes you question the hypothetical world around you.\nOverall, 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1673739067, "timestamp_updated": 1673739067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656827449798583984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130791292": {"recommendationid": "130791292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067479124", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1689116059}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the best game ever made, and there will never be anything like it again.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my husband had died.

Zombies, debuted\n\nCONS:\nVirtual Tank is more long-term than you'd expect due to restocking at midnight and how the store slot for fish with special attributes is on a twenty-day cycle\nCould damage your mouse due to all the clicking you have to do (unless you get an auto-clicker, but even then, aliens have invincibility frames each time you hit them).\n\nIf you want to revisit your childhood (or play this game for the first time), go for it.", "timestamp_created": 1668099703, "timestamp_updated": 1668099703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550561785697937012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125210548": {"recommendationid": "125210548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201431209", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1683943323}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game if you can handle the intense joint pain that comes with playing it", "timestamp_created": 1668015179, "timestamp_updated": 1668015179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566787004470825195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125002476": {"recommendationid": "125002476", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037583129", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1453, "last_played": 1676507257}, "language": "english", "review": "Last time I played this, it was on the family PC.

That sweet sweet Prego fish. It was with her that my liking of pregnant women came to light. I wish I could express to all the people my love for pregnant women. They are so beautiful and that gorgeous baby bump, it just gets me going in all the right ways.

In 2nd grade my teacher Mrs. Dillon became pregnant and once I realized and were able to see her baby bump I couldn't get my mind off of her. At every given chance I would hug my teacher, whether it was in the mornings or when we left at the end of the day. Something about that feeling made me jittery.

remember that time when you used to sit at the playground swing as the evening afternoon slowly came to an end? Maybe you were in middle school, high school, some small child who stared blankly outwards towards a world you didn't even know you were so blatantly ignorant to. All you knew then was that you wanted to swing on that swing for hours and hours and never go home. \n\nA chill might have crept up your back then, as a soft wind beckoned the oncoming of nighttime, and you knew in your heart that you needed to go back home, back to your parents and your siblings and your family pet and all the small things you kept in the little corner you called your world. You might've wanted to sit on that swing for hours and hours, or swing on that monkey bar until your arms fell off. You wanted to run in that park field until you collapsed from laughter and exhaustion, or ran through those thickets and wooded areas your parents told you not to go into. You might've wanted to chase your friends around in a never-ending game of chase, or hide forever in that one little spot you knew by heart. \n\nBut as you grew up, you found yourself attracted by the myriad vagaries of life. You might've gone on that first date, or gone far away from home for some nebulous reason you don't know. Maybe you decided you hated what things had become, or who you were becoming, or blamed life for misery, for suffering, for the conditions intrinsic to human existence itself. Maybe you sat by yourself at times, wondering who you were, where you were going, why things were the way they were. Always looking for answers in the wrong places, always searching for the next high, the next fad that'd distract you from the emptiness gnawing within you. \n\nAnd when you became an adult, you found yourself again looking blankly, but backwards this time. Wondering where had all that time gone, why hadn't things turned out the way you wanted? Who was I still, and what was important to me? Questions of philosophy and human intricacies might've ran rampant within you, struggling with your body and spirit as you split yourself into a veritable crowd of personalities, all fighting bitterly for conquest and dominion over your eternal soul. \n\nBut when I sat for a few minutes and played Insaniquarium, I felt all at once an uneasy peace come over me. \n\nFor my restless soul that bound itself to conflict and purposeful self-inflicted pain, who knew all at once what was right and wrong and yet chose wrong and rejected right. \n\nAs I dropped these fish pellets I floated in my own fish tank, empty and blank, seeing nothing but a horizon of the rising sun, the distant sky tinged in a pallet of orange and green. \n\nAnd as the sweet, soft music played I felt a hot streak come down my cheek, and was overcome with shame at what I was and was not. \n\nAnd when my fish died, I died with them. \n\nAnd when they grew up happily and in contentedness, I grew with them in equal measure. \n\nI fought the demons and the aliens, and struggled for lives that were not my own. \n\nAnd when it ended, and I beheld all those creatures and companions I had acquired and protected over those many levels, who could say that it had been merely a video game? \n\nBeyond the veil of childish design and simplicity I looked upon an ageless beauty, feeling redemption undeserved for a tired and weary soul.

"review": "This is a wonderfully quirky take on a fish tank simulator that combines the fairly routine act of feeding your fish and collecting the coins that inexplicably fall out of them with occasional alien attacks. Each level has the goal of purchasing three egg pieces from the HUD's shop. Each fish drops a different type of currency based on its maturity or type, and the more valuable the fish's drops are, the more expensive the fish itself is. This means every fish is a risk, because if you drop a large sum of money to buy a fish and it dies before you get back what it cost, you are now that much farther from reaching your goal of collecting all three egg pieces. And each time you do reach the end of a level, you gain a new pet that will assist you. You can have three pets of your choice for any given level, and the ones you choose can drastically change the way you approach a level, as does the combination of pets you choose. The alien attacks can be genuinely heart-pounding due to their deadly efficiency at taking down fish. Some pets can mitigate the aliens' destructive force by either attacking the aliens themselves, or luring your fish to a safe spot in the tank, but that takes up a spot that could be used for collecting more money, and getting you closer to clearing the stage.

This currency is used to buy food, upgrade the quality or quantity of food, buy more fish, and a few other options available depending on the world.\nThe player is also asked to protect their fish from the dastardly, murderous intervention of various aliens, all with their own obstructive patterns.\n\nThere is an additional gameplay mode, which allows you to curate and maintain an aquarium of your own, with additional skins for the fish you encounter in game. You purchase these fish using a currency earned by completing sections of the game, called shells. This mechanic features a minigame where you click on various forms of the shell currency to collect it. If you click on the same type of shell, it accrues value until you click on another type of shell, or until you finish the combo. \n\nThere is a semblance of a story, mostly filled in by the player's imagination, and by the credit sequence. \n\nWhile this game likely does not match the standards of many current gamers, this game still carries fond memories of many people who were simply looking for a game that felt like it was alive.

shooting carried out by 20-year-old Adam Lanza at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012, which resulted in the deaths of 27 people, including 20 children, six adults and the lone gunman who committed suicide as the police began to arrive on the scene. On December 14th, 2012, Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old resident of Newtown, Connecticut, entered the premise of a local elementary school and fatally shot 20 children and six adult faculty members before killing himself. According to the police investigation, Lanza showed up at the school around 9:35 a.m. (ET) dressed in black fatigues and a military vest with two hand guns, two rifles and a semiautomatic rifle , all of which were purchased legally and registered under his mother\u2019s card. Adam Lanza was born April 22nd, 1992 and was an honors student at Newton High School before being removed to be home-schooled by his mother. After earning his GED, Lanza attended the Western Connecticut State University. According to an article in NY Mag,[6] Lanza's mother was an avid gun collector who stockpiled weapons and food in preparation for a possible economic collapse. Following the shooting, Lanza's brother Ryan told police he believed his brother may have been \"somewhat autistic.\"[7] On December 18th, 2012, Fox News published an article titled \"Fear of being committed may have caused Connecticut gunman to snap,\" reporting that Newton area resident Joshua Flashman claimed Lanza may have discovered that his mother was petitioning a court to have her son committed to a mental institution.\n", "timestamp_created": 1645837683, "timestamp_updated": 1646362561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481249988079071045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111019677": {"recommendationid": "111019677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150296358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 759, "last_played": 1676777252}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked this game when I was four.

If you\u2019ve played Plants vs. Zombies, then you already\u2019ll have a good understanding over what the \u201ccampaign mode\u201d is like, with new pets being introduced almost every time you beat a stage and new gameplay mechanics coming in each tank you do. The gameplay loop, for the most part, is very rewarding for most of the game, though I will say that by the latter half of tank 4, which is near the end of the campaign, it can get pretty repetitive. Also, there\u2019s no resolution options, so what you see is what you get. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a simple clicker to play with a lot of personality and a bangin\u2019 soundtrack, I\u2019d recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1643954396, "timestamp_updated": 1643954396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543108880519866943", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109448369": {"recommendationid": "109448369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367224419", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1673060960}, "language": "english", "review": "Best fish tank carpal tunnel simulator from 2001 until forever.", "timestamp_created": 1643952688, "timestamp_updated": 1664107315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109413926": {"recommendationid": "109413926", "author": {"steamid": "76561199185266138", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1669691885}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a part of my childhood.

a C for gmaeplay, but an A+ for originality. \n\nSeriously, if this gameplay was anything other than \"click wildly 100% of the time until you can't feel your fingers anymore\", this would be a masterpiece.  But that's what you get here -- a game that is so much about clicking that I can barely play it for more than 20 minutes at a time.  That's not an exaggeration, it's about 20 minutes until my fingers go numb from clicking as wildly as I can, and I have to take a little break before I jump back in.\n\nYou can probably play this game more casually than I do, but not by much... and if you're like me and you wanna get through every level as quickly as possible, you're never going to stop clicking once it gets going.  It's a real problem for long-term play, unlike any other game I've played to be honest.  I've never had to bail from a game for finger fatigue almost at all before, never mind consistently.\n\nHowever, this massive downside aside, this game is still really neat.  It's a FISHTANK with a STORY MODE.  So, despite any gameplay flaws, it's the best FISHTANK with a STORY MODE game that's ever been on the market.  Anything bad about this game can't knock it off the #1 spot of FISHTANK with a STORY MODE games.\n\nAnd for that reason alone, I really love it.  It's very unique, and it's from that fun age of gaming I love to revisit.  I bet most people come back to this because they remember it fondly, but I only came back because a coworker remembered it fondly and made me want to buy it.  I think it's important to mention that, even without any nostalgia attached to this game, I found it really enjoyable to play through.\n\nMINOR SPOILERS AHEAD:  The main gameplay loop is to earn enough money with your fishtank to buy an egg that will unlock a new special creature to help you in future tanks.  You can take three with you, and they do a bunch of different stuff which helps you try and go for certain 'fishtank builds' if you will.  Beyond that, each fishtank has a different money requirement, and each set of five fishtanks has a different set of fish you can put in it.  You might have to max out guppies in the early levels for coins, but later levels will have you upgrading those guppies to star guppies by feeding them a potion only when big.  You'll soon notice the star doesn't even give as much as the guppy gold coin before and feel ripped off, until you notice Starcatchers can turn those stars into diamonds worth 5x as much.  So now you have guppies growing up, converted into star guppies, dropping stars you can't touch until they convert to diamonds for max profit.  There's a bunch more like that I won't go into detail about, but my main point is that it's not just a \"put fish, feed fish, get money\" game, there's little themes and puzzles to figure out along the way.  The speedrun for this game must be crazy, can't wait to check it out after I've played through everything.\n\nThe maim story goes by pretty fast, but there's some extra modes and some grindy unlockables for people that don't want to be done with the game that soon.  I haven't tried them all, but there seems to be some time trials and an open fishtank casual mode, which could be neat.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some drywall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest gamer with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the parent I needed to be in that moment, not the weak drywall-puncher I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1640591135, "timestamp_updated": 1640591135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819513022899627686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106637468": {"recommendationid": "106637468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186447563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1676198844}, "language": "english", "review": "game that haunted my childhood and wouldn't leave my head, fish make funny death sound hehe.", "timestamp_created": 1640585366, "timestamp_updated": 1640585366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106630108": {"recommendationid": "106630108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089516625", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1666116162}, "language": "english", "review": "absolute banger", "timestamp_created": 1640576188, "timestamp_updated": 1640576188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106627158": {"recommendationid": "106627158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347941950", "num_games_owned": 905, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1641554986}, "language": "english", "review": "When I was a child, my mom took me to play this game, most of time I was watching her play.

well the goal is to save up enough money to buy a special egg slowly, you buy it in parts, and the more rare the egg is the more expensive it will be. these special eggs will turn into special little helper pets that will do different tasks to assist you in keeping your fish alive, or get you to your end goal of collecting the special eggs.\none of my personal favorite parts is the personal aquarium you get to have, you get to buy, name, and keep fish that will never die in your personal tank, they too will give you money, the money is worth a lot less, and not even close to as much as you would get if you were to be playing the, for a lack of a better word \u201ccampaign\u201d.\n i don\u2019t want to go too much into detail, because i genuinely recommend giving it a try, it is honestly an amazing game to turn your brain off and just play, .\u2022\u02da\u2727\u208a\u204e*~to a point~*\u204e\u207a\u02f3\u2727\u0f1a\u2022., it\u2019s just the right amount of challenging and fun. so overall 1,000,000/10 would replay again, and again, and again, and again, infact if i had my laptop on me right now i would be playing it right now!

You can try to get the high score on time trials for easy money for your shop, or do an INCREDIBLY challenging \"challenge\" mode where enemies become literally EXPONENTIALLY more difficult with time, and every item's price increases overtime, if you're able to complete a challenge you get a piece of backstory from the game, making it so you can play each challenge mode again and again! You have a personal fish tank where you can get many odd fish, from being able to get singing volley balls to being able to raise the enemies themselves(friendly ones of course). The game also has a KILLER soundtrack and some pretty fine art design, along with the MANY Easter Eggs of this game, this game just has it all.\nThe game will always hold a special place in my heart, and it may just be childhood bias, but this is one of my more favored games that I've played over these many years, and I recommend buying it 100%!", "timestamp_created": 1623123359, "timestamp_updated": 1623123359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93202432": {"recommendationid": "93202432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259522103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1622857712}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing this game back as a kid, decided to see if steam had it.

Alien Wars from the mid-2000's. I remember the lives I've failed to save all those years ago...the battles I've won, the ones I've lost, the feeling of my index finger clicking away at those aliens that I have never forgotten about from over a decade ago.\n\nAnd now they've returned.\n\nOur weapons have changed since then, our clicks per minute, our FPS, everything has improved since then, but the enemy remains just as vigilant as they were the first time they entered our world. I grabbed my mouse, and began clicking once more. The sensations never faded away, I remembered everything from the smiles on my fish as I fed them to the looks of the aliens terrified faces as I blast them to smithereens.\n\nOnce again I join the watery battlefield, taking care of the ones that are so helpless that all they can do is swim away from the aliens, but alas, their tiny minds make them oblivious to all the danger. Is it a gift to not know you are swimming directly towards the one who will eat you whole in a single bite? To be so blind to the threat in front of you? I do not know, but I do know it pains me every time that one of my fish swims towards their watery grave which is inside an alien's stomach.\n\nThey give me so little, but I treasure each and every coin I can manage to click on. They give me so much, yet I can only click so fast. My index finger grows stronger by the day, with the ability to carry all the groceries in on a single finger, the ability to lift a 5-pound weight on a single finger all while maintaining a tender grace on my weapon, clicking away at the alien threat until all my fish are safe.\n\nSome of the fish join my cause, offering to collect the gifts the fish give me along with offering protection. My strongest ones can barely hold themselves together anymore, often eating or killing my fish to maintain their sanity and fight for our cause. The aliens have done more than killing us, they changed us, drove us mad as we worry for every life under our watch, yet the goal of keeping every fish safe is impossible as they mindlessly swim in any direction they wish, oblivious to the war around us that carries on every day.\n\nA gift, or a curse? We may never know...\n\nThis is the war that takes place under the sea, this is the place that so few come out unscathed, your index finger will break, you will break, your mind may snap, you may wish that it would just end, that the war will finally be over, we pray every day for that, that someday we may finally let out a sigh of relief as the aliens finally call forth a full-retreat and fall back to their home world.\n\nA foolish wish it is, yet it gives us hope, and it keeps us clicking away...\n\nThis is Insaniquarium.", "timestamp_created": 1615583290, "timestamp_updated": 1615676949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88286943": {"recommendationid": "88286943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198417045363", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 14244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8968, "last_played": 1624623421}, "language": "english", "review": "....................,,-'\u00b4 . . . _,,,,,';:-,...................\n....................,-(c\\ \\`;-=\u00b4,_,-~-, \\`...............\n..................,/ . . .\u00af'\\, \u00ba ,/.'-~\u00b0,' .\u00af`'-,...........\n................../ . . . . . .\u00af,_ ~--~',, . . .'\\..........\n.................| . . . . . . . . \u00af\u00a8\u00a8\u00a8(\u0305_\u0305_\u0305_\u0305((_\u0305_\u0332\u0305\u043c\u0332\u0305a\u0332\u0305\u044f\u0332\u0305i\u0332\u0305j\u0332\u0305u\u0332\u0305a\u0332\u0305n\u0332\u0305a\u0332\u0305\u0305_\u0305_\u0305_\u0305() \u06aa\u06d2\n.................| . . . . . . . , . . . .`'-, . . . |..........\n................/\\ . . . . . . .\"-,,,-'~-~' . . .

I'm so happy I got to play this again.\n\nThis game is lots of fun and has a very friendly vibe so it can appeal to most audiences. In terms of gameplay, your job is to feed the fish and defend them from threats until you can earn enough money to complete the level. As you progress through the game, keeping certain fish alive becomes more complicated and defending against threats can become more difficult too. As you continue, you'll also unlock new pets that you can keep around to help you complete levels or just to make the tank more interesting.\n\nWhen you're tired of the main game, there's a Virtual Tank where you can relax and appreciate your own personal fish tank with permanent fish that you can feed and observe.\n\nIt's just as fun and frantic as I remember and I can't wait to finish it again. I believe a slightly updated version or remaster of this game would work very well. Add more game content, Steam achievements, make it work better with wider aspect ratios and add other modern features like visiting other players' Virtual Tanks. I'd be happy to buy it again for that.\n\n-----\n\nFor those who don't know it, this game was PopCap's best game (in my opinion) before [i]Plants vs Zombies[/i].

There's aliens and they want to eat your coin producing fish. Story won't be factored.\nGameplay 5/10: You can choose from a variety of pets to have that can do anything from make fish to killing aliens. You then start with some fish, and can buy more. You have to feed your fish so they produce money for you. Your goal is to buy all 3 pieces of the egg to finish the level and get a new pet. But sometimes aliens invade. They want to kill your fish, so kill them with your laser gun. Very simple, and can drag on after a while. Your index finger is also destined to get cramped for a while.\nLooks 3/5: This game screams 2000's PopCap, and it's pretty nice. No where as good looking as, say, Plants VS. Zombies, but still looks solid.\nMusic 4/5: The tunes are very simple, but very catchy. \nAccessibility 0/5: This was back in 2006, when there wasn't much talk about accessibility, but it doesn't excuse a complete lack of accessibility options. Just music options! That's it! There's literally nothing.\nOverall Score: 12/25, or 48/100\nEnjoyment Score: 7/10\nWhen would I recommend? Sale\nThis is only a thumbs down because it's below the halfway point. I'd say it's an interesting cornerstone in PopCap's history, but otherwise, it's just... fine.", "timestamp_created": 1609781390, "timestamp_updated": 1609781390, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2,
