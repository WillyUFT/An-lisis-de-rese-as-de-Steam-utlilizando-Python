The premise alone is comedy gold. Who would have thought that navigating a kitchen as a single slice of bread could be so side-splittingly funny?\n\nThe controls in \"I Am Bread\" are, well, let's just say they're as wonky as a slice of bread trying to move on its own. Each corner of the bread is mapped to a different key, which means you'll be flopping, flipping, and flinging yourself across the kitchen like a bread ninja on a gluten-filled mission. It's both frustrating and absurdly funny at the same time.\n\nThe levels are a playground of chaos waiting to happen. You'll find yourself climbing precarious stacks of dishes, riding a skateboard, and even hitching a ride on a Roomba. The sheer absurdity of these scenarios had me laughing out loud as I watched my bread slice heroically flop its way to toasting glory.\n\nSpeaking of toasting, the ultimate goal of the game is to get yourself toasted to perfection. This means navigating the perilous journey through various obstacles and hazards in the kitchen to reach the ultimate prize - the toaster. It's a quest that's both ridiculous and oddly satisfying.\n\nThe game doesn't take itself seriously for a moment, and that's what makes it so entertaining. The idea of a slice of bread embarking on a heroic adventure is just too absurd not to love. It's a game that revels in its own silliness and invites players to do the same.\n\nIn conclusion, \"I Am Bread\" is a game that's as lighthearted as it is ludicrous. It takes a simple concept and turns it into a comedy masterpiece.

Get ready for a rollercoaster of emotions, frustration, and maybe a newfound appreciation for your morning toast.\n\nSo, picture this: You are a slice of bread, and your one true goal in life is to become a perfectly toasted piece of golden deliciousness. But, hold your butter, it's not as easy as it sounds. \n\nNope, you'll be navigating kitchens, living rooms, and god-knows-where else in your quest to get toasted. And by \"navigating,\" I mean flinging yourself around like a bread ninja.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk controls. They're intentionally wonky, like trying to steer a piece of bread with a mind of its own. Each corner of the bread corresponds to a different control, and believe me, you'll be laughing and groaning as you flip, flop, and flop some more. It's like trying to control a possessed piece of carb-loaded chaos. But hey, that's the fun of it \u2013 the struggle is real, and it's hilarious.\n\nThe game's environments are anything but boring. You'll find yourself flopping around the kitchen, launching off toasters, teetering on edges, and causing chaos that only a rebellious slice of bread can manage. Each level presents a unique challenge, and you'll often wonder how bread ended up in some of these places in the first place.\n\nNow, let's talk about gameplay mechanics. You've got a \"edibility\" meter that's your lifeline, and let me tell you, it's as fragile as a croissant dipped in tea. Every little speck of dirt, jam, or other unmentionable substances will chip away at your edibility. It's simultaneously hilarious and anxiety-inducing, and if that wasnt enough you get graded at the end of each run.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the rage-inducing physics that'll make you question the very laws of bread nature. Just when you think you've got a grip on things, you'll find yourself glued to walls, flipping uncontrollably, and sometimes just lying there, defeated and wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nBut amidst the chaos, \"I Am Bread\" has a surprising charm. You'll laugh at the absurdity of it all, share your struggles with friends, and maybe even start personifying your piece of bread \u2013and  yes, I've been guilty of that. (I named him \"Steven\".) \n\nThe game's goofy antics make it strangely endearing, even when you're ready to launch your controller across the room.\n\nNow, it's worth mentioning that \"I Am Bread\" won't be everyone's cup of tea \u2013 or in this case, slice of bread. The wonky controls, the sometimes infuriating physics, and the sheer absurdity of it all might not be everyone's idea of a good time. But if you're in the mood for a game that defies convention, that makes you laugh at its own ridiculousness, and that challenges you to toast yourself against all odds, well, this is it.\n\nIn the end, \"I Am Bread\" is a hilarious, frustrating, and strangely addictive experience. It's a game that doesn't take itself seriously and invites you to join in on the laughter. So, whether you're ready to conquer the bread world or just want to see how your morning toast feels, give it a shot.

I remembered it recently when I saw it in my steam library... apparently I hadn't played very much, so I decided to finish the game. I can see why I didn't play much of it. The quirky funny bad controls get pretty stale pretty quick, and a lot of the game feels unfinished/broken (Even the game's title screen was never changed to say this game is out of early access). I wanted to explore and interact with the levels more, but the design is hostile towards that kind of thinking, putting traps and danger everywhere and not making much of the environment useful other than the stuff that toasts you. I kept interacting with stuff, expecting to be able to turn a radio on, or putting stuff on my bread in hopes of increasing its health or something, but it never worked. The camera also just, sucks a lot of the time.\n \nI guess, some positives for the game. The concept is funny. The premise of this eldritch horror bread coming to life and doing everything it can to toast itself for no discernible reason, terrorizing some guy's life in the process, is fun. There's also an easy mode (magic marmalade) which actually solves a lot of the problems I had with the game, allowing for more exploration and creative movement. It does feel weird to have half the mechanics turned off and come out of it with a more fun game. There's some neat extra game modes. These aren't really enough to save the game for me, I enjoyed maybe 20% of it and a lot of the remaining 80% was kind of a slog. It just feels like it was never really finished or refined into something more enjoyable.

Developed by Bossa Studios, this unconventional game offers a fresh take on the physics-based puzzle genre that will leave players both amused and challenged.\n\nThe first thing that sets \"I Am Bread\" apart is its concept. Playing as a sentient slice of bread may sound bizarre, but it's surprisingly entertaining. The game takes place in various everyday locations, such as a kitchen, a bathroom, or a park, where players must navigate the environment as a slippery slice of bread with the goal of reaching a toaster to become toast. The absurdity of the premise adds a sense of humor and charm to the game that is sure to make players smile.\n\nThe gameplay in \"I Am Bread\" is both challenging and unconventional. Players control the bread's movements, using the corners of the bread as \"grip points\" to cling to surfaces and maneuver through the environment. However, the bread's limited grip and the physics-based mechanics make controlling the bread a delightful, yet frustrating challenge. Players must strategize and plan their movements carefully to avoid hazards, such as dirt, water, and various obstacles, that can spoil the bread or cause it to lose \"edibility points.\" The game encourages experimentation and creativity, as players can find different routes and strategies to become toast.\n\nThe graphics in \"I Am Bread\" are simple yet effective. The game features realistic 3D environments with detailed textures that make the world feel immersive and believable. The animations of the bread's movements are comical and add to the overall humor of the game. The sound design is also noteworthy, with realistic sound effects that enhance the gameplay experience, from the crunching of the bread's crust to the quirky music that accompanies the bread's adventures.\n\nWhile \"I Am Bread\" is a fun and quirky game, it does have some downsides. The controls can be challenging to master, and the difficulty of the levels can sometimes feel frustrating, leading to repeated attempts to complete a level. Additionally, the repetitive nature of the gameplay may not appeal to everyone, as it mainly revolves around navigating the environment and avoiding hazards.\n\nIn conclusion, \"I Am Bread\" is a unique and entertaining indie game that offers a fresh and humorous take on the physics-based puzzle genre. Despite its challenging controls and sometimes frustrating difficulty, the game's quirky concept, creative gameplay, and immersive graphics make it a loaf of fun for players who are looking for a lighthearted and unconventional gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1681857547, "timestamp_updated": 1681857547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529020845890045166", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136776055": {"recommendationid": "136776055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058250272", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1681608591}, "language": "english", "review": "FOV Report: Very poor & non existent\n\nVery narrow FOV with no settings, config, or mods to change it.

Sounds simple but it is really difficult as you have to avoid getting the bread too dirty and the control are made to be intentionally challenging. Luckily if you're crap at it like me you can get an optional powerup after a couple of failed attempts which makes your slice of bread invincible. I thought that was a nice touch as it at least allows you to explore the levels and experiment without the stress of failing.\n\nThere are also a few other game modes to try outside the main one such as a destruction level where you control a baguette and try to cause as much damage as you can within a time limit. Another mode is a time trial where you roll a bagel around through some checkpoints in as fast a time as you can. There's also a few bonus crossover levels with Team Fortress and Goat Simulator.\n\nSo all in all you can see that an attempt was made to try and add a bit more fun and variety to this game. But that said, unless you are a masochist and want to try and get the highest ratings in all levels, you'll realistically only get a few hours of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nWhile it does what it does quite well it's not a game that would be for everyone. If you're looking at this game and thinking it seems stupid, then playing it is unlikely to change your mind. However if you just want a few hours of silly fun then it should do the job.\n", "timestamp_created": 1665616122, "timestamp_updated": 1665616122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

on YouTube and played it with some friends for a few hours before promptly moving on to other games. Although I remembered having some fun with this game, I recently decided to try it again to see how this game holds up now, and unfortunately, I didn't have a great time.\n\nThis game has a number of different game modes, most of which run through the same set of 7 levels with different goals and gimmicks:\n[list]\n[*] [i]Story Mode[/i]: This is the main game mode which includes the story, and is definitely by far the best game mode. You control a slice of bread on a journey to become toast, all while avoiding dirt and garbage so you don't become inedible. The story is funny and the different levels are interesting, with lots to explore and interact with. Although the controls are quite challenging to learn and definitely leave a lot to be desired, it's still fun to try and climb through the environments in search of heat sources to become toast. The controls can definitely be frustrating to use though, since the direction don't seem to align with the directions you're looking, and are relative to...something else (I could never figure out what), so you tend to spend lots of time flailing, hoping to go in the right direction. I still had fun with this mode though, so I think it's still worth playing.\n[*] [i]Bagel Race[/i]: In this mode, you control a bagel instead, and try to race through various checkpoints in each level as fast as possible. It's not terrible, but it's nothing special, and it's extremely frustrating when you hit something and lose your speed, or are forced to climb (as some levels seem to require), as it's really hard to regain momentum, and the bagel only has two grips you can use to climb, which makes it far harder to control. I didn't really enjoy this mode very much.\n[*] [i]Rampage[/i]: In this mode, you play a baguette and try to smash as much stuff as possible to rack up a high score. It's probably the second-most fun mode, and it's a lot of fun to break the glass dishes, especially when you get a crazy chain reaction going. It's fairly luck-based though whether you'll get a great chain reaction (or whether stuff will start breaking immediately when you start, giving you bonus points for doing literally nothing). It's also really hard to control the baguette as it once again only has two grips to use to move it, which is just far harder to do and the directions often makes little sense. Since this mode also creates a lot of debris, it's really easy to grab debris by accident, and for some reason, this makes the physics behave really weird and makes the bread even harder to control.\n[*] [i]Cheese Hunt[/i]: This game mode is awful. You play an extremely fragile piece of crackerbread that must climb through the levels in search of pieces of cheese which you must touch to \"collect\". Not only is it somewhat tedious to find these pieces of cheese, as they're not extremely easy to see, especially from the starting position, but it's way too easy to break the crackerbread by falling a short distance, having an object hit you too hard, or even just by grabbing the wall in the wrong way while climbing, which forces you to restart and makes this mode extremely tedious and repetitive. I didn't finish a single level in this mode.\n[*] [i]Zero G[/i]: This game mode is very similar to the story mode, except there's no gravity and you must use rockets to guide the bread to the heat source in each level. I didn't like this mode at all either, because the controls are impossible to figure out. Just like in all the other modes, the directions aren't relative to where you're looking, so it's impossible to tell which direction you're going to be propelling yourself, and since there's no gravity, it can take a ton of work to correct minor mistakes when flying.\n[*] [i]Free Roam[/i]: This game mode lets you select the type of bread to use and lets you explore each level with no restrictions. It's really only good for practising, getting achievements, or goofing off if you really want to. It's not awful, but it doesn't really offer much extra.\n[*] [i]Ram-page[/i]: This mode is essentially the same as the Rampage mode, except you play as a goat instead of a baguette. I actually found the goat easier to control, because it gives you back four grips like the main game mode, although it's still frustrating, especially since the legs tend to flail around, so it's hard to tell where they'll end up and you often end up waiting for them to hit the ground to continue moving. I honestly prefer this mode to the regular Rampage, but it's controls still leave a lot to be desired.\n[*] [i]Team Fortress 2[/i]: This mode is essentially a Team Fortress 2-themed level that is almost identical to the main Story Mode. Just an extra level to play. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I'd actually played TF2 before.\n[*] [i]Starch Wars[/i]: This mode is actually a decent Star Wars-themed level where you must attack a Starch Destroyer as a flying piece of bread. The parody is pretty neat and is fairly well done. The controls are entirely different than anything else in the game and it's actually pretty fun. Unfortunately, it's both extremely short and has a complete lack of direction, as it doesn't really tell you what to do, so I ended up wasting a bunch of time before I just looked up how you're supposed to win. It's too bad, because it's pretty fun, and a little bit of direction or guidance would have helped a ton.\n[/list]\n\nSo after all the game modes, the only ones I really recommend are the main Story Mode and the Team Fortress 2 and Starch Wars bonus levels. This is a very small part of the content in this game, and it probably won't take more than a few hours to play through, so given the lack of good content and the horrendous controls for the price of this game, it just isn't worth it.\n\nI should also mention that the game is fairly buggy and unpolished. The majority of the bugs are physics related issues, such as objects moving or breaking immediately when the level starts, crazy collisions where objects go flying away at high speeds, or issues where you get rocketed away from something you're holding onto in a seemingly illogical direction, often causing you to lose the level. The camera can also be extremely wonky, often moving in weird directions, moving way too close to the bread you're controlling, or clipping through objects. I didn't really have any performance issues like some other reviews have mentioned recently, although I had a couple of crashes as well.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] This is a silly game where you control a type of bread and attempt to complete some sort of strange goal, such as becoming toast. It can be entertaining and has a funny story and some interesting environments, but the controls are abysmal, many of the game modes are not good, and there's quite a few bugs with the physics which can be pretty frustrating. Given the lack of content in this game that I'd consider good, I just can't recommend it unless you can get it on a good sale.", "timestamp_created": 1649638556, "timestamp_updated": 1649638556,

We're those guys who provide games like [i]Half-Life[/i], [i]Team Fortress 2[/i], [i]Garry's Mod[/i] and [i]I Am Bread[/i]! If you're one of the true elite gamers, then this is one of the games that you've played!\" [i]Surgeon Simulator[/i] is another \"big Steam game\" that I've had interest in and since I wish to play it, I decided that I would play its long-spoiled prequel [i]I Am Bread[/i] first. The results of my playtime with this game were less than satisfactory.\n\nI know that this game is known for having \"wonky controls\" as one of its main appealing features, but there were so many times where I felt as though the controller wasn't responding to my inputs in a way that seemed fair. I constantly felt as though I was wrestling the controller into submission to get it to do what I wanted it to do. Even then, it didn't always seem to work like it ought to have worked! If you want to get an \"A++\" grade on every level, then prepare yourself for a lot of punishment and frustration! Even when you finally do master everything that the game can throw at you, you don't get much of a payoff. All you get is an ending in Story Mode that most people already know about.\n\nI think that this game has two great things going for it and that would be the \"Magic Marmalade\" invincibility pickup in Story Mode and the Rampage Modes, particularly the one with the goat from [i]Goat Simulator[/i]. The \"Magic Marmalade\" shows up near your starting point in each level in Story Mode after you've failed the level twice. This gives the player a much easier way to beat the level, thereby allowing access to all of the other modes in the game and to progress further in the main story. The Rampage Modes give you a much-needed opportunity to take out your frustrations about the game by smashing the crap out of everything in each story level with either a baguette or a goat (I prefer the goat).\n\nIf you are going to get this game, then I suggest that you only do it if you're interested in the lore of [i]Surgeon Simulator[/i] or if you want to bash dishes, glasses and bottles to pieces with a goat. However, if you're the kind of person like me who is obsessed with earning all of the achievements that you can possibly earn in a game, then I give you fair warning that this game will frustrate you to a point where it's not even fun anymore.", "timestamp_created": 1637101060, "timestamp_updated": 1637101292, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482588440179824829", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102746227": {"recommendationid": "102746227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059556207", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "playtime_at_review": 586, "last_played": 1699933972}, "language": "english", "review": "it taste good 1.37/10", "timestamp_created": 1636858302, "timestamp_updated": 1636858302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102575338": {"recommendationid": "102575338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123597638", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1636612270}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a fan.

I Am Bread is kind of infamous for being frustrating and I only decided that I would try to beat it after I managed to beat Getting Over It. I have completed 2 levels so far at the time of my review. I think I should also mention that I am playing with a controller.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- Frustrating, but not unbeatable\n- Has a nice puzzle aspect to it, and there are often (from what I can tell) multiple ways to toast yourself in the level, if you pay attention to whats around you.\n- realistically scaled (for a video game about playing as a sentient piece of bread)\n\nTHE NEUTRAL(my nitpick category):\n- I wouldn't mind it if the grab object mechanic actually allowed you to rotate around it if you also pressed the trigger/bumber of that corner (which it doesnt, it completely overrides the other controls)\n\nTHE BAD:\n- The camera can be controlled with the right analog stick, but auto adjusts itself (and I mean completely, even changing the rotation) in some areas, which tends to completely throw off the immersion and flow of the game (From an aesthetic perspective I mean)\n\n\nComments:\nThe ridiculous controls are humorous, but also can get quite frustrating (which I personally see as a good thing, for the kind of game this is) I find that (as was the case when I played Getting Over It) trying to find the humor in the bad controls is the way to go with this game. The story behind this game was interesting to, it just goes to show how video games have evolved over the years that the developers felt the need to explain why the bread was moved from the kitchen and into the other rooms of the house. I believe I read somewhere that this game was actually a prequel to another game made by the same developers which I may or may not check out after I finish this as well.\n\nThat being said, I am gonna go into a bit more detail on my only real criticism with this game. Ridiculous controls are one thing, that is kind of the point of this game is to be extremely ridiculous. However when you have a mechanic where the camera can be controlled, having it auto adjust/reset itself is probably the worst (and I don't mean in terms of frustration, but in terms of aesthetic design) thing to implement with that. It wouldn't be that bad if it simply zoomed in/out to accommodate for whats around, because then at least it isn't entirely interrupting the flow of the game, but it also resets the rotation in that case here as well, which completely interrupts the flow of the game, and has actually been what messed me up a few times, not to mention the fact that clashing game-play mechanics tends to ruin immersion in video games.

In reality, it plays more like the lovechild of Octodad and QWOP, in my experience, most comparable to the former. But Octodad has some clear advantages over it, in terms of controls, which is where I Am Bread suffers most imo. \n\nBread lacks flexibility, range, momentum, and precision, all of which tie into each other. While at surface level, the same \"hold down key to stick, release to move\" principle applies to both, Octodad pivots around quite nicely thanks to flexibility, allowing you practically 360 degrees to reach around, with very little hindrance, even from obstacles, making precise motions a matter of simply getting used to the odd controls. Bread, on the other hand, is surprisingly inflexible for not being toasted yet. You try to turn and can only get less than 180, even less so with obstacles and with gravity on vertical sections. Flipping over to change direction can be quite a task if pivoting isn't an option, as you sorta get stuck on yourself, and end up pivoting in some unhelpful direction as you try to flip, rendering the spherical range of motion rather pointless. This also plays into the precision issue, as catching on your own stale self makes precise grabs a nuisance. Octodad, meanwhile, uses separate controls to perform vertical movements, allowing precise grabs with little issue. Octodad has a very wide range of grabbing, whether it's right in front of him or well past his standing height. Bread, meanwhile, is essentially limited to three semicircles centered around whatever corner you're latched onto, and even then, due to your stiffness, actually grabbing the thing doesn't always work like it should. The stretchiness of Octodad also allows him to build up momentum, whether it's sloppily yet effectively running by alternating left and right mouse or outright slingshotting yourself across a hallway, getting from point A to point B may take practice, but is rewarding to master. The convoluted use of all four corners coupled with inflexibility, as well as lack of oomph behind your motions in general, makes building up momentum that you especially need for all the vertical climbs a chore, if not nigh impossible.\n\nI'm not saying I Am Bread has to BE Octodad, but the control schemes are practically identical save for the extra grabs on the former, and of the two Octodad's is just almost entirely better on an objective level, even if some might subjectively prefer the more convoluted and limited QWOP-ish nature of I Am Bread's. \n\nIf you want something that's quirky, yet rewarding to learn, I'd say go with Octodad: Dadliest Catch, because the two games are very similar anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1580078602, "timestamp_updated": 1580078602, "voted_up":

I don\u2019t know why, but I try to avoid only playing AAA titles, and looking at my list I\u2019ve done a fantastic job. But I like to switch between an \u201cAAA\u201d title and an indie title. Well, I don\u2019t think they get much more indie than I Am Bread.\n\nSo in 2013, a unique game came out called Surgeon Simulator by Bossa Studios. It tasked the player to do surgery on a patient with just awful controls. I don\u2019t mean that as an insult to the game as they are intentionally bad, but the fact is you had to manually control every finger of a hand to grab tools to work on the surgery. The controls really challenged the player to do the surgery. It was odd, it was unique, and It was a smash hit.\n\nSo in 2015, Bossa released a follow up to Surgeon Simulator, simply titled \u201cI Am Bread\u201d. A game which could also simply be called a \u201cBread simulator\u201d, a new entry in the \u201cbad simulation\u201d genre. While it\u2019s not a genre they created, as QWOP might be one of the original games with intentionally bad controls, it is a genre which they seemed to have shown a mastery with Surgeon Simulator. However, a \u201cBread simulator\u201d? Hmm how odd, but intriguing. How can one be bread?\n\nThe fact is you don\u2019t play \u201cbread\u201d necessarily but rather a seemingly sentient piece of bread that wishes to be toasted. Yeah, I don\u2019t get it either, but I\u2019ve played games where I\u2019m a magical goat wizard so I\u2019ll go along with it.\n\nThe story of the game is sparse. Between levels, there are notes taken down by a psychiatrist about a man who thinks a piece of toast has come alive and is wrecking his house. Well obviously he\u2019s right, but the notes don\u2019t really refer to your actions but generic information about what was in the room you were in. Even if you\u2019re very careful and disrupt nothing, the note says you made a mess. Really, that\u2019s the entire story for the game. The game doesn\u2019t tie heavily to those notes, though there is an epilogue level specifically tied to that story. The story is there to avoid people saying \u201cThey want a story.\u201d but ultimately I don\u2019t know if the story is necessary for this type of game.\n\nSo if the story doesn\u2019t feel important, how is that gameplay then?\n\nIt definitely has a feeling that it\u2019s in the same genre as the Surgeon Simulator, but it also feels that it\u2019s more similar to \u201cQWOP\u201d where you independently control the legs and thighs of a runner. In I Am Bread, you get the ability to grip with any of four corners of the piece of bread, and from there you can flip the bread using those gripped corners as the axis.\n\nThe easiest movement is to use two bumper buttons on a controller for the \u201ctop \u201d of the bread, and the triggers as the \u201cbottom\u201d and just alternate, and this works well. If you\u2019re on a flat surface and are precise with your motion, you can usually use this to flip towards any goal you want in a straight line. There is a challenge when you need to make a turn but only grabbing with one of the edges allows you to flop around based on that single point, and in that too, it works.\n\nThe feeling of the movement is quite odd. The controls are good and usually feel like they\u2019re based on camera direction or bread orientation more than anything, but it\u2019s a game you need to feel to understand how it works rather than just watching someone on youtube. It\u2019s very strange and unique.\n\nAt the same time, there\u2019s also a pro-control version, which is actually the original style of the game, and that\u2019s\u2026 quite a bit more frustrating to say the least. I can\u2019t exactly explain the difference between the two control styles, but the \u201cBasic\u201d is the newer easier control scheme developed after feedback from the audience. It does make the game remarkably more playable but it\u2019s mostly due to the fact the controls work as you expect 100 percent of the time instead of closer to 75 percent of the time. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reason that the pro controls feel so strange and there are probably rules for the motion, but I can\u2019t put my finger on it with the ten minutes of playing with it that I did, and had no desire to continue playing with those controls.\n\nStill, even with the basic controls, the controls can be quite frustrating. When you need to move quickly, the controls are limiting. You want to quickly get off a bad surface or away from a danger and the best you can do is flip away, and the speed that you flip at is slower than you imagine. You need to make proper contact with an object to grab it or grip on it. Sometimes that requires flapping around until you make the \u201cRight\u201d contact. I get all the reasons why the controls are like they are because if they weren\u2019t, the game would be remarkably easy to do everything, but at the same time, I have to admit I got more frustrated with them the longer I played.\n\nThe game also has a few rules about \u201cGrip\u201d. You can grip for a certain amount of time on any surface. If that time runs out, you slip and fall to the ground. You can land on anything and as long as you aren\u2019t gripping with any point, you\u2019ll gain that grip power back but running out at the wrong time can doom you pretty quickly.\n\nHowever, with all these rules, I did find some cool moments and motions in the game with those controls. You\u2019re able to fling yourself in the air. When you do it right, it feels amazing. If you fail, you still feel like a boss doing it because it\u2019s a fun motion to do. The same is true when pivoting on one piece up and over an object, that\u2019s a great moment. Falling and grabbing onto any surface with any of the four corners is also an exciting experience. So while the controls can be frustrating they do have moments of coolness.\n\nBut I think the game tried to return to the \u201cWow, that feels odd\u201d feeling that Surgeon Simulator existed in. It tries to also be random to get weird and zany situations for Youtubers to experience and freak out over or make the player have fun, but really the game itself is too normal for that. The controls are wonky and silly because of it, but the game itself seems like a standard platformer in many level design.\n\nLet me give an example with Surgeon Simulator. You have to do surgeries in surgeon simulator, with the first one being to do a heart transplant. Then after you beat all of those surgeries, you have to do the surgery again in a poorly driven ambulance, and on a gurney riding down the halls, and in space. Even the operations are weird, such as an eye or tooth transplant. This all works because everything is over the top or extreme.\n\nI Am Bread, on the other hand, tries to take the sentient bread, which is a pretty outlandish concept, and then normalize it with a very average world. It\u2019s just a game with weak controls rather than a weird and unique experience.\n\nAnother example of how games tackle this type of style is how Katamari Damacy handles its world. Often times you start with a normal looking world, but as you play more and more, you get to see outlandish locations to the point where you want to see what the game does next, or what the game might be hiding behind a door or in a secret area.\n\n\nIf you want to read more and see a final score, you can see the full review with pictures and video at https://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/06/17/i-am-bread-review/.

The controls alone are so fustraighting, you have no clear picture in your head that you know what you are doing at all times. You spend more time guessing the bumper pads in hopes something will cling. The analog stick to move the bread will sometimes be forward, or backwards depending on how you grip the bread. \n\nThe bread has no flexibility. You spend all this time to become toast, but the bread feels like toast. The bread should bend more in the middle and fold and flex better, but instead is you get this stiff cardboard bread. Trying to go vertically up anything then trying to clear a 90 degree right angle to get on top of a counter/stove, etc, it's impossible, the bread will not fold and you end up fighting to make simple right angles. \n\nThen you got the worst camera angles I have ever seen. The camera is 100% zoomed into the bread and there is no way to zoom out to get a more clear picture of the room and your path. Not only that the camera will lock in place and get stuck on objects. If you get stuck behind a dresser, the camera will glitch into the dresser and point to the sky making it impossible to see your bread. \n\nThe game is also so glitchy that my bread will get dirty by touching containers will dirty things inside. What happens is the bread clips through things a lot, like containers and so the bread will grab an object inside a container and pull it through the container magically. Sometimes things just float on the bread, like hovering over it but will still be stuck on it some how. \n\nSome objectives are to make yourself toast, but how you make yourself toast is the most interesting part of the game. I spent about 5 minutes getting to the toaster on the first level, just to spend 20 minutes just trying to get the dumb bread in the toaster. Then I realized there was a burner on the stove that I can easily lay on top of and become toast to beat the level. But what made me quit this horrific game is on the 2nd level the way you have to become toast is by entering a small slit in the heater on the wall to because toast. After 20 times, I gave up. It is impossible to bend the bread into the small areas. \n\nAnother thing that irritates me is that they give you such a small time for gripping with the bread. Most of the time I am fighting the camera angle in order to see what I am doing, then by fiddling with the camera my grip is losing quick so then I feel rushed.

If it were virtually ANYTHING else, I'd say it's a sack of shit.\n\nIn the main game, you are a slice of bread trying to become toast. You can grip surfaces to move yourself and climb around, but you can only grab at each of your four corners, and you can't grip for too long so you have to stop and rest sometimes. And BEWARE THE FLOOR!\n\nThe buttons you have to hold down keep changing depending on your orientation, and the camera always seems to work against you. Maybe you're moving in a straight line, but the camera decides to orbit you in a 360 pattern. Or maybe you're trying to figure out how to get up a stack of objects, but the camera keeps putting boxes or other stuff between you and the bread. You may as well try to play the game blindfolded.\n\nAlmost every surface is loose, too, so it's not uncommon to have something slip out from underneath you and kill your whole run. Mastering the art of the fling is almost impossible because when you only have one point of grip, you never know what the analog stick is going to make you do.\n\nI enjoy the different games within the game, to some degree. The bagel race is about as infuriating as the main game largely because of the uncooperative camera. And the times you have to beat are INSANE! The rampage game is my favorite because I find it to be the easiest (relatively) but you only have two grip points this time so orienting yourself and making yourself go where you want to go is almost impossible (I often wind up going backwards.) I also don't understand the physics because I can break a glass, send shards flying, and then subsequently grab onto a flying shard and get carried halfway across the room! The Zero Gravity levels are excruciating, and I can't even beat one level of the Cheese Hunt because the damn cracker bread breaks too easily.\n\nDespite all this, the game is still fun. And I can't help but laugh at the whole premise, and chuckle every time I see \"I'm not eating that\" thrust on the screen. This is a game that is hilarious to watch other people try and beat, but I've found that I can laugh at myself, too.

Another thing that I hate is how the bread bounces off surfaces when rocking back and forth on one side... totally unnecessary and inaccurate to the laws of physics and freaking gravity. Also, just when you think it can't get worse, the camera completely screws you over so that you either have unneeded trouble seeing, or you can't see at all.\nLoved the idea of this concept, but the mechanics are absolute crap. I'd like to meet someone who has been successful with this game and have them teach me their ways, because even as someone who is able to adapt very easily to different sets of controls, I had infinite amounts of trouble with this game.\nDo not recommend this game- not for the easily-angered... although it would probably be enough to get the most patient of people yelling and screaming.\nI hope whoever designed those controls dropped their toast this morning.", "timestamp_created": 1496441549, "timestamp_updated": 1496500285, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2,

That is mostly what you get. It's hard being bread, but you're bread, and that's funny.\n\nThere are two main caveats. The camera sucks, and you have no information.\n\nThe camera is as clunky as your movement, but not what you paid to experience. I suspect skill with the camera is similarly acquired as the movement but your initial experience will vastly differ from the perfectly framed trailers and quickly adaptive let's players. And when frustrated from the gradually decreasing grip meter giving out the camera becomes the thing to blame. It also nigh breaks the bagel racing mode.\n\nAside from that, this game desperately needs some sort of Detective Mode that shows you exact areas of dirtiness and heat. One of the games merits is discovery for the player of different heat sources, but these almost always have a switch. Let's take a 90s era CRT tv, if you owned one you won't know if the developers made the top also hot like a real one or if you'll just have to press against the screen. The iron will seem like the most obvious heat source, but can you still use it if it isn't glowing red like activated hot things? Trial and error necessitates repetition, which will quickly sour the humor of it all. \n\nHowever if you don't care about scores eventually story levels give you 'Magic Marmalade' which allows you invincibility and unlimited grip.

The variety is surprising, as you'll find multiple ways to flip, toss, and jiggle your bread with the shoulder buttons. \n\nIt might be weirdly unintuitive at first, but with practice, the controls become quite natural. It ultimately becomes a key part of the game from easily becoming a stale novelty. Suffice it to say though, a controller is a must. The keyboard and mouse combo would only wreck your hands. \n\nThe crusty parts eluded to earlier involve a camera that can sometimes work against you. The angle can change quickly, altering the way the controls and forcing you to compensate for it. It happens infrequently, but leaves an irritating impression when it does happen. The environment could also use some life to it, as aside from the multiple ways to become toasted, there isn't much else to do in it. Some challenging trigger events like turning on the TV (which I found disappointingly unresponsive in the second level), or even a combo of related actions could have added much more value. \n\nNonetheless, I am Bread provides fresh, delicious scent to an indie landscape overstuffed with me-too first-person shooter and rogue-lite games. Highly recommended for those looking for a new, action-oriented game and recommended still for everyone else.   \n", "timestamp_created": 1480417305, "timestamp_updated": 1480417305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534461915493011475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28027748": {"recommendationid": "28027748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989385375", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1480401596}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to like this game.

The challenge seems to be figuring out what to do as much as getting there.\nI tried the Starch Wars, which was entertaining for about 10 minutes, then after the 20th attempt (and intro), I decided this game is not balanced, not well considered, and not worth much more of my time.

Which again, is cute to see happen, but when you've spent 5 minutes making your way across a level, only to be thrown across the room by a bug, it quickly turns from cute to controller snapping frustrating. \n\nIf you can pick it up for a couple of bucks the wackiness is certainly charming and distracting, but ultimatly the frustrating lack of agency in the game play will probably have you giving up long before you've explored most of the content. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1478502043, "timestamp_updated": 1478502043, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646896898746490479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26458693": {"recommendationid": "26458693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159592455", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1594391303}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Original idea, great game[/h1]\n[b]I have no idea what I am doing here, anyway.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1478446576, "timestamp_updated": 1478446599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26455224": {"recommendationid": "26455224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079455459", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1479942352}, "language": "english", "review": "My body is bready...", "timestamp_created": 1478435085, "timestamp_updated": 1478435085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485212564468383789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26412551": {"recommendationid": "26412551", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989601303", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1499554483}, "language": "english", "review": "WTF am I doing with my life...", "timestamp_created": 1478248371, "timestamp_updated": 1478248371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477354556322097778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26406707": {"recommendationid": "26406707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088206502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 161, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1494252880}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game, but verry difficult (controlls)", "timestamp_created": 1478210677, "timestamp_updated": 1478210677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559981226921081543", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26402704": {"recommendationid": "26402704", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961020415", "num_games_owned": 1044, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1449290247}, "language": "english", "review": "Why am I able to post a review?

This is a trial and error sort of game, the trouble being every trial can last about 15 minutes or longer.  the first hour of the game is spent trying to get used to the controls. Then you blunder along trying not to touch the floor or other various things through each room. Apparently the controls are better with a controller, but after trying it with my steam controller, they were even worse. I am using a keyboard and mouse, and while I got the controls down pretty good finally, some things are just random and uncontrollable. \nWhen you are not figthing the controls, you are fighting the camera and it is very hard to navigate up a wall with limited grip time while having to adjust the camera as well and trying to squish yourself up between two tight spaces.\n\nIt took me like 20 minutes just to fit inside a toaster thanks to flaily bread controls.\nAnyway, the gameplay itself is unique and clever, but not very fun. It is just repeating the same thing over again until you figure something out to get you further along in your helpless search for a heat source.\n\nWhen you miraculously reach a heat source, good luck trying to find the place where it actually would heat you up. I am not sure if there are certain spots only that are hot, or if the game just isn't working correctly. For example, I was climbing all over a space heater, but only one tiny spot on the whole thing heated me up. As you scramble around the heat source trying to get toasted, you will likely fall off and die. Not very fun.\n\nIf you are a more patient human being than I and enjoy doing long repetitions of bread flopping over everything, then buy it. I personally find it very boring, slow moving and frustrating because you never feel truly in control. \n\nThe game does give people like me some help though. If you fail twice on a given level, some super butter or something comes and gives you unlimited life and grip. This makes beating the levels much easier, but it makes a boring game even more boring.\n\nOne good thing I can say about \"I Am Bread\" is that there is a rather large amount of content. Too bad the game is too horrible to play through it all. I usually force myself to beat terrible games, but for the second time in memory, I have had enough after 5 levels.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1477159197, "timestamp_updated": 1477159197, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52161705493927002", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26145715": {"recommendationid": "26145715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143835029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1686708155}, "language": "english", "review": "It seems like a good game when you are buying it, but it is just too stressful and you spend like 15 minutes on one level and then you just loose.", "timestamp_created": 1477058842, "timestamp_updated": 1477058842, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489111512899398804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26110879": {"recommendationid": "26110879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081475873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1525714501}, "language": "english", "review": "Has a space battle mode that is more in-depth than No Man's Sky.", "timestamp_created": 1476855242, "timestamp_updated": 1476855242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486625522375106812", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26101763": {"recommendationid": "26101763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073345810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1476801620}, "language": "english", "review": "Wasn't my thing, could be fun for others though.", "timestamp_created": 1476801665, "timestamp_updated": 1476801665, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44001162052154541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26073624": {"recommendationid": "26073624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002676485", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1644157713}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this game with my wife and daughter who managed to make a piece of toast with fluff and ants on it ...

Now, our food plays... with us.\n\nStraight out, it's clear this is not a game for everyone.  Expecting a silly Bread 'Simulator' Youtube-sensation smash-em-up?  Look elsewhere.  I AM BREAD needs *surprising* amounts of skill and puzzle solving.  Surprising unless you've played Surgeon Simulator, Bossa's previous game, which likewise required you to train your brain to learn what keys WON'T hurl spoons and scalpels all over the theatre.  This'll sound scathing but some reviewers prefer the Bagel Racing because it's a lot more straight forward and not at all punishing.  If you're interested enough to read this, you'll laugh plenty while you play, yet I AM BREAD will make you feel like your mild-mannered alter-ego has been bashed around the head with a baguette.\n\n[h1]Story Mode:[/h1] Yes, story mode about living bread.  The other modes are a very fun distraction but Story Mode hooked me in.  It's a surgeon simulator prequel!  As surreal and daft as that is, it works. You're taken on an adventure and the world really does become all about one thing: You aren't just bread; you must become TOAST.  You play through as a loaf possessed with life, each slice seeking any and all ways to become everyone's favourite morning accompaniment.  Story Mode takes place over the course of a week.  One of the joys is how the mission at hand engages you completely, and before long the escalating impact of your toasty obsession becomes deadly clear.  This loaf will stop at nothing, slowly pushing its owner into a frenzy while the world (or his therapist and security guards, at least) thinks him insane. \n\n[h1]Controls:[/h1] You have complete control of every corner and every movement of your wholesome slice, and you will have to learn how not just to grip, but how to flip, how to leap, how to swing and hurl things about to get through the levels.  The levels aren't just kitchens and lounges and petrol stations, because there is an increasing requirement to learn what you've tried out in previous levels to get through the next.  This is one thing that makes I AM BREAD much more of a game than I think a lot of players give it credit for.  It takes timing and practice and a lot of patience - with yourself more than anything!! You'll totally flop on some key manoeuvre and curse your aching fingers, but you'll try again and figure it out.  The only difference between limping across a kitchen surface or crawling painfully up the side of a bin, and flipping across car bonnets or leaping across chasms and flipping gracefully over petrol station shelving, is YOU. \n\n[h1]Levels:[/h1] Over the course of a week, you'll have to find heat sources, of which there are a few even in the same level, while avoiding anything that'll render you inedible.  Later you'll have to be a bit more creative (and destructive?) in your mission to toast yourself.  It requires level exploration until you spot something, it clicks, or you have that \"I wonder if...\" moment.  The levels are littered with everyday objects and I adored how everything seemed to move right, from bin lids to swinging petrol station signs, to individual piles of books and rolling gas tanks.  Some things break physics conveniently without going anywhere near the stupidity of something like goat simulator - switches move easily at a stroke, bread is surprisingly strong enough to hurl bricks at cars, and lighters will flick just by touching them.  These breaks are convenient and welcome!  If things get too difficult too often, you are offered a way to become edible no matter what you land on, but I recommend avoiding this.  Staying edible is half the game!\n\n[h1]Other Modes:[/h1] Thanks to Bossa's intent on providing banquets rather than just the one offering (surgeon simulator had several modes by the time they were done), the other modes add content to this game each with its own brilliant twist.  Bagel Racing is easy to get to grips with, though I did initially expect to race other bagels and multiplayer bagels would have been fantastic.  Starch Wars is pretty epic in which you'll take on an evil ironing board and its Rye Fighters.  Rampage puts you in control of a very angry baguette intent on smashing everything, swinging itself about like a baseball bat.  Cheese hunt sees you take on a quest for several pieces of cheese in a room as a piece of Rye, but isn't so interesting.  Zero-G is surprisingly addictive and very nicely done.  I haven't completed the Team Fortress mode but its a quirky version of the same thing and looks a lot of fun as you interact with familiar objects and weapons from comatose Heavy Weapons Guy's world.\n\nIt's not a long game, over with in a couple of evenings or maybe 4-6 hours (depending on what you do with the other modes).  It's very silly, great to play with mates or family around, it's got a nice dark glint in its eye, it's easy to play and difficult to master, but your patience and determination will be rewarded.  Remember this is a game in a true sense and you'll be ready - YOU [i]WILL[/i] BE TOAST.  I am a fan.  If you've even read this far, just get it on offer and have a great time.\n\nNo spoilers intended here but my girlfriend was absorbed in this game's story and right at the end just asked one question: [i]\"Why doesn't Mr. Murton just make his bread into toast?  Then everyone would be happy.\" [/i] \n\nWhy didn't you just, Mr. Murton?", "timestamp_created": 1475831620, "timestamp_updated": 1475831620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25863844": {"recommendationid": "25863844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064245682", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1122, "last_played": 1480116187}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls are frustrating and unintuitive.

But wait, you must also be edible, so no crawling around on the floor as you complete your quest for a toaster.\n\nYou can individually control each of the four corners of your slice of bread, and each corner can be used to grab something.  The bread flops around with ragdoll physics as you strategically alternate between corners in order to flip your way to a suitable toaster.  Controlling the bread is unbelievably difficult, and made worse by poor camera movement, but you do get the hang of it after a few hours of severe frustration.  Thankfully, repeatedly failing every level allows you to optionally become invincible and complete the level without worrying about your edibility.\n\n[i]If the toaster is broken how do I become toast?[/i]\n\nEach level has multiple methods that will allow you to become toast. You can turn on the radiator, break the tv, use the iron, light the grill... the list goes on.  There are also several possible paths to reach each, so you can play each level several times.\n\nThe game has quite a bit of humor in it.  Story mode allows you to watch as your owner slowly goes insane.  Starch Wars mode allows you to fly around in a spaceship made from a slice of bread in order to save a baguette.

Why is this a recommendation?\n\n-Unlike Goat Simulator, there isn't a grand total of one joke per level. It's ridiculous how many puns are packed into the game and some of the more subtle ones actually made me chuckle. There are no shortage of bread puns in this game.\n-This game succeeds in the same way Surgeon Simulator succeeded- It actually has merit above just being a game with bad controls. Both this and Surgeon Sim are games with actual learning curves and the potential of mastery- Games where you can actually get better and better at them and earn your A++ rank.\n-Actually really, really hard. I'm not even joking, this game is pretty tough especially if you want high rankings.\n-Surprisingly open levels. Your goal is to become toast, but there are many different ways to do that- Making your way to a toaster is one, but you could also toast yourself inside an oven or on a BBQ. How you get to something that can make you into toast is also completely up to you, as long as it doesn't consist of crawling along dirty surfaces such as the floor- But even then, skilful play can get you across the floor with minimal damage, too.\n\nBut there's a lot of things that drag this game down, too, unfortunately.\n\n-Like Surgeon Simulator's A&E Edition it outstays its welcome. The campaign mode is at a pretty good length, but if you want 100% completion in this game it will be an incredibly painful and boring experience. They mix it up with different kinds of bread but it isn't really different enough to work particularly well. Especially with all the extra stuff they've added through updates. It's very unlikely you'll actually have the interest to play every extra level at least once.\n-The controls are actually TOO bad. Surgeon Sim is a game that appears to have bad controls to the uninitiated, but all you need to do is actually learn the controls and the controls will no longer be an obstacle to your play. I Am Bread, on the other hand, doesn't appear to have that quality- No matter how good you get the game's physics engine will still screw you over at times because your very movement is dependent on the game's physics engine. This may have been because of the fact I didn't use a controller but I still feel like even movement felt more difficult than it needed to be.\n-Once again, it may be because I didn't use a controller, but those zero-gravity levels... UGH.\n-There didn't appear to be any secrets or secret levels like there were in Surgeon Simulator. Surgeon Sim had this titanic number of easter eggs and so on that were pieced together in order to discover an amazing secret level- I Am Bread doesn't have anything like that.\n\nOverall I Am Bread is IMO not as good as Surgeon Simulator was. It still manages to do what games of its type consistently fail to do but it's a downgrade to what Surgeon Sim was. It's not exactly a game I can muster up a \"Not Recommended\" rating for because it does have merit especially if this kind of game is what you're looking for, but I'd still recommend you pick up Surgeon Sim instead of this.", "timestamp_created": 1472202027, "timestamp_updated": 1472202027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462665259838104248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25070081": {"recommendationid": "25070081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279404800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1594328240}, "language": "english", "review": "err", "timestamp_created": 1471859186, "timestamp_updated": 1471859186, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447674423456192017", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25067536": {"recommendationid": "25067536", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966241880", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1676012303}, "language": "english", "review": "Simulate a piece of bread on it's wayward adventure to becoming toast.", "timestamp_created": 1471846337, "timestamp_updated": 1471846337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25061966": {"recommendationid": "25061966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106026985", "num_games_owned": 1449, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1684088390}, "language": "english", "review": "best game on steam love this game soo much but cant play for too long as my controllers all seem to keep breaking when ever i start this game", "timestamp_created": 1471816201, "timestamp_updated": 1471816201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25030891": {"recommendationid": "25030891", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981159776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1440214567}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is both hilarious and frustrating as hell!

You grab onto the bookshelf with one of your corners, and catapult yourself across the gap as hard as a piece of bread possibly can.

You're now vertical, holding on for dear life with one corner, hoping against hope that you can just maintain your grip long enough to finally become toast.  50%.  70%. 90%!  You flip around to toast the other side, feeling your grip begin to weaken.  \"NO! I WAS SO CLOSE!\" you scream inside, as you feel your victory slipping away, and finally you fall.  You now lay on the floor, in a pile of toenail clippings, inedible and unwanted - nobody likes toejam toast.\n\nYou start again, yet another slice from the same loaf.  This time, you anticipate the situation and stay on the side of the lamp, so when it finally lands, you're on top.

Make your way through a level at a snails pace, enjoying the journey, however, and victory is incredibly rewarding. Yes, the controls take getting used to, but it honestly didn't take as long as I thought to have my bread doing air-flips.\n\nOne major issue that can't be ignored; the camera is not your friend.

I won\u2019t. But I could.\n\n\n\n******************\n\n\nDue to popular demand Ive decided to add a more \u2018wholemeal\u2019 first look review for people who like that sort of thing. \n\nThe game is essential qwop combined with the floor is lava. You navigate your slice of bread around various obstacles on a quest to get yourself nicely toasted (insert your own joke there). Encountering dirty items reduces your edibility and therefore your overall score, whilst getting smothered in tasty tasty jam boosts it.\n\nThe game controls exactly how you would imagine it does. Each corner is assigned a different button which when pressed holds that edge in place apparently regardless of the surface/physics. The mouse or thumb stick flicks the bread around of can be used to nudge it around for precise movements. Practiced or naturally skilled will surely be able to cartwheel their way onto the leaderboards quickly whilst people starting out will ultimately spend more time flailing around like a dying Magicarp. Your main opponent is your own frustration.\n\nIf the play style is sounding very familiar that\u2019s because it is. Anyone who has already played Surgeon Simulator or Octodad will immediately recognise the pattern of destruction and failure. This means that behind its freshly baked exterior the game is likely to become stale fairly quickly. Like its sister games there is a big potential for fun workshop content but ultimately you cannot judge a game on what could possibly be made by fans later on.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that it is an early access game, meaning that it is essentially unfinished, although this game does feel a lot more complete than most. It is very much playable with the exception of a few minor bugs.

Yes and no is the simple answer. The more elaborated answer is a bit more... complicated.\n\nYes, I recommend it because:\n\n+ The ultimate challenge for your patience\n+ wonderful, playful music\n+ nice graphics\n+ excellent idea\n\nBut I don't recommend it because:\n\n- It's way too hard and unforgiving for its own good (imho).\n- Short soundtrack - all though lovely, I only played like 70 minutes, and I already got tired of the soundtrack\n\n\nI want to comment a little bit more elaborated on the \"too hard for its own good\"-point here. I know this game is supposed to be hard, and I know it is the ultimate challenge. But in my opinion there are too many factors that makes you fail in order for this to be fun to play. Prior to ordering this game, I was just thinking that people were too bad gamers and soar loosers for down-voting this game due to its controls and being too hard. But now I understand them.\n\nIt is hard enough to master navigating the bread; but once you learn that it's quite simple. HOWEVER, what I cannot grasp is why the most difficult aspect of this game is to get into the God forsaken toaster??? You've just been through hell to get to the toaster, and then you simply cannot get into the bloody thing. On the first story mission I mastered my skills to get to the toaster in like 3 - 4 minutes, which is quite good considering I just bought the game. But then you are rewarded by having to spend another 5 minutes to get the bread to actually go into the toaster. And that blew a fuse for me.\n\nThe second thing that makes this game too difficult is how unforgiving it is; not only do you loose edibility (health), but also have a grip-counter which is way too short/small considering how you are sometimes supposed to hang above the floor infront of a grill in order to become toasted. \n\nIt is also not rewarding enough. The grading scale in the end is way too demanding, which more often than not sends out a vibe that \"Hey, You suck ballz!\". I mean, I don't expect an A-grading for completing a mission in 10 minutes, but a D when I lost no health at all? That is just mean.\n\nSo how to \"fix\" this game in my opinion? Make it a bit more forgiving; don't make it so difficult to get into the toaster after all the hell getting to the toaster, indicate WHAT is the toaster (it is difficult enough to get to it, you should not have to search for WHAT is the toaster), and make the toast more responsive to your controlls.\n\nAll in all: If you like to torture yourself, and/or have an incredible amount of patience, this game is for you. The concept is brilliant. But considering the immense difficulty of the game I would not recommend this for the weak-minded (I guess I am a weak-minded gamer in this sense). \n\nMy final verdict is a 7/10 for being a brilliant concept with good graphics and being a game that really stays true to its intended gameplay. But NO, I don't recommend this, unless you have some serious nerves of steel and is serious about sitting hours just to get through one or two levels of the game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1459199147, "timestamp_updated": 1459199147, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566953122615814209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22110110": {"recommendationid": "22110110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249336296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1753, "last_played": 1479260800}, "language": "english", "review": "This may be one of the most awkwardly addictive games i have ever played!

If you've already seen (or played) the game, you know it challenges players by having difficult controls that makes it frustrating but also hilarious to play. In this case, they did it in pretty similar way, with important difference: You will be in control of a slice of bread that wants to get toasted. ([i]A great potential friend for toaster from Red Dwarf![/i])\n\nYes, it's a weird physics simulation game where you are trying to move bread towards a source of heat. Controls revolves around four buttons - a button for each bread's corner that makes it sticky. If you are now thinking about the movement, you have probably already thought out that all the movement is done by swinging and flinging on those stickied bread corners.\n\nI can't say it would be unexpected after Surgeon Simulator, but it's still important to say that I am Bread is a difficult game. It has a high level of difficulty, you'll be raging a lot because while you'll be trying to get to get toasted (by toaster or table lamp, for example), you'll also have to dodge all dirty and wet areas and objects. Don't even think about touching ground! It's like the floor is lava, it makes you taste bad which leads up to the game over screen. And one more thing, you have limited \"sticky timer\". You can hold on some place swinging just for a moment, then you have to lay somewhere to regain your energy for being sticky.\n\nWhile it's definitely a great game for skilled speedrunners, don't expect to get into it easily, you'll need a lot of practice to beat levels without getting dirty. Good thing is that the developers knew how begineers will suck at it, so after two times you lose a level, you'll get an option to remove the sticky timer and edibility meter (edibility is reduced by getting dirty).\n\nThe main story mode offers a classic level list with funny short story, delivered via medical reports, about a man who gets crazy because he thinks that a slice of bread is destryoing everything in his house. But there's more! There's also a cheese hunt, bagel race (probably the easiest game mode), rampage (where you have to destroy everything with baguette), zero-g (to make you even more frustrated), and free play mode.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that developers made a lot of free content for I am Bread later after release - Team Fortress 2 bread level, Goat Simulator mode (just change bread for goat) and Starch Wars mode, which is a kind of weird 3D space shooter with laser bread (referencing Star Wars, of course). Even if it's been done with the idea of cross brand marketing, I really appreciate that those updates came up for free!\n\nThe game supports keyboard and mouse or gamepad controls. While other players had problems with controllers, I played with Xbox 360 controller without any problem, haven't seen any lag through my gameplay sessions.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nI am Bread is a perfect game for those who want something silly but difficult. It requires a lot of practice to get good at it, so depending on your perseverance, it can offer you many hours of entertainment and huge self-satisfaction in the end... or a lot of frustration.

In the tiny feet of a diminutive prince, players were tasked with picking up whatever random crap was strewn around a room/house/neighborhood/city/planet as fast as you can.  It was strange, yet strangely compelling; an oddity of video games that came out of nowhere and has since been milked dry as a concept; even the original creator has distanced himself from the series.  Weird games slowly drift by the wayside as video games break way into the mainstream, and things become normal.\n\nThen, in 2015, players were tasked with playing as a slice of bread.\n\nBossa Studios, the creators of Surgeon Simulator 2013, bring us yet another bizarro creation.  As a single slice of bread, your mission in I am Bread is to get toasted by any means necessary.  Gripping the surfaces and objects around you with the corners of your bread slice (somehow\u2026), you must traverse the various rooms of a house to find that sweet embrace of heat that will get you nice and crispy.  But don\u2019t land anywhere gross or linty!  Otherwise you\u2019ll end up inedible, and what will even be the point of being toasted?  The horror of such a thought!\n\nI am Bread is utter nonsense baked into a bizarre, fluffy bun.  Yet the gameplay is so fun and goofy, oftentimes creating some of the best accidentally funniest moments of any game released this year.  Purposefully frustrating controls leave the player pulling out their hair one moment and laughing the next.  There\u2019s no escaping it.  You are bread.  And you will be toast, one way or another.

Bread, I don't feel, is anywhere near as good as SS. \n\nBread's friendship with Goat Simulator sort of reduced my minimal respect for such an original game, that is Bread. GS is an extremely buggy game that thrives off of bugs, glitching and clipping, all are annoyances of mine. Labeling weak coding and QC as an aspect of gameplay doesn't cut it for me. I felt Bread went down that route a little bit, which I don't like. \n\nPerformace of Bread is questionable. I get huge frame rate drops when the Goat destruction levels start up and also every time I break that jar of jam with the bread. Speaking of the jam, the glass containers in this game look like something from a 2005 title. They are a huge eye sore, and they are everywhere. Technology exists today that makes glass look realistic... please use it. This is a 2015 title. Even with it being from a small developer, they still have enough money to get some decent looking glass going on. 21st Century Fox is a partial owner of Bossa, there's tons of money there to get some better graphics and coding. Hopefully they go down this route as Bossa becomes more popular. I hear they're working on a MMO open-world title right now... yikes. That's a huge jump. \n\nSpeaking of graphics, it's hit or miss in each level. The few levels towards the end are the worst, visually. It doesn't make sense why this is even happened other than laziness, or they ran out of time. The game has a gradual decline in graphics the further you progress. I see tons of low res textures, a very poor sky box, background visuals look like they're from the 80's, etc. Graphics aren't everything, but they are important. \n\nSome visuals are cartoony, some are more heavily detailed.... don't mix this sh**, pick one and go with it for the whole game.\n\nThe third person camera... Christ. Yes, many games suffer from third person camera issues, especially those old GTA games, but lets get this sh** cleaned up, guys. It jumps around everywhere, clips through everything, hinders those bagel racing levels like crazy, and is poorly optimized. It pisses me off. Unity can do better. \n\nIffy physics. Props and movable objects sometimes do move around in a natural manner when you grab them or push them, but not all of the time. It's inconsistent, like the visuals. I've gotten stuck on props many times, and have had myself, and different objects bounce unnaturally in different directions, before saying to myself \"wtf is this sh**, seriously?\" \n\nNegatives aside, Bread does have its moments. I'm glad the 0 gravity mode is back from SS. It is very difficult to control, but is rewarding when you beat it. The humor is nice. The game is fun to watch. The concept is fresh. Like SS, the controls and movements have a steep learning curve, but is awesome when you get it down. \n\nLike I said previously, maybe give the game a whirl, it's pretty unique. Like SS, it requires a lot of patience. As for the questionable overall quality, Bossa: talk to Fox and get some heavy funds rolling in, hire a few more devs (get some people from big triple-A companies), get some Unity pros to work with ya'll--Unity can accomplish so, so, so much more. \n\nThanks.", "timestamp_created": 1451702638, "timestamp_updated": 1451703017, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20195965": {"recommendationid": "20195965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098301190", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1462148767}, "language": "english", "review": "A goofy game that's great to play with friends", "timestamp_created": 1451688219, "timestamp_updated": 1451688219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20189268": {"recommendationid": "20189268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170439451", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1435704329}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is crap.
