It\u2019s difficult yeah, but it\u2019s this tediousness that doesn\u2019t make it fun to play. Puzzles are mostly trial and error and some brute forcing instead of aha moments. Levels are very confined and small, making you find one very specific solution to a problem only if you make all the correct moves. Literally nothing about the game is explained to you besides how to move and undo.\nYou gotta figure out just by accident that statements can be made downwards, the \u201cIs\u201d block can be used by two things at the same time, changing an object to something else makes it stay that way instead of reverting it once the statement is broken, etc.\nIt just feels very rigid all the time and if the

Whenever I feel stuck, or incapable of accomplishing something, I think back to my time when I used to play Baba is You, and every obstacle that seemed impossible became possible. \nThere's a level in Baba is You titled \"Insulation\" that I spent about 4 hours on across 4 days. I reopened the level the next day, and solved it within 2 minutes of having it open. The joy I felt wasn't a sudden rush of euphoria, but rather feeling of fulfillment and competence. I had been working on this level for so long, I was genuinely worried that I just wasn't smart or creative enough to come up with the solution. Then, I proved myself wrong again.\nSo yeah, I would recommend the game. You can play on controller, and you can pick it up at any time.

I don't think anything I played this year was a more deeply unpleasant experience. Back when I first heard of the concept of this game, I immediately fell in love \u2013 and sure enough, I had a lot of fun in the first couple of levels. I got stuck fairly quick during my first session \u2013 probably didn't even make it past the first world. I was pretty busy at the time and chalked it up to not having the peace of mind for something like this. I made it a bit further some days later, to about 20 percent or so of the game. And already I didn't enjoy that very much. However, I still liked the idea of the game so much that I kept thinking it must be me and decided to backlog it for now.\n\nA few weeks ago I started the game up again. I had read some opinions/tips in the meantime. It's meant to be slow, you have to give it more time, think outside the box \u2013 the usual. I also repeated some of the earlier levels to make sure I wasn't getting stuck from having forgotten the lessons that were taught there. As I understand now, that was a mostly moot exercise. After completing the game I can confidently say that I will [i]never[/i] have the peace of mind for a game like this. It is incompatible with what I like about video games.\n\nWhile I do enjoy hard games quite a bit and have no problem at all retrying a level in, e.g. [i]Celeste[/i] or [i]N++[/i], for hundreds (in some cases actually thousands) of times, I need to feel [b]progress[/b]. For example by getting better with experience, i.e. starting to understand how to approach a difficult level after some attempts and then getting farther and farther with actually implementing that solution in further attempts. Or more obviously via leveling up stats from in-game XP. Or in some other way. Baba does not give me any of that. There is no progress. You either finish a level or you don't, there's no in-between. This results in just feeling stuck for most of the time. The game has no difficulty curve, it's just a wall.\n\nIt took me quite some time to figure out what I dislike so much about this game, and this lack of tangible progress is definitely at the core. But I'd also say that [i]Baba is You[/i] ultimately is very misleading \u2013 the core idea suggests that you can be creative, and change the rules. But you actually \u2013 for the most part \u2013 cannot do that. Quite the opposite, the solutions to most puzzles are extremely narrow and you have absolutely no chance of beating a level if you can't figure out this one specific way of doing things. In addition to the lack of progress in this process (having solved the five levels before doesn't help you in figuring out the solution to the current level) the game is also intentionally obtuse: By constantly switching around the fundamentals (in one level, water is not passable, in another level water is fine but grass is impassable) you don't get used to anything and basically have to start from scratch all the time. There isn't really a point to that, because it doesn't change how the puzzles themselves work. It's as if Sudoku each time used a different set of nine unique symbols, so you never get used to playing with the numbers 1 to 9 \u2013 it doesn't change how to solve it, but it prevents your brain from anchoring with something consistent.\nEven all that aside, sometimes the solutions are just ridiculously convoluted. I gave every single level a fair shot myself, even sleeping on it sometimes. But as time went on so did my patience, and I looked up quite a lot of hints and sometimes even full solutions. There's a couple of solutions where even after seeing and implementing them I still don't think they make sense or are consistent with the game at large, and rather just exist as one-trick-ponies to create some of the more \"mind-blown I can't believe the game allows you to do this\" moments. Another thing that felt really inconsistent was that even deep into the endgame, there would still often be levels that were really (comparatively) easy \u2013 because the level design mentioned above simply makes it impossible to arrange levels by difficulty in a meaningful way.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down here, because while I personally almost hate it (and think it has some objective flaws) I definitely want more games like it in the world: Doing something different and wacky. It has overwhelmingly positive reviews so a lot of people clearly have gotten something out of it \u2013 and I know how amazing it is when a game does that for you.

It's puzzles are clever and ramps up the difficulty somewhat well although not perfectly, which is impossible for a puzzle game with such a large scope. The game is mostly non-linear meaning if you're really stuck on one puzzle you could switch to a different one although I rarely did this. The best part of the game is when you get that eureka moment on a difficult puzzle and it all finally clicks into place.\n\nNeutral: The game is definitely aimed more towards very hardcore puzzle gamers which I am somewhat. I wouldn't recommend this game to a puzzle novice as it gets quite extreme quite quickly, Even for me, sometimes I thought I had solved a puzzle and then realised that wasn't even close to the answer. At times it felt like I had to dig five layers deep to find the actual solution to the puzzle which can be quite exhausting if you get a bunch of brain-numbing puzzles in a row. I managed to push through slowly but surely all the way up to the depths area. At that point, I just felt like I had had enough of the game and didn't bother searching for how to enter the meta area.

"review": "A challenging puzzle game in which you create and break rules by pushing around the words making them up.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nThe basic gameplay of Baba Is You revolves around you moving around in grid-based 2D levels and pushing around different objects. However, each level also contains words which can be similarly pushed around. When arranged in the correct way, these words will form rules, i.e., causing specified objects to move, block other objects from passing through them, act as the player character or interact with certain other objects in different ways.\n\nUsing this system, levels are set up by placing their rules within them and require you to break and/or change some of them in order to get to a winning state. What exactly constitutes this winning state can vary depending on the rules, though you most often have to touch a specific object with your own character. The gameplay is somewhat hard to define here, as the rule-system coupled with a pretty big number of words that can be used in them means the things you have to do in each level vary widely.\n\nBaba Is You has an overworld, divided into different sub-worlds. Each of these has a unique graphical theme and introduces a couple new words, centring its levels around their mechanics. Completing levels will unlock adjacent ones and allow you to progress further in the overworld once a set number of levels have been cleared.\n\nWhile the early levels are quite easy to figure out and are mostly concerned with showcasing the possibilities the rule system provides, the game\u2019s difficulty quickly picks up. Later levels take a while to even figure out, require a lot of out of the box thinking. The last world(s) step this up even further, taking the concept of what rules can do about as far as possible, which certainly left an impression on me.\n\nIn addition to the large main world, the game also includes additional level packs, introducing new mechanics and showcasing in-development levels within them. I found these to be a bit less cohesive and interesting than the main game, but they certainly provided a fresh experience with more of the established gameplay. There\u2019s also an included level editor, coming with the ability to play other players custom levels created within it. Given this, there\u2019s more than enough content in the game to keep you busy.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nBaba Is You is a unique concept executed wonderfully and has a huge amount of varied content. However, be aware that it also quickly becomes quite challenging, meaning most of the game will require great puzzle solving skills.", "timestamp_created": 1695315924, "timestamp_updated": 1695315924,

original puzzle game that delivers many hours of gameplay at the same time as adds new mechanics as you advance.\n[list]\n[*][h3]Positives[/h3]\nDiscussing the positives, first of all, the game delivers many hours of gameplay and is very challenging, while as you advance it gets harder requiring you to be witty. Secondly, the game does not need a powerful PC and does not take much disk space, being a good option to play it while you travel. Additionally, the artistic style is simple and makes it less prone to having a headache.\n[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]\nOn the negative side, the main problem is that the game is extremely hard to complete, and would be more enjoyable if it had some hints per level to make it more accessible to some people. Besides that, the soundtrack after some time can be very apalling as it some times is very loaded.\n[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]\nTo sum up, it's quite challenging and delivers many hours of challenging original levels with a simple artistic style, with unique mechanics that evolve as you play.

played. It takes a basic concept and turns it on its head, and forces you to think outside of the box, or like the box. The only obstacle in this is yourself and your inability sometimes to think about other solutions. You may know how a level is won, but are too focused on a way to do it you can't think of anything else, so an effective way to solve some of these are just looking away from it and thinking about it again.\n\nBut I would lie if I said I didn't use any hints at all. Some of the levels seemed impossible and there are great ways to get spoiler free hints as to not ruin the accomplishment. That's to say, this game is not easy, and even without testing some of the player made maps you'll find it challenging. The difficulty ramps up gradually as you'd expect, and it does a great job introducing the new mechanics. Some of them are niche and reserved for only a few levels, but most of them are used throughout the whole game.\n\nIt's not a short game, either. They really made the most of it. There's more levels in this game than you can ever expect. And I mean that in a very literal sense. Each time you think you've beaten the game, you're proven wrong. None of the levels seem out out place either, but some of them are tougher than others when it feels like they shouldn't be. But generally speaking, you're going through them in a very logical order and your understanding of the game increases with each level completed.\n\nIf you're at all interested in the game, do get it.

Lleva los puzzles a otro nivel distinto con una mec\u00e1nica muy simple: hacer frases para que se cumplan en el juego. Voy a hablar mucho, as\u00ed que por si acaso quieres llegar fresco al juego, no leas a partir de aqu\u00ed. Ahora s\u00ed, empecemos.\n\nBaba is You es un juego que nos propone puzzles en los que nosotros cambiamos la forma de jugarlos. Puede sonar raro, pero vamos a poner ejemplos. Hay 3 tipos de bloques: los de objetos (como Baba o Rock), los \"intermediarios\" (Is, And...) y la acci\u00f3n (Push, Win). Alineando estos de diferentes maneras, conseguiremos que los objetos interact\u00faen de esa manera. No s\u00e9 como ser\u00e1 el c\u00f3digo del juego, pero tiene una cantidad absurda de interacciones. Todo puede ser o hacer de todo. Al principio es simple, disponiendo de pocos bloques, pero al final, se vuelve en un quebradero de cabeza, pero lo hace tan bien que es dif\u00edcil criticarlo. Pero esa abrumaci\u00f3n es precisamente lo que m\u00e1s quita al juego. Al haber tantas interacciones, el juego solo te ense\u00f1a unas pocas, por lo que la soluci\u00f3n a muchos puzzles se siente extra\u00f1a y frustrante por lo poco intuitiva que es.\n\nTodo en los puzzles est\u00e1 pensado. La mayor\u00eda de niveles tienen bloques que no pueden ser intercambiados, por si acaso se nos ocurre cambiar las condiciones que hacen dif\u00edcil al puzzle, por lo que la dificultad aumenta much\u00edsimo, pero sin sentirse forzado. Esto sumado al dise\u00f1o de nivel de cada puzzle, que se amolda perfectamente a todas las caracter\u00edsticas anteriormente mencionadas.\n\nAudiovisualmente, es simple pero funcional. El estilo art\u00edstico es uno muy simple y la OST no es nada destacable. No est\u00e1 mal, pero es bastante simple, por lo que no rinde homenaje a la jugabilidad que es m\u00e1s dura a veces que una roca hecha de Nokias.\n\nComo la historia es como un coche volador (todos queremos, pero no existe), Baba is You es un juegazo que si te gustan los juegos de puzzles debes jugar. Para jugarlo necesitar\u00e1s ser muy resolutivo con poco, pero no veas lo bien que sienta completar sus acertijos.

There are some surprising, and in my opinion very funny, hidden \"easter eggs\" (they are technically part of the main game but are miss-able if you're not experimental) that are interesting. The rules across all levels are consistent but do require experimentation to figure out.\n\nI do think the game should have a little more handholding or an easily accessible way to test new knowledge (the level designer is very good for this, but runs into the issue that it's easy to spoil yourself for things you haven't encountered yet). But compared to some other popular puzzle games, I almost never get annoyed after solving a puzzle. (A good, uncontroversial counter example is old point-and-click adventures where you realize the solution was some stray pixel that you couldn't figure out without outside help or an immense amount of patience).\n\nI think if the screenshots look appealing to you, it's worth getting. If you're on the fence, it might be worth getting on sale (usually 25-30% off during the major sale seasons).", "timestamp_created": 1693367611, "timestamp_updated": 1693367611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145285786": {"recommendationid": "145285786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007749039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1694916960}, "language": "english", "review": "The puzzles where there are multiple ways of completing it are good fun but the ones where you need to do everything exactly in sequence are frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1693345454, "timestamp_updated": 1693345454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145285754": {"recommendationid": "145285754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124918717", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 5895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5463, "last_played": 1698419896}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is Good.", "timestamp_created": 1693345426, "timestamp_updated": 1693345426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145284366": {"recommendationid": "145284366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067911631", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1448, "last_played": 1683124906}, "language": "english", "review": "baba is best", "timestamp_created": 1693343529, "timestamp_updated": 1693343529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145271932": {"recommendationid": "145271932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200222417", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1693349946}, "language": "english", "review": "Thinking is scary", "timestamp_created": 1693328922, "timestamp_updated": 1693328922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145267963": {"recommendationid": "145267963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056844412", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1693770822}, "language": "english", "review": "Ollie was Oliver", "timestamp_created": 1693324857, "timestamp_updated": 1693324857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145264982": {"recommendationid": "145264982", "author": {"steamid": "76561199118477152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3151, "last_played": 1693531647}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not a gamer.

"language": "english", "review": "[I]Baba is You[/I] is a hard game. It starts off simple enough, but the difficulty ramps up somewhat quickly \u2013 though, with fairness. It\u2019s also a long game, reportedly with over 200 puzzles in total. At the time of this review, I\u2019ve only solved 51 puzzles (with help) and unlocked the first of two endings.\n\nWhat I particularly enjoyed about [I]Baba is You[/I] is the hacker spirit it embodies. You solve each puzzle or level by manipulating the level\u2019s rules, which are formed by tiles of nouns (e.g., \u201cBaba\u201d, \u201crock\u201d, \u201cwall\u201d), operators (e.g., \u201cis\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201cnot\u201d) and properties (e.g., \u201cmove\u201d, \u201cpush\u201d, \u201cwin\u201d). By moving and swapping these tiles, you can change the rules, and modify your environment, yourself and the conditions for winning. There are often multiple solutions to each puzzle, making the game highly replayable.\n\nIt was very satisfying to solve a puzzle on my own after taking the level apart so to speak, putting it back together with new rules, and making the environment work to my advantage. By the second sub-world, I started to need help. [I]Baba is You[/I] is not a casual brainteaser (well, for me anyway), and demands (pretty much) your full attention each time you play it.\n\nAlthough [I]Baba is You[/I] is fun and delightfully challenging, I found it too long, too daunting, and in some ways too repetitive. Right now, I want a game that is quick to pick up and put down, and casual to play but not overly easy; one that can be played in short bursts and completed in several hours. [I]Baba is You[/I] [B]IS[/B] that type of puzzle game in the first couple of sub-worlds, but not once you\u2019ve reached sub-world 3 (of 10).\n\nSo while I\u2019m a not a genius and couldn\u2019t breeze through this game in several hours, I still recognize it as a gem. Another way of looking at its long length, high difficulty and large number of puzzles is that you know this game is of great value even at regular price.\n\n[I]Baba is You[/I] is one of those games that I\u2019ll chip away at once in a while if I find myself in between games or bored with one. I recommend you adding it to your collection \u2013 power through it or work at it a bit at time, whichever suits your play and lifestyle \u2013 and enjoy the fun and challenges it offers. It may just be one of the best and more stimulating games you\u2019ll play yet.", "timestamp_created": 1692280177, "timestamp_updated": 1692280177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670169532299041748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144399865": {"recommendationid": "144399865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337190300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 7729, "last_played": 1700088462}, "language": "english", "review": "Without a doubt the most enjoyable and mind-melting puzzle game I ever played, music takes this game from excellent to unforgettable, truly a genius game!", "timestamp_created": 1692268827, "timestamp_updated": 1692268827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144289127": {"recommendationid": "144289127", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223048422", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 757, "last_played": 1692132461}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Incredibly hard, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you wanna fry your brains for a good 80 hours (I got all the achievements seeing a guide in youtube), I'm probably barely or never gonna play this game again, it is exhausting.

interesting interactions such as Chip's Challenge. In Baba Is You, the rules of the game are the blocks you can push, resulting in some crazy puzzles. Not only is the idea really innovative and unique, but the sheer quantity and quality of puzzles is amazing. It is a very hard game, but it still has a pretty good learning curve as there are easier levels spread throughout to teach you how certain blocks work, and then further levels to get you to question that. Many advanced levels build on things you did to solve previous levels, so if you're ever stuck (and you will be), there are always plenty of other levels to play around with and think about.\n\nI don't recommend using a solution guide for any puzzle game, but for Baba Is You, I REALLY don't recommend it. My mind was blown so many times while playing through and it is an incredibly satisfying experience. Just when you think you've seen it all, the game gets even deeper. For the best experience, do as much as you can without any outside help. I had to come back months later to recharge my brain and then when I started to make a certain amount of progress, I couldn't stop playing. In fact, I skipped dozens of levels and had to go back to them later because I just kept getting pulled further and further in a different direction :) If you're really stuck on a specific puzzle for hours and hours, there's a very helpful no-spoiler hint site that I recommend, but I only recommend it for specific puzzles that you're currently accessing. It orders the hints in terms of helpfulness too, so it helps to confirm if you're thinking about the level in a good way. Try to avoid hints on where to go next though, as doing so may sour the experience. Explore! \n\nNot only does the main game have a staggering amount of well-designed levels, but there are free official level packs that add new interactions, objects, and levels. There is also a level editor, and since the community is so huge and full of very clever puzzle designers, there is practically an endless amount of content. \n\nI'm writing this review before I'm truly done the game, but having experienced a good majority of it. Some puzzles are just so insanely hard to think about and I feel like I can keep coming back to this game whenever I need a puzzle, even after the main game. Hopefully the Scenic Pond will fall eventually :^)\n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1691534331, "timestamp_updated": 1691536291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758798837661743164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143658350": {"recommendationid": "143658350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013456198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 141, "last_played": 1691507362}, "language": "english", "review": "Satisfying puzzle game that requires lateral thinking", "timestamp_created": 1691507378, "timestamp_updated": 1691507378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143657029": {"recommendationid": "143657029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069434681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1691352048}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\ude2d", "timestamp_created": 1691505975, "timestamp_updated": 1691505975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143645009": {"recommendationid": "143645009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365763561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1691997335}, "language": "english", "review": "best puzzle game ever", "timestamp_created": 1691490518, "timestamp_updated": 1691490518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143643151": {"recommendationid": "143643151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310938363", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 806, "last_played": 1700049343}, "language": "english", "review": "you wont last 5 minutes playing this game", "timestamp_created": 1691487739, "timestamp_updated": 1691487739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143589533": {"recommendationid": "143589533", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015971124", "num_games_owned": 995, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2186, "last_played": 1696514210}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is based on an old sokoban game. But instead of having objects with fixed properties, such as you can only push rock, you have special text blocks, which placed in particular order define rules. The name of the game \"Baba is You\" actually shows three of the blocks that when placed correctly mean that you control Baba. What makes this puzzle interesting is that by moving the text blocks around, you can change the winning condition, or what objects you control, or can walk through. There are several different interactions between objects and more varieties of text blocks introduced in latter puzzles. This keeps the game interesting and requires you to come up with new and unique ways to solve the puzzle that have not been used earlier.\n\nMost puzzles range from moderate to very hard. I'm still stuck on a few of them. But you are not required to finish every single puzzle to progress or finish the game. You can actually skip a lot of puzzles and return to them later.\n\nI definitely recommend this unique game to anyone who likes puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1691416088, "timestamp_updated": 1691416088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143589346": {"recommendationid": "143589346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198810699499", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1691415767}, "language": "english", "review": "great concept, bad execution", "timestamp_created": 1691415885, "timestamp_updated": 1691415885, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.390857577323913574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143588800": {"recommendationid": "143588800", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215571799", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 9540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8079, "last_played": 1698078796}, "language": "english", "review": "no one knows how keke is spelled like", "timestamp_created": 1691415237, "timestamp_updated": 1691415237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143567116": {"recommendationid": "143567116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161876686", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1700201258}, "language": "english", "review": "even though i havent played much of baba is you i can say that is it such a unique and amazing puzzle game where you have to think out of the box and it makes it feel like you are the one making your own solution to each puzzle", "timestamp_created": 1691381187, "timestamp_updated": 1691381187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143561032": {"recommendationid": "143561032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335203274", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4239, "last_played": 1697412255}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game; if only finland were real...", "timestamp_created": 1691371609, "timestamp_updated": 1691371609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143537500": {"recommendationid": "143537500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880453653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 6255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6255, "last_played": 1581801476}, "language": "english", "review": "played it for a bit, I guess its pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1691344303, "timestamp_updated": 1691344303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143521100": {"recommendationid": "143521100", "author": {"steamid": "76561199022728782", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1694835847}, "language": "english", "review": "BABA IS YOU\nDESIGN IS INTERESTING\nGAME IS CHALLENGING\nI AM DUMB", "timestamp_created": 1691327943, "timestamp_updated": 1691327943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143511083": {"recommendationid": "143511083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306198735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2116, "last_played": 1680821437}, "language": "english", "review": "The concept of this game is absolutely genius.

It's a puzzle game by Arvi \"Hempuli\" Teikari where the rules are literally part of the game world, and you get to remix them to solve each stage.\n\nThe puzzles are set in small 2D spaces with various objects, characters, and words that define the rules. For example, you start with a white rabbit (Baba), a yellow flag, and some rocks between two walls. The rules written on the stage include \"Baba Is You,\" \"Flag Is Win,\" \"Wall Is Stop,\" and \"Rock Is Push.\"\n\nNow, the cool part is that every word on the screen is a movable tile. So you can rearrange them to your advantage. For instance, you can push the \"Win\" tile to change \"Rock Is Push\" to \"Rock Is Win,\" and now you can complete the puzzle by touching the rock.\n\nOr, you can change \"Wall Is Stop\" to \"Wall Is\" by removing \"Stop,\" allowing your bunny to walk through the walls. There's a bunch of creative ways to manipulate the rules to your benefit.\n\nBaba Is You finds joy in the concept of rules, which might sound odd at first. But rules are the backbone of great games\u2014they create predictability and help us master the game's mechanics. In Baba Is You, you not only see the rules but also get to modify them, prompting you to question your assumptions about how games should work.\n\nI love how this game challenges me to think differently. Sometimes, when I'm stuck on a puzzle, I take a break, do something else, and suddenly, the solution clicks in my mind. It's like the game encourages me to reprogram my brain and look at rules in a whole new light.\n\nWith over 200 puzzles, I'm about 50 deep, and I can't wait to finish them all. Baba Is You is not only a fantastic game, but it's also inspiring me to rethink the rules in other games I love. It's a refreshing experience in a world where so many games demand constant attention.", "timestamp_created": 1690170358, "timestamp_updated": 1690170358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929101943969727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142663408": {"recommendationid": "142663408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196583333", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1690135399}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've taken a look at other reviews, you'll see this game is almost universally loved.

Combine that with the fact that the rules are easy to learn, and you are encouraged to break them as soon as you learn them, and Baba Is You has all the markings of a fun, novel puzzle game. So why the thumbs-down? Because the novelty quickly wears off.\n\nA lot of people, whether they love it or hate it, will talk about how the game is deceptively hard. Take a quick glance around the community hub and you'll see testaments of players spending days (literal days) on a single level. Whether or not this appeals to you is entirely subjective, but it is worth noting. \n\nMy main issue is that Baba Is You is presented as a game where you can break all the rules, but it soon becomes apparent that you are breaking only the rules that the developer wants you to break. This doesn't lead to creative, unique solutions to the puzzles. It leads to one single solution for any given puzzle, a sequence so complex and restrictive that if you do not follow each step to the letter you will not beat the level.\n\nWhat this means is that you don't have a game that capitalizes on some wild new concept, you have a game that plays like every other puzzle game on the market.", "timestamp_created": 1690141855, "timestamp_updated": 1691130572, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569897890090942383", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142625972": {"recommendationid": "142625972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198841270249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1692220441}, "language": "english", "review": "amazin game", "timestamp_created": 1690092627, "timestamp_updated": 1690092627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142622856": {"recommendationid": "142622856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271938896", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1670172308}, "language": "english", "review": "hardest version of scrabble ive ever played", "timestamp_created": 1690087073, "timestamp_updated": 1690087073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142598717": {"recommendationid": "142598717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015368658", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1690578653}, "language": "english", "review": "This so good and fresh puzzle game!

I'm writing this review after beating every level available currently[spoiler]( 231 in total)[/spoiler]. I'll also say that I had to look up the solution to a few levels, because some levels didn't make sense to me even after knowing the solution, which I'll elaborate on later in the review.\n\nWHAT IS BABA\n\nBaba is You is a Sokoban* -like game where your goal is to rearrange words to satisfy or create a winning condition by establishing rules.\u00a0\nThe most common are :\u00a0\nBABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN, meaning if Baba(you) occupies the same tile as Flag(win), the level is considered completed, but you could swap the words and make :\u00a0\nFLAG IS YOU and BABA IS WIN meaning that your goal now is to reach Baba as Flag to win.\nThroughout the game, you will encounter more words and more possible combinations to solve levels.\n\nGAME IS PLAY\n\nAs already stated, the game is divided into singular levels and most of them can be solved in under a minute if the player knows the solution. The levels are accessed on a world map, represented by an island. You can move around the world map and travel to different zones, which serve as hubs*\u00b2. The game does not require you to finish every level to advance to the next area. Upon entering a hub, you can always see the number of levels required to unlock a \"key item\". New zones are unlocked by just having a certain amount of \"key items\", so the player doesn't need to decide which area they want to unlock next.\n\nTHING IS GOOD\n\n[list]\n[*]One of my personal favorite things in the game is it's art style, as everything in the game is easy to identify and understand, with the added bonus of being able to run on almost any computer.\n[*]Levels where new mechanics are introduced are easy and let you play around with the rules to give you a basic understanding of them.\n[*]The \"undo\" button helps a lot, since it's easy to make a mistake in the game and not having to restart the entire level each time is great.\n[*]Most levels are designed pretty well and sometimes give hints on how to solve them, without it being shoved in your face and looking unnatural.[/list]\n\nTHING IS BAD\n\n[list]\n[*]The difficulty of the game is insane in some cases; it ramps up from some levels so quickly, that you don't even have time to learn how to use a mechanic properly and the game already expects you to know every possible interaction.*\u00b3\n[*]A few words have the issue of being hard to use or comprehend, as the introductory level only shows you a few possible interactions, which makes the easy introductory levels a double-edged sword.\n[*]Some levels verge on trial and error, as some mechanics don't seem possible when you first encounter them.\nThere are some interactions in the game that look like the dev was just messing around in a sandbox trying to find the most obscure interactions possible and made them into a level without giving you the opportunity to see them in action.\n\n[*]Now, my personal biggest problem with the game is the cumulation of the above to some extent:\nYou would think a game about breaking rules and remaking them would have a lot of freedom for making solutions, but it's the exact opposite; after a certain point in the game, you are restrained from doing the majority of interactions.\u00a0\nIf you somehow manage to find an unintended solution, chances are that the dev will just update the level to make that solution not possible anymore, meaning the game turns from \"think outside the box\" to \"think inside the developer's box; otherwise, you're just exploiting the game's mechanics\".\nIn my personal opinion, you should have the decency as a puzzle developer to admit when you have been outsmarted, but I guess changing the level to make your solution the only one is sort of meta in a twisted way.[/list]\n\nTHOUGHTS IS FINAL\n\nAs you see, I've written a lot more about the negative aspects of the game, but I still do recommend it, as it is a very unique game and despite all the issues with it, I still had a lot of fun with it, and the feeling of being a genius after solving a level is more than worth the frustration in some parts.\n\nREVIEW IS END\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* \u00a0- Sokoban (eng. \"warehouse keeper\") from 1982 is also known as a \"Box pushing\" puzzle game where you have to push a box on a specific tile on the map. Many games since it's original release have implemented it as a mini-game; a lot of these games are of Japanese origin.\n\n*\u00b2 \u00a0- Hub refers to a zone that houses a set of levels with the same visual aesthetic and theme; these levels quite often introduce a new word or mechanic that is expanded upon throughout the entire zone and the rest of the game in some cases.\n\n*\u00b3\u00a0 - Queue all the people saying :\"Maybe the game is too hard for you.\" or \"You are just mad cuz bad\", even though almost all of them didn't even finish the game or didn't even finish every level in most zones (according to Steam achievements at least), meaning they have no frame of reference of how hard the levels in this game can get.", "timestamp_created": 1689844501, "timestamp_updated":

[20/20\u2b50, 60h\ud83c\udfc5 (+40+??\ud83c\udfc5 level packs), 5/5\ud83d\udca1]\n\n[b]Context[/b] Baba is You is a \u201csokoban-style\u201d game where the player controls the properties of all objects in the map. This was not my first run at Baba Is You, I had already completed it back when it came out. But this one still feels special to me, a game so ambitious on its mechanics that it\u2019s surprising it actually works - of course, mostly due to ingenious level design. And, the cherry on top, since I last played free level packs with new mechanics were released that effectively doubled the play time, as well as a level-sharing functionality making it potentially endless.\n\n[b]Writing[/b] There is no actual plot in the game, just some thematically connected areas with different palettes. You can\u2019t even say that (a) BABA is the main character, since by the very nature of the game, everything can (and will) be a playable character. Which doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t feel for the little guy, as he looses its identity, is destroyed, pushed around, duplicated or transformed (it\u2019s not as gory as I\u2019ve made it sound really).\n\n[b]Aesthetics[/b] The visuals are simplistic, but due to the huge collection of objects it allows for levels with interesting contexts. The wobble effect can get a bit annoying after long play sessions, but can be disabled. The soundtrack is also pretty cool and low key, but inevitably also gets tiring after hours of play (I can\u2019t count the days I\u2019ve spent with different tracks playing on repeat in my head).\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] To put it shortly, each level has a set of objects whose properties are determined by rules that can themselves manipulated in the level. To win, you have to move an object with property YOU (that you can control) into an object with the property WIN. Other objects are affected by a myriad of properties that can be either obstacles or solutions (e.g., STOP objects will block you, PUSH objects can be pushed, MOVE objects move on their own), and solving a level requires both manipulating the objects and the rules affecting them. Rules can also be combined with other rules and have conditions attached. And this applies both to the levels as well as to the world maps, with meta-consequences that I won\u2019t spoil here.\n\nIf this sounds crazy, well, it is. Baba is You is the hardest grid-base game I\u2019ve played, and probably the hardest purely deductive game (won\u2019t compare with those with exploration elements as it\u2019s a different kind of challenge). But it is also incredible fun and satisfying. As all great puzzle games, levels are usually small enough to just require a small eureka step, and not convoluted solutions. Even in the cases where you have to identify bizarre corner cases (such as the order of application of rules), the levels are simple enough that you quickly realize there\u2019s something tricky you\u2019re missing. But this is also a game that should not be rushed - at least I couldn\u2019t. There were often times where I was stuck on all open levels and had to take a break (the game is rather non-linear with multiple worlds open at a time, exploring different mechanics). You can die and hit deadends in a level, but can always undo indefinitely or restart; progress is auto-saved, but the state of each level is not saved.\n\nThe New Adventures level pack is also amazing, featuring both worlds playing around with new weird properties which are pretty fun, and extremely challenging worlds that just build on already existing properties. The Museum level pack has variants of the levels from the main game and levels that were left out by the developer, and has director comments (which I didn\u2019t find particularly interesting to be honest).\n\n[b]Value[/b] I cannot stress enough the value of this game. On the second playthrough I still spent ~50 hours in the >250 levels of the main game (which was for sure higher on my first run); the >150 levels of New Adventures added further 40h of gameplay; I haven\u2019t completed the Museum since I needed a rest from the game, but probably adds a dozen more. (This is without counting the hours spent daydreaming about possible solutions.) And I didn\u2019t even explore the user-designed levels, since the game now features a level editor and a level sharing functionality. You can always revisit previous levels, and there are multiple progress slots. There are multiple endings depending on how far you progress in the game. Achievements are unlocked as you progress the game, and don't really add anything to the experience, and require a single playthrough.\n\n[quote][i]For more puzzle-game reviews and curated lists check

The satisfaction of figuring out these brain teasers is unmatched, and you'll find yourself grinning from ear to ear as you celebrate each triumph.\n\nWhat truly sets Baba is You apart is the sheer brilliance of its craftsmanship.

The way the words interact with each other and the environment is pure genius, creating an ever-evolving playground of possibilities. It's a testament to the power of game design when even the simple act of rearranging words can ignite a spark of creativity and discovery.\n\nPrepare to lose track of time as you immerse yourself in the whimsical world of Baba is You. The charming pixel art, coupled with a delightful soundtrack, creates a warm and inviting atmosphere that draws you in and keeps you engaged. It's a game that encourages experimentation and rewards curiosity, making each \"Aha!\" moment all the more satisfying.\n\nSo, if you're ready to embark on a hilarious and brain-bending adventure, look no further than Baba is You. With its clever wordplay, challenging puzzles, and undeniable charm, it's a must-play for puzzle enthusiasts and wordsmiths alike.

starting levels are promising but the game stops being fun when \"hacks\" become the norm.\n\nAs far as I have played, there are 2 game logic rules which allow some things to float or overlap with each other.\nWhenever there seems to be no solution, I remember these rules and brute-force and backtrack which things can overlap, so that I can get back to the sokoban, places switching and cloning parts.\nOverlapping breaks how the game looks visually and it forces an unnatural 3d axis of puzzle solving which breaks the appeal.\nPeople use float and noclip cheats to avoid gameplay in other games. Baba is you considers it a puzzle-solving feature.\n\nEvery level has a pretty much hard-coded solution. This would not be bad if you were not given the illusion you are in a solvable state. In sokobans, if you put a box against an edge, the game might still continue. If you place it in a corner and that was not the goal, you clearly can't play anymore. In Baba is you though, there are invisible impossible-to-solve states and the game does nothing to highlight them.\nTo make matters worse, the \"undo or try again\" message gives the illusion that it can detect a game-cannot-be-finished scenario. It only shows complete failure though. If you destroyed the only item which could have solved the puzzle or blocked it as part of your solution, you can spend the rest of eternity fiddling with the rest of the items.\n\nI was going to grudgingly play the game to finish it just to see all the mechanics but I got to the wireless connection level.

Flag can be Death. Skull can be Sink. There are zero conventional limits. The only things that can stop you are the map geometry and your own imagination.\nYou'll use this incredibly cool idea to solve some of the toughest puzzles I've ever seen, and progress through the heartwarming, fun, and strange world of Baba.

But chances are my praise of the game will blend in with the woodwork too because of that \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" by the review count! Which is well-deserved, by the way.\n\nThe game is so simple to pick-up that the bare-bones trailer tells you everything about how it's played through a few simple movements and no descriptions whatsoever; how can I possibly beat that? If you've ever played FLUXX, the card game that's all about altering the rules and win conditions to your advantage, this game is kind of like that! You create simple phrases by pushing word blocks together which change your OR other objects' OR even the geography's appearance, traits, and movements on the fly to create pathways, traverse obstacles, and form other phrases, ultimately working your way to (or even creating if necessary) the goal.\n\nIt's so approachable and easy to jump into or out of at a moment's notice because it loads quickly, and while it can take you hours to figure out how to solve a single puzzle, once you figure out the solution, it can be done from start to finish in less than a minute. And if you make a mistake, you can undo as many movements as you like with the press of a button. And you will use it a lot, because rearranging phrases in ways that breaks your control or removes an essential object from the field is all part of the experimentation process.\n\nIt's a ton of fun priced just right. And don't be daunted by people saying \"IT'S SO DIFFICULT\" or the associated tag, I assure you the puzzles are clever and fair-- some just have an extra amount of cleverness to them. And my advice is if you're ever feeling like a puzzle requires an extensive, complex Rube Goldberg machine of words and objects all synergizing with precision timing and positioning to solve it, chances are you're overthinking it.

Baba is You is the latest gift from the Finnish game development Gods housed in the frame of one man: Arvi Teikari.

Brutal not in the sense of a monster you\u2019ve created murdering your fianc\u00e9 but that the obstacles in the game and their levels of abstraction are tough. It goes without saying that despite Baba is You\u2019s cute aesthetics, the puzzles become immensely complex as you progress. \n\nIn order to lessen the mental burden upon the player, so one can avoid the fatal conclusion of \u201cI ain\u2019t playing that\u201d, Teikari designed the entire game around working backwards from the solution. This easier-said-than-done concept is the the game itself, from the numerous ways one can tackle the very first puzzle to the meta-insanity of the final worlds. Perhaps the game should have been titled \"Baba is Creative\", though that does not pique interest nor is it fun to say out loud, but it is the principal theme of the game: there's as much freedom as one would expect from immersive sims. I could go on and on about how the design should be the poster child of the overused term \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d, but that\u2019s not what matters.

There are many levels in this game where I have to stop, take my hands off the keyboard, and think about the puzzle, or I might figure out the solution while taking a break from the game.\nThe developer also added in the ability to create and distribute custom levels, which makes the possible play time effectively infinite.

The concept is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical logic most of the levels will go over a typical player's head.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these puzzles, to realise that they're not just challenging- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Baba is You truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Baba's existential catchphrase \"Flag is Win\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02And yes, by the way, i DO have a Baba is You tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

This is fairly clever, which strikes me as odd, because one would hope a clever developer would understand that PC gamers don't like mobile pixel trash very much, and would understand the basic minimum requirements games should satisfy to be accepted. [list][/list]From a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.[list][/list]The artwork here is terrible, it's a blend of old retro pixel \"art\" used as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics, and some of the most amateurish MS-Paint style drawings I've ever seen.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget to arrange someone who can do graphics properly, or lack of talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result of these decisions.[list][/list]There's no options to change the resolution for the mobile app or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this mobile app is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this mobile app will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality mobile phone graphics. [list][/list]Bewilderingly, the mobile app doesn't include proper audio controls, so you can't turn off the annoying background music, you'll need to alt+tab out and stop the music using the Windows sound mixer.  This is obviously not okay and it's unclear why the developers chose not to include this basic feature.[list][/list]The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the mobile app unplayable for differently-abled gamers.[list][/list]Because this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.[list][/list]Some of the defects in the mobile app can be attributed to the choice of using the Clickteam Multimedia Fusion construction kit - the \"No-Code\" construction kit that \"Anyone can make games with!!\".  Including, you know, people who aren't game developers.  Which is a problem.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.[list][/list]These technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.[list][/list]Once more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is an eyewatering $15 USD, on app stores, it's less than $7. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH for a cheap mobile app just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  For comparison, $15 USD would get you The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, Hollow Knight, or Subnautica.  The developer genuinely thinks this construction kit MS-Paint garbage is as good as The Witcher III, so pay up!  [list][/list]This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this is a mobile app, is priced to insult and gouge PC gamers, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.

is you is wonderful, but massively overstayed its welcome. \n\n[b][u]General Thoughts/Overview:[/u][/b]\n\nBuckle up kids, it\u2019s angry ranting time. \n\nIt was at 2:30am, as I contained my frustration and silently screamed \u201cWhy won\u2019t you just end?!\u201d at my screen, five \u2018secret maps\u2019 deep into what I had assumed was the last hurrah, that I realised the simple truth in an old adage: You [i][b]CAN[/b][/i] have \u2018too much of a good thing\u2019. \n\nBaba Is You is a simple yet somehow adorable little tile shifting puzzle game, where the short sentences you form change the rules of the game. Make objects pushable, pullable, floating, moving, and more in your quest to complete the level, generally by getting to a flag. \n\nIt\u2019s quaint and enjoyable at first, frustrating and enraging second. On the overworld I completed about 50% of the levels by eye, 25% with hints, and 25% I needed a walkthrough. This diminished by around 15% per \u2018secret map\u2019 until I found myself fervently reading walkthroughs [i]just to find the next secret map[/i] all in my quest to just finish the damned game.\n\nI [i]never[/i] felt like I finished the game. Part of that was the fact that by the end I was just following guides, and is entirely on me, but the main part of the issue for me was the lack of telegraphing that the game had ended\u2026 If I had discovered the flowers were collectable in \u2018a way out\u2019 before reading up on how to get my last achievement \u2018finish the game\u2019, and I\u2019d seen those credits\u2026 I\u2019d have stopped a good 10 hours earlier, barely needed a guide, and this review would most likely be positive\u2026 but I didn\u2019t, and it isn\u2019t. \n\nBaba Is You is a band on its 23rd encore, which has outlasted the set, the diehard fans are all that\u2019s left, still screaming for more, the majority have gone home not wanting to miss the buses and trains, there\u2019re some angry clean-up crews trying to get the band off stage because they\u2019re already four hours behind schedule, and there\u2019s a sound engineer that called his wife during the first encore to say he\u2019d be home soon and is regretting his life choices. And then there are a couple of bored teens, sat near the back while their dad sits behind them, arms crossed as he makes them wait, \u201cI paid for these tickets and you\u2019ll damned well endure the entire show.\u201d he says, every time they try to head home.  \n\nI am both that dad and those kids, who will probably never listen to the band they were fans of again.  \nAnyway, angry ranting aside, let\u2019s take a look at the pros and cons. \n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] There is an absolute [i]sea[/i] of levels in Baba Is You. If you want a big ol\u2019 helping, this game has you covered.\n[*] The music is fitting and the art style pleasant. The ambience of the game is just delightful.\n[*] The feeling of accomplishment when you crack a particularly hard level on your own is just unreal. This game knows how to crank up the frustration so that sweet, sweet victory is all the sweeter. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] Many of the levels are extremely frustrating, with very specific paths to solving them. \n[*] Many mechanics are obtuse, with some being outright irritating to try and get a hold of.\n[*] The difficulty curve of this game looks like my elevated fucking heart rate. It\u2019s up and down so much you\u2019d get neck ache if you tried to follow it. There is a very fine line between fun difficult and purposefully obtuse, and Baba Is You misses that line far more often than it hits. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]\n [list][*] At each of the map sections, there needs to be a game over screen. An actual one, not one gated behind flowers or puzzles, a simple, \u2018baba is you is complete\u2019 Bam roll credits, give a total completion score so the diehard fans can dig for more secrets. This would break the game up in such a way that people could more easily walk away from it. I don\u2019t care so much if it isn\u2019t 100% completed, I just want to feel like it\u2019s reached [i][b]some kind[/b][/i] of definitive end. Even after finally seeing the credits, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s over because of the way the game is set up. \n[*] Some sort of internal hint system\u2026 possibly one that can only be used once per level for each area you have 100% completed, giving a snowball effect as you travel, and making things a little easier along the way, flatten out that curve, if you will. \n[*] There really shouldn\u2019t be any \u201chow the hell could [i]anyone[/i] have seen and figured this out?\u201d moments in a game. That\u2019s indicative of poor design, if you\u2019re tying it to an actual ending. If it\u2019s a secret set of levels outside of the main game? Sure. But not in the main game, these moments really need to be eliminated to give the experience as a whole a more polished and positive feel.  \n[/list]\n\n\n[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]\n\nBaba is you is a great concept, a fun game, and an incredible challenge. \nIt\u2019s just taken too far. \n\nOnce again it\u2019s a very personal thing. I\u2019m a person who over eats at an all you can eat buffet. \u201cI paid for this and I\u2019ll damn well eat till I can\u2019t.\u201d Is that the games fault? No. But it does mean I don\u2019t want to recommend it. \nThis game is not for completionists. It is not for people who want to feel smart. It is not for people who want stories or progression arcs. It is not for people who are easily frustrated. \n\nBaba is you is for hard core puzzle enthusiasts. \n\nFor everyone else, Baba is you is good for a few hours. If you can just walk away from it when it\u2019s gotten too much and not care too much about what feels like a half finished game, then you\u2019ll also enjoy this. \nFor me? It was about 20 hours too long. It overstayed its welcome. It didn\u2019t end. It probably never will.", "timestamp_created": 1679563366, "timestamp_updated": 1679563419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39087948203086853", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135214245": {"recommendationid": "135214245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120917352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2069, "last_played": 1696263543}, "language": "english", "review": "Very creative and well made puzzle game.

Filament is a good example of this. The rules of each room must be deduced, but the mechanics are not hidden from the player, you know you can't cross the filament\u00a0and you know it is always extruded when you move.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, many games get lazy in this department and they choose to start hiding mechanics from the player\u00a0in order to make the game \"harder\". It's obfuscation\u00a0confused for challenge, and it's a chronic problem in many puzzle games.\u00a0\n\nAnd it's a problem that BIY dips into its fair share of times by hiding particular mechanics and depending on one simply guessing at it to learn them (spoiler: [spoiler] like two SHIFT objects stacked will act as a move object ... why? and where was that at all telegraphed?? [/spoiler]). \u00a0\n\nAdd to that the inherently cheap Sokoban mechanic, which is another example of lazy puzzle making, and you have a combination that is mildly annoying at the initial levels, but begins to get exponentially fu/cking boring at the later levels to the point that I turn into Wheatley trying to brute force GLaDOS's password in Portal 2's intro instead of elegantly coming up with a solution.\n\nWhich is to say this is where BIY shifts from fun and interesting to a chore; and the deeper I got into the game the more I realized this subtle shift. When you then also consider the fact that there isn't an overall compelling story linking the 230ish levels in the game together....one becomes less and less compelled to continue the journey.\u00a0\n\nUltimately, the late game morphs from puzzler into a di/ck measuring contest worthy more of a subreddit run by linux users than a game; because, honestly, if the solution to more and more of the puzzles requires one to inelegantly imitate Marie Kondo moving blocks of text around rather than cleverly manipulating them, then it's just going to be an exercise in seeing who wants to brag the most about beating a level.\u00a0\n\nAnd I just do not give that much of a fu/ck about doing so when the only payoff is to one-up some reddit neckbeard or Steam user with an UWU anime icon.\n\nThe only reason the game gets a \"recommend\" here is because Steam doesn't have a number scale, if it did this would be a 6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1678250393, "timestamp_updated": 1678252211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134277662": {"recommendationid": "134277662", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007476066", "num_games_owned": 2923, "num_reviews": 458, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1692537325}, "language": "english", "review": "A creative puzzle game.

Some difficulty spikes may deter some, but Baba is You is perhaps the best puzzle game released in the last decade.[/b]\n\n+ simple rules govern how puzzles are solved\n+ a lot of content for your dollar\n+ lots of brain-busters, but never felt unfair\n+ great and subdued soundtrack and audio cues\n- often only one set of moves to solve a puzzle\n- some early levels may filter out many\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\nBaba is You is a top-down puzzle game which allows you to play with the rules of the game to overcome obstacles. On every level are indicators that [i]something[/i] is [i]something[/i] and you can move parts of statements like this to change how things work.\n\nFor example, most levels will have \"BABA IS YOU\", but you can move the \"YOU\" to attach to a \"WALL IS\" to then take control of all walls in the level. As well, some objects might have a \"IS WEAK\" to denote that it will break when pushed against a hard object, or other attributes that govern the properties of that object, like game over on touch, if it melts when touching hot objects, and so on.\n\nThere's lots of permutations and modifiers to play with, and puzzles often have superfluous statements that only serve as misdirection. Chains of statements can also get quite long as the game progresses, and the brunt of the challenge is figuring out (sometimes at a glance before making your first move) what modifiers need to be set to what objects in order to succeed.\n\nThere's several worlds, each with up to a dozen or more levels in each, and each level can take anywhere from a few seconds to potentially hours. The game is tough, and it becomes tough quite early. Even some of the first world's levels had me stumped for ten to twenty minutes before it clicks.\n\nBaba is You is great, mostly because it's so simple yet intricate. Levels can sometimes not be obvious and even sometimes you can come up with a novel solution outside what the game expects. The game itself is also very novel, maybe other games have gone in a similar direction in the past but it's done extremely well here. It's super refined and easy to pick up, just how a puzzle game should be.\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Specific[/h1]\nThere's no real graphics settings to tinker with. Game runs at 60fps even as low as 3w. The Deck's internal battery measure alleges up to six hours of battery and I can believe it.

But they just throw you into these puzzles and I guess encourage you to run around aimlessly after trying every combination. Even earlier stages were really confusing that I also had to look up hints after being stuck for a long time but they all kind of made sense even if I never saw them.

Indeed, the form you and the winning element have depends on the rules written in the level. Each word is a block you can push and they form rules based on how they are organized.\nThe fact that changing the rules themselves is the main mechanic of this game leads to a very wide variety of puzzles, the dev was clearly inspired and fully used the potential of his game.\n\nSo yes the goal is simple but finding the solutions is absolutely not. The game starts like any game, with easy levels acting as tutorials to show you how the game works. But the difficulty quickly increases, and by a lot.

It's very much a case of show and not tell: the game teaches you how different rules interact with each other by using them in puzzles. There are often several ways to do a level, none of them better or worse than others.\n\nThe level design is great, starting with relatively straightforward puzzles introducing basic interactions, and slowly ramping up towards the end, having some absolutely fiendish puzzles towards the end. Despite the insane difficulty towards the end, it rarely felt unfairly difficult. The answers were always there to be figured out, and with enough creativity and trying things out, they were always doable. It was rare for the solution to be a stretch.\n\nThe amount of content is staggering too, especially for the price. Even in the base game, there are enough puzzles to last 50+ hours, and that's before considering workshop level packs, which includes an official levelpack introducing many more blocks and almost as many levels as the base game.\n\nOverall, one of the best puzzle games ever made.

Or, I love Baba is You but I hate what it asks of me. Or maybe I adore Baba is You but with the major asterisk that I used Baba is Hint from time to time because some times the things Baba is You asks you to come up with on the spot are fucking asinine, and require such liberal guesstimate reads of the fundamental mechanics that extend well beyond the rules presented that you genuinely will sometimes just accidentally guess the right answer after three straight hours on the same puzzle then have to reverse engineer how the solution you got even makes sense.\n\nBaba is You is a game *about* love, I think. You move around in this four by four grid with this cute little critter named Baba, and you push around blocks that manipulate the rules Baba works by. You are a kid playing with metaconceptual Legos, and as you play you discover, and as you discover you learn, and as you learn you explore, and as you explore you find new ways to play. There's a zen here, I think, don't quote me on this I don't know zen philosophy at all, in the quiet meditative peace of just seeing what the game will allow you to do, trying different solutions. \n\nIf there's an \"optimal\" way to play Baba is You, which i think there isn't as a facet of its nature, it's in finding new and better ways to fail faster and harder. How can you try different ideas without restarting a level, how many different ideas can you throw at a solution, how do you act when nothing you're trying is working. Maybe the most frustrating part of baba is you is how little it judges. You won't get feedback on whether your idea is right or asinine, whether your play is open or restrictive, whether you've even *beaten the game or not*. But I think there's something beautiful in that too- I finished Baba is You but it's more accurate to say I walked away from Baba is You, put it down like the bell rang for recess and it's time to go back to class and tomorrow I will pick up my toys and play with them again", "timestamp_created": 1673631560, "timestamp_updated": 1673631560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130764445": {"recommendationid": "130764445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121716746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1640446847}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good to question that little shred of intelligence I had left", "timestamp_created": 1673621442, "timestamp_updated": 1673621442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130743914": {"recommendationid": "130743914", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979730563", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1673681627}, "language": "english", "review": "It's everything you've heard about.

Otherwise games still stay shallow but get over-complicated.\n\nI had a lot of fun finding and completing all the levels for the achievements.\nGAME IS WIN", "timestamp_created": 1672684648, "timestamp_updated": 1672684648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129959962": {"recommendationid": "129959962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302791861", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 920, "last_played": 1696553116}, "language": "english", "review": "good game. i quit.", "timestamp_created": 1672682303, "timestamp_updated": 1696555520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129931641": {"recommendationid": "129931641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025047553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 139, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1681119152}, "language": "english", "review": "Breaks my brain", "timestamp_created": 1672657769, "timestamp_updated": 1672657769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485943764448165894", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129873042": {"recommendationid": "129873042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019641438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2007, "last_played": 1651424852}, "language": "english", "review": "Neat idea, gets tough.", "timestamp_created": 1672595242, "timestamp_updated": 1672595242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129872312": {"recommendationid": "129872312", "author": {"steamid": "76561199145698443", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1696897312}, "language": "english", "review": "brain is slow", "timestamp_created": 1672594601, "timestamp_updated": 1672594601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129869988": {"recommendationid": "129869988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089161013", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1681084295}, "language": "english", "review": "nice puzzles :^)", "timestamp_created": 1672592500, "timestamp_updated": 1672592500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129863176": {"recommendationid": "129863176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017232566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1699952754}, "language": "english", "review": "baba is my waifu", "timestamp_created": 1672586768, "timestamp_updated": 1672586768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129843445": {"recommendationid": "129843445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813224623", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1642379594}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminds me a lot of coding (and that's what it is in a nutshell).

It is a very challenging game as it makes you consider several fundamental issues when solving a puzzle: 1) the tile pieces needed, 2) where the tiles are located (and how to access them), 3) the order of operations when adding or removing a rule, and 4) tile/item placement. Sometimes the solution to the level seems obvious, but getting to that end goal is not as clear as it seems. The game has 200+ levels, and they get progressively harder as new tiles and rules are added. The graphics are very simple and stylized, which is good in my opinion since it helps you focus on solving the puzzle. I think the music is nice and relaxing, although after hearing some tracks for 20 hours it can get a bit repetitive. I will be playing this game for many years as I try to achieve 100% completion, but for now I can say that this game is one of my favorites. Every couple months I'll try solving a handful of puzzles to progress. It is one of those games I think is best played in shorter bursts rather than longer play sessions.\n \nCons: Not all levels are created equal, as sometimes it seems like most puzzles are set up to be solved only one way in and in a specific order. You are granted a lot of freedom in some puzzles and not so much in others. This adds to variety, but I think it makes some puzzles more frustrating than enjoyable to solve. The rules are also sometimes hard to understand, such as EMPTY. I think sometimes if you are placing several tiles on top of each other it can be very confusing how they operate. At times it seems like puzzles can be too open ended to where you can't figure out what the solution or the starting moves are, which leads to confusion in what it wants you to solve. It can be a frustrating game at times, but I think it is also very satisfying to overcome the challenges the game asks of you. Of the roughly 120 puzzles I've beat so far, there have been only a handful that I spent 2 to 3 hours on solving. As I reach these later levels, I'm starting to take more time (sometimes reaching 30 minutes to 1 hour per puzzle). If you see time being a restraint for this game, I think this could cause some frustration for some players. With all my complaints I still can't fault it for what it is. The game does such a great job at what it does for me to hand-wave these complaints. At the same time I think these may be what makes or breaks the enjoyment of the game for others.\n \nOverall I think its a very challenging, creative, innovative, and polished game! :)", "timestamp_created": 1672308611, "timestamp_updated": 1672308709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129591187": {"recommendationid": "129591187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360621607", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1660589991}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommend is Now", "timestamp_created": 1672307908, "timestamp_updated": 1672307908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129584153": {"recommendationid": "129584153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805013423", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1236, "last_played": 1685596875}, "language": "english", "review": "[code]\n   me\nme is dead\n   dumb\n[/code]\n\nme want brain and sleep :(\n\n(but luv is luv)", "timestamp_created": 1672299513, "timestamp_updated": 1672299799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730584681034088135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129581688": {"recommendationid": "129581688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092534377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1218, "last_played": 1672543989}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

Wholeheartedly recommended.\n\n[b] Baba has Charm: [/b] The game is simple, visually appealing (might I say cute), with an equally simple premise. Baba is you is a sokoban-style tile based pushy puzzle game, where you aim to win isolated levels by... well, any means available. The unique twist is the game is that every rule of the game is quite literally spelled out as tiles. The sore reason you control the titular character is due to the titular rule being made in the game (clever, eh?). This means that fundamentally every level has an out-of-the-box, meta-ish solution, making for a very rewarding experience.\n\n[b] Content is More [/b] The game initially has 10 worlds all with more than a dozen levels, plus the early tutorials and more difficult extras, all grouped around themes and novel game rules. The game also boasts 2 free level pack DLCs with new and exciting content, and also has a secret end-game that you access by [spoiler] a clever trick you should figure out on your own. Seriously, everyone always clicks spoiler tags anyways. [/spoiler] All in all, a vast amount of tough and unique puzzles to solve. The game also boasts a level editor and custom levels, which is a vast rabbit hole of extra content once you inevitably get addicted to the style of puzzles you find in the game.\n\n[b] Review is Done [/b] In conclusion, the game is probably the bet puzzle game of the last 10 or so years, and is easily value for money. Game is Buy.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1672172098, "timestamp_updated": 1672172098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129454121": {"recommendationid": "129454121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052098813", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1673887563}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game if you like problem solving and puzzles.

I can't say that the path to completing the puzzles I did was straight forward, as I have wracked my brain trying to figure out a few of the puzzles, and there were plenty of frustrating moments. However, every time you figure out a puzzle feels like a triumph and it consistently provides that through out. It has simple controls and mechanics, but they are all of them difficult to master and some of the mechanics take a while to get used to, but they are all individually simple and easy to understand. When you combine these mechanics, however, the game becomes infinitely complicated and the final puzzles in the game really test your understanding of the underlying mechanics.\n\nThe way this game forces the player's brain to twist and develop out-of-the-box thinking is something not a lot of games do. And even with knowing to think outside of the norms, the game's solutions might still delight/surprise you when you figure them out.\n\nThis is a consistently difficult and thoroughly enjoyable puzzle game.

I love the simplistic looking puzzles that can take a while of thinking, I love the atmosphere, I love everything about the game. \n\nNow, you may ask, why then I give it a negative review:\n\nSpoliers ahead\n\n[spoiler] The game lies to you. Several times. These are just the two most prominent I remember.\nThere are a handful of puzzles within the first two areas that straight up lie to you for later puzzles. One that comes to mind is a puzzle involving a conflicting block, something like an immutable \"Flag Is Flag\" in the upper left, and if you try and make Flag something else, it says you cant do that. OK, that makes sense. But it doesn't tell you that order matters, a puzzle or two later requires that you have that \"Baba Is Baba\" BEFORE you slide a block upwards that tells it \"Baba Is Crab\". I thought it would just break, or turn me into a Crab since I had slid the block in. Order matters. \nFine, that can be intuited. I'll concede that. Maybe. \nIt would've been nice to know at some point earlier \"Hey Order Matters\" without having to trial and error it.\n\nThen Later on there is a puzzle involving a robot and the solution I could figure out broke the rule about conflicting strings. Or at the very least didn't tell you that a broken string [u][b] can still work with a broken part [/b][/u] \nie. an immutable\"Flag is Flag\" then, the solution being to line up another string that reads \"Flag Is Rock And Win\". This will just exclude the \"Rock\" part from working and keep the rest. There's no tutorial for how operators work, and there's no way to learn some of the rules except by sheer dumb luck (or looking them up). I want to know the rules for the game, rather than having to figure them out through trial and error. I shouldn't be able to solve a puzzle because I'm a big dumb stupid thick idiot, not because I don't know all the rules.

The level design is well made. First it start with simple rules and concepts easy to grasp. Baba is you, rock is push, wall is stop, flag is win. You are baba, you can pushes rocks, walls block you, the flag is your objective. Soon you are pushed to change rules and do things that can appear silly or bizare, like being a wall, walking on lava, pushing water, these little things you do not necessarily think to do.\nI laughed when once, I spent 20 minutes on a level, when I found that in fact I COULD go through walls, because there wasn't any instruction 'wall is stop'. And yet I subconsciously thought that walls would block me\nThen little by little, new mecanics are introduced in graspable ways, and the enigm complicates. Where the first levels will not require more than three minutes to win each, you will quickly find yourself breaking your head for half an hour (or many more) over a solution to win a single level in the more advanced parts of the game.\nThere's hundreds of levels, what's more you can create your own or the play the ones other makes (and god!

Bien, pues Baba is You se sit\u00faa en las ant\u00edpodas. Su propuesta consiste b\u00e1sicamente en superar una cantidad nada desde\u00f1able de niveles independientes entre s\u00ed, en los que normalmente el protagonista (Baba) ha de alcanzar un objeto que en principio es inaccesible, pero al que finalmente podr\u00e1s llegar jugando y alterando las reglas que rigen en cada nivel.\nLas primeras pantallas act\u00faan como tutorial y resultan accesibles, pero la complejidad no tarda en aumentar hasta alcanzar cotas realmente elevadas. Esto se debe en buena medida al hecho de que al desaf\u00edo que entra\u00f1a jugar con la l\u00f3gica y las reglas que rigen en cada pantalla, se une la necesidad de gestionar adecuadamente el espacio y la manipulaci\u00f3n de los objetos y bloques diseminados por el escenario. \nPor este motivo, a la hora de enfrentarse a este Baba is You conviene armarse de paciencia y mentalizarse para sesiones de juego de cierto desgaste, en las que gran parte del tiempo transcurrir\u00e1 frente a una pantalla est\u00e1tica ensayando y descartando soluciones. A ello hay que a\u00f1adir un aspecto gr\u00e1fico muy funcional pero poco atractivo y la ausencia de historia u otros incentivos narrativos para progresar en el juego, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la satisfacci\u00f3n personal que sientas al superar ese puzzle que se te atraves\u00f3 durante un par de tardes.\nEl resultado es un juego exigente, retorcido y arisco como \u00e9l solo, pero que no puedo dejar de recomendar debido al talento que atesora. Pocas veces un acertijo te dejar\u00e1 indiferente y la mayor parte de las soluciones son realmente ingeniosas (algunas de ellas poseen un componente meta que te volar\u00e1 f\u00e1cilmente la cabeza).

It's pretty obvious from the start that you'll have to think outside the box to advance,  and if you can remember that, you can make steady progress. I'm a puzzle away from completing a fourth area, and there is SO much more content left in the main world. That's not counting all the extra levels this game's got packed in, as well as the ability to make your own puzzles. \n\nThis is easily the most impressive, nuanced, and original puzzle game I've ever played. It's hard to come up with a single con. Its storage size is tiny, its hardware requirements are virtually nothing, and its visuals are lightweight enough to draw focus to the puzzles without sacrificing a pleasant aesthetic. I would only ever advise you not to get this if you've done very poorly in other puzzle games, because Baba Is You is likely much more difficult. I think it would be fair to admit I probably wouldn't enjoy this if I felt completely stuck regularly, regardless of the game's immaculate quality. \n\nThat being said, if you feel confident that you can at least make some progress, the first few areas of the game are a blast to play, and the deeper levels, while spiking in difficulty, are extremely satisfying to finally overcome.

It's very fun to play with a friend.\n\nThere are also SO MANY gimmicky levels, like the one where the baba text is broken into to ba text blocks, or the 3D levels, or the meta levels (which are f$%@in brilliant by the way) and so many more. I have infinite respect for creative projects that really just go all out with interesting ideas like that. That's something I aspire to in my own creative efforts.", "timestamp_created": 1666108199, "timestamp_updated": 1666108199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124028493": {"recommendationid": "124028493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963902808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2125, "last_played": 1697126591}, "language": "english", "review": "baba", "timestamp_created": 1666103617, "timestamp_updated": 1666103617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124018265": {"recommendationid": "124018265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851026611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "playtime_at_review": 1545, "last_played": 1699952517}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it", "timestamp_created": 1666086771, "timestamp_updated": 1666086771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124011518": {"recommendationid": "124011518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064527406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 1462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1445, "last_played": 1666131976}, "language": "english", "review": "I really suck at puzzle games.

level.\n[spoiler]*You're not always Baba, and it's not always a flag.[/spoiler]\n\nPlot Is NOT Here.\n\nGameplay revolves around rules.  The game's rules are malleable, as in they're physical objects that you can shove around to alter rules, make new rules, break rules, add descriptors to rules, and more.  This is the central conceit of the game, and it executes it masterfully.  From the trailer, we can change Baba Is You to Rock Is You, and now you're a rock that has to go to a flag.  This is just the bare basics, and the game's exact wording, loopholes, unwritten rules that are active unless NOT, and the puzzles all of this makes, mean Baba Is You is a fiendish little puzzler.  I won't spoil any details here, but just know that it gets patently insane.  Thankfully, there's an 'undo' and 'reset' button on standby if you have irrevocably screwed up (usually by breaking 'Is You' with nothing to be You)\n\nGraphics are pixellated goodness with a sort of 'wobble' to them, with playable characters having just two states of motion, similar to old Mega Man titles, with both states having said 'wobble' to them.  This is good.  They're simple, but the graphics lend a cutesy charm to the entire game that makes it adorable and innocent.\n\nPerformance-wise, you could probably run this on a Samsung fridge.

In each puzzle, the goal is that the object \"[YOU]\" is on top of another object that is \"[WIN]\". At first, this may seem like it lacks a challenge. However, you will quickly learn that the addition of simple concepts as pushable objects (enforced by rules such as \"[ROCK] [IS] [PUSH]\") and impassable objects (e.g. \"[WALL] [IS] [STOP]\"), this win condition may prove to create interesting challenges to be solved.\n\nThe challenges often require a certain perspective on the puzzle which you may not recognize easily. So if you want to play this game, expect to be sometimes staring at a single screen for an hour (or maybe longer) for that final \"Aha!\"-moment you had been waiting for. [It should be mentioned that you don't necessarily need to stare at a single screen, it is just the way I played the game most often. There is definitely room for some trial and error (encouraged by the ability to undo moves), and you could of course also think of solutions when you are not directly looking at the puzzles.]\n\nAs a fan of puzzle games, I would gladly recommend this game to anyone with even the smallest amount of interest in puzzle games. The unique solving experiences with the almost endless amount of puzzles the game provides are definitely worth both my money and my time. However, note that this game is known to be very hard even though difficulty should be subjective. \n\nThe ways to think about most of the puzzles are almost unlimited, so having completed the game myself I would recommend the use of some kind of hint system for yourself. However, you should really only ever use it if you really cannot figure out the solution after considering many angles to the puzzle and are desperate. I personally would recommend the one by 'keyofw' called 'Baba is Hint'; they don't give away the solution in any way, but guide you towards the right direction with intentionally vague hints. Also note that it generally helps to take breaks because they allow you to think of perspectives you did not consider before.\n\nAt last, I have one small point of personal critique for the game. To illustrate it I am going to make an analogy. One could do mathematics without directly knowing of the so-called axioms. However, in my opinion, to truly understand mathematics one should know of these axioms (almost) by heart. The game design is brilliant: generally you do not have the need of knowing the 'axioms' of the game, but they are there! For example, the rule \"[TEXT] [IS] [PUSH]\", while not visible, is present at all times, but you do not need to know of this because the game makes its presence apparent. Although I always was able to solve the puzzles without the presence of the 'axioms' in the end (sometimes with the use of some hints, mind you), I sometimes felt the need to know of them.", "timestamp_created": 1659231562, "timestamp_updated": 1659231656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61538463830947876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119741206": {"recommendationid": "119741206", "author": {"steamid": "76561199158311674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2537, "last_played": 1688764348}, "language": "english", "review": "baba is you and good game", "timestamp_created": 1659155953, "timestamp_updated": 1659155953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119722966": {"recommendationid": "119722966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043782587", "num_games_owned": 1930, "num_reviews": 597, "playtime_forever": 3771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3771, "last_played": 1659126257}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't watched any smart game design video about Baba is You but when I saw the meme that goes:\nLevel Too Hard\nBaba Is Done\nBetter Watch Out\nBaba Has Gun\n\nI knew that I had to get it.

Having to figure out the order of specific things to do here is like trying to learn a programming language when you barely understand math.  This game has given me some of the biggest 'AHA!' moments of my entire life, but I found myself becoming stumped way too early in the game, and it wouldn't be much of a game at all if all I did was glue my eyes to a walkthrough and refused to work things out on my own.  So I'm personally stuck in something of a limbo with this game, not able to rise to the challenge of making Baba somehow push things around so they work correctly in my mind, but wanting to play it nonetheless.\n\nWould I recommend this brain-scramble of an experience to anyone else?  Yes.  To every single person I've become friends with, actually.  Even if all it'd be for is just to watch them try to figure out how to turn a sheep into a brick wall so they can clone flying letters that need to destroy a flag to put the key in lava and win the level so Baba can take a dang bath.\nI'd bet that's actually one of the level solutions.\n\nFor the record, I normally HATE brain-teaser puzzle games like this.  I'd never be able to play through something like Fez or The Talos Principle without going mad.  This one is just somehow... pleasant.  Like someone hitting you in the face with a foam noodle instead of a baseball bat.  Its out-of-the-box solutions are somehow perfectly logical, once you get a handle on this game ([i]not that doing so is particularly easy[/i]), and it just appeals to that secret-hunter in me who so badly wants to know what lays beyond the Baba-shaped veil.\n\n's just good.

There are also many instances where ways of interacting with a mechanic used last three worlds ago are then again used in a new difficult puzzle, so that by that time, I've already forgotten that a certain way of using a block or rule is possible. \n\nI see many people say that this game is difficult, and in general I can enjoy difficult games, but I find that for me too much of the difficulty comes from not remembering how certain things work and not being properly introduced to a mechanic and needing to look them up in a wiki. \n\nI will end on a positive note, because this game has many settings for how intense you want the visuals to be, plus some ways to customize audio, and as someone who gets easily visually and auditorily overstimulated, this is great in terms of accessibility.", "timestamp_created": 1656574070, "timestamp_updated": 1656574960, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117898749": {"recommendationid": "117898749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857638620", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1672292539}, "language": "english", "review": "Brain is mush", "timestamp_created": 1656554457, "timestamp_updated": 1679461203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447761178016662598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117892247": {"recommendationid": "117892247", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971288418", "num_games_owned": 912, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1682882929}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a brain melter.", "timestamp_created": 1656544966, "timestamp_updated": 1656544966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117890131": {"recommendationid": "117890131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164413841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4062, "last_played": 1695161608}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily my favorite puzzle game, and one of my favorite games in general. \"Ooooooh\" moments left and right, a real test of critical thinking, it's always very satisfying when you solve a hard level.
