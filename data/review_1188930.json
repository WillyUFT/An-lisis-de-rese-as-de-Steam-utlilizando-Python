This is in the narrative style of a hades rather than a slay the spire. Expect a story with a beginning and ending.\n\nSome features are marked as \"coming soon,\" but for the most part the game feels quite complete. \n\nTo give you a sense of what still needs polish, here are some complaints about version 2.01, which is current as I write this.\n\n- Inventory management is a little awkward. Switching equipment between characters takes a lot of clicks for no reason. The inventory is small in a way that doesn't seem to make the game any more interesting. I don't see any reason it couldn't be 50% larger.\n\n- Why doesn't clicking and dragging cards cast them? If there's only one possible target for a card, why can't I double click it to cast it? \n\n- As far as I can tell, no way to see your deck or discard, which is awkward when there are cards that reference the top card in your discard, let you search your deck, etc.\n\n- The finale is a complete run, except with narrative between stages, and the final boss is replaced with lots more narrative and some LONG boss fights. It goes on for ages, so much longer than any other run, and by the end it's just exhausting and not very fun. Died at the last moment, had to restart, really sucked, wish I'd turned the difficulty training wheels on.\n\n- Some weird bugs. One time the game randomly decided I could only confirm card targets with my keyboard, not my mouse. Everything else worked fine, just not that. Lasted through a restart, only went back to normal when the run ended. When I died on the final final boss, it restarted me in the bosses's waiting room, even though I was on one life mode - but I'm not sure the leeway was intentional, because it also had the camera off on some random spot and had to walk around offscreen to trigger the boss fight.\n\n- One boss, the grim reaper, uses a devastating attack each turn that can instantly wipe your party if you mismanage it. The game tells you who it will go to, based on your hand, but unfortunately it is often wrong (I have lost multiple runs to this). I think this is because the actual targeting ignores created cards, but the UI marker for targetting doesn't. Created cards aren't labeled, and it's impossible to keep track of them, so I'm not 100% sure this is the issue, but something is definitely not working correctly.\n\nIf you're fine with the above level of issues, you like roguelike deckbuilders, and you can tolerate anime, this should be a snap buy.

I bought this back in 2019? and it was a bit bare bones but I'm really glad I came back to it! The core game loop is fun and addictive, bosses are challenging, and tons of unlockables (characters, items, bosses, etc.)\n\nThe game is, like it describes, a party-based deck building rogue-like. How that works here is each party member has their own unique ability and deck of cards you combine to make your deck. If a party member falls you loose access to their cards (which are removed from the deck). The main character, Lucy, is mana (points to use cards) and card draw mainly, and always a part of the team. When starting a run you start in the over-world (meta-progression elements are here) and choose two characters (as you progress you can gain up to two more party members over the course of the run). These characters, and Lucy, you can upgrade by getting soul stones and spending them in the tab menu (leveling up stats and drafting another card for that character). From here you basically have a map with events similar to other deck builders but, where this one stands apart, you can do everything as long as you can pay the cost (usually through keys, health, or money). There are 3 core areas with a few others that unlock later in the story. As you succeed or fail runs the world grows and the story, presented through skip-able VN-style dialogue, continues (not a big deal; you can continue to play after completing the story) and you're sent back to the over-world.\n\nRegarding the translation almost everything is translated at this point. There are a few elements that are still in Korean (the story mission notice, not the actual text but the part which probably says 'mission' isn't, a left-click control hint in the card browser isn't either) but not anything which I could see causing a problem for anyone. The quality of the translation seems pretty good with only a few lines with minor grammar issues or one main mission dialogue with two lines of untranslated Korean (which are then I'm pretty sure repeated in English). Overall as someone who doesn't speak Korean this feels like one of the more natural and complete translations I've seen for a Korean game.\n\nFinally the developers put quite a bit into the game and it shows. All of the characters feel unique but are pretty well balanced. Mixing decks is fun and has built in mechanical synergies, both through card upgrades as well as effects that chain with other effects. The bosses all have unique mechanics that you have to pay attention to and unique dialogue for specific party members. This is stuff you don't see that much and really makes a difference!\n\nAnyways hope that helps! From what I've seen the game has come quite a long way over the last few years.

You get a basic tutorial in the very beginning, but there are a lot of subtle mechanics that it will take a while to get used to. More important than the mechanics of the game is understanding how to synergize your cards with one another. Certain characters work really well together, and getting cards that work well is key to winning. You can win without the above if you know what you're doing, but it becomes a lot easier if you synergize.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not a master of the game yet. I got to The Reaper and he destroyed me...and then again, and again...I beat him on my fifth try. I was kind of disappointed because it seemed the game was too short. And then I unlocked a new area, so I ran the game again. I beat The Reaper again, though I felt weaker this time (the characters I used don't work well together)...and then I met big daddy. He bent me over like a red-headed step-child and, well...I'll spare you the details. Long and short of it I'm still not done done with the game (it seems like you beat the game after your first Reaper win, but not really).\n\nThe basic mechanics of the game go like this: You pick two investigators of your choice (there are 20 total, though you will only have something like 6 to start). Investigators have 3 types: tank, attack, support. Support=healing and other buffs, attack=attack (obviously), and tank=other random abilities/support/debuff, etc.). At first I thought 2 attack, one support, and one tank was good, but I absolutely destroyed The Reaper with 2 healers (Pressel/Joey), a tank (Ironheart), and an attack (Azar) so I would just say get at least one of each and go from there.\n\nYou will then wander around a hexagonal area in your first zone and fight enemies. There are about 4-7~ fights per area including the boss (more as you go on). After defeating an enemy you get soulstones. These are used to upgrade your skills (more mana, draw skills, or level up your heroes, and a few other misc uses in the areas). There are equippable items you will discover, relics (powerful items to help you on your run, but you can only use four), potions, scrolls, skill books, and more.\n\nYour first bonfire (area between areas) will let you pick another investigator out of 3 choices. Then two more after that you get to pick your final investigator. The fifth area is where you fight The Reaper, so you get some time each run to familiarize yourself before you get destroyed by him.\n\nThere are 2 game modes--normal (die and restart, losing all party progression) or hope (keep your level ups, etc. and start again). I really think normal is the best way to play, as it's hard but fair once you know what you're doing.\n\nThere isn't a ton of stuff for perma progression--you will net 10 credits if you defeat all the bosses up to The Reaper. You can unlock new equipment, friendship items (you can gift to the investigators to become friends and have more card choices per level up), and skills.\n\nAs far as the characters, they all have unique personalities, cards, and fighting styles. I'm still learning the ones I have and I have to unlock 8 characters still.\n\nI really enjoy this game, it's wonderful. I highly recommend.\n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1699150405, "timestamp_updated": 1699150405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149485561": {"recommendationid": "149485561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120343141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 2039, "last_played": 1700375325}, "language": "english", "review": "The most fair and fun deckbuilder I've ever seen.

Be it checking targets with the current hand, checking for specific cards in hand, or tagging cards in hand with a buff/debuff.\n\nIt also, fairly uniquely does have another mechanic called \"Healing Gauge\", which basically pressures you into healing damage as soon as it's taken [the most recent instance of damage is converted to healing gauge, healing is 100% effective on this gauge, and is reduced NOTICEABLY if you attempt to heal past it].\n\nOf course, aside that, you DO have a Slay the spire-ish mana-per turn and card mana cost to go with this along with more \"standard\" JRPG dealings like Taunt status, Role Trinity [in party composition], and equipment/relics that can change and/or make the run a success.\n\nRuns at the start, might take ~3 hours to finish while you're unsure how a character works or dealing with the unknown boss mechanics, however with enough familiarity this should be reducing to ~1:30 hrs ish, even less if fully dedicated tbh.\nNote that there IS a \"harder\" mode, that does include different boss mechanics/patterns.\n\nCurrently there are ~ 20 playables, and you choose 2 at the start, so in terms of party-building, you have a fair amount of variety before you start getting bored.\n\nI will also note that visually, it is fairly minimal in the amount of animations, -- It kinda reminded me of Etrian Odyssey in that sense, for both the partybuilding sinergy-search and the minimal animations.", "timestamp_created": 1697766253, "timestamp_updated": 1697766488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148484147": {"recommendationid": "148484147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350613572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131, "last_played": 1698769014}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay loop is fun, and music is fantastic.

I've played through a ton of them, such as Inscryption, One Step From Eden, FTL, Dead Cells, Enter the Gungeon, Slay the Spire, Hades, Plate Up!, NecroDancer, and the Binding of Isaac.\n\nAll of those games are good, but I like Chrono Ark more than any of them. Bar none it is my favorite Roguelike I've ever played, my favorite new game of 2023, and one of my favorite games of all time. And it's still in Early Access!\n\nHere is how I like each part of the game in depth-\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay for this game is very fun. You control a party of 4 characters, and build a team out of different artifacts and equipment to defeat enemies. Each character is unique in their own right, and it's really cool to build your team around their strengths and to see how they interact. There are 20 characters to play as, and many of them are fun. \n\nThe bosses of this game are also very good. They are very creative to the deck-building roguelike formula in general. They are meant to exploit weaknesses, and it's cool to adjust your playstyle thinking about the bosses you will randomly fight. There are over a dozen bosses to fight, so every run feels very unique.\n\nThe game's combat is also very in-depth and has a lot of layers. I've played for 42 hours and I am still learning new things to optimize my game better. There are many advanced mechanics as you unlock the harder modes and it's cool to learn how things work. It makes this game fun for beginners (if not a bit of a learning curve), and great for experts as well. \n\nGameplay is 9.5/10. Only complaint is the learning curve and the brutal difficulty if you are going for the hard stuff, but you get what you sign up for.\n\nCHARACTERS AND STORY\nThe story is very good in this game. It has a lot of layers. The true ending (so far) really made me think a lot, and it was overall really cool. The story isn't always in your face either. It kind of lets you explore how much you care about the story and the characters, which I really like in video games. I do wish there was a bit better of a skipping option through cutscenes you've already seen, however. The story is a bit edgy as well, but it is also very well thought out.\n\nThe characters are also very good. The art is polished and nice and there are a lot of little interactions that you can have with the people you recruit, which is a nice little touch. Some characters are a bit one-dimensional, but they gain depth if you view the optional stuff.\n\nOverall, the story and characters is great, one of the best for a roguelike. Only roguelike I can think that rivals this in story and characters is Hades.\n\nPRESENTATION\nI really like the worldbuilding in this game. Each level feels like it has its own personality and are really creative. You've got a cursed rose garden, a creepy abandoned amusement park, and a snow-covered graveyard, among some others. Each feel very unique and stand out. The deeper worldbuilding is cool too.\n\nThe music is also excellent, and I wish that it was on spotify. I especially love both the Level 2 Boss themes and the Level 3 field, battle, and boss music. Also the final boss themes go hard.\n\nThere is a level of jank to this game, however, with it being in early access. There are a lot of things that don't seem to work as intended, a lot of text seems to not be translated, and sometimes there is a bit of load time when entering a cutscene.\n\n\nTL;DR, this game is fantastic. Worth every penny.

Each character also feels unique in their passive abilities and overall play style. \n\nI am also a huge manga fan, so the art style and art direction of Chrono Ark are in my opinion, the best in the genre. Everything from the character designs to the card art just oozes with charm. If you have ever dreamed of the unlikely combo of manga style art and roguelikes, this game will be your dream come true. \n\nThe game play has lots of little tricks to it, and as you lose and start over, you will start to adapt to the game's systems, and improve against what enemies the game throws at you. Another plus is that the game seems to be given a lot of love from the development team, with constant updates and tweaks to the balance. \n\nChrono Ark is my favorite roguelike game, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the genre, or anyone who likes anime style RPG games.

I personally did like some aspects of it, but others are not as well done. This game has an interesting story and theme. It has some cool moments within the story that make you want to continue playing. Unfortunately the gameplay is not fun in my opinion. non boss fights are incredibly punishing for no reason. Enemies might as well all have the same skin. Buffs and debuffs are poorly explained. It is often unclear how enemies will interact with each other or yourself. items are pretty useless and they only buff your character but don't really change fights in any meaningful way. Gameplay gets samey and stale very fast. I was just overall disappointed. I think this game is meant to be a story first and a card game second. Useful to have some fun for a while, but I have no reason to go back since the different characters have very little impact on how enemies are fought. They all do a different variation of heal or deal damage with little build diversity. There is also no way that I have found to remove cards from your deck. I'm not sure if this is intentional but it leads to super bloated decks unless you just leave your heroes under leveled.

There are some combos that need a bit of rebalance (Leryn + Illya cough cough), but overall, every character can at the very least fulfill a niche that makes you want to pick it on certain scenarios.

Want to make your DPS the support or tank? You've got it!\n\nSome cons (I'm sure the devs already plan to overhaul it)\n- The relics: Limit 4. That doesn't feel good. I understand there's supposed to be trade-offs, but it's a speed bump to the end game formula of roguelikes. Players need feel stronger and reach for the god-tier run. \n-> My suggestion: Alter the spawn rate of the relics and remove the limit. Also there needs to be better communication to the user that they need to put relics in the pod thing to activate them.

Just for context.\n\nPros: \n- Beautiful art and engaging style. From the jump I felt more engaged in the world because of the atmosphere.\n- Unique, interesting take on roguelike deckbuilding. Most of this is visual and stylistic, but it was enough to make it feel new to me.\n- To expand on the above, there is a LARGE cast of playable characters. Each of these characters has a class, each of them have unique cards and multiple unique synergies and mechanics. \n- Fantastic gameplay loop. I had no issues doing runs over and over.\n- VERY polished. In this day and age I'm very used to EA games leaving a lot to be desired, which ultimately can turn me off of the game before it even truly releases, whereas by comparison this one is basically a complete game already. It makes a huge difference.\n- I really enjoy that there is a town area to walk around in before a run. Not a huge deal on its own, but it really helps to flesh out the world.\n- Wealth of content. Literal hours of cutscenes, hundreds of unique cards, items, encounters, etc.\n\nCons\n- The writing is... very eight-grade syndrome. I understand that this is a stylistic choice, it feels very much like RPG maker horror games, except the art style just makes it come across like a bad anime. Tonally, it just feels off.\n- EXTREMELY heavy on cutscenes. Why is this a con? Even when fast-forwarding through, cutscenes are often several minutes long. Some can't even be skipped or fast-forwarded through. The excessive length quickly grows tedious and they frequently forcefully take you out of the game. Imagine if you wanted to ride a go-kart but halfway through the course your kart stopped and you were forced to read a novel on the lore of go-karts. Do you give a shit or do you just want to ride the damn kart? I strongly believe that cutting these down into more concise segments would feel less jarring and vastly improve the experience. \n- Some of the keywords on cards don't have tooltips (and really need them).\n- Lacks some of the dopamine hits you normally get with deckbuilding in other games (something about opening card packs and deckbuilding just doesn't hit for me in this game).\n\nOverall, I think this game is absolutely worth the price and worth the time to play. While I do have several complaints, I think that for the most part they can either be ignored or forgiven.

Battles feel relatively balanced and fair as well, although there are still some outliers like:\n-[spoiler]The Parade Tank boss being a particularly nasty and brutal enemy in elite mode due to the extremely high and lethal damage bursts [/spoiler]\n-[spoiler]The final boss mechanics like for Reaper are made around needing to shuffle debuffs back and forth between team members, and this hasn't been changed or fixed for the solo challenge while Reaper has been fixed as the only boss for that challenge. So there's a really solid chance you have a normal or even easy run all the way to the end, only to get instantaneously wiped out without a shred of a chance, unless you are aware of this and prepare accordingly (barrier potions and the likes).

It has the common issue of bad RNG being a run ender, but because the individual decks for the characters are small (and in general you just get a lot of pretty insane deck control options), it's not as bad as most games of this type.\n\nBasically the only major thing to complain about are that getting poor choices for your 3rd and 4th party member can be extremely crippling and you can't do very much about it. I understand the idea is to get you to be flexible about team building and get you to take characters you may not have considered... but if my team is lagging behind in DPS and needs a second DPS character and I get 4 healers as my options, that run is probably lost. At the very least, it's not surviving the final boss (since it's a fairly steep DPS check). Otherwise, RNG usually only feels like a \"win more\" factor, where you might get lucky and get extremely powerful unique equipment or top deck a cheap nuke card.\n\nAll the characters play quite differently from each other, and the relatively small deck sizes for each character means you can control your build easily. You've got characters that account for almost any strategy you could think of, whether you want to abuse the power of drawing a lot of cheap cards, or go the opposite direction and have massive cost nukes to drop on enemies. Or maybe you want a healer that damages and debuffs your own allies (which is much more than just a downside to balance her powerful healing, it also synergizes with effects from other character). \n\nLastly, the story is... fine. I don't have any issue with it. It actually gripped me a lot more than I expected at first, but the character design and dialogue is painfully \"anime\" and a lot of the plot is dropped in bits of lore that you might not feel like reading.

There's enough drafting and impactful enough relics to feel a strong sense of variance between runs, while each character's card pool is consistent enough that they can be relied upon to do the jobs you chose them for.\n\nSomething this game also gets right is enemy design: sequencing your turns in combat requires a lot of attention and familiarity with the combat mechanics & individual enemy behaviors. The bosses in particular put a lot of pressure on you, but I've generally found them to be very creative and flavorful, with some very well thought-out counterplay mechanics: often the order and composition of your hand determines who the boss targets, and it feels like all of the tools the game gives you to answer certain situations have really rewarding use-cases when you plan for each encounter.\n\nEach character also functions very differently, with each character in a given role providing overlapping utility in a way that feels nothing like their neighbors. Just changing one unit on your team for another character in the role can feel like you're playing a completely different game, and there really is something for every preferred play-style here. This in particular is what keeps me coming back to the game; somehow, I never feel like I fully grasp all the ways to use a character, then it all feels fresh again when I start messing around with someone else.\n\nAside from the gameplay, which I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who enjoys deckbuilders and/or dungeon crawlers, there's a lot more to love here. Other than character and relic unlocks which are for the most part pretty quick to do, there's not really any metaprogression: a character has access to their whole kit upon unlocking them, so the game feels well balanced on a run-to-run basis. The story behind the game has a lot of surprising and entertaining twists. And the presentation of the game especially deserves a mention: almost every card has a unique animation with really snappy and satisfying sound design without ever feeling time-consuming to watch. The soundtrack often transitions between a map theme and battle theme seamlessly per area, and there are some absolute banger boss tracks.\n\nI've written this review when the game feels near completion, and I'm extremely excited for its full release. It's a challenging, but very rewarding game with a ton of replay value on account of really intelligent design. Every part of the game just works really well for me. The English translation and clarity of combat mechanics and certain card functionality could use another pass, is really the only caveat I have about the game.

There are a lot of cool ideas here and the theming, atmosphere, and gameplay experience all have been done pretty well. There are absolutely improvements to be made on all of those fronts. However, none of this is why I cannot recommend the game.\n\nThe story of this game is not great, not terrible, at least out of the box. I don't really know, I have not played it enough to see that.\n\nThe big thing however, is that the balance of this game is very off right now. Not just with how numbers work during combat but also the balance of events that are given to you, the rewards you get from them, how they are explained, and the cost/reward for doing certain things.\n\nKeys do not feel worth it to get a pile of unusable equipment. It may change deeper in but the things that you can do with relics feel impossible, as relic drops are incredibly rare.\n\nI went from cleaving down everything with ease, pretty much from start to finish, to getting OKO'd by the final boss in a couple of turns.

Some of the issues (eg relics) are resolved with more understanding, but there are new issues (eg pacing). If some of these issues are improved, I'd probably change my recommendation to positive.\n\nI can understand how someone might like this game, but I just didn't. I understand it's in early release, and maybe I'll revisit this. I've played plenty of deckbuilding rogue-likes, so it's not the genre. Maybe this game just has a steeper learning curve than I'm used to; it definitely feels more complex, and has all the stats of a JRPG. Or maybe KRPG?\n\nTLDR: Overly complex, poor UI/control, poor plot, and unintuitive results of skills.\n\nI hated the UI. Apparently no controller support (or maybe mine just doesn't work) and an unintuitive mix of keyboard and mouse. There were also little things, like the fact you have to click on the portraits, not the big targetting arrows above them. Also, you can't swap relics by dragging one over the other; you have to unequip, then equip, then equip the other one.\n\nThe skills and upgrades commonly do things that are not what I expected. EG: I had a \"card draw\" stat of 2, and I clicked to upgrade my card draw (expecting to now draw 3 cards). Instead, I gained a \"Lucy card\". Some of the skills have a lower section that has additional information, but no tie-in to the skill itself, so I have no idea what that information is for. I have relics that give me extra mana at certain times... but no idea how to actually use them.\nEdit: The \"Lucy cards\" tend to give card draw.\n\nThere is a myriad of effects on the nameplate of each skill to mark its traits (glowing, red  lightning, computer static, etc), but I just found these confusing. It didn't help that there's color codes and no colorblind support, but most people probably won't find that  as annoying as me. At one point the tutorial goes \"You can tell these apart easily because they're a different color\", but it looks identical to me. \nEdit: Also, the rarity system does not have colorblind support (eg symbols or labels in addition to colors).\n\nThe plot jumps around so much that it was difficult to follow.\nEdit: And a scripted battle after your 2nd run for some reason; by that I mean your decisions are scripted, but you still have to click through it.", "timestamp_created": 1685575761, "timestamp_updated": 1685780723, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472727268934249878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139330537": {"recommendationid": "139330537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201076013", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 3045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1690842415}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes yes very fun!", "timestamp_created": 1685555700, "timestamp_updated": 1685555700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139243069": {"recommendationid": "139243069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039629474", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3088, "last_played": 1695019466}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1685408049, "timestamp_updated": 1685408049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139222758": {"recommendationid": "139222758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018086833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1685379339}, "language": "english", "review": "Found this really boring.

Each character only has a relatively small pool of cards (11-13, 2-3 of which being rares), but with such a large roster of characters who all have a different playstyle, there's a lot of room for experimentation and coming up with unique and nuanced combinations. And since the card pools for each character are so small, you can usually get the cards you need to make your combos go off, even if you decide you need multiples of the same card.\n\nAs a bonus, the game has easier modes, harder modes, and challenge modes, on top of mid-run difficulty modifiers that you can decide to risk (or not) for additional loot and rewards. They all do a great job of shaking up the standard gameplay loop, in case you want to do something different.\n\nThe VN side of the game is no slouch either. If you don't mind your writing a little \"anime\" with the tropes that come along with that, the main story beats are engaging and make you want to know what will happen next. A lot of the early story is told through records you pick up during the game that you'll have to access by sleeping in the character's bed; they'll tell you a lot about the lore and history up to that point of the game, and how things got where they currently stand, plus some tidbits about some of the characters. Then you also have large swaths of story that you're rewarded with for completing a full run, which is where the real meat of the story kicks off. The dialogue isn't always fresh, but the characters are still interesting and the story arc has a ton of twists and turns. The only real problem is that, as of writing this review, the ending of the story still hasn't released. \n\nThis is definitely a solid indie game and though it doesn't quite have the same polish as STS, it's definitely got the complexity of mechanics and interesting story to keep you busy and engaged for tens of hours.", "timestamp_created": 1685378488, "timestamp_updated": 1685378488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035129547119141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139147529": {"recommendationid": "139147529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412996638", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1700622295}, "language": "english", "review": "crashes on launch", "timestamp_created": 1685271695, "timestamp_updated": 1685271695, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139030374": {"recommendationid": "139030374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028562664", "num_games_owned": 1544, "num_reviews": 191, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1685119451}, "language": "english", "review": "Nah chief, this ain't it", "timestamp_created": 1685119554, "timestamp_updated": 1685119554, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.352558434009552002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139003808": {"recommendationid": "139003808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036641462", "num_games_owned": 853, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1769, "last_played": 1685079866}, "language": "english", "review": "Chrono Ark is a combination turn-based RPG and roguelike deckbuilder. Each time you throw yourself into the dungeons, you start a new build from level 1 and a deck of bottom-tier starter cards. Craft your deck, level up and grow your party, and collect the Time Shades needed to save the world. But there's more going on underneath the surface. Across runs, you'll uncover conspiracies, and it becomes clear that you need to find a way to go off script...\n\nDeck building is pretty unique in this game. Each run, you start with two party members and gradually increase to four. Each character has their own card pool, which is small enough that you'll see all of their non-rare cards in a single playthrough with them. So the deck building can feel limiting. But that's because you have a small monkey brain: between all of the characters in the game, there are about as many cards as in a more traditional deckbuilder like Slay the Spire or Monster Train. What it really means is that you have an incredible amount of control over which cards you are offered. Over runs, you'll learn how each character performs, and then you'll start to figure out synergies between them. If you have a weak build, it's definitely on you, not because you got bad luck with card offerings.\n\nThe bosses and late-game mooks are huge standouts. Each one brings a unique game mechanic or three with it. They're not just damage sponges - they're whole-ass puzzles! Read the buffs and debuffs that appear very carefully, and see if you can piece together just exactly how the boss is trying to screw you over. One boss changes who it targets based on which cards you play - but all of your plays are forced into a queue instead of taking effect immediately, so you have to mentally keep track of where aggro moves. Another boss adds a card to your hand each turn that forces you to put nasty debuffs on your own party, and neglecting to do so means the entire party gets punished. Yet another requires you to play your own attacks against your own party, then ups the ante by possessing your characters until you can snap them out of it by smacking them around. Every single boss has something this deep and unique going for it.\n\nThe real standout for me, though, is the story. This ain't your typical four to six very best friends band together to keep magic Hitler from becoming God. The story, as it's initially presented to you, is that mankind is trapped on a floating island after the world was destroyed by a corrupting miasma, and now you must travel into what's left to collect the magic to turn back time. But this is a blatant lie. The truth is far more complicated, the stakes are unimaginably high, and you are being played like a fiddle by the puppet masters. But the villains aren't evil gods or sorcerers who need to be killed. They're ordinary people who mean well. It's simply that things have gotten so far out of control that they had to make some difficult decisions, and now they're in so deep that it's not possible to back off.\n\nThat doesn't make them one iota less dangerous.\n\nJust about damn near every cutscene has left me with my jaw on the floor.

I like this genre in general, but here I just can't point at any flaws, I can't find them. But I can point at some things that makes feel this game way better than other games of the same genre:\n\n1. As long as you have 6+ cards on the character, you can freely delete all the trash cards at any moment, without the need of finding some events or paying tons of gold. It is extremely useful and nice.\n\n2. You will almost never witness how your party gets annihilated in one turn because of a few misses in a row right before enemies will crit one by one (hello Darkest Dungeon). Numbers in Chrono Ark feel fair and you rely mostly on your decisions, not on pure luck. Even if you got unlucky here and there, you almost always have a way to handle it (using consumables, standby, unstunning by discarding cards, using Lucy skills which can save your life in the most fatal situations, and I don't even mention characters' abilities). You also can replace a card in your hand by the topmost from your draw pile (1 per turn by default) if you don't need it now, and it is a basic mechanic, not some rare exclusive skill. To be honest, now playing older deckbuilding games (which I liked) after this one feels like I'm shackled and like my character is very clumsy (yes, even though it is a turn based game).\n\n3. The accuracy. I played many games, I know how for example in Disciples chance on hit 80% seemed really high, I remember how rookies in XCOM had even less than 70% accuracy (despite they could miss three times in a row even with total 95% chance on hit). So... In Chrono Ark even on Expert difficulty you have only 98% accuracy cap. And even this cap can be neglected by certain relic. On Normal difficulty there is no cap at all.\n\n4. Huge amount of possible synnergies between different characters which can be expanded even more by different relics. Also, when you upgrade a card, it doesn't turn into something known in advance, because you choose your upgrade yourself, and it can be either from usual pool of upgrades or synnergy oriented with other character.\n\n5. The game is constantly changing from one patch to another, getting better and better. I didn't play very long, but I saw earlier versions. Unlike other games where constant nerfs or careless rebalancing sometimes ruin the whole fun (don't want to mention examples), I didn't notice anything like that here. On the contrary, in Chrono Ark it feels like with new patches your possibility of creating good and interesting party only grows.\n\n6. VERY interesting plot. This is actually unique feature by itself for games of this genre. Even playable characters have their own story and personality, they aren't just some hireable dummies. And this is really cool.\n\nAlso I wanted to say that I personally like the healing gauge system and enemies acting during the turn alongside with your characters. It feels more lively.\nArt style and music are top tier either, but I think many people would point on that even without my words. I only hope this game will be more popular in future.

And as a very welcome bonus - while all the characters look very nice, there's minimal fanservice and the one (arguably there's two if you're specifically into one thing, but that one isn't appearance-based) character that seems even a little fanservicey is not at all excessive about it and her design actually seems fairly fitting for her personality rather than shoved in explicitly for fanservice reasons. A very nice change from many other anime/manhwa-looking indie games in multiple genres.\n\n+ The story (and there is a story) is both good - and quite a bit deeper/different than you would initially expect from this genre. Don't want to spoil anything - let's just say it grabbed my attention extremely quickly. \n\n++++ Who the fuck did the music for this game and what do I have to do to get them to compose for every single deckbuilder I play for the next 20 years? There's literally no reason that this game's OST has to go as hard as it does. Jesus Christ, this is probably the thing I was the most surprised by. It's REALLY good, if on the smaller side in terms of total different tracks.\n\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- The story (unless I am completely mistaken and am not, in fact, at the final boss, which I think I am) is somewhat on the shorter side for RPGs (halfway a fair comparison since this is kind of an RPG/roguelite deckbuilder hybrid) but again, that's largely my own doing since I can't stop fucking playing it.\n\n- The wealth of mechanics to learn/manage is almost always a positive for me because I like those kinds of intricate systems, but for those who want a more simple experience it may end up feeling overwhelming\n\n- On that note there are one or maaaaaaaybe two bosses where even I started sweating a little because of the amount of different things to factor in with their special mechanics. If you are heavily complexity-averse, those bosses might just be instant run-enders for you.\n\n- I'm not sure if I'm just good/lucky/both (very experienced with deckbuilders and usually pretty good at them) but the balance of the game isn't nearly as fine-tuned as a precisely balanced game like Slay The Spire (although again, part of this is due to the hybrid RPG elements) in that I feel like I've largely been smashing almost every run and the few runs I've not won, it's been smooth sailing the whole way up until a specific, giant spike in difficulty and then defeat. Somewhat different to the kind of attrition that slowly grinds STS runs to an end. Again, YMMV on this one being a pro/con - it doesn't bother me personally much but I'm listing it just in case it's a notable point for someone else.\n\n- Feeling extremely mopey that I'm almost out of characters to unlock because each one has been so much fun to learn so far\n\n- My grades are dropping swiftly\n\n[h1]VERDICT/TL;DR:[/h1]\n\n10/10 roguelite RPG/deckbuilder hybrid. Fun, variety of characters, deep mechanics, good art, good story, incredible music. Rapidly became my 2nd favorite deckbuilder ever, right after Slay the Spire. I would have paid a lot more than $19.99 for this if I knew how much I'd like it.", "timestamp_created": 1677440102, "timestamp_updated": 1677440327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793846964836120605", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133214422": {"recommendationid": "133214422", "author": {"steamid": "76561199074468524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 810, "playtime_at_review": 9132, "last_played": 1700682149}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, so, I've played this game for a good, solid bit now (totally wasn't hopelessly addicted for like an entire month) and cleared most all of the currently available content other than the secret area, and I can truly only recommend it, ESPECIALLY, at its (as of writing this review) Early Access $20 price tag. Here's some of my favorite things about the game.\n\n1. Character Designs and Aesthetic: On point for anyone who likes the wider anime-esque style of character designs. The designs are even cooler, in some cases, when you take into account some story details which give you a new outlook on certain characters, and provide some hilarious and intriguing contrast.\n\n2. Parties and Potential Combos: Incredibly varied and fun. The fact that you can choose your first two out of four total party members means that you always have agency in controlling the direction you want your party to go, and there are a LOT of directions to go. DoT-based parties, parties that benefit from discarding certain cards for special effects, parties that specialize in self-damage to up their own damage output, heavy combo decks for turbo DPS with cost reductions or deck manipulation... It's all there and it's all reaaaaaally cool.\n\n3. Story: Very interesting. The story unfolds in stages as you get more and more clears, and the VN Prologue (not currently available as of writing this review, but was there before and will presumably be back later) lays out some super interesting foundations and twists. I actually did not read Chrono Ark: FATE until I had already unlocked every other story cutscene and it was even BETTER imo than reading it early on. One particular character reveal left me just downright flabbergasted, and a major theory about another specific character wouldn't have been as jarring or intriguing had I not played through and unlocked another (set) of characters before seeing them in FATE. \n\nOverall: Please. PLEASE buy this game and support the devs. If you're reading this review before it's out of Early Access, NAB IT BEFORE THE PRICE GOES UP. If you're reading after, there's almost certainly even more content added since this review which makes it worth buying ON TOP of everything I've mentioned, some of which have already been teased. The game is addicting and engaging and also Lucy is My Daughter And I Would Kill For Her, And You Probably Will Too.\n\nAdditional Tidbit Edit: The game looks much more polished now than the video on the Store Page would have you believe (imo)!

This game is a real hidden gem and i couldn't allow myself to continue playing through the \"uncle google's extended trial\" and had to support the devs. I hope we will get more content for this game after the Early Access, or maybe a sequel.\n\nIf i had to describe this game in one comparison, it would be \"Darkest Dungeon 2 meets Slay The Spire\". If you like any of those games then you will most likely find this game entertaining. You have to manage your RPG party in fights very similar to DD2 (yes, the Death's Door is here, and the enemies will hit like a truck) but instead of static skills and turns like in DD2 you have a deck with usually 5-6 skills from your every character that you cycle through while using mana to cast them like in Slay The Spire. I was skeptical at first but that combination really works great and brings some really nice variety, especially with how many characters you have and how differently they play. There are 18 characters right now (and 20 in the full game judging by the empty spots) and i was pleasantly surprised to find out that all of them are really distinct from each other and really fun to play. The boss mechanics are also some of the most unique and cool things i ever saw from games like this. Forget simple stuff like \"this boss is summoning minions, oh no!\". Bosses in this game have actual mechanics that you have to play around like you would in some kind of raid in an MMO. One example is a boss that requires you to switch aggro between all members of your party so that you don't wipe. Won't say anything more about them to keep them a surprise, you definitely wanna go in blind to fight the final bosses cause those mechanics deserve it.\n\nIt also has a bit of a story that is progressing with every run, kinda like Hades. Unfortunately it's definitely the weakest link here and i wish it was explored more cause it has a huge potential, but in the end you only get a couple of story beats and then it's over. But what is there is good, don't get me wrong. It's just that i wish there was more of it. But in the end, if i had to choose between gameplay and story then i'm definitely glad that the devs put a lot of attention into the gameplay.\n\nEdit. Just wanted to edit this review to mention that my complaints with the story being too short were fixed. Now i honestly don't know what i could even complain about.

I feel a little bit bad giving it a thumbs down, but I feel like some of the positive reviews need some balancing out. Which is a weird thing to think, admittedly.\n\nAnyway. \n\n[b]Good things:[/b]\n\n- Mechanics are pretty neat and at least the starting characters all have interesting little gimmicks. Honestly all the fights I've had so far felt pretty fun. Fair? I can't say; I will not play enough to find out how fair it feels as a whole, but I didn't feel like I was ever killed by some dumb garbage, so make of that what you will.\n\n- Art is great. This should go without saying.\n\n[b] Bad things: [/b]\n\n- The UI/UX is a bit of a disaster. I feel like this is a result of an engine retrofit; it definitely feels like some sort of RPGmaker game with some plugins attached - and kudos to the developer, I wouldn't know the first thing about making games or engine wrangling so I'm impressed by how it works on a technical level, but the resulting UI really is a bit painful to work with. \ne.g. Items, which are very useful, are in these tiny little boxes on the top left of your screen while your main abilities show up in what looks essentially like a little to-do list with alt text when you hover over them. As the main mechanics of the game, it's really weird to have them take up so little space. This might not bother you though, I don't know you.\n\n- Outside of combat, you also walk really slow. I don't even really see the purpose of walking around in a game like this when you could just as easily still have the map (for vibes) and teleport us around it. Even the main hub map is needlessly big in relation to your walk speed and everything's pretty poorly marked. I just want to stab things and I feel like my valuable thing-stabbing time is being taken from me to do some very dull walking around.\n\n[b]Dubious things:[/b]\n\n- The story. This is very subjective, I will admit, but I... do not care. And I'm aware of how mean that sounds! But I'm really not sure how else to put it? It's hard to pinpoint what I dislike about it without actually caring, and for the life of me it has not been able to make me care. From what little I've seen, it's got a very fanfiction-y, webtoon-y vibe, and I'm really not a big fan of that stuff. If you are, hey, that's great, maybe you could give it a shot then.\n\n- The English localisation... exists. And they did do a decent job! It's serviceable, but don't expect professional. It definitely wasn't helped by the fact that I didn't enjoy the writing, to be fair. I will say: I didn't have much trouble understanding card text, so if that's a concern, that's easily a better part of it. I just think that some of the lines in the story that I imagine are more dramatic or poetic in Korean come off as a little goofy as they've been brought over to English.\n\n- The whole illustrator controversy. Don't worry, I looked into it for you... kind of. The bad news is I can't read Korean so it's hard for me to corroborate things. But the dev claims that their previous artist dropped a couple racial slurs, which isn't cool, and it's possible that the whole feminist thing was a non-issue. I have my reservations, but I can't draw a conclusion because I literally can't read the screenshots and no I'm not writing all of that into Google Translate.\n\nWhether you choose to take him at his word is up to you, don't come bother me about it, I have no idea, I don't even know if I'm reporting everything correctly; if you understand Korean/hangul, even better, you can go look it up yourself. \nIf you don't care... idk, man, it isn't cringe to care about things, you know. But I know, separation of art from artist etc. etc. that's all on you, whatever, I have an anime pfp my opinion is irrelevant or something.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nAll in all, it's an indie game all right.

Bosses deal ridiculous amounts of damage on top of having extremely gimmicky stuff that basically cripple entire builds.

Everything, from enemy turn order, equipment acquisition, level-ups, money, to the very cards your characters get from levelling up is random. \n\nIt punishes you for experimenting (aforementioned bosses).

This is a review based on my experience so you might love or hate it.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \n + A mix of Darkest Dungeon + Slay the Spire. You control Lucy to lead a team (up to 4 characters) through stages to defeat final boss and loop the game (which is the way to progress story).\n + A bunch of characters to choose from easy to hard to play characters. Each have their own playstyle and synergies to build a team.\n + There are many RNG elements in this game (I think the RNG make the game less repetitive), but there are also ways to reroll if you have bad lucks in items/skills. Usually this is fine by me because I can change my build if bad things happen. \n + The overrall combat mechanics is unique. It's really punish you if you make bad moves. And also you must use everything you have to win the game.\n + Every bosses have their own mechanics which make you carefully to approach them (Imagine playing for 3 hours then The Reaper KO your team in one attack).\n + You can unlock many characters, items, skills later. Currently there are some challenges you can do to get Steam achievements.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n + Very cliche for me but it's okay, i still enjoy the dialogues and cutscenes. I'm waiting for the full story.\n\n[h1] Music/Sound [/h1]\n + Soundtracks is banger.\n + Each characters/enemies have their own SFXs and they are so satisfying to hear. \n \n[h1] Art [/h1]\n + Manhwa art style (yeah manhwa, not manga). \n + Characters and skill cards design pleased my eyes. I know there was a drama about this but still shout out to who put efforts into the art.\n + No waifu baits, no fan-service.\n\n[h1] Things to improve [/h1]\n + Bugs/lags occur frequently, especially in this new 1.99999 version. \n + Translation need to be improve. There are many skills and effects that made me confuse the first time seeing them. I had to test them and there are a lots of \"Ohhhhh, I get it!\" moments.\n + Interactions/In game dialogues are weak, the dev could make them more interesting.\n + The story in EA involve around Lucy with some characters but not full cast. I'm afraid the full release game will lack the chemistry with full cast.\n + Balancing: Some items, skills are just random stats and I always don't use them. A example is Charon, a heavy Pain debuffer but her lore item have Weakening inflict rate rather than Pain inflict rate which is weird.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nChrono Ark is the hidden gem I found this year.

[/h3]\n- Party, Countdowns and Overload mechanics encourage creativity with deck construction.\n- Good variety of bosses and boss mechanics.\n- Tons of challenge for those seeking a punishing experience.\n- Art style pops. Soundtrack slaps.\n- Clever moments of delivering narrative impact via game mechanics.\n\n[h3] What Could Use Improvement? [/h3]\n- Short narrative experience (to date).\n- Party member personalities are paper thin.\n- Story mostly delivered via supplemental archives instead of being woven into the main play experience.\n\n[h3] Recommend To: [/h3]\n- Fans of roguelike card games that need something more than just mechanics for their next fix.\n- Anime fans, particularly fans of science fantasy animes like Steins;Gate or 13 Sentinels.\n- Anyone who takes Final Fantasy music into their car, the park or the gym.\n\n[h3] You Might Instead Enjoy: [/h3]\n- [b] Griftlands [/b] - A roguelike card game dripping with personality. Sharp writing, strong atmosphere and plenty of mechanical depth, but a game with small, shallow character vignettes instead of a single driving narrative.\n\n- [b] Chrono Trigger [/b] - Hiya Zoomer! Like the idea of an RPG with clocks and wished this game was more RPG-zy? Give this elegant classic from the 90s a shot. \n\n- [b] Ender Lilies [/b] - Wildcard recommendation. If the art style and soundtrack of Chrono Ark enticed you, I suspect you'd find this game equally compelling.

It's a Rogue-like Card Battle game that relies on RNG elements. IMO it's a LOT more RNG than other games of it's type because of the sheer amount of choices. Personally I'd recommend the game because the balance/gameplay is interesting, BUT this still needs improvements/fine tuning done to make it a better experience- mostly in not wasting the players time.\n\nEvery 'Event' in the game is a selection of two choices. Chests in the game give Equipment (With five rarities Common/Uncommon/Rare/Unique/Divine) OR Relics. On every level up for a character (where the average level will be 4-6) you get 3 choices for skills. There are times I've gone entire runs without seeing what I consider to be the BEST skill for a character, this is even having a relic that lets me see MORE choices for each level up. I've gone runs where I just don't get relics or I don't get any of the good ones- alternatively the same with equipment and the lack of keys needed to even open the chests to begin with. To me the biggest issue is the games length. Any single run of the game is upwards of an hour, and you are going for what I consider to be a coin-flip against the two last bosses- who have such annoying mechanics that you'll need to pray the stars align. And I think that's the thing that really sours me with the game- I don't want to be doing hour long runs that end in a single turn because I failed to draw the right card. It's not that I care about losing, it's the time commitment to get to that point. In other games of this type, I'll reference Slay the Spire (STS)- runs are closer to 20-30 minutes and you can speed through things. The bosses in this game are like pulling teeth with dialogue and mechanics that force you to slow down- not to mention REGULAR enemies which have nearly 500 health (comparable to the last bosses), or have to be killed THREE times, or have an invulnerable shield that blocks the first hit, or has 80% evasion for the first attack, or has 80% armor that needs to be hit twice, or extra enemies spawning every turn, or the balloons with 5 health that can stun you, or blah blah blah. A lot of these mechanics are just dragging out the timer, you won't lose to them, it just makes the fight take longer than it should.\n\nHere's my first big complaint. You start the game and do the combat tutorial to learn the game. Makes sense. You then start your first run which I managed to complete and got game-over'd by the Bird anyways. Following that you get ANOTHER sequence that's similar to the starting scene and gives you what feels like another watered down tutorial as you fight easy enemies in a more story driven sequence. It's just odd to me because you should've STARTED the game with this story sequence and had it be the tutorial. Instead it feels like I go through the beginning of the game like three times and the tutorial twice. But WAIT! It gets even better! Because there's the Forgotten King (the ACTUAL final boss) I literally had to 'complete' the game a SECOND time to get booted AGAIN and then I was able to face the Forgotten King.\n\n- Keybindings can't be changed at current build. The map is used to warp around, but the icon to open the map is on the upper right of the screen and the key-bind is for M which isn't close to WASD- which is where MOST bindings are located. It'd make sense for Map to be Tab but that's currently tied to a Menu which is DIFFERENT than the escape menu. The Escape + Tab menu should be combined and the Map tied to Tab.\n\n- Bosses are just over-tuned, resulting in you hitting death's door and healing out. Results in the Meta being extraordinarily reliant on heals- essentially Tanky DoT DPS. Could be boon or con depending on where you stand. You're either running two tanks or two healers, with one of the alternative. Running two dedicated DPS feels suicidal, but that could just be me. \n\n- Bosses talking and wasting time. Dude I've fought the SAME boss multiple times and they say the same dumb shit every time and you CAN'T skip their dialogue. In fact you can't even hit escape to open the menu! It's absolutely absurd. It's cute to see it pop up, but it shouldn't be hampering actually playing the game by slowing it down and forcing you to stare at the screen because you're stunned irl.\n\n- Self-cast skills aren't simply auto-cast. Phoenix is a good example, his Feast ability can only be cast on himself- yet you have to select Phoenix after selecting to use the ability. Even an Active Ability like the Mana Coin needs to be cast on a character after selecting it, despite it not affecting a character as it restores 1 Mana.\n\n- Walking around is a waste of time. Outside of having the Secret Tile, the entire concept of walking around could just get removed for an interactive map. I don't mind the concept but it needs utilized.\n\n- Credits should be changed to work like a Gacha system where the reward is randomized. It'd just work better for this style of game instead of flat unlocks.\n\n- Enchanting isn't more clearly specified to only one enchant per item. \n\n- It's not made clear WHAT got put on the item. There should be like an animation/pop-up saying what Enchantment was placed.\n\n- Enchantment Event will keep the item in slot when you first Enchant, on the last Enchant it'll boot the item into your Inventory, it's super annoying because normally I had it equipped to a character.\n\n- Choices where you can get a Curse Card but it doesn't say what it does. For example Lucy Curse 'Banana Peel'. You also have to 'select' the curse when it should auto-distribute.\n\n- Items are annoying to activate/use in combat. Double clicking a Party-wide item should make it cast. It should POP a bit more that I've even clicked on an item and am using it on something.\n\n- Can't equip two of the same item on a character. Honestly with the boss balance I fail to see how this is broken, maybe it's more related to preventing bugs? Two Identical Rares is DEFINITELY not broken.\n\n- Can't back out of the start sequence for a run. If you enter 'Starting Sequence' aka Character Recruitment, you can't just exit out of the menu. You need to select your Characters and THEN you can walk back and go into town. This area isn't clearly marked so when I reached the Ark, I was exploring and stumbled into it. This should CLEARLY be said that it's the start zone- or just talk to Azar to arrive here.\n\n- Combat ends or Enemy dies and I'm still needing to select an option choice in combat. These should auto-cancel out instead of making a choice.\n\n- When you game-over you can't skip the game-over cut-scene. I get you CAN hit quick reset, but it's not the same since you need to go to town to spend Credits.\n\n- Enemy RNG in a single turn can just decide to target one ally (1/3 or 1/4) and murder from full health. Yes it's uncommon, but yes I've had it happen.\n\n- Amulet (Revive) can only be used outside of combat. As stated in my previous annoyance, this would be helpful in removing that sort of nonsense- just put a Mana cost on it.\n\n- No way to re-organize the layout of Recruits. I get this doesn't ACTUALLY matter but dude my brain.\n\nAdvanced Options DO let you speed up combat, and clear SOME of the map for you to save a bit of time. You can also turn off auto-discard basic skills on level up.

Of the all the ones I've played in the past years this one's initial hook got me the hardest as I played for 14 hours in my first sitting.\n\nAesthetics and OST are pretty cool. I kind of like how the story is presented because for one it isn't really shoved down your throat as all of the context and lore is shoved in another area so if you just want to send some runs go for it. What I enjoyed the most is figuring out the teambuilding and combat system. Combat is the highlight for me here. There is a lot of bullshit that can happen, but it can easily be avoided if you master the system mechanics and I think taking full advantage of that was my biggest hurdle to consistently get good runs in. It doesn't have your typical combat system you'd see in other deckbuilders and I would say that using standby is your best friend. Boss mechanics are pretty unique and fights in general felt very satisfying to overcome. I never felt like any fights I lost were out of my control or just being straight pooped on by RNG. I will say that it took me about 20 hours to get my first win on the true final boss and it was great since I felt like I was gigabraining every single turn. If that sounds like too much there is an ez mode where you basically get free retries with bonuses each time you die if you want to just enjoy the story or whatever as I do think it's pretty interesting\n\nIt's rare that I feel compelled to continue playing a game after I beat whatever it has to offer so I really am looking forward to it's full release sometime later this year.", "timestamp_created": 1658163857, "timestamp_updated": 1658163857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118686269": {"recommendationid": "118686269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116603868", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 832, "last_played": 1657731814}, "language": "english", "review": "A truly wonderfully designed game, it takes the classic StS formula and evolves it to a very entertaining RPG battle system.

There is something about the sound design that just really works here - it completely sells this \"hopeless world, fighting to survive\" aspect. And it has the difficulty to really live up to that.\n\nNow of course at this point, after 140+ hours of playing, I can pretty reliably reach the final boss even on Expert (Hard) mode, but that certainly wasn't always the case, in fact I died on the very first major boss on my first run (as have many, I'd assume) because the combat mechanics are not entirely obvious at first. \n\nNow with any Roguelike, the amount of RNG that goes into a run is always a balancing act between the player having almost no agency in what happens and each run being too easily streamlined leading to repetitiveness . I would say that this game treads this line fairly well, with a skilled player maybe eding towards the latter a bit. There is a certain weight in play to favor you, such as recruitable team members most often consisting of the roles (DPS, Tank or Healer) you don't currently have in your team.\n\nSpeaking of roles, I think they did a great job in making each role feel impactful and valuable and forcing the player to not just completely neglect either Damage or Defense/Sustain. At a base level, there is a DPS check in every fight because the Black Mist arrives at a certain point and starts damaging you as well as preventing all healing. The turn count for this is usually pretty reasonable to do unless you are actively stalling and with a few exceptions in the later areas.\nOn the other hand, not having any healing or support will quickly lead to some of the more grindier fights to wear down your party members. Debuffs and Buffs are also very crucial, as they usually are in these kinds of games, and work just fine on bosses as well (although there is a mechanic in place preventing singular characters to be stunlocked for multiple consecutive turns)\n\nThat is to say, the combat has a lot of depth to master and there is quite a lot of replayability in trying different strategies and character combinations.\n\n I should mention that although this game quite heavily focuses on narrative and lore, the in-game story isn't actually finished yet, although what is there is already pretty promising. Devs are pretty regularly updating the game with balance patches as well as new content, both gameplay and story-wise, so I'm confident that this is not a game that will rot away in Early Access Hell and I honestly always look forward what they will bring next.\n\nOverall, this game definitely stands out for me in the Roguelike crowd due to its unique setting, clean audiovisual presention and deep, engaging combat.

Earning advantages through merit, currency and even filling out challenges set before them matches the overarching story behind the scenes to provide a sense of unity with the game developer's pace.\n\nRegarding equipment the game has a pretty balanced set of systems for stats with legendary and unique gear that provide characters with another tool of utility and even provide added brute force if you are lucky enough.\n\nCharacters are varied and some are with their tropes. Though outside of the typical berserker, archer and plague doctor are interest quirks that accompany them to flesh them out.

Every character is unique and interesting, and this game has some of the most compelling healing characters/mechanics that I've seen in general. Updates have done a great job at giving players more agency and control over the deck and events. They've added card upgrades, including synergy upgrades unique to the characters in your party. While there isn't too much diversity in encounters yet, the combat is engaging and strategic even early on (beyond the first floor). As usual for this genre, there are relics (teamwide passives), equipment (2 per character), skills (cards), and card upgrades that can completely change your run. Unlocks are limited to new characters, relics, equipment, and skills\u2014no permanent stat increases. The bits of story are pretty decent so far.\n\nLucy, the main character, does not actively fight and instead provides \"Draw\" cards and special abilities for your deck. There are general Draw cards like \"draw 1, draw 1 for the next 2 turns\", character-specific Draw cards like \"draw 2, add Illusion Sword to them\", and powers like \"replay all the cards played from your hand last turn\". It's a unique spin that makes her feel like a vital support for the team.\n\nThis game has a unique \"healing gauge\" (green HP) mechanic where damage reduces your healing gauge, effectively \"potential HP\". Taking another hit resets the healing gauge from your reduced HP. Healing has full effect on healing gauge and 1/3 effect otherwise (unless the skill has Overheal). Chain heals bounce to other characters but can't heal past the healing gauge. Upon hitting 0 HP or lower, characters enter \"Death's Door\" and die on the next instance of damage, giving you time to heal/shield them or kill the enemies first. Clearing encounters fully recovers your healing gauge so you have to strike a balance between sustain and rushing enemies down. There's also a Dark Fog mechanic to prevent stalling but it shouldn't matter too much unless you lack damage or are specifically playing around it with relics.\n\nFor new players, I suggest bringing at least one healer and more than one source of primary damage. You don't really need to level your characters past 2-3 and should instead increase your max mana and draw skills. Use skill books, generic skills, and events to round out your skills instead. Try to have a debuff clearing skill (consider making it Fixed), especially for Pain debuffs since those can grow out of control.

Be aware I have only reached the 3rd or so main boss, so there is likely alot I have to go through to fully experience the game.\n\nThis game has a fantastic foundation, the combat is pretty unique for a deck builder and whilst it takes a while to learn all the HUD elements and functions, it gets pretty deep as you progress through each run. I am a big fan of Slay the Spire and turn-based JRPGs in general so i hugely appreciate the layers and depth to characters and general team builds.\n\nThe game does well to make each run feel different by not withholding characters from you, but also the devs not withholding their creative ability when designing each character and boss. Each one plays (so far at least) extremely uniquely, and its hard to categorise each character into a very simple \"tank, healer and DPS\" nomenclature , and that's not even considering the items and relics which'll adjust how well you perform a certain build or task.\nAs for the bosses, there is some very interesting mechanics, such as juggling a debuff to avoid nuking your team, or being given a limited card every turn (which'll cure one character of a dangerous debuff that the boss applies). The enemy and boss designs are brilliant, especially in the second area of the game - additionally, the music and atmosphere is as good, the music is well blended into the atmosphere of the zone and its a delight to do enemy encounters for all the aforementioned reasons in this review. \n\nMy only complaints is that of some, no doubt, early access jank and problems.\n\nFirstly is how information is displayed on cards and abilities, sometimes it feels overwhelming starting off as to what a card does and when. You could probably make the current card text alot more concise and clear to make the new player experience alot better, though you tend to figure out most of it when you play through it.\nSecondly, is the impact of relics and scrolls (I could be wrong about this, depending on the devs vision / roadmap), I feel like teleport and swiftness scrolls serve no function at the moment, and some relics are somewhat superficial as far as their effect goes. If the devs are aiming for a proper roguelike experience (again, they might not be) then it might be worth adding some more game changing relics rather than just stat or percentage increases. \n\nThis also stretches to abilities in some cases, many abilities are quite narrow and the range of character builds are limited, however this impact is offset by the range of characters available and who are to come, and its not really a problem to me because of the range of playable characters. I certainly wouldn't expect multiple completely different build ideas for each character, but having some aspect of control would be cool, e.g. Stronger individual shields for Ironheart, or focus upon party wide shields, or focus on his damage side. Though this to an extent would encroach upon the dps/tank/healer system structured in the game, so it doesnt really matter to me ultimately. More characters or more ways to build characters, either works.\n\nThose are my only 2 complaints as of now, aside from that though, I am hugely surprised that such a gem has been hiding from my sight until now, and the seemingly regular updates for this game give me good impressions regarding the developers commitment and I hope their talents get noticed from hereon.

[/h1]\n\nJesting aside, Chrono Ark is exactly what's advertised. For $20 ($15 on sale) you can play a fun party-based deckbuilder with roguelite aspects and mechanics. I can recommend, and if you're looking for nothing more than affirmation that the game is worth your money, you can stop reading here. It isn't flawless, but even in its current state it feels worth the $20 if you give it a chance.\n\nOf course, Chrono Ark has its issues. Instead of going over the positives like every other recommended review, let's go over the main issues you'll face. And let's make a \"compliment sandwich\" out of it.\n\n[h1] The Top Bun [/h1]\n[url=https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/36176731/ce447cb26ee88cdc7b8bbd06fabcf9a021c49033.png] Pressel is cute [/url]\n\n[h1] The Meat [/h1]\nChrono Ark suffers from a few things, namely off the top of my head:\n1. The game isn't locally English\n2. The difficulty varies wildly per run (with an exception)\n3. The story is weird\n\n[b] The game isn't locally English. [/b]\nI'll give credit where it's due, the localization isn't the worst I've seen. I can follow the dialogue, see what characters intend with their words, and interpret their tone in conversation. I can see the mechanics that the developer lays out and their importance. The one thing that becomes an issue is the complexity of Chrono Ark.\nThe boss battles are great fun, but later on you'll start facing bosses where you'll be reading a paragraph \"\"passive\"\" on what the boss does and their mechanics, all dragged through a language barrier. It's unfortunate, because the second you figure out what the boss does it actually makes some of the most fun boss fights I've had in a deckbuilder.\nSadly, some of the card descriptions suffer from the language barrier too. Case in point, the Chainsaw lady that you start with ended up being really fun to play, one of my favorites to pick. After my first run with her, I dropped her for about 9-10 hours of playtime because I had no idea what any of her cards did. I opted for simpler party members like baseball waifu and her knight in shining armor until I had a better grasp on the mechanics. It isn't IMPOSSIBLE to interpret the text, but there's still some work to go overall.\n\n[b] The difficulty varies wildly per run (with an exception) [/b]\nIt takes is a single look at the screenshots tab of Slay the Spire to find someone who has created a build that allows them to endlessly draw a single 0-cost card from their deck. It makes the game look easy (though I assure you it's not.)\nChrono Ark doesn't have many of these (to my knowledge) to exploit thankfully, but it's still challenging regardless. Difficulty will vary depending on the party you take; 4 healers will act differently from 4 DPS. The part of this that isn't so accountable is the massive change in difficulty from boss-to-boss. Each level on Chrono Ark has a boss that generates, and while there aren't such massive discrepancies for early levels it becomes blatant on the second-to-last level.\nSpoilers ahead for two notable examples:\n[spoiler]On the second-to-last level, you need to defeat a boss called \"Reaper.\" He's a tough dude, took me about 4 tries and 18 runs to defeat him the first time. He was a great, massive challenge, but defeating him unlocked the other two bosses of that level. Comparatively, these two bosses are both easier, but the \"Sacred Karaela\" boss is too much easier. I managed to take her on with 2/4 party members, something that I couldn't think to manage for the other two bosses.\nOn the final level, the difficulty spikes massively for the final boss. The level itself is fair enough, and after learning what the enemies do it feels way less intimidating, but the final boss doesn't match that. He has ~700 health and a small chunk of armor (25%). I've faced him 3 times, only actually beating him the first time around. He's tough, but unfairly so. There's a move where you can only target him due to a \"taunt,\" but if you don't take care of three other \"pillar\" enemies, your deck will start filling up with cards that deal 40% true damage to a character upon play or discard. \nThis kinda sucks, because it means the fight's over at the halfway point if you:\n1. Don't have anyone who can deal with taunt\n2. Have someone DIE before they can deal with the taunt\n3. Have too tanky of a team with a healer that can't manage to heal 40% of 100 health in a single card\n4. Don't have any all-targeting attacks\n5. Don't kill the pillars before they start dishing out 40% max health true damage cards\nI get the reason for the phase. Building a team around single damage for a single-target boss would mean a cakewalk. I had a Narhan dealing 137 damage crits against single targets that run, but because the thunder cards kept pushing my identify cards out of my hand I couldn't deal with the pillars.\nMaybe I'm just a casual (I definitely am) but it seems like a really massive difficulty spike. I'll try to remember to update this part of the review if my feelings change at a later date.\n[/spoiler]\nFor those who skipped the spoiler: the TL;DR is that the discrepancy between the final boss and the previous boss is massive. Said previous boss also has some friends who are much easier compared to him. The final boss is the exception to the varying difficulty, considering his consistent high difficulty.\n\n[b] The story is weird. [/b]\nThis one is to be expected since the game isn't natively English, but regardless, the story is strange in some areas. When you open the game, you'll get a section of story that seems very inorganic once you actually start playing the game. I'd like to call it a tutorial, but your actual first run teaches you the mechanics better than the starting tutorial. You're brought past some standard stuff that helps you get the concept of the story. In particular, I loved the big \"500\" that you start your first run with. It's a small detail, but it's very nice.\nAs you progress in the game, the story sections become more well-written, expressive, and higher quality. They aren't amazing, but they're miles above the inorganic cutscene at the start. It's a shame because it feels like they didn't revisit the starting dialogue once they actually figured out their storytelling style.\nOne small thing, though it is spoilers for a new mode they added. This mode is seemingly only story-based, so it has no bearing on mechanics as of the time of this review.\n[spoiler] Do note: this also spoils some of the Danganronpa series, so jump-ship from this spoiler text if you haven't finished the series and you want to. There's an extra story mode, \"Chrono Ark: Fate.\" The writing is miles ahead of that in the standard mode of the game, but it also puts you in the shoes of someone who isn't the main character of the standard mode. If you aren't a fan of Azar, you might not enjoy it as much. The inspiration from Danganronpa 2 is pretty blatant, from \"WASD to look around the room and investigate objects\" to [url=https://i.imgur.com/4cQ6Jqx.jpeg] this diagram that screams from how close to the series it wants to get. [/url] It's a good read, but I also enjoyed Danganronpa, so mileage will vary. Only the prologue is complete so far, so maybe there will be something to spice it up that doesn't just seem to be some sort of elimination-style game. [/spoiler]\nOverall, I recommend Chrono Ark if you can get past these 3 main issues. It's a fun little deckbuilder.\n\n[h1] The Bottom Bun [/h1]\n[url=https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/36176731/cefdd486b41a6a67cc32e87d2a1bc6587f2a31d5.png] Did I mention that Pressel is cute?

The party system is not only well done, its enforced. Each character (including you, as Lucy) bring in their own set of skills to the overall deck, and you are encouraged to use skills from everyone in order to use mana efficiently. \nWith that all said, let me get some assorted questions many people might have cleared:\n\"Is the soundtrack good?\" Yes, very. Like this is one of those soundtracks you will listen to outside the game its that good.\n\"Is it broken by infinites like a lot of card games?\" Shockingly no, its frankly almost impossible to go infinite at least in any consistent manner as the cost of cards from a given character escalate over time in the same turn as part of the party system.\n\"Is it balanced?\" ...Yes and no? I'd say every character (even the joke one) are all at least competently useable but there are undeniably some clear frontrunners, game is in early access though so thats to be expected. \n\n\"I am brand new/weak at deck-builders, will I be alright in this game?\" This is hard to say I will admit, the game is FAR from easy, id say it is substantially harder than the likes of slay the spire and a lot of other deck-builders at base value - but the difficulty isn't artificial I can say out of all the runs so far there has only been one where I couldn't determine what went wrong, its easy to learn from mistakes. \n\n\"The game is translated for English players, are the translations good?\" I'd say readable but a bit rough around the edges.

The fight mechanics are varied; the characters all feel unique; the music is great enough that I find myself listening to it for leisure, which is a rarity from a video game OST for me; what I've experience of the story is intriguing; RNG doesn't feel [i]too[/i] demanding for a successful run; there's a pleasant difficulty curve to draw you in while keeping you engaged in the long-run; and I [i]love[/i] the art style and general aesthetic of the game. \n\nChrono Ark doesn't play much like your typical deckbuilding roguelite. While synergies are obviously important, you're never going to stumble across the perfect combination of effects that let you cycle your whole deck and OTK every fight. It feels much more like a traditional turn-based RPG in terms of playstyle. \n\nI've only really got two major complaints. The first is the UI can be clunky at times. When the field gets stacked with enemies, it's not uncommon for their health bars to overlap and hide crucial information about turn order or health exact health point values. I find it frustrating that I can't look through my items and skills in various situations where it'd be helpful to (such as when drafting a new skill). \n\nThe biggest problem for me is language-based. This game is in [i]desperate[/i] need of some form of problem-solving card text. Anyone with a background in physical card game can tell you how important it is to have consistent wording on your effects. To compound this issue, it's clear the devs are not native English-speakers, which can lead to some additional clunkiness to the wording of effects.\n\nThis problem permeates into every element of the game. Card effects, [b]especially[/b] those of debuffs, are worded incredibly inconsistently. Different skills will shift wildly in wording, to the point where it's not even consistent in terms of perspective (that is, first-, second-, and third-person are all used on at least one card). While I have high praise for the variety in fight mechanics, it often took me various tries before I could actually parse the language on some of their gimmicks. Even core character mechanics aren't free from this. It's near-impossible to figure out if one of Azar's skills referencing his [i]Hallowed Sword[/i] mechanic are referring to the [i]buff[/i] Hallowed Sword or the [i]skill[/i] Hallowed Sword as they both have the same name.\n\nThe game comes packaged with a VN-style prequel story, so if you're looking for a more plot-focused experienced there's something for you to sink your teeth into. I worry that the aforementioned language difficulties would cut into the experience a lot, but my understanding is that as of writing (ver. 1.63) it's currently incomplete so I haven't personally delved into it just yet.\n\nUltimately, the problems in how the game presents information to you are relatively minor. It can be frustrating but experience will eventually let you plow through it, anyways. The game itself is a blast and I can't recommend it enough.

Honestly it's not that bad until you combine it with the games higher learning curve, this problem will go away with time though\n\n-Unlocks- Most games don't give you everything at the start and this one is no different, they can be a little rough to deal with but are overall very rewarding\n\n-Early Access- occasional bugs\n\nI really hope you try this game, it really feels like it's made for the player and deserves a lot of love after all the hard work that has been done so far (and is still being done) on it\n", "timestamp_created": 1632603893, "timestamp_updated": 1632603893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99918450": {"recommendationid": "99918450", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965396869", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 229, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1632545054}, "language": "english", "review": "Sooo... Chrono Ark... no, I don't think this one's related to Chrono Trigger at all.  I put hours and hours into Chrono Trigger back in the day and I'd play it again any time.  I put minutes into Chrono Ark and I kinda want my time back, and I don't want to play it anymore.  If that doesn't tell you all you need to know, then read on!\n\nI didn't like the combat and the \"deck\" building system doesn't at all feel like I'm creating a deck to fight with because I'm not.  I didn't like the level up system or the permanent upgrades, either.  The graphics are okay, the animations aren't.  Too much dialogue and disposition for the first chunk of the game and it's very, very repetitive.  I want to play the game in the first 30-40 minutes, not read... and read... and read some more.  I had a few fights, but mostly it was reading and waiting.  The dialogue wasn't much to write home about.  Blah, blah, clock tower, blah, blah, clock tower, blah, chosen one, blah, blah, clock tower.  Okay, I get it.  The kid is the chosen one, you have to get to the clock tower to start it up.  That took two lines.  Not 20 minutes.  Get the idea, game?\n\n\"Recruit up to 4 party members and synergize each card you have to win the battle!\nAll skills and perks will appear as cards during the battle.  It is up to you to customize your own characters!\"\n\nI could only get 2 party members at the beginning.  I would imagine you eventually unlock space for more, but it was pretty disappointing to only have two to start with, especially since you only have six to choose from at the beginning.\n\nThis is advertised as a deck builder, but it's not really a deck building game since I wasn't able to see any cards or pick any decks.   You select party members and the abilities show up like cards from a deck as you play each battle, and you do get to pick abilities as you level so I guess that's.. the deck they're talking about?  It just doesn't feel right.\n\nBattles also have a time limit, some kind of black fog that rolls in and damages you when the time limit ends.  It prevents healing, and is generally a \"hurry up\" mechanic that I don't like.  It means if you can't dish out enough damage to end a fight fast enough then you will die.  It means you can't select healing and defensive characters, or if you don't get the right \"cards\", which will happen often, you can't do any damage so you just sit there and the fog will be a problem.\n\nSound effects are sometimes good, others are just wonky, especially some of the sounds that play during dialogues.  I've seen the chemist character break a test tube several times, and heard the exact same glass breaking noise repeatedly, so often that I'm tired of it after only about 40 minutes of gameplay.  There's also some kind of wood breaking noise that plays when characters are in a conversation that feels like it's very out of place.\n\nThere are some issues with the typed dialogue, sometimes the flashing cursor appears over a word instead of at the end and there are a few mistakes in the text.  I'm sure that'll get ironed out eventually but the game's just not much fun.  I think this could become something decent, but right now it's not in a state where I can recommend it.\n\np.s. I've already asked for a refund.  This one is just not worth my time right now.  Maybe after it's out of EA?  Maybe then I'll give it another look.", "timestamp_created": 1632545367, "timestamp_updated": 1632546254, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.31214529275894165", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99889414": {"recommendationid": "99889414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003722864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 3814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1672853347}, "language": "english", "review": "5/5 story, soundtrack, and gameplay\n\nmade me cry lol", "timestamp_created": 1632497587, "timestamp_updated": 1662500001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481079787015914917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99855706": {"recommendationid": "99855706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035595508", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1632385975}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, I thought the game was absolutely fantastic for what it was, and you can read other reviews about what makes it great, but I ended up refunding it.

Don't compare this game to games that you can be carried by your deck draft, you need to understand the enemies mechanics and the game's concepts. In StS, Arcanium, Phantom rose, etc. you are able to complete the game in 10 hours or less, don't think that you are going to do that in Chrono Ark. Think about Chrono Ark as Darkest Dungeon, you need a learning process to be able to understand things. \n\nThis game is way more creative than others of this genre. Using StS as an example, deck building is usually linear there is no mix between archetypes, if you are building poison you will never mix shivs together. But Chrono Ark have so many interactions, combos and playstyles that makes your gameplay unique. You are able to make comps and combos that maybe no one has ever done. For some people certain character can be trash while for others they are incredibly OP, making this game replayability really huge and unique for everyone.\n\nIf you ever need some help or want to share some strategies and replays checkout the[url=https://discord.gg/cRCA3DSdR3] community discord[/url], people there are EXTREMELY friendly.

The abilities you draw end up being very useful and actually carry you through... then some runs every random mob will just one shot half your party. The game literally has random mobs that do more damage than any character can possibly have the max health of. \n\nFor instance a level 3 healer character in the second zone has roughly 27 hp. There is a chance you will fight a 3 mob battle that can do roughly 40 damage per turn. They may not do the damage abilities but if they do  you're just S.O.L. Its insanely frustrating that every single aspect of the game is random chance but you need all of them to work perfectly in your favor to stand any chance.\n\nLeveling up characters, gotta pray for useful abilities that work for your part. Fighting enemies, you gotta hope for enemy compositions that don't one shot your party. Completely filling your party, you gotta pray that one of the 3 characters it lets you pick are actually a good combo with the team you've been leveling. Using potions, you gotta pray its a useful potion (more than 50% of them are not good). Getting and using scrolls, you gotta pray that its a useful scroll that actually will help you. Getting equipment, you have to pray its good equipment that actually helps your current party, you also have to pray it isn't cursed which will usually end up completely ruining your run when it is. Map spawns are also completely random and you can and likely will get a bunch of map locations you can't use that just end up providing nothing. Finally bosses are also random, though maybe they aren't random, it may actually be designed to pick the boss that is absolutely the counter to your current team line up.\n\nAdditional to every single thing being random chance with a maybe 1% chance it all works out to give you a decent run, there just isn't enough XP. Every fight drops 2 and only 2 xp. No matter how hard the fight is, or how long it takes. You absolutely have to do the battles for the XP or you might as well just forfeit, and their isn't enough XP in a run to actually flush your team out, you have to use it to level up your ability to use more spells, to draw more cards, to add utility cards, to level up your stats and get new abilities. The final straw on why I just can't suggest the game is that when you do level up it just doesn't impact anything like it should. Enemies in zone one range between 10 and 20 hp, enemies in zone two range between 27 and 40 hp. Your characters in zone one will do about 11-14 damage per mana. Your characters in zone two will do about 15-18 damage per mana. But the game doesn't just level up the enemies it also doubles the quantity of them. 2v3 is the hardest potential match up in zone 1.   3v7 is the hardest potential match up in zone 2. (this only gets worse with every zone).\n\nUnless the developers actually decide that people should enjoy their game and rescale literally any aspect of the game (id say the randomness cause its so out of your control its just asinine) don't buy it. There are dozens of better rogue like games and this one is just not worth it. It had so much potential as it developed through the beta but the developers ignored everything in terms of player feedback and focused on making it more and more frustrating to actually get a decent run.", "timestamp_created": 1628867605, "timestamp_updated": 1628867605, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505033195018768311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97351728": {"recommendationid": "97351728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132178848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1628786960}, "language": "english", "review": "Clich\u00e9 korean story\nUnfair gameplay right at the start\nUnlocking stuff is a chore\nOverall bad concept of the deck building rougelike genre\nGamebreaking bug right after I started playing the game\nSo yeah I personally don't reccomend", "timestamp_created": 1628683318, "timestamp_updated": 1628760835, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.387961447238922119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97263862": {"recommendationid": "97263862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027420272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 493, "last_played": 1628755375}, "language": "english", "review": "in the lastest update they reference among us\n\n10/10, joey lookin pretty sus", "timestamp_created": 1628556008, "timestamp_updated": 1628556008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504950463771820068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97201495": {"recommendationid": "97201495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198952038507", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 612, "last_played": 1635002222}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome character and creature designs, stellar sound track and a mysterious plot that instantly draws you in, if card based combat with a large selection of character, each with their own unique mechanics, sounds like your jam and you're a fan of the rogue-likes then this is for you.\nIf you aren't I'd still recommend checking it out, it might just make you a convert.", "timestamp_created": 1628466226, "timestamp_updated": 1628466226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97092637": {"recommendationid": "97092637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128209897", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "playtime_at_review": 3076, "last_played": 1699658965}, "language": "english", "review": "Good!", "timestamp_created": 1628321148, "timestamp_updated": 1628321148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486381322145462036", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96908277": {"recommendationid": "96908277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099203158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1637, "last_played": 1644614214}, "language": "english", "review": "fun fun", "timestamp_created": 1628049142, "timestamp_updated": 1628049142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96906123": {"recommendationid": "96906123", "author": {"steamid": "76561199194694022", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1821, "last_played": 1686101790}, "language": "english", "review": "This game provides hard difficulty curve with awesome soundtracks and gorgeous anime art.

[spoiler]It's all a virtual world one of the researchers built to sleep through an Ice age, not the promised creepy land you are shown in trailer.

Also, way too much dialog in that last cut scene for a rogue like. You wrote a book, with no way to save and walk away, come back and finish it later. Now, the story is not finished, but I don't see a way to recover from that last bit.

Im a huge fanatic of roguelite strategy games that test my mind and push me to my limits when developing and executing a strategy. I've fallen in love with FTL, Into the Breach, Darkest Dungeon, Slay the Spire and Monster Train, but none of them quite as much as Chrono Ark. Why? Because Chrono Ark makes me feel like an idiot. It's absolutely brilliant in how many different ways you can approach a turn that always has me questioning whether I could've played that better. The sense of complexity and choice in each of the player's actions per turn is unrivaled, and it makes the synergy you build in your characters and deck all the more satisfying to unleash when you absolutely nail a turn. On top of the gameplay, Chrono Ark has gorgeous art and a soundtrack so magical that I jam to it even when I'm not playing. \nMy biggest warning (outside get ready to apply your brain) to prospective players would be the game clarity. A lot of gameplay mechanics and interactions aren't explained the best, if at all, and it made the process of learning the game a lot more difficult. The developers seem to be working on this issue as the game progresses through Early Access and hopefully  it will be fully resolved by the time of release.\nChrono Ark deserves more attention and love than it has gotten over its time in Early Access and I hope if you've played and enjoyed more popular games like Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Darkest Dungeon that you give Chrono Ark a try.

This one is worth checking out. For easy comparison -- if you like deckbuilder games like StS, Monster Train, Griftlands etc then this is a good pickup. It takes the formula we know and does remix it in an interesting and exciting way.\n\nYou have a party of 4 characters (2 at the start of the run but it grows); similar to other games, each character has their own set of skills. What sets Chrono apart is that each character's deck is shuffled together. Whenever you play a skill from hand from a character, that characters other skills goes up by 1 mana until end of turn. This leads to unique combinations of party building where you tend to want an AOE Dps, a Single target DPS, a Healer, and a 'Tank.' Different characters can play different roles depending on who you run into on that run. For example; Joey is a popular healer but one of the best single target DPS if you only draft his DoT skills.\n\nI enjoyed the game despite the story not being engaging for me.

Yes, but if you\u2019re hesitating between this one and Monster Train, just get Monster Train.\n\nElse\u00a0:\n\nReally nice attempt at a deckbuilder dungeon crawler with nice chara-design, but it suffers from asian rpgs sins\u00a0: Some skills are redundant, unbalanced, unnecessarily articulate or downright obscure, making it hard to understand synergies without reading guides (and I hate having to study my games before playing them, as I am here to have fun, not study for exams in asian game design BUT, it could be because of a bad translation -maybe-). Difficulty is unbalanced as well (you can roll on enemies until a boss teabags you in 2 turns), and the devs answered that NOT with a rebalancing sweep, but with the addition of a handheld, immortal easy mode (is this a roguelite or not?). Some characters are just to be avoided because of how useless or weak they are, which makes the diversity of the cast a fake point. A lot of the equipment is also underwhelming. Teleportation scrolls are also useless, as well as hidden tile-revealing ones (because there are no clues as to where to use them, and when you manage to use them well, the loot you get is also underwhelming).\nThe game could use more content as well (levels and foes), but it\u2019s early access, so that\u2019s to be expected.\nAnd the story, well, nobody gives a fcuk about it. Asians creators can\u2019t write scenarios without a useless amount of cringy fluff anyway, as the characters all seem to be mentaly stuck in highschool light novels. I wish they focused on making the game better first.\n\nIt\u2019s fun though.

There's also difficulties though, so if you want it casual you could play on easy and likely have a relaxing experience. I never played below Normal/Expert, as I prefer harder games. \n\nThe issue with this game I find is that a lot of the mechanics are poorly translated/thought out, so an example is that a character will say \"Double X thing when you play this card\" - You have no idea what X thing is. It's never explained, so you're not entirely sure what you're doubling or how it works. \n\nThere are many cards that say do something according to X amount of X, and as it never explained to you what the things it says it is using or doubling are, you have no idea how the card works. This is a big problem in a very difficult card game with no save points. Because all your work can be deleted by you not knowing a mechanic that was never explained and that's just your hour run gone. \n\nI think this idea has been better executed by other devs, however, for the game of its type there are very few. Thus it is a very good game of its type (Party Roguelike Deckbuilder), and would recommend it to people who are specifically looking for that experience. \n\nIf you're looking for a deckbuilding experience and the party system isn't something you are hunting for, I feel like there are better roguelikes out there.

The blend of RPG with deckbuilder is truly unique. Progression is incredibly satisfying and 14 (eventually 20) characters provides immense replay. Music is just fantastic and the bosses so far feel very unique. The RNG is well-balanced. Yes, there's more of it (attacks can be missed/evaded), but there's a lot more deck control and more options in combat. So it's harder to perfectly plan but you have infinitely more leeway to improvise. And because it doesn't get talked about enough, I want to say how much I love the little camp banters between characters. \n\nThere are some concerns though:\n1) Only 3 difficulty levels. They're making the highest (expert) harder, which is good. But there needs to be more granularity between difficulties, with a gradual lead up (like prestige/ascension levels) to the top level which should necessitate near-perfect play.\n\n2) Enemy variety is low. Their compositions are randomized (except for the last stage) but it still feels a little samey. I know they're adding more stages - hopefully these are for the midgame (with fresh enemies) and not something to make runs even longer.\n\n3) It's a tad long for a single sitting. Doable, but not ideal. You do get a good RPG progression out of it though, but like I said above...I'm worried about them adding new stages to the end.\n\n4) Item balance is wonky. There's some epic/legendary equipment that isn't much better than commons (and I don't see much talk about improving them). Characters aren't fully balanced either (and occupy more discussion), but they're not as bad. It's clear the devs will get there.

The skill curve for the game is high but a high skill curve shouldn't mean that the game feels unplayable. You have the option of playing on normal, casual and a hard difficulty, during my play though I played the game on normal. The game makes it feel like causal is the only option to play the game if your new to the game itself and most games aren't like this, most games ease you into the gameplay and mechanics so that winning is possible regardless of the difficulty you play on.  This game is so harsh that even knowing the mechanics of the bosses or enemies your fighting you still have a very high chance of dying or losing to those enemies. The major issue that lies in this game is the gameplay itself, so little is left to the player and more to the systems of the games itself.   \n\nYou healed your party completely and divided up your items equally amongst everyone? \nDie because you keep drawing basic heal and basic attack.\n\nYour party is well rounded with a healer, tank and dps?\nDie because the skills you learned were up to rng and what you want / would have needed won't be drawn.\n\nYou planned out every turn/move you make while playing the game?\nDie because you're taking too long and the fog debuff roles in on turn 3, so your whole party takes aeo damage + the monsters are attacking you on your turn.  Every Turn.\n\nOverall, this game has potential but because of the systems currently in the game, to me at least it's practically a miracle if you actually complete a full run.  The game will explain its systems to you to a certain degree without actually giving you full options on what you as the player can do about them.  Other roguelike games know how to balance out the fun aspects with the frustrating ones and still have the players enthusiastic to play those runs again to get those super hype clutch moments while still having those heavy rng aspects to them. This one doesn't encourage you to keep playing it and in its current state, I think I've barely had any real fun playing it. \n\nIf this game changes enough for me to pick it up again I'll edit my review in the future but for now, this is my current stance on the game.", "timestamp_created": 1610046473, "timestamp_updated": 1610046473, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48285713791847229", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84180875": {"recommendationid": "84180875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052882776", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1697450275}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una mezcla perfecta de Darkest Dungeon y Slay the Spire", "timestamp_created": 1609971188, "timestamp_updated": 1609971188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84005649": {"recommendationid": "84005649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068013081", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1341, "last_played": 1691722427}, "language": "english", "review": "i like this game", "timestamp_created": 1609782310, "timestamp_updated": 1651967133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83939654": {"recommendationid": "83939654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009430786", "num_games_owned": 604, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1609704519}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to be able to give this a positive review but it's just too little content. \nIt feels like with the current amount of content THIS is what should have come out a year ago in early access.\nIf you play on normal you will just fight the second boss over and over with very little deviation besides first character pick.\nIf you play on casual you can reach the final boss of the game in roughly 30ish min. \n\nPros. \n1.

The combat is a fresh take on traditional JRPG team based turn by turn, with an emphasis on drafting a proper team/deck as you progress through a run. Like most other games in the genre you often have to make the most of what you're offered, and can't just run with some predetermined plan (though you can do this to some extent). \n\nGameplay wise you start with two characters of your choice and slowly add more (4 total) throughout each run. Each character has a (admittedly small) card pool where you'll draft from, and your final deck is a combination of all character cards + draw cards. You are not shown enemy intents, but you are shown when they will act, as it is not normally at the end of your turn, but rather in the middle of it. There are other unique mechanics in combat that really do make each fight fun, though at times, it can be a little frustrating as card draw feels a bit limited in most runs (might just be my inexperience here fyi).\n\nThere are only two major issues I see with the game currently. One, some of the English translations, particularly for more complex skills/passive mechanics, are poorly written and honestly quite confusing. You'll figure everything out quickly enough, but there are instances where the first time you use a character or see a specific card and not quite understand what they do. Second, you can't view your discard nor draw pile. Maybe it's just a gameplay/design difference, but I feel that these are two things that the player should always be able to view. The first issue seems like it's being actively worked on, and I honestly can't complain about an Early Access game not having 100% perfect localization (tbh it's at like a 90%+ so I'm nitpicking here).\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of deckbuilders like StS or Monster Train, I highly recommend this game!", "timestamp_created": 1608359498, "timestamp_updated": 1608359498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82342063": {"recommendationid": "82342063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123510958", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 31933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2636, "playtime_at_review": 1589, "last_played": 1700632267}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible deck-building roguelite experience, featuring a great soundtrack, spectacular artwork, and a very unique gameplay system!

Chrono Ark's mechanics are a merging of RPG and CG gameplay that set it apart from other CGs on Steam. Rather than an emphasis on \"deck-building,\" there's a greater focus on team composition and character personalization. Clean UI design and arrangement really feeds into the game's immersion, making it feel less like playing with cards and more like battling in a cinematic, turn-based JRPG fashion.\n\nThe \"less-is-more\" approach to game design adds a lot of weight to player decisions (battle encounter order, inventory management, money/experience utilization, picking abilities) and keeps even early battles intense and engaging. Chrono Ark is so satisfyingly challenging, with a game balance showcasing impactful roguelike choices, rather than parading around with a \"you will die\" difficulty. All-in-all, a thoroughly enjoyable game loop awaits for leisurely breaks and dedicated long runs alike. The experiences are equal parts rewarding and humbling for those that come to appreciate the game and all its nuances.\n\nChrono Ark's presentation really pulls it all together. Sprites and portraits are polished, backgrounds aren't noisy, after effects are plentiful and the color scheme is easy on the eyes. Character design (for enemy/boss types as well as player characters) is varied and interesting, instilling personality and breathing life into the game's universe. On top of the great art design is the music they arranged for the game (menu, hub, stages, encounters). The music alone builds up and maintains the game's atmosphere and helps to pull me in and keep me wanting to play another round. In short, the game is a treat of sight and sound.\n\nI'm always looking forward to more updates.

It is a really challenging game but one with rich strategic depth. When you lose you are responsible, not the RNG, and you can win the fight the next time by thinking about why you lost and playing smarter. I'm only just scratching the surface but I can now tell this is a game I will get many, many hours of enjoyment and challenge from. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys high-stakes strategy RPGs, but be warned that the sharp learning curve means you will spend an hour or two struggling to grasp the basics of the game, and that it is quite difficult and you can't just bang your head against the game until you progress. If you're not up to really working out your tactics, you're going to wind up bouncing off the second or third boss until you give up. \n\nIf this sounds like your cup of tea, definitely buy the game.

The last stage music is epic.\n\nCons:\n- The battle UI can be better than this. The first time I play it, I didn't notice the 'fixed skill' can actually be clicked from the character bar. And there were other things I just realized after playing some rounds.\n- Some of the character skills are off balanced, not too much but I somehow ended up picking the same characters again due to the skills.\n\nSince it's underdevelopment I hope the story could be polished more. The RNG is brutal but it's still fun to play. I haven't tried the expert difficulty yet, since I'm still struggling in the normal difficulty. If there's a Voice Actor for the characters I think it'll be more amazing, but currently it's already nice too. \nI'm currently still intrigued the most by the story, I really hope you can develop it better since it has good premises.

You can get screwed over by RNG, but that's part of the fun. The art is great, and the music is actually pretty fire. Like others have said, each boss has a mechanic that you have to learn about while fighting them, so it was a lot of fun to figure out the best way to beat the boss after dying to them the first time around.

If you've played Steamworld Quest, this also combines deckbuilding with traditional JRPG combat, but aside from having a party with characters' own stats and cards which get shuffled into a communal deck, it has little in common with Quest. Considering the seemingly unknown status of the game, there are surprisingly a ton of unique mechanics this game uses very well, and it's extremely fun.\n\nEach character has a (usually game-changing for the entire party) passive and a relatively tiny set of skills (cards) which interplay with other characters in ways that provide a surprising variety of strategies. That and the seriously cool cardplay and battle system make this quite a special game: I'm tempted to describe every aspect of the combat, as there are so many unique mechanics here which work together great. The turn order system in particular felt confusing and a bit unfair at first, but is actually really neat and ties into healing in a very clever way; basically, healing is most effective if a character isn't attacked twice in a row, like the recoverable bar in certain fighting games. This means you can manipulate turn order so as to get healing turns in between enemies' activations.\n\nIt's a good thing the combat is so special, because there isn't a lot of variety compared with other popular roguelites. There are Relics and character equipment, but the effects seem to be tame stat boosts which don't fundamentally change anything, at least not individually. That's a bit boring, but it's OK because there are a lot of characters and character combos to try, and the combat system is probably best when there isn't the possibility of having untold number of synergies turning you crazy OP like in Slay the Spire and such inspired games.\n\nSome aspects still need development, such as how the ability to save and quit only comes after bosses, around every twenty minutes, and AFAIK you will lose all your progress if you quit or have a computer issue any other time. That's unacceptable for a complete game, but fine for (hopefully) now. In addition, I'd like to see more of the risk-reward options which liven up the early-game of modern roguelites. There's optimization to be had in the way you use the items you find, but as long as you manage to defeat a zone's boss (which to be fair is consistently fun, as they have really clever gimmicks), there aren't many advantages to eke out through clever play. Battles before the first major boss, in particular, feel redundant.\n\nThe result is a one-of-a-kind roguelite that manages to feel more like highly tactical JRPG combat, rather than the standard (and also great!) deckbuilder.

If you're on the fence about this one, here are the mechanics that have made the game stick out to me:\n\n1) Smart card system:\nYou don't discard at the end of each turn. To balance this, your base card draw is very low, encouraging you to save up cards for the right moment rather than play everything at once. On top of this, up to 4 cards can be designated as available anytime (with a one turn cooldown). This both helps to thin the deck and make play more consistent - a great mechanic. Getting cards with card draw is also consistent - there is a special \"shop\" specifically for this.\n\n2) Fair mana system:\nMax mana can be increased at any time, infinitely (for a price). However, mana cost for cards increases with card use. So far, I haven't found any way to break this game with runaway mana/draw, and I have to respect that, because it pops up often in deck-builders.\n\n3) Weirdness:\nEnemies do weird things. Your cards do weird things. Bosses do even weirder things. Most encounters are very unique and demand careful play, even basic ones after the first zone. It really keeps the game from getting old.\n\n4) Health management:\nHard to describe how much I like how the game handles character health. There is a death's door mechanic, but negative health is also a thing. If you don't heal a character that has been hit, they will loose \"healable\" health next time they are hit, and afterwards it is difficult to get them back to full hp. But heals are also insanely strong if you invest in your healer. This leads to a constant \"full health --> near death --> full health --> near death\" loop that is much more interesting and challenging than relying on tanking. You always need to reserve some cards/mana for heals or else.\n\nCould add more, but half the fun of the game is figuring stuff out yourself and getting jump-scared by not understanding the bad translation on a debuff and getting wiped from full hp. (its a lot better than it used to be, but be prepared.)\n\nI'd say current content is worth 60-ish hours to fully enjoy, more if you want to win with all characters or challenge yourself not to use some of them.

In addition to being a mouthful of a genre, it's got a lot of really cool and unique mechanics.  You form a party of 4 characters, starting with 2 of your choice, and then drafting 2 more over the course of the game.  Each character's (known as an Investigator) skills get shuffled up in a single deck to draw your hand out of. \n\nAs you're playing cards, enemies have a turn counter that ticks down, and they'll take their actions when they hit 0, so you'll want to consider that with when and what you play.  Your characters will also become overloaded as they play more cards in a single turn, causing their cards to become more expensive.\n\nHealth is also pretty unusual.  When a character takes damage, their health becomes a green \u201chealing gauge\u201d, which can be refilled with healing as normal, but if they get hit again, that green bar will become black, and the new life they lost will become the healing gauge instead. Black health is much more difficult to recover, requiring 3 times the normal healing to recover.  There's also a Death's Door system.  A character won't die from being below 0 life until they take one more hit.  If you can get them back above 0, they'll be fine for another hit.  All green health is also healed at the end of every fight, so if you can kill enemies quickly, you can sometimes finish fights without taking much damage at all.\n\nThere are something like 20 characters in the game, divided between Defender, Support, and Attacker archetypes, and they all have very unique mechanics.  My favorite is a support named Sizz who has a doll named Eve that will move between allies as you cast ally-targeted skills and follow up any attacks they make.  A few others include Azar, an attacker that can create free illusion sword cards to poke at enemies, or Miss Chain, a defender with a flaming chainsaw whose cards get extra effects if she's already played another card in the last 2 turns.\n\nThe game's still in early access, but should be coming out in the next few months.

It gives you some sense of satisfactory when you look back and see how noobish you were the time you begun. Overall game system is just like that of Darkest Dungeon:\n\n- Pick mercenaries to start your adventure in search for next \"Time-shade\". \n- Walk around in same maps (no procedurally-generated map?) with random map elements (shop, chest, relic enhance, etc), with campfire between stages. \n- Deck-based combat mechanism. All chars start with basic attack and heal cards, their role becomes more pronounce as you level them up. It's less straightforward than Darkest Dungeon, but still enjoyable to play.\n- You can't save, because you're supposed to die. And most stuff reset each play, only a currency and story carry over.\n\nSometimes the enemies are too strong, it give raise to question \"Am I supposed to die here, or is my team just garbage?\" I saw a boss attacking you once and your team basically died twice.. (HP can goes negative in this game, but they won't die in one hit because there's \"Death's Door\" mechanism here as well) Boss fights are fun and challenging, but map navigation is a complete chore.\n\nThe story, though, is little fragmented. From the start, it seems her mom left her in the room and suddenly she just walk out and trying to \"run the clock\" while random strangers willing to die for her because the kid seems to know what to do. I think it's bad story-building? And you can go on playing for minutes without any new pieces of story because you just keep dying, and wonder what was this game's all about again? \n\nThe game based on Unity Engine, so you can expect some stutter when there're heavy effects, but it won't really affect gameplay because it's semi turn-based.

I've seen other reviews compare it to a cross between StS and Darkest Dungeon, but in reality it's more of a classic dungeoncrawler where your actions in combat are dictated by the cards that each character has. The combat is the same that you can expect from any dungeoncrawler, but also adds a series of different functionalities that really work well with the card system.\nBeware that the game is quite hard, I've yet to beat it at the hardest difficulty (as of patch 1.2) despite me getting better and more knowlodgeable about the various mechanics and the sinergies between the characters, but I somehow keep wiping in the later stages, especially at the endgame bosses. About them, every single boss is really unique and different from the usual, they really require you to focus and think at what you are doing in order to be beaten,  it's definitely the thing I like the most in this game.\n\nOh also the OST is fantastic.\n\nSo damn yeah I do recommend this game.\n\nEDIT: Came back to the ark in patch 1.9 after a long hiatus since 1.4 and I'm surprised by how good this game has progressed. Probably my favourite deckbuilder by now.\n\nIf I have to pick ONE flaw. Due to the complexity of the various cards interactions some mechanics are not explained too clearly, but that's about it.

There are still things that are being actively developed and the game is in Early Access. You may encounter some bugs if you play at this time.\n\nThere is a small tutorial, though I do hope that this will get updated to be better. When you play through it once, you cannot see it again. And while some basics are explained, a lot are left to the player to learn through trial and error.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels, Casual, Normal, and Hard. Casual mode shows up after you lose once or twice on Normal difficulty. You cannot unlock new characters in the Casual mode.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe Ark was constructed a long time ago to try to save the world from catastrophe, but its creators disappeared. The world is slowly deteriorating and the legend around the Ark is that the Clock Tower within the Ark can restore the world to a time of the past, essentially reverting back to better and happier times. Nobody know the truth behind this claim but the protagonist, Lucy, seems to be connected to the original creators of the Ark. She will try to save the world, with the help of the characters who will fight with her to achieve their mutual goal.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou play as Lucy, who will choose two characters/friends to fight by her side at the beginning of the run. Lucy does not fight herself, but offers abilities that can come in useful during the fights.\n\nWalking around the world map on each level, Lucy will encounter different areas of interest, such as shops, chests, loot, enemies, and bosses. You will be able to move to the next level once you defeat the boss for that area. In between levels, you may have the option of recruiting more characters for your party to make the game more dynamic as you move along.\n\nThe battles are turn-based and you use the few skills/cards that you have for each individual character to defeat the enemies. The fighting system can be a bit difficult to get used to because there are a few different variables to pay attention to. For example, the enemies have a count-down that allows them to perform an action during your turn, and this counts down each time you perform an action.\n\nWinning battles means that you will earn loot in the forms of gold, items, soulstones, and credits. Soulstones can be used to level up your characters and also to upgrade Lucy's skills. Everything is used in the same run, except for credits, which are used in the meta-game to give you a permanent progression unlock. This is done in between runs. You will need many runs to unlock everything.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics are very good. The designs in the overworld all looks very cute, whereas in the battles, you can see the usual signs of danger.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe music can be quite intense at times, it seems appropriate.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nYou can play the entire game with the mouse, this mouse-based movement was introduced by a recent update. This is nice because there are some people who don't like to use a keyboard. You can move around using a keyboard, this is sometimes easier.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Video[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDU-qB8W1iA\n\n[h1]Pricing[/h1]\nThe game has a reasonable price, it is 13.99 Euro/16.99 USD at the base asking price right now in Early Access. It has enough content to keep you entertained for a while.\nIt likely will increase as the game develops more.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nIt was a bit overwhelming at first because of the many things that I needed to learn, especially because the tutorial is not that informative. Once I became accustomed to the game system and mechanics, I really enjoyed my time so far. The game is really hard on normal mode, and I still cannot beat level 3 regular monsters when I get there.\n\nI do hope that the game will be better balanced at full release.\n\nOverall score: 7/10\n\n[quote]I received the product for free.

I strongly believe that's a choice that only hurts the story overall in its current state despite the updates to the story scenes in 2.0. More on that below.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]- The Good -[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]Nice art\n    [*]Great OST (I would buy it they decided to sell it on Steam).\n    [*]Enough characters to build what you want most of the time.\n    [*]Doesn't come down to luck to finish fights (in most cases).\n    [*]In case the games crashes it now auto saves at the last campfire you visit.\n    [*]It's not hard to pick up decent enough items to help you finish the run.\n    [*]The story overall is interesting, and losing some runs and winning some will progress it.\n[/list]\n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]- The Bad -[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]Removal of the Fate Episode made the story less compelling, since they constantly refer to the events of the Fate Episode's \"Game\" yet now we can't see what happened in a interesting or interactive way, nor does the game (at least in the English translation) explain these events well enough to understand what even transpired prior to the current event. We just get that it kind of just \"happened\" at best and we see what the end caused. But almost nothing in between those two points. It also helped flesh out the characters personalities a bit more. They seem to be trying to mitigate that loss by adding the friendship system into the games but so far I'm more interested in their pasts than their \"current selves\".\nThe devs said they might make it a standalone game, though I'd rather just see a revised version of the Fate Episode as an update later on if possible before the full release of the game.\n\n    [*]When getting more character mid run (since each run starts with 2 and you can get a max of 4), it's pretty rough when you don't get any options that fill in what your looking for. (The only thing really luck based to me).\n[/list]\n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]- Neutral -[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]Issues with the correct names being displayed on a certain story boss.  \nSpoiler as for what fight in question: [spoiler]Azar's and Lucy's names are incorrectly displayed sometimes during the intro to Azar's fight.[/spoiler] \n    [*]Steam Workshop has little to no documentation to help players who might want to start modding the game.\n    [*]The friendship system. (I just haven't done enough of it yet to know if this was a good replacement of the Fate Episode yet.)\n    [*] I soft locked the game using Phoenix's External Flame...

I honestly was hooked from the start, but waited to write this review until I had reached my personal goal of clearing normal difficulty of the available content at of EA version 1.1g (ending with the [spoiler] Reaper boss [/spoiler]) so I could have the proper perspective on the game. \n\nPositives:\n[list]\n[*]As of this review, there are 12 heroes (with 20 planned it seems) and they all (with my personal exception of one [spoiler] the Phoenix, which is just a bit \"gimmicky\" for my taste) [/spoiler] feel great. Every hero has a purpose, multiple ways to build them, unique / creative concepts / mechanics, and just feels [i]fun[/i] to try out each one as you unlock them and try new combos and strategies.\n\n[*]A different approach to leveling up. In the course of a run (this is a rogue-lite, after all) you'll get these \"Soul Stone\" items which you use to level up not only your heroes, but your main person (Lucy) as well. This gives you a flexibility to choose how your party progresses in strength, and gives you, the player, more control over your strategy.\n\n[*]You get your main person (Lucy) who works alongside your party of (up to) 4 heroes, fulfilling a certain kinda of support; not only in cards which specialize in drawing cards, but also a couple of other ways, like enhancing a hero's card for that battle, and other potent effects.\n\n[*]As I mentioned in my first point, the teambuilding in this game feels great. I've played a lot of other deckbuilders, and Slay the Spire is great of course, but it's cool to see a team-based deckbuilder roguelite adventure game carve out its own niche in an ever-growing market where it seems like everyone is making their own deckbuilder game.\n\n[*]Meta progression unlocks cool stuff for your future runs, similar to other roguelites. Using these \"credits\" which you get from defeating bosses n such during a run, you can unlock not only more equipment & relics, but also more common skills (skills which can be used by any hero) for your heroes to learn (and more skills for Lucy to learn). These unlocks, of course, help you become stronger for subsequent runs. Thankfully, the game is very much skill based, so while these unlocks help, player skill is [i]really[/i] what leads to success on a run, not how much you've unlocked.\n\n[*]A different approach to battles. In most deckbuilders, it goes \"my turn -- enemy's turn\". In this game, it uses a system where enemies go after X number of actions (as indicated next to an enemy) which you do, meaning the enemies can \"interrupt you during your turn\". There are some ways around this, but the point is that you have to carefully plan out your turns around this mechanic and pay attention not only to your mana, but to what the enemies are doing as well.\n\n[*]Similar to Darkest Dungeon, this game uses the \"On Death's Door\" mechanic for dying, meaning that the game will give you a chance to heal a hero before they die (and thus taking them off Death's Door). I like this mechanic's flexibility, as it allows you to react to bad situations most of the time instead of \"lol you're suddenly dead\" (though sudden fatalities can still happen, of course).\n[/list]\nI could go on about a few things, but I'll go over some \"Negatives\", which overall aren't that bad in my opinion, but I'll mention a few things so you can have a better picture:\n[list]\n[*]The developer is Korean, meaning that the English translation can be \"a little rough\" at times. While this may be the case, I've never really had any \"issues\" with being able to read things, and quite recently before writing this review, the developer had done another localization sweep and significantly improved the English from its former state. Essentially, yes, it's a translation, but the developer has shown that they care about making sure it's readable / playable for English players as well.\n\n[*]There are a few wonky / odd mechanics and explanations in the game. Admittedly, it would be a little difficult to describe some of these oddities if you weren't already familiar with the game, but suffice to say there is a little bit of learning curve with some of the heroes / skills / items / consumables / bosses / etc because some thing don't explain themselves very well or don't act in the way you would've \"expected them to\". I can quite understand how this might be a little troublesome for some players who might have less amounts of patience per se, but if you're willing to give the game a chance instead of ragequitting when an unexpected or \"seemingly unexplained\" thing happens and take the time to understand it, your future runs will be fine. Remember: things happen for a reason, and I've had a lot of \"Oh I get it now\" moments while playing this game.\n\n[*]More of a \"mixed\" instead of pure negative: As of this review, you get some unlocked rewards for beating the current content with any given hero on normal difficulty (one unlock per hero), but [i]don't[/i] get any rewards for clearing it on hard. I [i]guess or presume[/i] that this might change in the future, but mentioning it here so people are aware.\n\n[*]During boss encounters, you don't win until you defeat [i]all enemies on the screen[/i]. This means you have to kill summoned minions even if you kill the boss first. Some might consider this \"generally annoying\" (in terms of taking more time), and others might even get a little upset when they \"barely killed the boss but then got killed by the leftover minion so the victory doesn't count and it's actually a defeat\" (that's happened to me before haha). So, it's not the end of the world to me, and I can understand this mechanic existing, but some might not be that keen on it.\n[/list]\nI think I'll cut things there for now.\n\nSo, if I had to describe what this game \"feels like\" to me, I'd say it's like someone combined elements of Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon, and a Chinese / Korean Dungeon Crawler RPG, blended it up, and made it their own. I can tell from just how creative the various heroes and mechanics are that this developer cares about not only making games, but playing them.

It's a neat and interesting system that gives you more control over your in-combat choices. Do you level one of your party for more stats and a shot at a powerful card? Or do you level Lucy for more strategic flexibility and choice? There's no right answer and it depends on your party, items, and playstyle.\n\nSpeaking of party there's a colorful cast of characters (with more you can unlock through playing) that can really alter the way you play.

If you like SoS like games, you\u2019d enjoy this game (at least for the first 2-3 hours I hope).\n\nNow, here are comments for the game.\n\n1.    I hate liars. When the steam profile suggests a game supports Eng, I expect to play the game in Eng, not an alien language in disguise. I saw a comment from the developer saying he/she recently found out about the problems and working on it. Idk, I felt near impossible and it just ruined most of the game. Well, try to enjoy finding out what skill does what on an extremely difficult game.\n\n2.    I had to force myself for the second run. Usually, this kind of game gives you a reason for it. May it be more cards, skills, weapons, stories, and whatnot, there is an initiative that forces players to go further. But combined with saving issues of the game, it\u2019s really hard to find any reason to do so. \n\nLet me elaborate a bit more. A player finishes a run-through, comes back to the town and see absolutely zero changes. There are unlockable factors, (that doesn\u2019t appeal at all in my honest opinion.) The main problem is that although you are working on a very clear goal and sees nothing in that aspect. (By the storyline, the player goes back to where she started the game without any change.) In the end, the player doesn\u2019t get stronger, nor see any progress story-wise, or experience any changes he/she made by the previous run. I am sure this will be fixed with more updates, but meanwhile, I\u2019d love to see more reasons to continue the game. \n\n3.    Intentional or not, I want to argue the game has the worst save system ever. EVER. I can\u2019t even imagine why it is the way it is, but a player cannot save a system except at the start of each chapter. For difficulty, it can just be every turn of every fight (more like xcom style.) For each chapter takes about 20m, you will be forced to choose to play the game or just stop on the start of each chapter and knowing that if you starting a chapter will erase your save file, you\u2019d avoid playing the game entirely until you are absolutely sure you have more than half of an hour. (I mean, that\u2019s really not a big deal, but why?)\n\n4.

Turns out that the creators of Ark disappeared with a trace and now, even thought it's safe at the moment, the future of Ark looks grim. Thus they formed an investigation squad to sent outside, for gathering information and searching for fragments of the mysterious clock tower, which among some theories, could turn back the time before \"the Grand Catastrophe\" happened.\n\nDuring your runs, you will find stuff like tapes, photos and videos, which will explain more about the story.

Most normal battles got a hard requirement of MAX turns available and if you exceed that number, you will receive a strong HP Damage-over-time and Healing debuffs. \n\nYour best bet is 1 DPS + 2 Tanks + Healer or 2 DPS + Tank + Healer.\nMy personal favorite is 1 DPS + 1 HybridDPS Tank + Full Support Tank (Ironheart) + Healer.\nIt's hard to advice a specific character, because they all are usable and you need to build them in a manner that you want to play. \n\nThere's not much to say about dungeon exploration, you move your character in isometric-like style, while collecting stuff on the ground and engaging in battles.\nThere's a few events that you need to pay attention to:\n1) Trader - this guy here will sell random equipments, skillbooks and scrolls. Important: ALWAYS BUY all available \"KEY\" first, other than that, pay attention to the skillboks, sometimes there great abilities like \"Double Attack\", \"Rash\" and some others.\n\n2) Library - this thing can do one equipment item enchant FOR FREE. However, you should have at least 200/400 Gold with you for a reroll in-case you get a negative (debuff) effect.\n\n3) Smithery - this one is important in case you get too much artifacts and want to turn useless ones into a new random one higher tier or transform it into another random artifact within same tier.\nTiers are as follows -> White -> Green -> Blue -> Purple -> Orange.\nFor Purple don't mistake Equipment and Relic items, Purple relic items are actually placed in a specific box, which you can find in your camp, when you rest between stages.\n\n4) Altar of Greed - the one building that will ask you for food and in exchange will give you random items. So far here's the list of items that i managed to find there:\n- 1 Gold\n- 400 Gold\n- Legendary (Orange) tier skills for Lucy, this one is a Jackpot, honestly.\n- Potions \nThis building is always a risky move, so be aware.\n\n5) Water Oasis, that will make you forget one skill and choose another. Recommended to use on Lucy to get a better Draw skill. Not sure if erased skill is random or not, so keep that in mind.\n\n6) Mysterious Pot - throw 2 useless items in there and get a new random one. Potions with negative effects are your best candidates\n\n[b]Now, let's move to the most interesting part of the game.\t[/b]\nBattles in the game is like a TCG with dungeon crawler RNG elements. All skill/cards and enemies animations are flashy and well done. The gameplay itself is pretty dynamic and fast too.\n\nEach turn you will draw random cards from your deck, that you can use. Even though Lucy don't fight at front line, her skills will help you greatly to get more available cards in your hand.\n\nWhen you receive damage, you will notice a green HP bar - this is one of the most important mechanics in the game. While the bar is green you need to heal that character HP, if he will receive another hit, he will lose a big portion of that green bar.\nWhile it is still possible to heal characters even if they lost the green bar, the effect of that healing will be heavily diminished (it will be like 60% or more weaker, compared to base Heal value).\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1947509660 \nThere's a lof of possible characters/card combination and most of them you should be able to understand with common sense & experience (after you play the game for a few hours).\nAnother very important battle note is \"Fixed skills\". \n\n\"Fixed\" skill will become available each turn, however, for most skills you can only use 1 fixed skill each turn, the others will turn gray.\nThe cost of fixed skill permanently raise up by one point and you will no be able to draw it from deck via normal means.\nAlso, some skills can't be fixed and the only way to use them is to draw via normal means.\n\nThe boss fights in this game can be really tricky, pay close attention to what the boss do and all various buffs on them and pop-ups. I will speak only about the current available last boss in the game, because that guy is a walking disaster. Other bosses you should defeat without much problems, just pay attention.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1947509814  \nOkay, the most annoying boss fight in the game, that can make you rage - The Reaper. \nNote: make sure you at least at Normal difficulty, otherwise you will not be able to unlock new character.\n\nThe Reaper got a pretty dangerous mechanic that will result in a party wipe if you're unlucky or didn't pay attention.\n\nEach time when you press \"End Turn\" the boss will inflicts one target with Death Sentence debuff. However, there's a clear pattern when he choose his target -> he attacks the target which skill is curently is on the top of your hand. \n\nThis means every turn you need to have a different character skill on top of your hand or it's pretty much a gameover. While it's possible to survive ONE Death Sentence, the second is a 100% finish.\n\nDeath Sentence = 20 True Damage (ignores everything) to your entire party. Death Sentence activates each time when he hit the target already affected by this debuff, that's why you need to take this debuff with different character each time.\n\nGood luck and let the RNG be with you!\n\n[h1] The Final Verdict[/h1]\n8.5/10\nThe game is really good, you can feel the passion and talent from the devs, even when it lacks content and there's a lot of typos too. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\nThe battle system and overall game balance are well thought too. \n\n- This review was presented to you by \"Casual Game Reviews\" Steam Curator\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32296668-Casual-Game-Reviews/] Casual Game Reviews Steam Curator page.

(*\u00b4\u03c9\uff40*)[/b]\n\n[h1][b][1] Intro [/b][/h1]\nChrono Ark. It's a hybrid single player game made by Al Fine and localized by BADA Games. This little indie game includes a variety of genres. Party-Based RPG, Deck Building, Roguelike, and so on. This game finally started early access through the initial development period of over two years and crowd-funding. It means that this game makes a big bet on itself.\n\n[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game experience was better than expected. This is definitely an indie game. The overall content is rough, but it gives the impression that each one is packed with care. You begin as a girl who has lost her memory in an endangered mystical world. But she has the potential to save the world. Her name is Lucy. As the story unfolds, Lucy recruits colleagues and begins her journey with them. The effects that represent the event are somewhat clunky, but it's not bad at all, and it helps to immerse the player in the game.\n\nEach colleague has a unique story background, stats and skills. And these abilities and skills are based on random elements. As you explore different areas in this game, you can get items with artifacts, unlock secrets, and reach the truth. Character sprites are neat and impressive. There are standing CGs, SD characters, and event cutscenes. The battle is strategic and addictive. But It is a bit complicated and unbalanced. And the text font for descriptions is too small. The translation quality is fine overall, but sometimes it is too straightforward. Despite the early access, games have a lot of potential.\n\n[h1][b][3] Pros (+) & Cons (-) [/b][/h1]\n[table]\n[td][list]\n[*][+] Interesting Story\n[*][+] Nice Replay Value\n[*][+] Attractive Characters\n[*][+] Hybrid Genre Games\n[*][+] Cute Anime Artworks\n[/list][/td]\n[td][list]\n[*][-] Minor Bugs\n[*][-] Complicated\n[*][-] Slow Gamepace\n[*][-] Small Text Fonts\n[*][-] No Voice Effects\n[/list][/td]\n[/table]\n\n[h1][b][4] Verdict[/b][/h1]\nChrono Ark. It is an impressive indie game or a hidden gem-like game. This game shows the player many possibilities. Once you start the game, you can't quit easily. At first glance the game looks plain and familiar, but the actual gaming experience is fresh and impressive. The game is still early access. So if the developer team keeps improving the game with the feedback from the users, it will be a great game.
