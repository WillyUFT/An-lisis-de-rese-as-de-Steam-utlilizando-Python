The game doesn't minimize. The controls make no sense. To start you press enter, but confusingly enter is space, and there's mouse input which activates buttons no matter where you click. Shift is run, but it's practically the same speed as walking. The music is messy, and the sound cue at the end of a level is jarring. There being multiple objectives can be confusing. The story and world make no sense, and the view constantly rotating is sickening. The flashes of white light are pointlessly blinding (grey would have [i]looked[/i] the same, and worked fine).\n\nSometimes you can pass through the lasers, but they look pretty much the same regardless of whether they're in a state that will kill you or not. Underwater lasers kill you, how is that immersive? I guess you could say that the lasers were immersed, but I wasn't. One of the most awkward mechanics I've ever seen in a game is trying to move down a tunnel alongside the lasers, but your character can't move [i]alongside[/i] the lasers because it'll only travel at an angle, so you're constantly tapping the arrow keys - it feels like poor design rather than a fun challenge.\n\nThe gameplay in general is confusing. Every few steps, the world suddenly flips around (and the music suddenly changes), but it all looks the same, so you don't know which way you're going. I got lost frequently (and stuck; it feels bizarre to get stuck on a 2D platformer). Some rocks you're supposed to stand on, while others will just get you killed because you'll fall through them. Enemies arrive from off-screen and kill you in about a tenth of a second. The levels aren't [i]level[/i], they're all warped (almost beyond playability). You can never line up a jump because every step you take disorients the entire screen.\n\nThe screen doesn't show enough of the world around you. Sometimes you just have to guess what you're supposed to do, like assuming you can jump to something off-screen. To add to the frustration of the screen rotating (when there's dangers everywhere next to you) is that your character will keep moving when you don't want it to, so you have to wait and see if it strays into the danger - there might be a moment of judgement to trying to manage this sliding mechanic, but I found it really annoying to have to do. The old Mario games were far more satisfyingly responsive in comparison.\n\nThe game is absolutely full of noob traps that disrupt the flow of gameplay - you'd never complete even a small slice of this in one go without dying, you'd have to find out the hard way all the ridiculous things that kill you. What on Earth was the point of making the character cute if you're just going to kill it off like that every few seconds? Who would I recommend this to? I feel like dying is meaningless if you're essentially forced into it around every other corner.\n\nThere aren't enough checkpoints between the clunky parts of the game. It's a dreary experience having to go through them over and over just to go through more, and expecting even more of the same ahead. Even on the (few) bits that aren't disorienting, having to dodge multiple enemies (if not waves of them) is still really awkward. The gravity isn't even consistent - some of the ground will attract your character, but some of it won't. Some of the enemies don't even [i]move[/i] consistently. \n\nIt's more chaotic than skillful. Would anyone even enjoy spreedrunning it? I don't know why this game has a \"casual\" tag, it's extremely sweaty. I'm amazed at how many issues they packed into such a simple looking game. As cheap cartoonish platformers go, BEEP was far better. I don't remember the Mario Gameboy games having these nonsense mechanics; I'd rather go back and play Super Mario Land 2 (released in 1992) honestly.", "timestamp_created": 1682345772, "timestamp_updated": 1682346175, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136986736": {"recommendationid": "136986736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090275708", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1697859131}, "language": "english", "review": "oh man this game is sooooooo FUN!, except the fact that i died a hundred times but it is just fun dying and then doing it again i just love the fact that it is so fast, even after dying you respawn instantly which makes it more fun, it is fast, fun, crazy, creative and the concept of screen flipping is amazing, i gotta tell you it did give me nausea but i love it.", "timestamp_created": 1681960487, "timestamp_updated": 1681960487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136405146": {"recommendationid": "136405146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036297204", "num_games_owned": 1253, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 905, "last_played": 1675802468}, "language": "english", "review": "I both adore and hate this game. We took turns with my soulmate in playing [i]Airscape[/i], because sooner than later your head is gonna get dizzy from it.\n\nWe are playing as Orange octopus on a quest of saving its family from a clutches of some mean alien abductors! As we go through the levels in 18 zones we have to save sea critters as they are needed for our progression. Good thing is that we don't have to collect every one of them in the respective zone as the next one opens with a lesser number. Pretty convenient with harder levels.\nOnce we save our otcopus siblings they can be used in the game, some of the levels are even better suited for their specific abilities (although it should be possible to complete each level with every octopus, I am not gonna test it for sure). Mind you, the last ultimate Boss fight will be Orange's duty which doesn't have any special skills.\n\nThe game description doesn't lie - [i]ultra-challenging[/i]. Yes. It's very, VERY MUCH challenging. I can't possibly stress enough how challenging it really is. Don't be fooled by its colorful and cute graphics, because you are gonna get smashed, squashed, blasted, minced, disintegrated, eaten or drowned in acid on a regular basis. It's [i]fast-paced[/i]. Yes, you need to be quick, because most of the hazardous things around actively seek to destroy you. You are left with only a fragment of a second to make a jump or slide or run and most of the time you are not gonna make it. Majority of the levels can't be done on a first try, because you are going blindly ahead and you are gonna meet some nasty surprises on the run. Practice makes perfect.\n\nWith a high probability you will get motion sickness from [i]Airscape[/i], because of the frantic rotation that happens all the time! There isn't much you can do with it. You can lower the screen rotation rate, which will seem like a good idea at the beginning, but later in the game you will get in some tight spots because of it. What is mandatory to know when controlling your octopus is that you move where you \"look\". So as the screen rotates you can suddenly move the other way and die. You can center your view by a dedicated keyboard button, but realizing where exactly you are will just rob you of a precious time. Also the rotation actually helps your octopus to gain momentum in quicker sequences. In the end we set it back to normal.\n\nAs for the difficulty, I will repeat yet again, it's high. Each level has usually two or three checkpoints from which you are gonna start when you die. Sometimes it doesn't seem enough though and some sequences are quite punishing, frustrating even. In such a case it is best to take a break from the game. After all, we were playing through it with combined powers since 2020.\n\nI think [i]Airscape[/i] deserves a recommendation although it's certainly not for everyone and those who decide to play it can feel pretty miserable from time to time.

I have no problems with hard games: dying, losing and retrying is a huge part of the fun for me when I play them but from my experience this is the wrong kind of hard. Early on the game is quite fun and you can easily get to grips with the gameplay but it progresses in difficulty extremely quickly; this is mainly due to the controls being incredibly slippery thanks to your octopus' momentum so you're constantly sliding into hazards. The game's physics are also shoddy, sometimes the game reacts the way you expect it to but if you're on a moving or spinning platform then I hope RNG is on your side because sometimes when you jump you will just get flung into a hazard or out of the stage with zero warning thus causing you to suffer a cheap death. It's a precision platformer yet the controls and physics lack precision, which isn't good.\n\nBut not only that, your hitbox feels surprisingly massive as there are far too many times where I should be safe only to get killed or where I clearly jumped over an obstacle but it somehow counted as a death anyway. The game also has a bad habit of introducing new mechanics and level design without that \"safety net\" most other platformers use to quickly ease you in, so you're expected to know exactly what to do right away otherwise you die yet another cheap death. More often than not it's something ridiculous like having to fling yourself a great distance from a body of water or a platform that rockets you up into the ceiling and you have to tilt it right otherwise, you guessed it, you die. Those sound great on paper and they should be in practice but in actuality they are infuriatingly hard and stupendously inconsistent to the point I lost my temper in world 4.\n\nWhile I don't play many platformers, I actually like them quite a bit but Airscape just felt horribly sloppy to play, it's like the developer tried aiming for Super Meat Boy difficulty without the incredibly tight and responsive controls and a much greater overuse of poorly placed hazards. I feel It's the kind of hard game where the thought process was to make a hard game that people will die on all the time which is unlike most good hard game which are made to be challenging, exhilarating and making you feel like a champ when you overcome those trials; I never once felt that during my time in Airscape - I just felt like the game was simply wasting my time with BS artificial difficulty.\n\nI honestly don't understand why Airscape is so highly rated, for me it became an absolute chore after a single hour and I REALLY wanted to like this game because I adore its style, aesthetic, the cute octopuses and its amazingly creative approach to platforming but I just felt I was constantly kicked in the shins and I really don't want to play anymore of it. I feel if this game took a more chilled out, relaxed and zen approach to its gameplay with a greater emphasis on the puzzle aspects to perfectly fit its aesthetic then I would love Airscape with a burning passion. But as it stands, unless you want to torment yourself with a needlessly hard game that feels almost trial and error, I have to give this a firm thumbs down.", "timestamp_created": 1632643952, "timestamp_updated": 1632643952, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601587235927581787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99420747": {"recommendationid": "99420747", "author": {"steamid": "76561199018760768", "num_games_owned": 857, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1630633798}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Te puede servir para cromos", "timestamp_created": 1631753827, "timestamp_updated": 1631753827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98911324": {"recommendationid": "98911324", "author": {"steamid": "76561199135792634", "num_games_owned": 1786, "num_reviews": 296, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1663804642}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite the very low price (on sale), the game turned out to be very good.

(I have also played Celeste, another notoriously hard platformer, and I can say that this one is harder.) Simply beating this game is a real accomplishment. The main skill you'll need is enough patience to not ragequit when you die for the 45th time on a single level.\n[b]Aesthetics (Graphics and Soundtrack):[/b] The art of this game is very well polished. There are a multitude of different areas, and all of them look unique. I particularly like the contrast between the menacing-looking black and red hazards with the bright, almost cartoonish appearance of the player character. The music is not memorable but still good and it fits together well with the rest of the game.\n[b]Cost:[/b] I got this game on a 90% sale, for only 49 cents, which almost feels like stealing to me. (For a time I considered uninstalling this game then buying it again just to support the developers). I've seen it go on 90% sales several times before and I'm sure it will again if you want to wait, although I think it's worth the money even at full price.\n[b]Motion Sickness:[/b] One final note, because I've seen a lot of people complain about how this game is nauseating to play. In the settings there is a slider that changes how much the camera rotates with the player. At one end the camera will not rotate at all, and at the other end it will rotate with the player. The default setting is precisely in the middle, which is highly disorienting.

Otherwise, this game is amazing in all aspects for being such a hidden title! The core it's the top-notch gameplay! Level desing alone it's nearly perfect!\n\nThere are a HUGE amount of levels here, an orchestral beatiful soundtrack, nice cartoon cute graphics and a lot of skill to master! The game start very basic and simple at normal difficulty. Then it gets hard and harder each world you beat. By the time you reach late game like world number 13 the game goes to TOTALLY INSANE difficulty! And I'm not joking as I think this is one of the hardest platformer games I beated in my entire life. This game transforms into PURE MADNESS! Souls-like level of challange and reminding me of the hardest NES games! Also, no cheap deaths here as the gameplay it's purely skilled and learning well the approach to each level!!\n\nIt took me about 14 hours to 101% this little BRUTAL amazing monster and I think that it could be beated in 4-5 hours if it wasn't for the HOURS of dying over and over! So you can have maybe a better picture of what you're getting if you try to beat this. If you can go beyond that level of challange then you will enjoy a masterpiece little game! I have played platform games all my life and this blow me away!\n\nNew characters to unlock every now and then with unique abilities each one! The WORLD it's amazing too! Each zone has like 3-4 unique stages! Then the next zone will have a totally new aesthetic! You don't see this every day in modern games and even less in such hidden gems! More than 16 zones will make you never became bored and constant new threats in each one to step up the challenge!\n\nEven the boss stages here are cool! I really can't say anything bad about this game besides its challange! Sometimes little glitches can happen but nothing game breaking nor crashing. Only minor spawn or graphical ones. This is such a polished product from a game developer that sadly nobody knows about! I googled and I couldn't find more games from them! I would be glad to discover and play all the games of this developer. Since the game it's 5 years old at the time of writing this I suspect that the sales didn't went that well or the company simple vanished! Such a shame because this little amazing game can compete with the best classic challenging 2D platform games without even sweating!!!\n\nI CURSED a lot in this journey! I'm looking at you world 13!!! And of course also I nearly died myself to the rolling rock in world 15. Complete HELL! Even the final boss it's really hard! And the extra master staqes are MADNESS! This game never ever let you rest!! You think you have witnessed everything about this at world 16? You are wrong. Sorry! This game will test your soul till the very end of the real last stage of the whole game!!\n\nIt takes some time to be comfortable with the gravity mechanic and even more with the camera! I HARDLY reccomend to play this game with a controller! You will need every possible bit of precision you can get!! The are sections so tight and nearly pixel perfect! \n\nDevelopers of this game knowed at the fullest the level desing of hardcore platformers! I think they have played those kind of games for long years like I and that's reflected in every level! I clap to them for making an insane but correct challenging game even to those who love the genre and nowadays rarely can found a new game that REALLY test their skills beyond the maximum level!!\n\nAirscape The Fall of Gravity gets an amazing little gem top-notch challenging gameplay score of 9.5/10!\nMUST have for hardcore 2D platformer lovers!

At first the game was fun; a cinematic story intro, a simple but beautiful overall design, entertaining mechanics and enough levels to play. For the amount of money I paid for this game, it\u2019s somewhat stunning how good it is at some aspects. However, the real downside of this game for me was that the movement system felt clumsy and some collisions were headache worthy. Furthermore, the new mechanics in every level were sometimes a bit too much. I like to speed run games like these, but in this game speed running will often result in you dying due to the massive number of hostile environments or CPU\u2019s. Together with the sometimes, mostly in water, clumsy movement system, this can destroy all your fun while playing and turn it into what was for me a somewhat rage-ish / annoyed feeling. Therefore, the many maps do not attract and feel more like a big barrier. I tried to play this game several times, but every time it resulted in me rage quitting because I am stuck at the same level for 10 minutes because I die of that same prop repeatedly. \n\nIn a nutshell, the game is worth my money, it is fun at first and stunning with the simplistic but beautiful game design. For me it resulted in an annoying walkthrough with Super Mario Bros feelings but then worse because of the movement system. If you can die multiple times in a row and don\u2019t rage, this game will probably be amazing, but unfortunately, I already throw keyboards when I die in CSGO, so GG for me.\n", "timestamp_created": 1588851902, "timestamp_updated": 1588851902, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68424456": {"recommendationid": "68424456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090937284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 778, "last_played": 1690447472}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

Now dodge mines based in THIS place! Now dodge a truckload of mines whilst being shot at!\" I don't have very good screenshots, but this is what you can start to expect:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=784453748\nand this has moving wheels of death on moving platforms, but does not have homing attacks too (those come later in the stage.... agh, this was painful to play)\n\nIt has its ups - five characters, each unique (one can dash, one can slow time, one jumps super-high, and I can't remember the last two) and every level is playable with each one - but this isn't enough to offset the poor level design. This isn't helped by the game design: frequent checkpoints but one hit sends you back. This means you can't use invincibility frames and take some HP damage to get through tough sections - no, you have to work out how to do them. And then you have to work out how to do the next section. Aaaand the next.\n\n[i]And then![/i] You have to replay them to collect the collectibles. Most platformer have a principle of 'one level unlocks the next,' and most platformers also have bonus collectibles that usually unlock little of note. However, this game's progression is based on how many collectibles you've collected (=> in-universe, critters you've saved, but this game has next to no plot so don't expect anything). On the plus side, this means if a group of levels takes your fancy you can pick up all the (quite hard to get...) collectibles and skip some levels you dislike. On the negative side, if you're struggling with the game, it just becomes unfriendly to play. I genuinely would have completed it if it weren't for the collectibles... but aaargh. :/ This unlocking scheme could work, but it didn't.\n\nOh, and the game focuses on you basically jumping in and around moving timed platforms to avoid moving timed attacks - you have no attacks or anything. This is fine, but I thought I'd mention it. This works, if everything else is polished enough (there's a lengthy section in Out There Somewhere that occurs before you get a weapon) - but this isn't polished and isn't fun.\n\nI would write more but this game really isn't worth my effort.

What is annoying sometimes is that really simple stuff like jumping on small stepping stones while running is a bit difficult, thus sometimes making getting to the timed orbs more of a challenge than it should be.\nIn the first 15 minutes I struggled a bit with finding the right setting of how fast the world spins to avoid motion sickness, but after I tweaked the settings I can play for extended periods without feeling queasy.\nMy biggest grime with the game is actually the lack of explanation of what your goals are. For instance, I had to find out about the existence of the timed orb in the online discussions - before that I was getting really annoyed about not being able to find the last orb. However, not being able to get to each orb does not preclude you from progressing further into the game so no harm done.\nI agree with some online discussions that the cute graphics might give you the wrong impression what the target audience of this game is. I originally bought it for my 4 year old daughter, but her young brains can't handle the visuals at all.

You play a jellyfish abducted by aliens.  Your role is to traverse the levels in the game although it's unclear why, avoiding robot lawnmowers and mines, spinning the world around as part of the mechanic so you can get to the end-of-level pad. \n\nA second bonus dynamic to the game is underwater areas where you can swim around, which forms part of the pathway to complete each level.  The gameplay is primarily not puzzle solving but rather just timing and dodging enemies and judging the right times and places to jump from, despite the swimming and world-rotation mechanics.\n\nGraphics and gameplay are quite fluid although many have complained about motion sickness as the game can induce this.   The developers didn't go the cheap \"retro pixel\" route, although at the end of the day the game is still limited to being a platformer on PC.   While this is certainly one of the better platformers out on PC today, the gameplay itself quickly becomes a boring let down as there's just too many annoying timing challenges.

In reality, you can see that it tries hard to be more than that, but some design mechanics prevent it from being a great platformer. Instead, it\u2019s just an average, good one. In this game, you control an octopus through 63 levels in total. The camera rotates a lot, and it can make you dizzy. It makes your character a bit harder to control, but nothing serious. The game also has swimming, and it isn\u2019t good. You need to rotate (which also rotates the camera) in order to go sideways, and it isn\u2019t a fun experience. I completed the game to 101%, according to the achievement, so I can tell that most of the game has the right amount of difficulty, but there\u2019s some sections that are annoying as hell. And guess what, most of them involved swimming. You have less control and more cheap deaths. The checkpoint system is welcome, but I felt that should have been more of them. Some enemies are also annoying to deal with and rely a bit on luck. And perhaps that\u2019s the main problem I have with this game: many times, when you die you feel that wasn\u2019t your fault, but bad level design, controls or mechanics. Now, it seems that I\u2019m being harsh at the game, but it\u2019s only because you can see that it wants to be a great platformer. But in the end, it\u2019s still a good, cheap game, and I can recommend it if you enjoy the genre. The visuals and soundtrack are pretty nice, but even the best song in my opinion is unfortunately present in swimming focused levels, where the music gets muffled, wasting it.", "timestamp_created": 1529665720, "timestamp_updated": 1529665720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42646154": {"recommendationid": "42646154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147408104", "num_games_owned": 612, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1675302284}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego de plataformas visualmente muy atractivo...en donde al comienzo dir\u00e1s q eres puto amo pero en cuanto veas q ya el girar tanto te \"marea\" y el nivel de dificultad q tiene en sus niveles va en aumento...te sacar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de un insulto y te pondr\u00e1 a prueba...buen juego . lo recomiendo!", "timestamp_created": 1528693329, "timestamp_updated": 1528693329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42591298": {"recommendationid": "42591298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025543670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1528511717}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is god damn ridiculous.

Without being aware that the game had won Best Use of Game Physics in Intel's Level Up competition and was selected to be showcased at GDC, PAX Australia, PAX East, PAX Prime, and the Boston Festival of Indie Games, my initial impressions were that it would be a widely loved game.\n\nI assumed that its gorgeous graphics, orchestral soundtrack and cute characters would bring people in, and its difficulty curve would make sure it would be offering players months and years' worth of well designed challenges to explore.\n\nIt turns out, however, that Airscape: The Fall of Gravity would not receive much attention at launch from press or players. When developer Daniel West wrote a Gamasutra article talking about how he'd ticked all of the boxes for the, \"Oh, you should've done X,\" type dismissive non-actionable retrospective advice offered to unsuccessful developers titled [url=http://cheesetalks.net/www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DanielWest/20150908/253040/Good_isnt_good_enough__releasing_an_indie_game_in_2015.php]'Good' Isn't Good Enough[/url], the response he received was generally in the form of criticism of the game coupled with a veiled assertion that it's not appropriate for developers to voice concerns like this, coming from people who come across as not existing within its audience (as an aside, I'd hoped the article would generate discussion on how that kind of advice isn't particularly helpful and that there must be better ways to handle and mitigate disappointing launches, but it didn't).\n\nWith about 25 hours on either side of the game's release, I still find the game's level design to be its best feature. Even though the gravity mechanics may seem simple at first, the game presents a number of variations that allow for a consistently fresh array of movement challenges across the game's 60+ level campaign.\n\n[i]This was originally written as part of [url=http://cheesetalks.net/gamesRoundup2015.php]a retrospective[/url] on games I finished in 2015.[/i]\n\n\n[b]Addendum[/b]: Since writing this, Steam distribution rights for the game were sold to a third party, whose handling of the game causes me concern and are worth making note of.\n\n1. The new distributor would spam the game's announcements with news about their other games (Subterra and Road Redemption). These are now hidden from the store page/user notifications, but two can still be seen [url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/?appids=317250]here[/url]\n2. The new distributor lowered the minimum system requirements for Windows below what it will reasonably run on (original developer's comments on this can be found [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/317250/discussions/0/541907867790909664/#c350543951935747029]here[/url], [url=http://cheesetalks.net/images/2015played/airscapesysreq.png]screenshot[/url]), at the same time as setting 85+% discounts\n3. The new distributor added an ad oriented launcher with a difficult to see \"play\" button to the Windows version of the game.

Something of a stroke would happen and I would fine myself a dozen levels further finding joy in the \u201ctennis smash\u201d sound whenever you save a critter from being a Christmas ornament forever.

The soundtrack is enjoyable, and has a muffling effect as you enter water, which I felt only added to my dizziness.

It was all peaceful until a bomb exlosion happens and an alien robot thing captures your squid family and the rest of your fellow sea creatures and you have to go and save them from the alien race. Okay the story seems simple enough where the player will get the entire gist of it. Its a simple goal and it  works but the problem there is that its overused, Usual story plots of platformers is that something bad happens and you stop it, its been used alot the only difference i found in it is the fact instead of being a robot kid person (Megaman, sorry for low rated comparison), a plumber (Mario), a hedehog (sonic) your......a squid. Thats it, save your family beat the main villain poof thats it \n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nGameplay wise, Airscape has its own way of traversing through its levels, the levels are suited and well thought of in order to make use of the abilities your squid character has. Plus with all its other aspects like swimming while avoiding bombs and rockets, the twisty, tilting camera, Zero Gravity stages and more, you can fairly say that airscape has its own thing going for them. Another thing about it is its stages. some stages are forgiving and make you play calmly while emjoying the animated art the game has but others are really difficult. The difficulty can make a person rage from time to time (which i did mostly) The stages are layed out differently between areas (Zones) with each zone having a specialty, some are normal but others like the swimming stages, zero gravity stages, toxic stages etc, are designed to make your rage a few times. Another aspect i like in the game is being able to switch between the characters you unlocked, which makes you feel like a team when approaching your objective. \n\nCONTROLS:\n\nThe games controls are easy to remember which the arrow keys being the movement, spacebar to jump and shift to run \nbut the way the controls feel when your playing some of the stages such as the unerwater it tends to be way difficult. sometimes it feels delayed or it feels as if the game cheated you but knowing your the one who was the reason you screwed up. The player may also use a controller which helps in some levels. all what i can say is, some levels work with a controller and some work with a keyboard so its all about preferences. \n\nOVERALL:\n\nThe game is good, its good enough to call it a platforming game, but its something that you would play once, finish it and never reinstall because of how pissed you are at the game. But please i would say try it out for yourself its a platformer with its own styles and creativity which makes it feel like its not one of those cliche Games.

My greatest issue with the game is *why* it is difficult.  In other fast-paced platformer games like Sonic, Mario, Super Meat Boy, or Element4l, your success is solely based on your skill and ability to keep up your momentum.  Everything is positioned in a way where if you time yourself correctly, you'll get through very smoothly.  This game is not like that.  Assuming there is a fast and fluid way to beat each level, the enemies and obstacles won't be in their correct positions if you respawn at a checkpoint.  But the real underlying issue is there are WAY too many situations where the obstacles are out-of-sync.  For example, there are times where you have to wait for lasers to turn off in order to pass, but there could be a moving platform where if you don't get on it on time, you miss your shot.  So you sit there waiting, not knowing when you're SUPPOSED to go, because the exact moment won't come up again until an unknown amount of time.  Considering how un-forgiving this game is of the slightest mistakes, this just needlessly wastes time.\n2. Gravity is VERY inconsistent.  Some chunks of land (regardless of their size or material) will pull you toward them, while others won't.\n3. The way you move in water is very different from on land.  Normally this doesn't bother me, except in this game you're under pressure to make very precise moves very quickly, all while the camera angle might change as you switch between in and out of water.  Also, the blue octopus teleports forward in water, but outside of water it teleports left or right.  In levels with toxic water where you need to splash on the surface to stay alive, this gets extremely annoying.\n4. Some may find the camera dizzying, but to me the real problem is sometimes it zooms in too close, and I can't tell where I'm going.  I often died because I didn't know where I was supposed to go.\n5. Though the fan physics are fine, they are (in my opinion) the hardest mechanic to master. The game doesn't give you many opportunities to train yourself.  So, by the time you REALLY need to know how to master it, you just keep dying.\n6. Sometimes, you rotate too slowly in water.  There are moments where you have to outrun a fast-moving target and outrun a timed laser all while you're swimming in toxic water.  Meanwhile, the path you have to take is ~120 degrees off from your facing direction.  It's annoyingly hard to get your timing done just right when the octopus rotates so slowly.\n7. The game adds obstacles as an artificial way of increasing the difficulty.  Sometimes I'm presented with an already modest challenge, but the devs decide to throw in something like mines for the hell of it.  The additional mines don't further test your skill, they're just simply tedious.  Reminds me of Contra or Battletoads - if you like ripping your hair out over the slightest mistake, sure, maybe this isn't a problem for you, but I find it unnecessary.  A good platformer relies on your precision and ability to time yourself, a bad one will just simply hurt your luck.\n\n\nI feel most of my gripes could easily be fixed with just 4 simple tweaks:\nA. For any time-sensitive obstacles, make sure everything is synchronized, so you don't have to guess when is the right time to go; you'll just know.  At that point it is up to the player to have the skill to make it to the end.  In most cases, the obstacles don't have to change at all, they just move or toggle at a different pace.  This addresses problem 1.\nB. You play as octopuses: animals that have suction cups and are known to walk on walls.  There's no need to have micro-gravity effects - just have the octopus able to walk on [some] walls.  In most parts of the game, this wouldn't have any effect on the level design. This would resolve problem 2.\nC. Have the camera always oriented with gravity, which in turns makes the swimming direction absolute rather than relative.  This would solve problems 3, 4, and 6, and could make problem 2 a little less extreme.  This too would have little to no effect on level design.\nD. To address problem 7, have an \"easy\" and \"normal\" mode, where easy removes some of the excess traps, and maybe gives you a half-second extra for things like toxic water or the laser-mounted rifles.", "timestamp_created": 1504557500, "timestamp_updated": 1536628208, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544827580451965332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34691713": {"recommendationid": "34691713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045340862", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1506201977}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Great game, probably terrible code[/h1]\n[i]Yes, I just wrote this to rant[/i]\n\nGameplay-wise, super-neat game.

[i]Hypothetically.[/i]\n\nWhy did I put graphical and musical quality into an hypothesis?\n\nWell, regarding the graphics, because I may not have the best machine... In fact is just an average-tier professional laptop. But I know how to properly optimize my computer resources, and I have run flawlessy through games far more complex. I can run most Unreal games on High quality, same goes for Unity, and same goes for Source games. bUt ThIs ThInG decided to divide my resolution by ~=8 (at least it looked like it as the terrain got paved with phat pixels). In fact the resolution got so low, I could see light blue lines passing by the edge of each blob of water. I know why this can happen, and this quite the unprofessional mistake. Though I guess I can't blame the devs since they didn't write their engine.\n\nRegarding the music (any sound, actually), every something time, the sound would start crackling and muffling, and this effect would intensify until I get out of a body of water. My guess is that they forgot to remove the water sound filter when you exit a body of water by respawning. So if you happen to stumble on a segment where you die in the first body of water after a checkpoint, your sound will slowly morph from a symphony, to a muffled symphony, to a muder attempt against your sound card, to just getting mute. This would easily be fixed and frankly, shouldn't be a thing.\n\nSo do I recommend this game?

First off, this game's main selling point (the screen turning with freely rotating gravity) seems appealing at first but may cause dizziness or just be awkward once you actually play under it. Additionally, a mute octopus is not a really relatable protagonist no matter what you do with him, let alone with no plot at all. Plus, this is a highly linear action platformer, and a slow-moving one too, with no puzzle or metroidvania elements.\n\nEven for those who like it, the underwater intro before you get kidnapped shows off a lot of flaws even beyond that. The physics are slippery even for video game water physics, the graphics (like those in the rest of the game) are generic platformer graphics, there's no clear indication whether the other sea creatures around you are friend or foe, the screen may randomly shift so you have to mash the up button to escape, you're not even told the sideways controls until the first level proper, you'll probably wander around aimlessly for several seconds before being kidnapped, and once you're kidnapped you're not even shown entering the UFO that kidnapped you and your marine pals.\n\nThat intro still doesn't capture all the flaws with this game. Some of the rescuable sea creatures get kidnapped by the aliens if you take too long, there's no indication which ones or how long you have to rescue them, some are at the end of very sluggish levels, and the easiest way of making them available again is killing yourself.

The premise is you're a little octopus and aliens have sucked up your part of the ocean, including you and all your sea buddies. You unlock more stages by freeing things like crabs, jellyfish, and shrimps held captive throughout the levels. This is nice because it means you can finish the game by getting enough creatures in the early levels without having to actually beat every stage, and some of the later ones you'll probably be happy to skip since they can get insane. Lasers, homing missiles, bullet hell segments, all while spinning around in a floating bubble of water. It's a lot for one octopus to handle, but it's all in good fun. Every few stages you enter a fortress to free another octopus relative that has a special ability, like double jump, briefly slow down time, or perform a short teleport.

No recomiendo el juego, en especial a las personas con problemas de orientacion o equilibrio, esto podria reuslta en una experiencia especialmente desagradable para ellos.

I brings in a bunch of interesting mechanics that personally, I have never seen before, and it introduces those concepts in simple, yet clever ways that need little to no text whatsoever. An example of this is when they introduce buttons, they start off by putting you in a closed room with a door, and a button, showing you what the buttons in this game do before you get to the more complicated parts. I wish more games introduced concepts in simpler ways like this game does\n\nAt first, I thought this game was going to be way too easy, but as I got further in I discovered that not to be the case. It gradually gets more difficult as it goes, but it doesn't spike up the difficulty in a way that makes me want to quit playing altogether.\n\nSome people may have a slight issue with the rotation of the screen, but despite the very helpful slider that decreases, or increases the rate of rotation, I can see why some people might have a problem with this. If you have extreme motion sickness I would sadly say this would not be your best option, but you could always get it to see if the slider works for you, and if it doesn't there is no shame in refunding this game\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is simply  phenomenal, I simply love them and got the OST (original soundtrack) right away, just so I could listen to it everywhere I go. Usually I play my own music behind games, but for this one I just had to close Spotify.\n\nWhat I also adore about this game is the graphical style.

And, of course, the levels get much harder the further you go on.\n\nI liked Airscape. Early on, it felt a little weird and rough around the edges, but I definitely grew more fond of it as I played. Like I said before, it does get harder, and there are some levels that are pretty difficult. Nothing on the hardest levels of super meat boy or similar, but definitely up there. Mechanically, the game was pretty sound. There were a few strange bugs with gravity shifting unexpectedly, specifically when it came to ledges that you shouldn't be able to stand on but could, but other than that, it was definitely fine for an indie developer AND for the price point.\n\nUltimately, I think that this game is probably not going to be appealing to a lot of people, just because it's basically another platformer with a twist.

Also if you wanted to collect all the animals like me, you will have a way harder time doing so since it's very approximative.\n\nI can't really recommend this game unless you're someone who has an enormous ammount of patience and can deal with these clunky controls.

Take the traditional stage-based 2D precision platformer.  Add in the gravitational relativity of Mario Galaxy.  Now split the game into 15 worlds, give each world its own gimmick, and give each level its own special take on that gimmick, and only the surface has been scratched of what Airscape has to offer.\n \nThe level variety is astounding.  The gravitational relativity allows for levels to be linear, circular, vertical, amorphous, or all manner of other shapes never seen before (aided by the fact that water isn\u2019t affected by gravity at all). There\u2019s piles of different enemies, traps, and interactable objects in the game, each with important different mechanics, and so many that some are only ever seen in two or three of the 50+ levels.  Levels are long and complex enough that each obstacle is used to its full extent once it shows up, so nothing ever feels like its potential was wasted, nor is anything reused so much it wears out its welcome.  But be careful; Airscape is a true precision platformer, and the difficulty is very firm!  However, the difficulty curve is gracious, and offers the player a lot of easy levels up front to get used to things before turning on the heat.\n \nIn a nigh-unheard of move for a precision platformer, Airscape also has five very different characters to play: one moves faster, one has floaty jumps, one can teleport short distances, one can slow down the game speed, and one has a double-jump.  Despite these drastic differences all levels can still be completed with any character, and there\u2019s no clear \u201cbest\u201d pick, just different playstyles to suit a player\u2019s preferences.  The character selection is a testament to the game\u2019s robustness, as each level had to be designed with all five playstyles in mind to avoid game-breaking exploits while still being appropriately difficult, and it succeeds handily in that regard.\n \nNo review of this game would be a true review without giving praise to the glorious background music.  Throughout the game are beautiful, sweeping orchestral melodies that rival what any big-budget production brings to the table.  Each track elicits a different emotion perfect for the visual style of the world at hand, and while a player might pick out their \u201cbest\u201d song, they\u2019d be very hard-pressed to pick out their worst.\n\nNo review can really do this game justice: it is the real deal.

I was expecting something like Mario Galaxy, and I guess in a sense that's what it is. But it's a very disorientating and a poorly executed interpretation of Mario Galaxy. It could have been a great game but there are several critical issues working against it.\n\nThe first issue is the combination of the camera and the controls. Naturally the camera always rotates so it appears as if you're standing straight up. And that works well enough while you're on the ground, but when you're swimming, the controls switch to a completely different setup. Left and right now rotate the camera instead of controlling which direction you're trying to move your character. So it doesn't feel like you're controlling your character anymore so much as you're trying to steer him while he rockets forward. So switching back and forth between the two control setups in a pinch is very disorientating, and considering how many of the levels have you switching back and forth very quickly, it very frequently results in a death.\n\nI should point out it's possible to adjust how fast the camera rotates. It's based on a percentage, with 0% being no camera rotation, and 200% being the fastest speed. But anything that's not 200% or 0% is a waste of time because who wants a camera that can only slowly rotate to the direction you're facing? That seems like it would only add to the disorientation. Thankfully the developers had the good sense to let you adjust this on the fly with keybindings, but this means the developers clearly knew this was an issue, and couldn't/wouldn't fix it.\n\nThe next issue is the difficulty. It scales up too quickly. The first few levels are a joyous half-hearted romp through the park on a mild Saturday afternoon. By level 11, you have to dodge missiles, landmines, tanks with chainsaws, lasers, and killer UFOs while trying to reach a location at the top of a broken path to collect a thing before it's gone forever because there's a time limit. All the while you have to switch back and forth between the two disorientating control setups because there's chunks of land and bodies of water you're required to maneuver through. And considering how short the levels are, that is a very sharp difficulty increase.\n\nWhat's interesting is you can unlock different characters, but the bizarre part is the new character appears to be a complete improvement on the previous. Once you unlock the purple character, there is no reason at all to use orange. So why do they even bother letting you switch back to him? It should just be a new ability for the previous character.\n\nHonestly I could overlook all of this game's issues, including the fact you can't rebind the very necessary run key, which means if you keep your hand on the home row like an adult and need to run to the left, you get to eat shit. And don't expect that to get fixed any time soon because the developers were informed of this a year or so ago and there's been no response from them on the matter. But even that would be forgivable if not for the biggest issue of all:\n\nYou only have one health point. This above all else is what kills the experience for me. With all of the disorientating camera rotations, disorientating control changes, disorientating level designs, missile dodging, landmine dodging, tank with chainsaw dodging, laser dodging, killer UFO dodging, and absurdly short time limits, would having more than 1 health point really break gameplay? Would it really be so terrible if I could take one free hit before having to restart the whole level all over again because I didn't reach the thing before it disappeared forever? [b]Having only one health point is expecting a lot of discipline from the player, while the game itself shows no discipline of its own.[/b] Fix your camera and control issues first, then you can punish me for not navigating your disorientating levels fast enough.\n\nIn short, I give Disorientation: The Disorientating Strikes Back a disorientating disorientation out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1493520029, "timestamp_updated": 1493520029, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610665440559387207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31410521": {"recommendationid": "31410521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084280744", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1493362159}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to like Airscape: The Fall of Gravity but couldn't. The trappings are nice but the gameplay is poor, regrettably as it has potential.\n\nCute and clean graphics [i]can[/i] pose a welcome opposition to hard platforming gameplay. The problem with Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is that it clearly goes overboard with its difficulty, instead of hard but engaging it's outright malevolent. The leveldesign is such that it requires no less than pixel perfect platforming while the controls and physics needed for that are not up to the task.\n\nWhen it comes to precise platforming, I feel it is necessary to give the player exact control in a comprehensible environment. This ensures that the player is completely responsible for his triumph as well as failure. Unfortunately, despite trying a fair bit, I was unable to replicate a control pattern, the game is too floaty and elusive.

The multiple colors blend nicely, creating a nice view for your eyes. The quality is not the best, but this is not a bad thing, because the game is nice for its simplicity.\n\n[h1] Gameplay[/h1] \nThe gameplay is really easy to learn, like the overall of platform games: you move,  jump and, dash and you can also float a little when you jump if you keep the jump button pressed. The levels start easy and start to get really tough when you progress through the game. Your octopus is reallty fragile, because only one enemy hit will kill him, so you will die A LOT here. Fortunatelly, you have infinite lives and you start at the last checkpoint you used.\n\nThe interface has a map which you can roam freely at it, without needing to go through a fixed path, until you go to the level of your choice. At each level, you collect until 3 items which are used to unlock some special areas where you can unlock new octopus to play with. They are different colors and I have unlocked the blue one so far. Probably they are a little different to use, but I'm not sure, because I unlocked only one.\n\nThe difference of this game to other platforms is the gravity theme: a little like Mario Galaxy, you'll get to some places where you'll upside down, pushed by the gravity of some places and this sometimes can be kind of annoying. Fortunatelly, it's a minor issue and it doesn't affect the gameplay.\n\n[h1] Audio & Soundtrack[/h1] \nThe soundtrack is simple, yet beautiful, without being annoying. It's composed of relaxing tones so you feel at ease.\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1] \nAs a plartform game, the story usually is really simple, because there's no need to understand it in order to play. You are controling alien octopus kidnapped by an unknow force and need to survive throuygh the levels. That's all you know so far.\n\n[h1]The veredict[/h1]\nIt's a nice and relaxing platform game, with easy controls, but with levels getting harder when you progress through the game. I really enjoyed and would recommend for any platform game fans. Grab this game while at a sale if you are uncertain about it, you won't regret.\n\n[h1]Rating:[/h1]\nGraphics: 8/10\nAudio: 8/10\nGameplay: 8,5/10\nOverall: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1488053251, "timestamp_updated": 1488240458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465116292238235474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30167265": {"recommendationid": "30167265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279518384", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1522238414}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game!

So at first when I was figuring out the controls and how to move, I got a headache and dizzy real fast. I tried to turn down rotation slower, but then the \"lag\" effect from the world movement being slower than the character was so hard to deal with and practically made it worse. Then I turned rotation off but it was just too hard to navigate the game even when constantly recentering the camera. So I took a chance and actually increased it to the full 200% and it was WAAAAAAY better. I haven't gotten any headaches, nausea, or anything. The faster rotation worked well because you can focus on your octopus and navigate with your peripheral vision. So if you get dizzy, it might sound counter-productive, but give the higher % a try. :)", "timestamp_created": 1486947762, "timestamp_updated": 1486947762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29882521": {"recommendationid": "29882521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031390153", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1486699949}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is not bad, just dull.

Getting every \u2018critter\u2019 (3 in each level) was really a challenge, finding them can range from an easy jump to speed running through a level at impossible speeds, some of them require a certain character or precise timing; suffice to say you won\u2019t be able to complete the game 100% without a challenge.\n\nTl;dr : challenging game with unique controls and plenty of unlockables /achievements to keep you busy, well worth the price.\n", "timestamp_created": 1486235223, "timestamp_updated": 1486235223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29700664": {"recommendationid": "29700664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273720151", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1539237703}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: Holy lord this game gets difficult. Just beat the regular game after a year and a half hiatus, and after unlocking the final, extra world, I decided to quit because the time it takes to complete each level and die a hundred times in the same exact parts tilts the scale into the not-having-fun area of gaming. All that said, for a $5 game, this gets a 9/10 from me.

Controls are tight; most, if not all, deaths are your fault.\n*Clever Level Designs - Some levels felt phoned in, but MANY took advantage of the game's cool gravity mechanic. Not to mention, the different worlds vary in atmosphere greatly, which is very nice.\n*Adjustable motion rotation for camera - I turned mine up all the way, and only a couple of moments made me dizzy. The option is still there to turn it down if you are susceptible to motion sickness.\n*Ambience - Music and graphics fit well together. They don't bring the game down.\n*Sale price - So cheap. Definitely worth $0.49. I'd have paid full price if I knew I'd enjoy it as much as I do (still only $5). \n\nBad:\n\n*Exhausting - Being challenging can be a bad quality, too. I've been able to play 3 sessions, a half hour each. There's a reason most reviews you see for this game are 3 hours or fewer. Every moment requires your full attention and hard concentration.

If you're not sure you can stand it, you might want to get an impression first by watching a gameplay video.\n\nI bought this game as part of a bundle, and was positively surprised. It's a nice, challenging platformer with a cute art style.\n\nThere's not much story to this game -- you're an octopus that's happily swimming in the sea doing whatever octopuses do, when one day an alien disrupts the peace by abducting all the ocean's inhabitants. You will control the octopus on a journey to rescue his abducted friends. \n\nYou will visit a lot of different 'worlds', and each world will have a few levels that introduce new gameplay elements and enemies. Your goal is to navigate from the entry portal to the exit portal without dying. This will start off quite easy, but soon enough there will be dangerous traps and enemies to tear you apart. Every level also contains a few of your abducted friends trapped in orbs, waiting to be rescued. They will be in harder to reach places, and sometimes you'll have to beat a timer to get to them before it runs out.\n\nAfter beating a number of levels, you will unlock extra hard 'containment levels'; they are extra hard challenges to test your skills. But if you manage to complete them you will unlock additional octopuses to play with. And each rescued octopus will come with a special skill (for example, extra float time, or a short range teleport).\n\nThe variation in levels will keep this game from going boring too fast, and each world is also accompanied with great music.

The cute artstyle and peaceful music overlook a game that's actually reasonably difficult at its core. Variety is the name of the game here and levels don't repeat mechanics very often or reuse it in new and various ways, and you won't get bored with any specific mechanic or different character that you unlock. The game has some design issues in particular with the aesthetic and setting up the player for failure with some of its level design and the wrong use of color in certain action situations. It's going to wear on certain players of the genre, and there's nothing horribly unique about the game to make it stand out, but it's definitely solid in most aspects, and I did have fun even if I kept on dying at parts repeatedly. Also, be weary if you get motion sick. Even though there's options to deal with that in game, I do think it brings a worse experience in the end. \n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/tTLpZeG3XcY[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Strong variety in mechanics, as you'll be challenged by different platforming elements that don't twist the game into a pretzel, but do enough to make the game feel different from zone to zone. \n[*] Like the different play styles and taking advantage of the different small differences in each of the characters.\n[*] Music is a strong relaxing soundtrack with appropriate action sections that give a feeling like Super Mario Galaxy's music would. Very appropriate to the gameplay. \n[*] Cute artwork, definitely get attached to the different octopi due to the artstyle and child like nature.\n[*] Will provide a challenge for those who want it. \n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Some of the level design goes against good platforming conventions with ideas of forced deaths (having to learn of vital information with a forced death). Can lead to frustration.\n[*] Not really sure of the rotation camera mechanic and why it's so changeable in the end. Higher resolution of camera movement would have made a lot more sense.\n[*] It's in a crowded field right now, and honestly it doesn't do anything really strongly to stand out in any one area, which can be a problem. It's mostly solid: but that doesn't necessarily bode well with the competition it's against. \n[*] Inconsistent in the challenge curve. Fluxates strongly in several areas, as opposed to a reasonable progression. \n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

If Super Mario Galaxy was 2 dimensional then this would be it, also some of the features remind me of Yoshi's Island like how the fish follow you around when collecting the glowing orbs. \u00a31.99 is a great purchase for 60 levels and a few hours of fun.\n\n[h1]Details -[/h1]\nRuns on low end devices / Single player / Cartoon Graphics\n\nOverall I would rate this game a 6.5/10 - January, 2017", "timestamp_created": 1484356366, "timestamp_updated": 1502419114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504950523376464844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29235449": {"recommendationid": "29235449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124176299", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1484350281}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really surprised by this game, I grabbed it on sale for $0.20 but after playing through it, Id definitely pay full price for this. \n\nThe sound track is great, the levels are difficult and it uses many interesting mechanics.

The gameplay has several moments of fair and interesting challenges which can entice any average platformer fan. However, this quickly disappears as the levels begin to throw in unnecessary and often frustrating moments of difficulty.\nOne partculiar case involves several missiles that are off screen whilst your character must navigate on a slippery surface and dodge several annoying robots. Another level contains fireballs that blanket the ENTIRE screen and randomly curve mid- air. The game too quickly spikes up the diffculty curb.\nAdditionally, the unlockable characters are often useless in comparison to the original orange octopus for the simple fact that THEY CAN'T DUCKING RUN. It is also of unfortunate note that you can't switch characters mid level without returning to the start (and not dying). For levels that often involve speed and momentum, this can be frustrating for many players.\nThe graphics and sound track are nothing special but are quite passable (hey at least the octopi are cute).\nOverall, however, the game has certain enjoyable moments with some flaws that can be worked out and I would like to see the developers' work in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1484259372, "timestamp_updated": 1484259372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500756442546844482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29211025": {"recommendationid": "29211025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148229634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 781, "last_played": 1484224713}, "language": "english", "review": "Adorable and frustrating", "timestamp_created": 1484253977, "timestamp_updated": 1484253977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47708582878112793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29208758": {"recommendationid": "29208758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130063212", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1475107963}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't like Airscape at all.

The screen rotation speed always needs to be adjusted because on some levels if it's too slow, you again misjudge the jump height and get f*cked. Or don't see a baddie/obstacle coming your way. \n\nOn other levels, if it's too fast, you need to put the controller down and take a break because your feel dizzy. \n\nIt's a cool concept with potential, but the execution just misses the mark IMO. There are two types of difficulty in games - those that are artificially difficult because the controls don't let you translate your thoughts and into actions on screen the way you intended, and those that are difficult because you as a player need to step up your skills.

This game is broken and incredibly frustrating because of it.\n\nSeems like it was going for some kind of interesting mix between Mario Galaxy and Super Meat Boy.

You can set it to quickly rotate with your character at the cost of experiencing constant nausea and being unable to track it with your eyes, or you can set it to rotate slower so that you will find it difficult if not impossible to control your character, and while swimming it's completely disorienting. Half the time I have no idea which direction I'll go when I jump, move or swim, and in a game like this which challenges you to be extremely precise and subtle with your platforming, it's a huge problem. \n\nThis was somewhat bearable until I progressed to the poison water world with the teleporting octo, where you can only stay in the water for a few seconds. The complete and utter frustration I have experienced from this should be a warning to potential buyers. You will teleport in seemingly almost any random driection other than the one you intended, teleport into solid objects, teleport backwards for no reason, and you will die. Over, and over, and over again. Sums up pretty much the experience of the whole game.\n\nIf you enjoy a challenging game with near constant deaths and frustration due to a disorienting camera and poorly implemented controls, then this is the game for you.

Honestly I only bought it because it looked cute.\n\n[h1] The Graphics[/h1]\n\nAs I normally start all of my reviews, I have to look at the graphics first. Graphics are usually one of the first things people look for when choosing a new game to dive into. Airscape - The Fall of Gravity is a beautiful 2D-ish platformer. When I first picked up this game I honestly didn't expect much, especially for the $.50 that I paid for it. (Yes, I paid for it, but steam says I got it for free, so whatever.) But like always, I was mistaken. This game is beautiful, simply stunning for what it is. The edges are sharp, the visuals are pleasing and the art style keeps me coming back for more. I couldn't really ask for much more when it comes to a game such as this one, let's move on.\n\n[h1] Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis is where I was extremely caught off guard, this game takes advantage of some insane physics, I highly recommend turning your rotation down when you start playing, because motion sickness is definitely possible when playing this game for too long. The controls are very simple, up (jump) left and right, and shift to run/sprint. However, that doesn't mean this game is easy. There's many achievements for dying in this game, in fact at the very end of the story it will tell you how many deaths you had in your play through. It seems that around 1500-2000 is the normal amount for this game, but don't let that stop you. It's a hell of a lot of fun to play.\n\n[h1] Story[/h1]\n\n[u] This game has a simple story, but beware there are spoilers ahead. If you haven't started this game, you may want to skip this section.[/u] \n\nSo, in the beginning you find a group of other creatures, after swimming with them, you, and your new friends get captured and you have to find them. This game has a very simple story, beat level, play next level, advance. Rinse, wash, repeat. But, it is fun. I haven't personally gotten far in this game as of the time of this review, but I definitely will finish this game in the near future.\n\n[h1] Summary[/h1]\n\nAll in all, this is a very well rounded platformer, with a gorgeous are style and an absolute load of gameplay to go with it. It's cute, it's fun, and you'll like it.

You have to jump and flip the gravity whenever you are moving to a different rock. If you have played \"Super mario Galaxy\", then you could compare it with this. There are collectable in each level and they are needed to move on to a new section. There are bars/lines in the bottom of the screen. This should be seen as a collectable counter.  There are different themes and worlds with their own playstyle. There are checkpoints throughout the levels. Whenever you do die, you will respawn back at the checkpoint but will lose all of the progress that u have made until the last touch to the checkpoint. So if you have 2 collectables, but you touch the checkpoint whenever you had only 1 collectable without a renewing. Then you will respawn back with 1 collectable. Some of the collectables do have a timer. If you are too late, You will be forced to restart the entire level. You have to save your other squid friends and you will be be able to play with them after completing the level.\n\nCalming Game.\nCalming Music. \nEach level has collectables.\nSidewards screen rotation.\nDifferent squids has different \"effects\"\nHas collectable counter in each level.\nDifferent world themes.\nIt is a kid's friendly game.However the screen rotation COULD be a bugger for them.\nYou are able to reduce the screen rotation including turning it off.\nThere is a world map available where you are able to see the collectable progress and select your level.\nSome of the collectables are time based.\n\n[h1]Other things.[/h1]\n\nIf you are familiar with the Yoshi island \"Moon Raven\" Boss, That you are fighting him on the yellow moon.

Make no mistake about it. This game makes super meat boy look easy peasy. The best thing though is that there is enough here for casual gamers to be interested. The learning curve is quite well presented in its gradual approach. You know each level is that slightly bit harder, but maybe with enough tries you might be able to master it and this is where the game constantly teases you. \n\n\"It's only that little bit harder!\" \n\n\"Surely the next save point is just around the corner!\"\n\nThe story is simple. Aliens are sick of abducting steak for dinner, they feel like seafood. Unfortunately you and all your marine buddies weren't fast enough to escape their tractor beam. However while everyone else gets kidnapped, somehow you make your escape in a little glass astronaut helmet and you take it on yourself to traverse the alien landscapes to free your buddies.\n\nEach Octopus buddy you unlock has a special skill, from double jump, to dash etc., however to free them you have to have saved enough fish in the first place to warrant saving them from their alien prison containing diabolical traps. Everything wants to kill you on these alien landscapes that's all you need to know. To save most marine creature you'll have to work out quickly how to get to certain areas, or be at a certain place by a certain time or your friends gets kidnapped again.\n\nIt's easy to pick up, incredibly difficult to master. Eventually if you\u2019re talented enough to unlock all your buddy octopuses then you'll be given a chance to go against a boss. I've only seen 1 person ever complete this level and it took him well over an hr that's how hard it was. He even completed all the levels of the game, but did he save all the fish? Hell no, even he knows how hard this game is to 100%.\n\nBelow is me playing the first really easy levels and rescuing the first octopus. It gets way harder, but it should be enough of a sample for you. The question is are you up for the challenge? With puzzles that you will mentally have to wrap your suckers around, with enemies that will make you want to ink, with danger that will make you want to squidaddle. How deep in the game can you go?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0io_YADklHg\n", "timestamp_created": 1480089386, "timestamp_updated": 1480089386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677851200103759766", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27309859": {"recommendationid": "27309859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014392934", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1497880399}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute precision platformer featuring good level design and fun mechanics.\nI like unlocking characters with unique powers and collecting timed collectibles.", "timestamp_created": 1480019652, "timestamp_updated": 1480019652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27273421": {"recommendationid": "27273421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147360944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1482766550}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool little game to spend your time on.", "timestamp_created": 1480012610, "timestamp_updated": 1480012610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27121649": {"recommendationid": "27121649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127505209", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 646, "last_played": 1480378864}, "language": "spanish", "review": "pudo a ver sido mejor si mejoraran su jugabilidad", "timestamp_created": 1479986694, "timestamp_updated": 1638040017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26983280": {"recommendationid": "26983280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119854622", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1599066345}, "language": "english", "review": "This game simple yet challenging.\nMake your head dizzy at moment but.. it's the fun part\nbuy only 50 cent, sell card for 50 cent\ngreat", "timestamp_created": 1479952438, "timestamp_updated": 1479952438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26946626": {"recommendationid": "26946626", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994122381", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1494035514}, "language": "english", "review": "Have to set it to the right settings to stop yourself from getting dizzy... but otherwise a very, very innovative platformer!", "timestamp_created": 1479944277, "timestamp_updated": 1479944277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26760121": {"recommendationid": "26760121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021666405", "num_games_owned": 1194, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1480895963}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't beat this game yet, but I aim to, and with that being said: This game is cute.

The awe and mystery of it all is further enhanced by the fact that its spread across small planetoids and floating water tunnels that create this sense of a magnificient, interlinked series of little ecosystems just begging to be explored. You walk out... and are greeted with the sharp, startling noise of gunshot as an auto-targeting turret blasts your insides into several pieces.\n\nI'll readily admit that I'm not one of those \"Super Meat Boy\" type gamers. If that's your thing, Airscape may just be your next itch scratcher. Believe me, it gets hard... quick. But even acknowledging my own tastes, I find it hard not to look at this and feel disappointed.\n\nBecause shoot, this game looks and sounds absolutely beautiful. The orchestrated score is just wonderful and it complements the gorgeous vistas you'll visit throughout this game. The game feels like a cross between an adventure game and action platformer as you zig-zag between planetoids and navigate winding rivers of floating water. It controls well enough as well; when moving in and out of water, controlling your player's orientation can be annoying, but ultimately that's the only major control complaint I have. At face value, there's this game I just want to get lost in and take in the wonder and danger of it all.\n\nThe problem is that the danger quickly eclipses the wonder in a major way. Make no mistake, this game is teeming with wonderful ideas and creative set pieces to throw you into, and throw you in it does. You're flung straight into these deceptively pretty hotbeds of death with little to no introduction. Yes, levels are short so death isn't always costly from a gameplay perspective, but that's not my main complaint here. Its just that the game does such a good job of stimulating the senses that all these one-shot deaths can just shatter the immersion. Those turrets I mentioned earlier? When I encountered them in their level group, I quickly lost my desire to explore that cluster of planetoids. They were such a jarring part of the encounter that it blew my excitement clean away.\n\nIn conclusion, Airscape just feels like a game with something akin to an identity crisis. I'm certainly not against messing with player expectations or trying a \"bait-and-switch.\" But for me personally, the \"switch\" was so frequent and polarizing between beautiful and vicious that it sucked the air straight out of my sails.

You play as an octopus in a space helmet, sucked out of your ocean and cast off into space for\u2026 no apparent reason, honestly (the game has no real plot, and the villain of the game has no clear motivation). Your goal is to navigate through the levels, freeing various sea critters and ultimately, the other octopi who were kidnapped with you, all on the way to defeat the final boss.\n\nThis is one of those games which plays heavily with gravity. Gravity orients itself straight downward, including on curved slopes, meaning you can walk along a curved surface without ever having to jump or break your stride, similar to walking around a 3D planet with gravity. However, most platforming sections do only allow one orientation of landing on the platforms, so only select surfaces (marked by grass and similar things) are actually \u201cwalkable\u201d.\n\nThe game has a fairly simple set of mechanics \u2013 you can walk, you can jump, and you can, depending on your particular octopus, do one of several other things (run faster, float, teleport, slow down time, or double jump). As with many such games, the complexity comes almost entirely from the levels, wherein you must contend with twisted gravity, gravity reversals, attacks from missile turrets and moving lasers, bottomless pits, water (which always reorients your gravity according to the direction you\u2019re facing, though you float in it so it doesn\u2019t really matter), poisonous water you can\u2019t spend too much time in without dying, and a very small number of invincible enemy types (no enemies in the game can be beaten). There are switches which are used to open gates and at times reverse gravity, and\u2026 that\u2019s about it.\n\nAll in all, the game is fairly simple, but it is generally well-executed. The levels are decent enough and generally quite short, making them relatively easy to beat in a short time \u2013 if you can do them right. Some of the later levels are quite hard, though, and despite the checkpoints in them can take upwards of ten minutes to 100%. The longest levels are the levels where you unlock your fellow octopi and the final level, where you confront a fairly difficult boss (though thankfully, with very generous checkpointing after each phase).\n\nThe graphics look nice and are clean and attractive, and it is always clear what is going on. And if you don\u2019t like the way the screen shifts around, you can change it to change the pace of screen rotation to avoid motion sickness and just keep it working the way you want it to.\n\nSadly, the game never really feels exceptional. The game is consistently decent, and none of the levels are bad, but none of them are all that great, either. There was never a point in the game where I was wowed by it, and none of the levels really feel particularly organic (though they didn\u2019t feel especially inorganic either \u2013 just sort of okay).\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite the cute aesthetic, this game is not easy; while it isn\u2019t Super Meat Boy level of hard, it is above-average difficulty for a 2D platformer, and some of the puzzles, particularly water ones, can be pretty finicky.\n\nIt took me a bit under five hours to beat. If you want to 100% it, it will take more than twice as long, as the final levels are much, much harder than all the rest of the game. The very final level of the game took me nearly an hour to complete, and wasn\u2019t really much fun \u2013 it was an exercise in frustration combined with checkpoint starvation, as you had to execute a very long sequence of tasks flawlessly, then do so again after the first checkpoint, then do so again after the second checkpoint. The endgame levels are often nightmarish in their difficulty, and are too hard to really be considered fun.\n\nOn the whole, if you\u2019ve already got this in your library and are itching for a 2D platformer, you could do worse\u2026 but honestly, you could do better, too.

An octopus is abducted from its homeworld and is forced to save its family and return home while evading countless dangers along the way.\n\n[h1]What do I do?[/h1]\nYou control an octopus that is taken away from its homeworld along with its family and must either reach the exit teleporter in each level or rescue an octopus while moving through obstacles, traversing through land with each one having its own gravity and avoiding enemies that may or may not chase and follow you in order to return home. Objects and enemies include lasers, mines, spikes, robots, etc. There are a variety of octopuses (or octopi - take it as you will) to choose from with different unique abilities and with the first being unlocked by default and all subsequent octopuses requiring to be freed.\n\nThere are additional optional objectives where you can rescue trapped specimens (they are other sea creatures that have been confined as well) and find secret exits to unlock more levels and rescue more specimens.\n\n[h1]My overall experience[/h1]\nThis game was quite the roller coaster ride from start to finish. It's relaxing at the start but spiked in difficulty towards and at the end. I loved this game at the start, felt frustrated two-thirds of the way through and satisfied in the end. It was a blast.\n\nThe beginning and tutorial were very welcoming and helped to prepare for the gradual increase in difficulty and complexity in later levels. The next zones added a light challenge and a different atmosphere. It was at halfway through this game when its difficulty began to show, but the soundtrack kept me in and I pushed through all the way to the end where the level of difficulty never went down.\n\n[h1]What should I expect?[/h1]\nExpect an easy and enjoyable experience from the initial part of this game, but don't be surprised when the levels become much more difficult and require good reaction time, precise movement and good decision-making. You will be punished later on for mistiming jumps or making the wrong moves but don't worry about making mistakes, because it's all a matter of trial and error. There only penalty is to be sent back to the last checkpoint reached (or the start of the level if no checkpoints are reached).\n\n[h1]Things to look forward to:[/h1]\n- The start of the game is soothing and enjoyable to play.\n- Controls are simple and easy to grasp.\n- Unique physics and gravity mechanics.\n- The atmosphere and feel of the game is quite comforting and welcoming.\n- The orchestral soundtrack is excellent and accompanies the levels very well.\n- Gameplay is smooth at 60 fps and frame rate drops are very rare.\n- Enemies and obstacles are introduced at a consistent rate and are easy to understand.\n- There are a good variety of enemies and obstacles, requiring strategic planning to pull through.\n\n[h1]Things to look out for:[/h1]\n- The levels are linear and rarely reward creativity, if not punishing for it.\n- The rotation when moving around may cause nausea and motion sickness.\n- Difficulty will spike around the second half of the game and will require precision and timing.\n- The movement of the octopuses is a little slippery and can cause a lot of deaths (and frustration) especially when the direction of gravity changes suddenly.\n- Some levels are deprived of important checkpoints and will require a lot of focus (anger doesn't count).\n- [spoiler]The teleportation ability of the blue octopus does not work when used to move through lasers and can cause suicides.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The slowdown ability of the green octopus is very inconsistent and can ruin specific movement patterns of enemies and obstacles.[/spoiler]\n- The music can become jumbled and buggy when going in water.\n- There's no way to change the zoom of the camera, reducing awareness and preventing some levels from being traversed properly.\n\n[h1]Tips:[/h1]\n- Adjust the screen rotation rate and shake to what makes you feel the most comfortable (the rotation can get a little crazy and the shaking can be distracting).\n- Never stick to one particular rate of rotation and keep the orient camera button within reach.\n- It is not necessary to complete the levels from a to z in order to progress through the game (only rescued specimens are required to progress).\n- Watch out for a sudden loud noise when rescuing an octopus.\n\n[h1]Who should buy this game?[/h1]\nPlayers avid about platformers will likely enjoy this game especially with the increase in difficulty during the end-game, but casual players looking for an easy experience may want to avoid this game for the sake of sanity. People who get motion sick and nauseated easily may also want to stay away.\n\n[h1]Personal comments[/h1]\nI'm not sure why I pushed myself to 100% this game but there's something charming about this particular game that made me want to come back. Maybe it's the soundtrack I absolutely adored or the love-hate relationship with the layout of the later levels or the design choices that were made, but I really enjoyed this game for everything it had to offer. I guess the frustration was worth it in the end.\n\nThanks for reading\nKevin\n\nEdits:\nAdded a 'What is this game?' and 'What should I expect?' section, reworded some sections and made the headings more concise.", "timestamp_created": 1474292197, "timestamp_updated": 1474433493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733532965183258057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25512888": {"recommendationid": "25512888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278483447", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1473881955}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy entretenido a precios bajos y se puede utilizar en cualquier pc", "timestamp_created": 1473954039, "timestamp_updated": 1473954039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25488495": {"recommendationid": "25488495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028865504", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 321, "last_played": 1473654691}, "language": "english", "review": "PROS:\nAirscape is a challenging game in the sense that Battletoads on the NES was challenging. You will rage quit at the twitchy levels and extreme difficulty. However, the level of difficulty lends to its' fun. The levels and unique challenges in each area make it so that you never really get \"bored\" with a level for too long. The gravity switching is actually done quite well, and the multiple characters make it so you will want to go back and replay earlier levels with new abilities.\n\nBAD:\nHowever, there is really no reason to \"finish\" this game as all that is offered is the challenge. The characters are lifeless vehicles to move along to the next level. Literally any number of pixels could have been switched with the (albeit adorable) squids, and it would not have impacted the story *at all*. The \"enemy\" is aliens who mess with gravity apparently, but that is really never explained, nor is the main reason why the squids get kidnapped in the first place. There is no story to be had here, even in the Super Meat Boy sense (where you had some continunity with bandage girl). There is no explaination as to why getting your sea creature friends back \"unlocks\" levels, which will piss you off due to the arbitrary sense of the progression.\n\nALSO BAD:\nThe controls suck in this game. The basic platformer controls work for the levels where you spend most of the level on land. However, some of the special moves, such as the teleporting squid, make it impossible to teleport upwards in situations where it would make total sense to do so. However, when you get underwater is where the controls truly suck. Imagine Resident Evil style tank controls...but on a twitchy platformer. It's that bad.

Cute but not trying too hard.\n  * Options to tone down (or disable) camera rotation for people who get motion sickness\n  * Each zone has a theme (beaches, caves, poison clouds, moon, etc.)\n  * You unlock different characters with slightly different attributes (movement speed, ability to float, ability to \"warp dash\")\n  * Great checkpoint placement - I've never felt screwed by the lack of a checkpoint\n  * Somebody put thought & care into the level design. It's not Portal-tier design, but definitely pretty good.\n  * Optional speedrun incentive: some levels have gems that can only be collected for a limited time.\n\n\nCons:\n\n  * Movement controls take some getting used to. They're very predictable, but you need do need to be ready to learn to compensate for momentum to avoid running into everything, especially in water levels.\n  * There's a maximum camera rotation speed, and a few levels require you to think quickly while your character is rotation faster than the camera.\n  * Movement controls are relative to the character and not to the camera\n  * Some levels have fans in them. Imo fans are incredibly frustrating to work with: sometimes I'm blasted into the air, sometimes I hover. I have no ability to predict how I will move from how I approach the fan.

There are usually two or three critters per level, some in convenient locations and some out of the way or requiring a mad dash through the level to reach in time, and unlocks are based on these, which gives a good deal of freedom to pick your levels and avoid some particularly nefarious ones if you so choose (full disclosure: the levels featuring maneuvering in water almost made me give up on it early, but I'm quite glad I stuck it out).\n\nAs the title might indicate, there are some gravitational shenanigans involved - the levels usually take place on essentially tiny planetoids, and the direction that is 'down' will often shift several times over the course of a level (and as many levels have curved ground, often without even thinking about it). It's all part of the level itself, though - the controls are pretty elegantly minimal (up/right/left/shift-for-special-ability). This leaves the levels themselves to hold most of the complexity and they do that well - there are 15 areas in the main game, each with their own style and features, and you end up winding your way through an impressive array of platforms, lasers, cannons, robots, water, acid, homing missiles, mines, and of course the final boss, a force too menacing to be described.\n\nIt's a great game. If you're looking for a platformer that's reasonably challenging - but not unreasonably challenging - look no further.\n\n(Side note: I got the 'complete the game in under an hour' achievement despite my playtime on the save file being around five hours, so don't be put off by that - it's probably summing the actual level completion times.)", "timestamp_created": 1471381879, "timestamp_updated": 1471381879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550821661949157715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24945535": {"recommendationid": "24945535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063610575", "num_games_owned": 698, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1468973363}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si no eres de los que se desesperamente tras morir y morir y morir y morir una y otra vez y te gustan los plataformas con un gran toque de puzzles te encantar\u00e1 este juego.

Indeed: you may start the first few levels, wondering what you can expect more from that kiddish game. Then the difficulty will rise up and rise up, and if you ARE a REAL gamer, you will KEEP on pressing RESTART even after your HUNDREDTH death just because you want to finish that DARN level! So: a very smart level design.\n\nPlus, there are Items to gather, Characters to unlock, Secret Levels to find, almost no bug whatsoever so far, and a real and authentic effort in the overall structure and graphics of that game. That is a lot of old-school way (I did not say retro) of thinking there, which is really satisfactory.

There are 1 to 3 optional collectables per level, never too far from the main path. A handful of these collectables are time restricted and require you to speedrun the level with a not too strict time limit.\n\nSome movement quirks take a bit of practice to get used to, notably the way jumping out of water works (the incline of the water surface against gravity determines how much of your momentum you get to keep) and the fact that whenever gravity changes your controls also change instantly, before the camera can even catch up.\n\nThe difficulty curve is fairly smooth and the game isn't terribly difficult if you're used to the genre. For reference I'm (probably) the target audience for this kind of game and I beat it entirely in around 7 hours according to Steam. Actually challenging levels start to appear about 2/3 through when some enemies ripped straight from N+ show up.\n\nThere are a few mostly inconsequential bugs; if you die in water sometimes the music stays muffled when you respawn and fixes itself next time you jump out of water. The very last secret level also has plenty of visual glitches whenever you respawn which may or may not fix themselves when you progress to the next section of the level.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game to people interested in the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1462706160, "timestamp_updated": 1462706160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549580276012420654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22624354": {"recommendationid": "22624354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012934956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1480712055}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Early Impressions[/b]\n\nEcco The Dolphin + Super Mario Galaxy + Super Meat Boy\n\nIt's pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1461561117, "timestamp_updated": 1461561117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479209095239639282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22517353": {"recommendationid": "22517353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162534450", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 245, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1471479019}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting, sweet, cute little characters, he invironment is colorful and changable and the music is also great :)", "timestamp_created": 1461079538, "timestamp_updated": 1461079538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507448554039001465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22102510": {"recommendationid": "22102510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047454339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1591688315}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite enjoyable.

You're all lifted up through the sky by a massive tractor beam, but you alone happen to fall off and come crashing down on an unfamiliar planet. Dazed and confused, you have but one thought; to reunite with your friends.\n\nThrough the first few levels, Airscape is relatively standard platformer fare. You can walk, jump and run, and you have to avoid minor obstacles, like pits and moving enemies. In each level, you'll find a small amount of sea critters held captive in orbs, and your objective is to rescue as many as possible of these and make it to the goal pad. Some of these sea critters are timed challenges, and if you can't make it to them in time, a spacecraft will arrive to take them away. Their locations will still be marked though, so if you see an empty dotted circle, you'll know what you have to do.\n\nAfter making it through the first zone, the space map opens up, and you'll see the next zone of levels, as well as a fortified containment level. From now on you're free to zip through space and select levels as you wish. There are four containment levels in total, and for every one of them you beat, you open up a few more zones on the map, until you've unlocked all 15 and the final boss. Here's where you also get a bit more freedom of choice: Each containment level holds one of your octopus kin captive, and when you release an octopus, it's added to your lineup to choose from at the start of each subsequent level. The different octopuses have their own unique skills, which facilitate different play styles, and it's likely that you'll find a favorite among them. Some can't run, but compensate for their lack of speed through other means. One octopus can slow down time in its near vicinity, and is thus a good choice for when things start getting hectic. There is also a teleporting octopus, which has the ability to zap straight past certain obstacles. It requires a bit of precision though, since it's easy to smash straight into the ground or an enemy, but this octopus seems like a good option once you start learning the ropes.\n\nThe way gravity works is that there's a pull perpendicular to whichever surface you're closest to. In effect this means that if you're going uphill, the surface will tilt towards you to keep you on a level plane, and if a jump brings you closer to the ground above you, you'll flip around and fall towards that surface. In water, there's no concept of gravity, and you're free to move whichever way you want. There are hotkeys to adjust the screen rotation rate while playing, so it's easy to adjust rotation to a level you find comfortable.\n\nOne of the game's main strengths, in my opinion, is that there's a ton of variation; not just in enemy types and obstacles, but also in game mechanics and design. The gravity mechanics enable a level design where the ground not only is functional, but also has a curved and visually appealing topography. There are both low and no gravity levels, and even a level with alternating gravity. Enemies range from robotic tanks and aggressive UFOs to sniper rifles, homing missiles, huge showers of meteors, and a bunch more.\n\nEach zone have their own orchestral musical themes. I'm especially fond of Eclipse, which has sort of a gothic rock opera feel to it. At least that's what I'm imagining it to be, though I don't have anything to compare it with for reference. You'll find the soundtrack on [url=http://samulis.bandcamp.com/album/airscape-the-fall-of-gravity-ost]Bandcamp[/url], where you can give it a free listen before deciding to pay-what-you-want for high-quality downloads. The visuals are colorful and clean, and though there isn't a ton of variation in textures, there's an attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. Like the leaves and cotton balls floating around in the foreground, and plants jiggling a bit when you walk past them. There are also some subtle changes in the expressions of the octopus protagonists, like when their eyes bulge slightly when an enemy is near. Another thing that I found adorable is how when you rescue sea animals, they bob about in a trail behind you throughout the rest of the level.\n\nIt took me slightly less than 12 hours to rescue enough sea critters to unlock the boss encounter and get through the game. That time also includes finding and completing two hidden levels and well over 2000 deaths and retries. There are more than enough sea creatures to rescue to complete the game, and since difficulty varies between levels and your choice of octopus and player skill, you might find that you'll get through the game faster. The hidden levels can be unlocked by finding a hidden exit in some of the levels, and levels with such exits are marked on the map once you've rescued every animal in them.\n\nThe game can be played with either a keyboard or a gamepad, and though I prefer keyboard controls, my wired Xbox 360 controller works well both in menus and in-game. Most input buttons can be remapped, and in addition to movement and screen rotation, there's also an input to quickly restart from the last checkpoint. There are a few graphical settings that can be tweaked, but I had no problems running the game at a stable 60FPS on my laptop with Linux Mint 17 KDE and GeForce GT 630M. I did eventually decide to turn a few settings to low, but only because the back- and foreground effects started to give me a hint of motion sickness. By default, the game will try to adjust settings to give you a stable performance, but this can be turned off if you prefer to tune things manually. There's also a timer that can be turned on and will be displayed in the upper left corner, which should be handy for speedrunners.\n\nAirscape is unlike anything I've played, and though it looks like a Super Mario Galaxy in 2D, you should expect something closer to [i]Super Meat Boy[/i] or [i]Dustforce DX[/i] in terms of difficulty. The game has a fair share of checkpoints though, so less experienced players should still be able to get through it with some persistence. I finished the game a week ago, but I'm far from done with it, and have been picking it up for a bit every day since to try to rescue more sea creatures and uncover more secrets.\n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] This review was originally published on [url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/a-review-of-gravity-platformer-airscape-now-has-linux-demo.5921]GamingOnLinux[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1441958987, "timestamp_updated": 1441958987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664528012275695801", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17976892": {"recommendationid": "17976892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028049202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1443817058}, "language": "english", "review": "Mixed feelings about this one. It's almost really good, but a few things stop it from shining.\n\nI feel like I would have enjoyed the game a lot more if it was a bit easier. The difficulty around the middle of the game was perfect, but the last few levels were just frustrating. I loved Super Meat Boy, and managed to 100% that game, but I really don't want to go through that kind of torture again, especially from a game that looks so cute.\n\nThere's also a lot of minor bugs in the game, that add up and start to get a bit annoying. In the level with the moving squares of water, the music broke when in the water, and got so distorted that I had to mute my audio. Fireballs sometimes clearly hit me but I don't die. Stuff like that.\n\nRocks really annoyed me. I kept thinking they were part of the background! So many deaths caused by running into rocks.\n\nThe graphics are also kind of bland. They're passable, but just... not that interesting or appealing.\n\nAnyway! The game still has some solid platforming gameplay, and the gravity and swimming mechanics were implemented very well and were surprisingly intuitive. Collecting sea creatures was satisfying, and I got all of them so far in the first 16 zones, minus one. \n\nFans of Super Meat Boy should check this game out, if they want something very similar.

The game has a demo on Steam that is fun to play. It has simple but lovely graphics and a very easy set of game mechanics coupled to some fairly interesting physics and a decent control system. All these things point to the game being pretty damned cool and it is, right until it is not.\n\nAt first glance Airscape: The Fall of Gravity may well remind you of a classic platformer on a Nintendo system called Super Mario Galaxy but in a colourful 2D. You jump around as various sea creatures from small islands or floating water globules spinning the screen, swimming fast or slow as you collect other various sea creatures who bounce along merrily behind you until you find a portal that sets them free. Between yourself and these lovable creatures are various traps, bombs, squid bashing robots, lasers and\u2026 well, everything really! It feels extremely smooth, very controllable and generally lovely to play.\n\nIf you have been lucky enough to boot up the free demo (is there any other kind?) you will likely come away quite happy thinking that, yes, this is a game you could buy and enjoy once it is released. The problem lies in after you have purchased the full game at whatever undisclosed price it shall be. Hopefully just before you do you will manage to read this or other reviews that are allowed to be read a whole one day before the game goes on global sale because what you see in the demo is essentially it but with harder levels, harder puzzles that sometimes become frustrating in some areas and no real reward bar some small progression and possibly a chance to punch yourself in the arm proudly.\n\nDo not get me wrong, if you enjoy the kind of puzzle game you often find on your mobile device and if this games full release price is around five US Dollars then you could still walk away with a feeling of satisfaction however if you expect an actual in-depth PC game then you may well be best looking elsewhere because whilst the levels do vary in looks they do not vary much in the overall experience and this is why, based purely on assumption and forty years of gaming, I think this game had a review and stream embargo. I am quite sure the publishers and PR people will claim it is so as not to spoil the surprise of later levels or the bosses you get to fight but in reality I think we as gamers know that it is to avoid anyone saying \u201cIs that it?\u201d before buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1441807581, "timestamp_updated": 1441807581, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405013293027877808", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17956205": {"recommendationid": "17956205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053014019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1434109384}, "language": "english", "review": "Great spin on the 2D platformer genre.", "timestamp_created": 1441805200, "timestamp_updated": 1441805200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450458228588104248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17914977": {"recommendationid": "17914977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002877290", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1447950735}, "language": "english", "review": "Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is an action platformer game about an octopus lost in a strange and dangerous world, where regular laws of gravity simply don\u2019t apply, and it\u2019s sure to attain decent amount of attention from platformer genre fans. This indie title was developed by students from around the world, and its simple premise allows for the focus to be solely on the gameplay, rather than the story of a platformer game that really doesn\u2019t need one.\n\nWhen you hit solid ground for the first time, after a some kind of a movement tutorial,  the feeling is surprisingly familiar. As you may guess, you don't stay there for too long. Soon enough you start floating around and defying the laws of gravity. Your little octopus is able to sprint, run and jump its way around the level, and even backtrack or spin around itself in all possible directions.\n\nI often found that many sections of Airscape required a lot more thought than some classic side-scrollers and you really can't rely on any kind of luck when progressing. Everything is thought-out perfectly and it's up to you to step up to the challenge. There sure is alot, and I really mean alot of trial and error in Airscape, so it\u2019s definitely a positive circumstance that level times don\u2019t have an impact on any scoring in the game.\n\nThere is no score system in Airscape whatsoever, you progress along by means of gathering collectibles and thus unlocking future stages. Here, these take the form of a variety of sea-bound critters held captive by the mysterious glowing, circular machines. Guiding your octopus to the end of each stage is barely even half of the battle, and it\u2019s in freeing these captive sea critters where the real challenge lies.\n\nThe gravity-based puzzles are extremely interesting, and the original mix of liquid and land plains makes for some snappy button mashing from time to time. Precision is everpresent, that is obvious from the very first level.At some aspects Airscape's inovations really do extend far enough to make it a really great game, although overall floaty style can occasionally make it as frustrating as it is interesting. \n\nOne thing I really regret is that you can't kill off your enemies by any means. Sure, the game isn't designed in a way that you could directly kill, but at some occasions it would really be a neat touch.\n\nAirscape: The Fall of Gravity is a amazing example of platformer-puzzler game with a quirky premise and many interesting mechanics. I've personally been waiting for a chgallenge like this since the release of Super Meat Boy, some years ago.\n\nThose who stick with it until the end, or should we say \u2013 those who are skilled enough to actually finish the game, will definitely be in for a rewarding and different experience.\n\n[url=https://pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com/2015/09/06/review-airscape-the-fall-of-gravity/]FULL REVIEW[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1441558465, "timestamp_updated": 1441558484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625710487365722656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17750679": {"recommendationid": "17750679", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999342177", "num_games_owned": 981, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1452621994}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Airscape: The Fall of Gravity - A Steam Review[/h1]\n \n[i][Disclamer - I was provided a copy of by the publisher for review purposes][/i]\n \n[b]The good[/b]\n [list]\n[*] The quirky graphics\n[*] Nice gameplay idea\n[/list] \n\n [b]The not so good: [/b]\n[list]\n[*] The rotation is a lot, even at the lowest setting.

It started out as a strong, fun platformer that reminded me of Super Mario Galaxy. Then it turned into a game that was even more frustrating than Squirreltopia for me. I regularly play \"hardcore indie platform\" games, but the later levels were just beyond frustrating for a few reasons. First, it would be simple platform parts for about the first 40 seconds of the level, then after doing that 40 seconds of precision, but simple platforming, you get to the actual 'hard' platforming which ammounts to several environmental affects/enemies happening at once or an offscreen kill. Then the game ceased to be fun. Overall, great concept and execution, but lacking a bit in making levels fun, fair, and still challenging. Green squid levels are the worst since they literally drag on and on. I eventually just beat them all with purple.

Other octopuses with unique abilities are unlocked as players complete zones. My favorite is the blue one, which can teleport small distances instead of dashing. Each zone is broken into about three or four levels with a few exceptions. These zones are made of stylistically themed floating platforms and waterways and each introduces a new kind of danger or platforming element.

They also specified Mac support as well for August, but I haven\u2019t seen anything else confirming it directly as yet.\n\nWhile the game doesn\u2019t have the same degree of cartoonish gore as Super meat Boy, a number of the game mechanics will feel somewhat familiar.  The unique element that it brings to the table is game area rotation with a heavy focus on gravity to solve the various levels.\n\nYou are an Octopus who\u2019s friends have been kidnapped by mysterious mechanical beings.  And it is your task to navigate levels, rescuing critters while avoiding deadly traps and mastering gravity.\n\n[h1]Controls and Performance[/h1]\n\nAirscape feels good to play from a control perspective.  The character movements are very responsive whether you\u2019re using the keyboard or a controller.  By and large, the control options are fairly simplistic which adds to overall aesthetic\n\nAs far as performance goes, the obvious intent behind Airscape is to maintain a crisp 60 frames per second.  It switches resolutions on the fly without reloading the graphics like most games require, likely a feature of its\u2019 HTML5 base.  Further to that, it has an option to downscale graphical quality on the fly in order to maintain a high framerate which is incredibly important to platformers, especially ones of this kind where precise movements are the difference between success and failure.\n\nNormally, rotational motion is a huge problem in games because of people prone to motion sickness.  The devs included a very simple option to let you choose precisely how fast the screen rotates, as well as controlling screen shake which handles the motion sickness problem handily.  Turning the rotation down too slow, can impact how well you can play as the game is obviously intended to be played unadjusted, but that is a relatively minor gripe.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nAirscape can be very hard, perhaps unless you\u2019re a platforming master.  You will run into sections and levels that cause frustration but the beauty of the difficulty curve is that it is manageable.  A level is difficult for a while, until you master the movements to make it through.  And the devs did a good job of changing up the variety so that no two levels seem to have quite the same failure point.  I found that I never ran into a brick wall, two levels in a row which is clever forward thinking design.\n\u2003\n[h1]Graphical Quality[/h1]\n\nWhen choosing to go with a stylized aesthetic as Cross-Product did, you can get away with some things graphically speaking that would otherwise be a problem.  It is not an amazing looking game by any stretch.  The color palette is very bright, the characters very cute.  I did feel that some more personality could have been added to your metallic opponents though.  The world is very style heavy, but a number of the obstacle types are lackluster by comparison.\n\nThere is a fair amount of attention to detail though in minor animation on the level.  Everything from background animation and skyboxes down to trees and bushes swaying when you move past them.\n\nUltimately, the graphical presentation isn\u2019t harmed in any way by the simple aesthetic.  It is a game that should age very well.\n\n[h1]Quality Assurance[/h1]\n\nI have very few concerns on the quality assurance side of the coin.  Airscape is a very simplistic game in its\u2019 overall design, which leads to fewer bugs and Cross-Product has delivered a solid game that I didn\u2019t experience any major issues or crashes.  The only bug related problems that I encountered in my playthrough were related to music overlaps where the music would occasionally not terminate when exiting a level, causing multiple tracks to be played over top of one another simultaneously.  This is a frustrating problem that does require reloading the game to fix, but it also wasn\u2019t something that happened all the time, so in the grand scheme of things is relatively minor.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nAirscape: The Fall Of Gravity is a clever platformer with game mechanics that are fairly uncommon.  I can\u2019t say that they are entirely brand new ideas, but put together in a cohesive, if ridiculous and cute package that is satisfying from start to finish.  You will die, you will get stuck, you might even walk away \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 off, only to return an hour later and smash that tricky level to dust.\n\nThe performance and control scheme is spot on, the game looks good and is a ton of fun to play.  People who get hit harder by motion sickness may want to avoid it, or at least try out the demo first before committing to a purchase.\n\nAll in all, it is a very solid game with few problems.  If you\u2019re a fan of platformers, then this title is right down your alley and is definitely worth your time.  It does what it sets out to do very well.\n\n[h1]Rating[/h1]\n\n[b]9 out of 10.[/b]\n", "timestamp_created": 1439319792, "timestamp_updated": 1439319792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538385331630706787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17491537": {"recommendationid": "17491537", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987930658", "num_games_owned": 3311, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1439226807}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic little title that shows alot of character and has a pretty addictive gameplay style.

Levels have a lot of gravity based puzzles. You can jump from floor to ceiling, and rotate around small bits of land. It's pretty fun, especially in later levels when gravity is also used in traps and enemies.\n\nTo unlock the next chapter, you have to save \"critters\" within each level. Most are just hidden collectibles, but occasionally you will have a timer that starts when you begin a level, in order to save them. It's not hard to collect enough, and if you feel frustrated with collecting some, you can simply complete the level without saving any critters, or skip to the next level.\n\nAs you play the game, you'll save some octopus friends with different new abilities, which adds further freshness to the game.\n\nIt's a very simple game, with easy to understand mechanics, although levels later on do provide a challenge for people looking for something a bit harder.
