It is, however, free of microtransactions and other horrible things one can find in phone games. It is also not marred by the filth of common phone games, so that\u2019s a very big bonus\u2026 Even if the sheer fact that it is a phone game gives me conniptions.\n\n So, Divide by Sheep, being a phone game, works with just the mouse. The Player needs to escort sheep from platforms onto a raft, by losing as few sheep as possible. The game world is split into a bunch of platforms (islands), and these islands have up to 9 slots. Most often they have far fewer than 9 - maybe around 4 on average.\n\n The islands, safe for the one next to the raft, feature sheep. A number of sheep. The raft can fit up to 9 sheep at a time, but it doesn\u2019t actually do that. Instead, the raft leaves whenever a certain number of sheep is reached or exceeded. Exceeding the number of sheep means that the Player does not get a star - and the Player wants to get every single star - so they need to make use of the islands - some of which have fewer slots, while others have more - cut down the number of sheep they\u2019re throwing on the rafts.\n\n But what\u2019s this sheep throwing? Well, the Player can move a stack of sheep from one island to its adjacent islands by clicking, holding while dragging onto the desired island, and releasing to have the sheep get thrown onto said island. If there are more sheep in the stack than there are slots on the island\u2026 Well, the excess falls into the water and dies.\n\n That\u2019s the game, but it would be too simple if it was so. Introducing obstacles - walls that block throwing sheep to one of the separated islands from the other separated island; wolves that eat a number of sheep and then take up space afterwards; different rafts, some for wolves, some for sheep, and remember - wolves can\u2019t be thrown when they eat a sheep; there are laser walls that split the passing sheep in two (very morbid) but they still count if you duct-tape the pieces together.\n\n There are many ways the developers have varied up the levels and have made the solutions to the puzzles*  more interesting or complex. I put an apostrophe on the word puzzle, because it\u2019s more of a funky equation than a proper puzzle\u2026 Though it could be described as a puzzle.\n\n So, then\u2026 How many levels are there? 30 per world, and there are 5 worlds, so that\u2019s a total of 150 whole levels. Lots of time to spend on exercising your brain, and I\u2019ve got to say - this is the kind of game that\u2019s almost a perfect game, because it\u2019s like chess. It\u2019s like chess in the sense that the gameplay is so simple it isn\u2019t really fun, BUT the act of playing the game and the thinking you do makes it incredibly amusing. Thus, 3/3\n\nPresentation\n\n This game is monstrously cute. The sprites for the characters are wonderful, the backgrounds and sets are colorful and cheerful - truly lovely - and the whole feeling the visuals bring about is one of\u2026 Well, idyllic bliss, really. It\u2019s a really pretty game.\n\n Not only that, but the visual effects are also very nice, especially the animations. When the Player clicks a stack of sheep(or wolves), their eyes widen and tears form at their edges, as though the stack is overwhelmed with anxiety. That\u2019s a really nice touch. \n\n There\u2019s a very nice visual indicator of which islands can be jumped to from a certain island, which indicator is the platforms rising up. It\u2019s simple, but it\u2019s incredibly effective. The sound effects are very reasonable and tame, and I especially like the sound of the wolf-raft sailing away successfully.\n\n The music is also incredibly neat, pleasant and capable of not getting in your head irreversibly. Almost perfect as ambience.\n\n Then, there's the way new mechanics and obstacles are introduced - via some very neat comic panels that provide about as much information as the Player may need to deal with the problems at hand.\n\n Lastly, but definitely not least, there\u2019s the dark humor aspect of it. It\u2019s a bit morbid, but it is a bit funny. When a sheep gets halved, there\u2019s ludicrous amounts of blood, there\u2019s innards and there\u2019s a sheep\u2019s corpse. Then when that winds up on the raft, it just gets duct-taped back together, as if it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s so spectacularly magical, I have no words!\n\n I\u2019ve nothing to point at and say: \u201cbad\u201d in relation to Divide by Sheep\u2019s presentation! 3/3\n\nStory\n\n Death (or what looks like Death) is playing Chess with his companion, an octopus/some unspeakable and unknowable eldritch being. He\u2019s not very happy, but then he gets an idea. If a lot of nice little critters die, they\u2019ll end up with Death. So, with his octopus/cthulhu-esque buddy, Death creates a flood that washes away almost everything.\n\n And that\u2019s everything. This is just a simple little thing to establish why stuff is as it is, and it works quite well, though it is very simple. Too simple, almost, and that undermines the fact that it does its job very well. I suppose I want a lot more out of a story, and there was very little in this one. In fact, I thought there would be a story-related cinematic before every world, but that was not the case. Alas... 1/3\n\nLegendary Point\n\n Does this game get the legendary point, so craved and wanted by all and none at the same time? After giving it a big think, I\u2019ll have to say that NO, it does not get the Legendary Point, because it\u2019s just a time killer for yours truly. BUT for a child, a developing child - this game is going to be an amazing thing to give to said child. Don\u2019t feed your kids Fortnite or Call of Duty, give \u2018em this! 0/1\n\nConclusion\n\n7/10. This is a stupendous little game, worth every penny of its price, and even more when gotten on sale. I\u2019d recommend it to literally everybody, especially to parents with kids/responsive teenagers. It\u2019s an amazing little gem.\n\n I tuck it under my belt, another shining achievement that I proudly display.

suggested.\n\nInsane math level required? No. The 1st 2 worlds require some math to solve, but the rest of the game turned into simple puzzles that we can easily solve like any other puzzles, using the pattern. And each time a new mechanism is introduced, they lower the difficultly back to beginner level for the players to learn how the new mechanism works. Which is fair imo... but when they start doing only new mechanism introduction all through the game, this simply means all we get is the introduction levels for these mechanism and nothing more.. yeah.. beginner levels and not very challenging. I can see how these mechanism are fun and can be super challenging and insane when a good puzzle builder get their hands on them, but the devs of this game doesn't have those skills to build a tough puzzle, so all they do is a repeat of new mechanism and ideas on easy level, they didn't even do a good mix of all the mechanism they introduced, which is such a waste of ideas.\n\nThe end comes with a \"?\" behind, so the game is suggesting a sequel or even DLC... but if they only wish to introduce new ideas and haven't the skill to make these ideas into challenging puzzles, they might as well open this up in the workshop and let the community share their own made puzzles. At least these ideas are really great and can become even better in the right hands.\n\nAnyway... at this point, i can only recommend this to kids. Not to a puzzle solver that love challenges, cuz this will certainly end with disappointment.

"review": "Divide By Sheep is a puzzle game where the player has to move groups of sheep, wolves and pigs between small islands, and either guide them to the safety of a life raft, or collect their souls for the Grim Reaper.\n\nThere are various hazards which could kill the animals. Firstly the islands can be different sizes, and if an island is smaller than the group, some of them will fall into the water and drown. Wolves will eat sheep and pigs if you jump them onto the same island, while pigs will knock sheep into the water. Laser beams will slice sheep in half, although if you send two halves onto the lift raft they get joined back together with sticky tape.\n\nEvery level has three objectives to complete which reward you with stars. However, I don\u2019t really like how these objectives work. They ask you to either save or kill a specific number of animals, for example 5 sheep, 2 pigs, 3 sheep, and you have to get exactly that amount. If you save more, you still fail the objective. I would have preferred a more traditional \u201csave more animals, get more stars\u201d puzzle design. Failing by being too successful just doesn\u2019t feel right.\n\nSo each level involves trying to figure out how to use the hazards to intentionally kill off a few animals from each group so that you can fulfil the objective. Fortunately you only need to complete one objective to unlock the next level.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re trying to get all the stars, you have to perform the objectives in order, which means there\u2019s usually a correct movement sequence to solve the level, and the lack of an undo move button means one mistake can cause you to have to restart the level.\n\nNot a terrible game, but one of the weaker puzzle games I\u2019ve played.

If you enjoy feeling stupid and want to reinforce your lack of math skills buy this game.\n\n2. If you enjoy spending more time looking at a Youtube walkthrough to pass certain levels, buy this game.\n\nNow onto my actual thoughts about Divide by Sheep. \n\n[b] What I liked about Divide by Sheep [/b]\n\n- The art style is pleasant, and adorable. It comes off as a children's book, and you're drawn in by the bright colors and neat effects. The different characters and objects you interact with all have their own unique animations and it's sometimes fun to see them come to life. \n\n- The gameplay is superb, even though I am a complete ignoramus when it comes to puzzle games, especially ones dealing with math...it wasn't even complex math...I'm just dumb. There are a variety of ways to eviscerate the sheep and the levels become more and more complex as you progress. I really enjoyed seeing what each level offered, even if I was awful at the game. \n\n- The story, although not the main attraction by any means, is actually pretty fun. It's told in still images, but it gives you enough push forward to see where Death is willing to go to invite more 'friends' over to hang out. \n\n[b] Things I didn't like about Divide by Sheep [/b]\n\n-My biggest issue with this game is the lack of an undo feature. If you fail a level, you have to begin all over and that can become frustrating very quickly, especially in later levels that become really complex really quickly. I would have liked an option to undo certain actions. Even limiting it to 3 per level would have been welcome instead of forcing me to redo all my work. \n\n-The only other minor problem I had with the game was the music. While at first it matches up perfectly to the game, being pleasant and welcoming, it quickly becomes tedious. I actually was able to turn up the volume while playing this game to torture my partner into making me coffee because she didn't want to hear the steady melody no longer. \n\n[b] Final Thoughts [/b]\n\nI didn't expect to enjoy this game, and honestly, by the end of it I was glad I was done. Not because the game was bad, but because it made me [i] feel [/i] bad for being a big dumb dumb. I usually avoid the puzzle genre because I am intimidated by the complexity of the games, but this game was enjoyable and oftentimes  rewarding when I beat a level I was really struggling with.

You will know very quickly if you are enjoying the game -- later levels have different mechanics but the same feel, so if you like the early game, you are probably going to like the whole game. Going by achievements, 85.1% of people who completed the first world went on to complete the whole game, and 99.7% of people who completed the game got all three stars on every level. If you are not enjoying the first world, get a refund; if you are, you will have a good time throughout.\n\nI found it most fun to play in small chunks, 5 levels at a time.

This is a brightly colored game that doesn't take itself seriously and has cute sound effects and animations paired along with it. There is a vibrant positivity to this game, despite drowning and killing your sheep!\n\nYou will constantly be counting your sheep (and soon wolves, and later pigs) in order to figure out exactly what needs to happen and in what order. The order in which you do things is also very important, so there is a lot of shuffling. While it may seem repetitive at first, the game pretty consistently throws in new animals, platforms, and mechanics to keep things interesting and you will often be trying out different combinations of animals and mechanics to figure out how they work together. I found it kept my interest with all these things.\n\nThe game is super addictive and does not require you to be a genius. In each level, you have 3 objectives that must be done in order. It usually asks you to save a certain number of a specific animal or kill a certain number of animals. Each objective will earn you a star, and while getting 3 stars can be very difficult, you only need to unlock 1 or 2 per level in order to unlock the next world, so mastery is definitely optional. There were times when I wanted to just advance through the levels, but I kept going back and trying to 3 stars because the game is just that addictive.\n\nIn terms of playtime, this game will probably take you about 6-8 hours to beat, but if you are like me and want to try 3-starring every level, it will probably take about 20-30 hours (my hours logged are so high because I often left the game open in the background and played it off and on). Some of the levels are VERY tricky to figure out, but the game always feels fair and it's always clever. It is really satisfying when you have that aha moment and figure out the solution.\n\nI would also just like to chime in on some reviews that complain about the developers refusing to add an undo button. They made the right call. If I was constantly hitting undo, it would trivialize the game and I wouldn't really be *thinking* about what needs to happen and I wouldn't be learning all the mechanics and improving. It is very easy to hit reset and each level does not require a long list of moves. Trust me on this.\n\nOverall, this is a great game that gives you all the things you need to succeed but doesn't hold your hand. I highly recommend this one for puzzle game lovers!", "timestamp_created": 1587017082, "timestamp_updated": 1587017082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282048225402832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67253031": {"recommendationid": "67253031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090641945", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 583, "last_played": 1569549777}, "language": "english", "review": "Would I have paid attention to this game if I hadn't gotten a free key?

A lot. Once the story is all said and done, (story is well done by the way, just takes away some of your freedom if you want to make another character and have to sit through it again) it's incredibly open ended.

And the mods. My god, this community is up there with Team Fortress 2 and Garry's Mod with the quality of the workshop items. Some fans have even done what Chucklefish hasn't bothered to. Patched bugs and glitches that were a hindrance to the overall experience. Overall, even with the flaws that this game has (including one I forget to mention, Chucklefish seems to have forgotten about it and have since stopped pushing updates as far as I know), it's still an enjoyable experience. The story is well written (though sometimes drags along), and once you're done with the story, the entire Galaxy is yours to explore. Replay value on different characters doesn't really exist, but staying with one you like and staying in that world, never gets old. Hell, I only have around 30 hours as of now but I'm still always hooked and find something to do.

It is a debut game produced by Victor Solodilov and Denis Novikov.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nOur goal is to save (or not) animals from flooding, mainly sheep, which was sent to them by The Grim Reaper. On the way we will encounter various obstacles. From time to time, interesting, humorous mini-histories appear between the levels. Creators have made available to us 5 different worlds composed of 30 levels, each is different and introduces new mechanics. Despite nice, fairy-tale graphics, there is also blood in the game! \n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nSoundtrack is nice to the ear and fits into the atmosphere of the game. What's important is that different music is played in each world.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nFairy-tale and nice graphics are the first thing you notice when you turn on the game. You can see that the creators tried to make the game look its best.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nDivine by Sheep is a game that has an interesting gameplay and will surely draw every fan of puzzle games for a few hours. Everything is accompanied by nice graphics and good soundtrack. The price is decent, but I think it's worth waiting for the sale. However, despite the introduction of new mechanics during the game, the game is bored after some time\n[b]\n\u2714\ufe0fNice, fairy-tale graphics.\n\u2714\ufe0fInteresting gameplay.\n\u2714\ufe0fSoundtrack\n\u2714\ufe0fSometimes it gets difficult.\n\n\u274cMonotonous\n\u274cShort\n\u274cFew errors[/b] \n\n[b][i]Time of completion: 5-6 hours[/i][/b] \n\n[b][u]Rating: 6.5/10[/u][/b]\n[b]\nATTENTION!\nPlease note that this is only my evaluation and opinion of the game.

[/h1]\n\nDivide by the sheep is a game about our society. Developers secretly hide today\u2019s modern problems like xenophobia and racism, terrorism, flood of refugees, mass pollution, social hierarchy and fear for globalization and science (post-modernism era, what can I say). It\u2019s like metaphor hidden under the sheep skin.\n\nJust think about it, this game starts from peaceful mission where you have to save sheep from flooding. But water everywhere and there is a limit for sheep on the boat. In some cases boat can only hold one person (let\u2019s be open to this metaphor). So in order to save ONE sheep I have to sacrifice 6 or more. You can\u2019t ignore that, it\u2019s a clear metaphor to our society. We sacrifice everything to save our own children but easily agree to sacrifice others. Or another perspective, this white person is rich and he pays for his survival. Greed takes over the reason for the life and we proceed for the next mission. \n\nWolves are clear representatives of dark-skinned people and pigs will be representatives of the eastern culture. There are some events where sheep protests against wolves. They started to build cages in order to protect themselves. And even if the sheep has been eaten the killer will be sent for life in a small, flooding, tiny cage. \n\nAlso, there are not only sheep. It\u2019s got wolves, pigs, krakens and some mythical golden totem (metaphor for democracy) plus there are certain mechanisms for killing such as lasers, ritual stones, portals which designed to make levels harder. \n\nEven the name of the game has its hidden meaning -\u201cDivide by Sheep\u201d. It\u2019s portrays some mocking communities (like SJW) where leaders have no idea about their country nor the outside world and still trying to `protest or be offended by anything they dislike. \n\nAs for mechanics, it\u2019s rather simple. Wolves eat sheep and only the ones who are hungry are capable to move forward. Sometimes you have to save them too and there are cases where, again, you have to leave/kill some beings behind to succeed. Wolves can eat even some parts of sheep. You can mutilate them if you ordered to go though lasers. However wolves are smart enough to evade them. It\u2019s a mockup about army because you can save body but it\u2019s already a corpse glued together. In terms of game packed corpse count as a normal sheep. \n\nIf you get closer to the end of the game there will be a death and you have to kill any living being to finish the mission. That\u2019s a clear mockup of religion. Almost every \u201cup to date\u201d religions tells you that this worlds sucks, die like \u201cnormal\u201d person (and for some, grab a few other lives with you) and you will be rewarded in the afterlife. Same as in the game but for REAL life there is only one and only ending\u2026\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1562422919, "timestamp_updated": 1562422919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508914411067962646", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53797222": {"recommendationid": "53797222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198876835039", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1562593138}, "language": "english", "review": "wow", "timestamp_created": 1562422518, "timestamp_updated": 1562422518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53791928": {"recommendationid": "53791928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250668138", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1608635412}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny and cute little game.", "timestamp_created": 1562419619, "timestamp_updated": 1562419619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576033473014831543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53739573": {"recommendationid": "53739573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060824405", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1561960370}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best.

Matching the bright graphics are upbeat music and playful sound effects. In that regard, it's a standard puzzle game, not particularly outstanding, but more than expedient on any audiovisual account.\n\nThough the levels become harder and gradually layer new mechanics on top of each other, they still stay relatively small and potentially quick to solve. Because of their brevity, the lack of an undo button doesn't hurt the flow. Before a new mechanic is introduced, there's a short sequence of explanatory images shown. However, these are obscure, hard to interpret and don't help understand the mechanics.

Overall, the difficulty is fine, though: Few puzzles are really straightforward, but also not many are what I would consider really tough nuts to crack, either, which makes this game fairly stress-free overall.\n\nGiven that there are plenty of puzzles (150 in total), one can still spend a good bit of time on the game when looking for total completion (took me about 10 hrs). The focus here is really on the puzzles - the graphics and music are accordingly relatively minimalistic, so they don't get much in the way (although the soundtrack gets quite repetitive after a while). Generally, it is made to look cute, even though the puzzle-solving involves a good bit of critters getting eaten, chopped in half, burned or drowned, so if you are extremely sensitive regarding comic-graphics animal cruelty, then this game is not for you.\n\nIf you are, however, into maths that does not quite look like maths, then I can heartily recommend Divide By Sheep to you!", "timestamp_created": 1547154313, "timestamp_updated": 1547154313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456758648157119751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48097660": {"recommendationid": "48097660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025116505", "num_games_owned": 2877, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1546639268}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute puzzle game with some pretty good puzzle design, although some levels are a bit filler.

It's very weird in concept but playing it makes for some really interesting gameplay and fun and satisfying puzzles.\n\nThe story behind this game, Is that the Grim Reaper wants friends and basically causes the world to flood, Killing most of the animals and transporting their souls to the Grim Reaper. Its now your job to save/kill the rest of the animals so they can safely get away.\n\nEach of the 5 worlds included follow similar base rules, such as all the puzzle having a similar pseudo-ish 3D effect and being based on a 3x3 grid system, However to make sure each puzzle is different, each world introduces new gimmicks, such as lasers, which split sheep in half, Bounce-pads that splits the group of sheep that gets on, Wolves, Pigs, Death Statues, Cages, Portals and much more. Each of these provides some great mind-bending puzzles. very challenging to get all 3 stars on each level. \n\nI think the game faults at perhaps too challenging puzzles, at least if you're aiming for all 3 stars, if you simply cannot get all 3 stars in a stage. if you have at least completed one of the stars your are allowed to proceed, which I think I very kind of the developers to add. One for nitpick is that the Mac OS Version hasn't been updated. this means that the achievements will not work on those computers. Nothing too major, but a downside for those you like collecting achievements.\n\nOverall, Divide by Sheep is a really solid puzzle game. with great puzzles, entertaining gameplay, and cruel deaths. Also thanks to Chrono.gg for adding the game to their Coin shop, where I purchased the game. A very good decision. Not promoting them or anything.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1541347404, "timestamp_updated": 1541347404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45605554": {"recommendationid": "45605554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364514494", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1575999096}, "language": "english", "review": "A little puzzle game that gets progressively harder as the world goes on - as it should.

Thankfully they added in \"Esc\" to exit I guess. Lastly, it isn't an \"App\" it's a \"Game.\"\n\nOverall I think the rating is inflated due to Steam's Good/Bad system.

I am not 100% sure, but it seems it is a mobile game\u2019s port (made in Flash). Both versions released quite at the same time but it still feels like a mobile game. Why is that even important? Well, if you tend to play on mobile devices as well, perhaps this is important because the game is way cheaper on mobile platforms. So check your app store and maybe you\u2019ll buy it from there if you like the game and reviews about Divide by Sheep give you any assurance : )\n\nThat being said. This game looks cute in any possible good way. Gameplay works, graphics and artwork are great, plus music and sounds are not annoying. This is a puzzle game and I thought why write another review about puzzle games. But I really liked it and spent quite a bit time there, so I might as well share my experience.\n\nGame revolves around solving math problems - hence the name. Inherently you are given set of \u201ccute\u201d numbers and you have to solve those sets using math basics for the correct answer type. Those sets are sheep, wolves and even something more awesome.  Always cute :) Answer type is how many e.g sheep you want aboard a raft. Sometimes you need them dead then there\u2019s no raft, but Grim Reaper is taking its toll. Still game logic is the same.\nUltimate goal is to get 3 golden stars. That means each problem consist actually of 3 subcategories or correct answers, if you solve them all, you\u2019ll get all the stars.\n\nAddition and subtraction goes via different max 3x3 square sized platforms or \u201cislands\u201d game characters are placed on and you can jump around those. For example you have 9 sheep (max island size) and you can only jump to next island having 5 free squares. So subtraction is made. 5 sheep are saved, no more free space, others will drown. And if the answer required was 4 deaths for Grim Reaper, that problem is solved. This is just an example because game mechanics to get to the answer are more complex. It\u2019s all math and a bit logic is also required - so if you like such puzzles, you\u2019d love this game.\n\nSo I said islands. Game has 5 worlds, each having different island \u201cfunctions\u201d and each world has 30 maps. So in total 150 puzzles. Difficulty varies. There were some that really took time to solve, I needed to take a break, and come back with refreshed mind. There are walkthroughs around but I seriously recommend not using them - ok if you bought the game for achievements, this review is not for you anyway. \n\nIsland functions. Some islands will explode if there\u2019s no trigger element left on them. Some have non-passable wired fences. Some have a laser field between them, cutting sheep in half. Some are burning and you have to go to trigger island to turn the element off. Etc.\n\nTo continue with examples from this game > sheep are eaten by wolves who after their feast cannot move anymore. One char can kill all the other chars on that platform and so forth. Every character has different functions to attend to solving the current problem. Game introduces such mechanics by progressing through the worlds. Mechanics will get more complex but the answers are always doable because well, it\u2019s maths : )\n\nTL;DR This game is fun and if you like mathematics, this game is definitely worth a try. Maybe wishlist it and wait for SALE, because yeah, on mobile it\u2019s way more cheaper.\nI really recommend Divide by Sheep.\n\n// 03.05.2018", "timestamp_created": 1528031478, "timestamp_updated": 1528031586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739470899105072021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42434970": {"recommendationid": "42434970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020409906", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 1190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1097, "last_played": 1527986890}, "language": "english", "review": "Good math puzzles\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1527895655, "timestamp_updated": 1527895655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42133686": {"recommendationid": "42133686", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996550048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1528538705}, "language": "english", "review": "i have spilt the blood of many a sheep\n\ni have led so many to their watery demise\n\njust to fulfill a cold and cruel quota", "timestamp_created": 1526791824, "timestamp_updated": 1526792335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42128377": {"recommendationid": "42128377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078040123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1211, "last_played": 1649954304}, "language": "english", "review": "Smart, funny, good balance between easy and hard to solve puzzles.

It actually had some very clever use of the mechanics - and in the introduction of new mechanics that were related to the previous ones in a surprising way.\n\nNot a hallmark of puzzle design, but still enjoyable to play.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the game gets a bit too diluted with the constant introduction of new mechanics. The main mechanic, I suppose, is that you have sheep, wolves, and have to get an exact number of each to an exit point. Each island has a limited number of spots, and only adjacent (on the square grid) islands let animals be moved. Also, wolves eat sheep, and well fed wolves will permanently occupy a spot of the island, unable to move.\n\nInitially, all the puzzles involve a certain number of sheep surviving, to get to the exit. At some point, they introduce a mechanic where, instead of getting X sheep to the boat, you have to kill X sheep. I was not expecting this, but it is a very natural extension of the mechanics that lead to many more possibilities!\nCompared to that, some of the mechanics were a bit more artificial - pressure buttons that must be pressed to avoid burning sheep on a different island, some weird teleports, a totem that kills everything on an island, etc.\n\nI don't think they were bad mechanics, simply that there were too many mechanics, and the more artificial ones could have probably been avoided to explore the \"fundamental\" ones more thoroughly.\n\n\nRegardless, I had a good time with it!", "timestamp_created": 1526764399, "timestamp_updated": 1526764399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42029800": {"recommendationid": "42029800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103839440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 204, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1526381043}, "language": "english", "review": "A decent and relaxing puzzle game which gradually increases and shows you the obstacles in simple puzzles before increasing it in difficulty so you knwo what you're doing before they're dumped on you. though that comes at the flaw of taking a while before things get interesting and take off. you'll do almost 20 levels before you see any sheep die\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Xi-U8tiRkhM", "timestamp_created": 1526273923, "timestamp_updated": 1526286761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41998464": {"recommendationid": "41998464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220850652", "num_games_owned": 566, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 956, "last_played": 1505331243}, "language": "english", "review": "Divide by Sheep?\n\nMore like Divide by Sleep!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1526134425, "timestamp_updated": 1526134425, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410430818796157837", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41891721": {"recommendationid": "41891721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078117239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1537056308}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun and it's exactly what you can expect from it, it could have better visual cues that tell you if you are doing something wrong", "timestamp_created": 1525627710, "timestamp_updated": 1525627710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41766648": {"recommendationid": "41766648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057364631", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 123, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1500976483}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the dark souls of sheep-baaaaased puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1525056126, "timestamp_updated": 1525056126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474910378456115723", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41645008": {"recommendationid": "41645008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280432783", "num_games_owned": 1644, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 161, "last_played": 1526304403}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing and funny puzzle", "timestamp_created": 1524496416, "timestamp_updated": 1524496416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536804616451263428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40886377": {"recommendationid": "40886377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059608904", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 502, "last_played": 1558786786}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little game about murdering sheep in the most brutal ways. \n\nEaten by wolf?

First one is nitpicking and doesn't affect anything but leaving a \"please rate the app\" screen at the end of the menus is just bad form. Then there was no resolution/windowed control. And this being a time-filler puzzle game it is primed for being played while consuming other media. Windowed mode (without 3rd party programs) should be considered a must. So alt+tab'ing ensued and I will note I suffered some framerate hiccups upon doing that. The game does look good at 1080p and runs at a solid 60 frames otherwise though. \n\nThe port issues aside, this game is great. The wacky theme and art. The tight puzzles. The bright color palette. It all works. The 150 puzzles are all well constructed in their simplicity. Each level features 9 or less platforms with three sets of requirements to clear. It starts with hopping sheep around. But ends up with wolves, pigs, lasers, meat eating octopus, portals, traps, flames, totems, and more. The game regularly provides new wrinkles to the puzzles. Right when one set of mechanics is wearing thin and you are in a groove you run into something new. If you go for all the \"stars\" on every level you'll find yourself with a solid 7~8+ hours of gameplay. Very much worth the price.\n\nEasy recommendation to the puzzling puzzlers out there.", "timestamp_created": 1512336386, "timestamp_updated": 1512336479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37905985": {"recommendationid": "37905985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187780511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1650772336}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and disturbing. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1511891646, "timestamp_updated": 1511891646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505977809429168701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37839310": {"recommendationid": "37839310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048915899", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1613112575}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little puzzle game.

The premise is that Death is lonely, and decides to collect himself some animal friends. Thus, the game centers around killing cute, fuzzy creatures.\n\nReally, the game is at its core about manipulating objects \u2013 sheep, wolves, and pigs \u2013 around a 2D environment. There are a series of platforms laid out in a grid, and each platform has anywhere between 1 and 9 spaces on it for animals to stand on. If you boot an animal over onto another platform, and there isn\u2019t room for it, it will be ejected from it. If you put wolves onto a platform with sheep or pigs, or vice-versa, the wolves will eat the sheep/pigs and become fat and immobile, locking off spaces from landing on them. If you bounce pigs onto a platform with sheep, the pigs will land on the sheep and kill them. If anything is on a platform with a pig, only the pig will be ejected when you launch from it.\n\nThese simple rules, combined with a few other things \u2013 a fence preventing ejection between platforms; a laser cutter which chops sheep in half (but not other things), doubling the space they take up; TNT spots, which blow up if nothing is left on the platform, removing it from play; frying spots, which burn up one animal on them per move; burners, which are turned off by buttons on another platform; a portal platform, which teleports back excess animals instead of killing them; a bounce pad, which immediately ejects any animal which lands on it onto one or more adjacent platforms (some will eject onto two, splitting the animals evenly between them); and a totem, which kills anything else on the platform it is on but can be bounced around from platform to platform by the player and is otherwise invincible \u2013 make up the gameplay.\n\nThe goal is to ship out three sets of animals, in order. Boats come on the top-left of the screen, and your goal is to load exactly the right number of exactly the right kind of animal onto the boats. There are boats for each of the wolves, sheep, and pigs, as well as a boat for Death himself, which requires you to kill X many animals (making their souls appear on his boat), and a sea monster, which just requires X amount of any sort of animal (it isn\u2019t a picky eater). There\u2019s also a boat for a totem on a few of the levels.\n\nThe boats won\u2019t leave until they\u2019re filled (or overfilled), and while you only have to get one right to progress, you need to get almost all of the boats filled to unlock consecutive worlds.\n\nThus, the goal is to get exactly the right number of animals onto the boats using the various platforms and mechanics given to you. The game gradually introduces new mechanics over its length, adding about one new mechanic every 10-15 levels, helping it to keep itself relatively fresh as it adds ever more complexity to its puzzles.\n\nOverall, the game has 150 levels, spanning 5 worlds, and takes somewhere on the order of 6-8 hours to 100%. It isn\u2019t terribly hard, generally speaking, but a few of them levels require quite a bit of cleverness to solve; none of the levels takes more than a minute or so to solve correctly, but you may be stuck on them for ten times that long if you can\u2019t figure out the right trick. It is ultimately very much math-based, and oftentimes the process of elimination is necessary to try and figure out all the ways that clearly won\u2019t work, so you can figure out the one way that will.\n\nThis is a fairly decent puzzle game, and the mechanics work well for what it is. However, it is very simple, and unless you really enjoy simple puzzle games without much in the way of story or anything else, there\u2019s nothing else here for you. \n\nThat being said, this is really a game you will probably enjoy more on your phone than on your PC; it isn\u2019t a sit down and play it for hours game (though you can do so), it is more of a throwaway thing.\n\nOverall, this is very squarely directed at a puzzle game player \u2013 the sort of simple puzzle game you might play on your phone or a similar mobile device. If you like pure puzzle games, this is a decent game, but it is hard for me to muster much enthusiasm for it - while it certainly was clever at times, and its mechanics were simple and clean, I just was never wowed by it. It is just sort of a par for the course game - never quite dull, but never all that interesting, either. If you don\u2019t like pure puzzle games, or if you like plot or purpose or anything else, this game will likely bore you.", "timestamp_created": 1495369228, "timestamp_updated": 1495369553, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530319750308990479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31879402": {"recommendationid": "31879402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019209539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1495361352}, "language": "english", "review": "Not sure how math this game is, but it sure is a puzzle game, and it was fun enough.

It might look a like cheap mobile port, but underneath there's a very solid and clever puzzle game.\n\nThe game starts simple enough. You just need to move groups of sheep between platforms and get the exact right amount of them on the rafts. But the game keeps adding more and more elements to this simple formula and soon enough you are also dealing with wolves, pigs, dynamite platforms, laser fences and many other complications. \n\nThe constant introduction of new gameplay elements keeps the game fresh and interesting. There's a good amount of content too, especially if you decide to get full three stars in each level.\n\nDespite the cute art style the game has some seriously dark undertones. Many of the levels actually require you to sacrifice a certain amount of cute animals and using the game's internal logic it makes perfect sense that a sheep cut in half by a laser fence still counts as one if you patch it back together.\n\nThe controls are clearly optimized for touch, but the mouse controls work reasonably well too. The game also has a rather prominent \"Rate this App\" link, which really should have been removed from the Steam release. On a positive note there are no microtransactions or gamebreaking powerups.\n\nOverall Divide by Sheep is a highly enjoyable math puzzle game with lots of clever ideas and interesting levels.

Divide by Sheep has plenty of mechanisms that are more relevant to logic (wolves eating sheeps then blocking cells, pigs taking priority over sheeps, lasers cutting sheeps in half but not wolves, switching platforms, triggered burners, portals, and so on..). Each element appears around every 10 levels, which makes the game never boring and always fun all along the 150 levels.\n\nThe longevity is very good, it took me 18h to complete the 150 levels at 100%, which make an average of 7mn per level, please note that I'm very slow, and that around 20% of the levels can be solved in less than 2mn, while some other ones can easily take more than 10mn. One very good point is that the difficulty is not increasing continuously like in most puzzlers, instead, some levels are sometimes more easy than the previous ones, and I never been stuck or felt frustrated. Knowing that the next level can be easier is very motivating. When finishing the game you will be granted with a 100% achievement.\n\nApart from that, the graphic design is a total success with its colorfull look, animations are smooth and very fun, maybe one bad point is that the screen resolution is locked, but it's really not a problem. The game is also divided in 5 worlds, each one with his own graphic design, mechanisms and music soundtrack (variations on the main theme). The game was made with Adobe Air (which is a very solid engine for such games), and it was designed first for touchscreen (I imagine that a tablet version should exist, I didn't check), but works perfectly with the mouse as well. There is also a parental lock if you want to remove the gore and let your 5yo kid play (it's a fun game for kids too).\n\nIf you're into puzzle games, don't hesitate one second.\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1482947099, "timestamp_updated": 1482998620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539078176021575928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28500356": {"recommendationid": "28500356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136961053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1669175594}, "language": "english", "review": "Manage to stays cute even with the gore 1000/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1482295522, "timestamp_updated": 1482295522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513513505458831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28385150": {"recommendationid": "28385150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237569370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1497952168}, "language": "english", "review": "Way too f**king cute 11/10 would fling sheeps into laser again", "timestamp_created": 1481798173, "timestamp_updated": 1481798173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28383011": {"recommendationid": "28383011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015441277", "num_games_owned": 1484, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 729, "last_played": 1467325227}, "language": "english", "review": "Math and butchering simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1481784572, "timestamp_updated": 1481784572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28356499": {"recommendationid": "28356499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328063747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1482394308}, "language": "english", "review": "fun  game to pass the time", "timestamp_created": 1481702523, "timestamp_updated": 1481702523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28353055": {"recommendationid": "28353055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075820042", "num_games_owned": 3238, "num_reviews": 435, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1446403043}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun puzzle game, the graphics are adorable.", "timestamp_created": 1481678908, "timestamp_updated": 1481678908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28339402": {"recommendationid": "28339402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311301888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1482017002}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very fun and addicting.

Yes, you also divide.\nLet me get it out of the way: this is a blatant mobile port that nonetheless ends up working ok with a mouse.\n\nThe basic mechanics have you throw groups of critters from one island to the next, with the goal of satisfying 3 requests in each, be it save an exact amount of them or kill a certain number. These requests are tied to the layout of the map and require you to move around the animals until you've satisfied them all in sequence.\nYou can merge groups on a single island (2 sheeps + 3 sheeps = 5 sheep!) as well as \"decrease them\" by throwing more than an island can take and drowning the excess. I should also mention that you [i]literally[/i] divide sheep with laser grids. In half. A bloody half. And two halves make a whole, don't forget!\nThings get more complex as the game gives you more critters who interact differently with one another (wolves eat all others, pigs squash sheeps, the golden idol that exists somehow squashes everything...) as well as different types of islands that disappear when left empty or burn any visitor.\n\nWhile the game is fun, it doesn't have a very good progression; the difficulty varies wildly from one stage and the next, but it somehow manages to be fun for the most part. \nI have to point out that it does overstay its welcome by a couple dozen stages; the last world adds slightly uninspired elements that were most likely added just to increase the duration of the game. The achievement structure also suggests this: the \"get everything\" unlocks after the second-to-last world, with one more \"get everything\" unlocking after you're done with the last world as well.\n\nAll in all, Divide by Sheep is a cute puzzle game, but I wouldn't suggest it to those who don't already love the genre.\nTo such players, go ahead and get it during a discount for a few hours of fun; feel also free to let go when you get bored though: sadly, there's no majestic puzzle design waiting for you in its last phases.", "timestamp_created": 1480699813, "timestamp_updated": 1480699813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604085981845855713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28083015": {"recommendationid": "28083015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012994966", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 595, "last_played": 1480452304}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute (and gory) kinda-math-related puzzle game.

Death is a lonely little soul with a sheep fetish (maybe he\u2019s from Buxton, I don\u2019t know), he just loves those wooly little ruminants. Being an anthropomorphic personification of the slide into decrepitude and the inevitable surcease of life, he can only be friendly with dead things. As a result and in a leap of somewhat startlingly stark logic, he decides to kill everything. In a flood. Old Testament style. Sploosh.\n\nNow this is where you come in, it\u2019s your task to float the little darlings on to rafts and rescue them from his bony clutches. So far so simple, but wait, they are on islands, and some islands only hold so many sheep. If you get them to jump from an island that can hold, say seven sheep onto one holding only four, three of them will drown and spent eternity as the grim reapers fluffy playthings! Ah well, them\u2019s the breaks. Of course, just like islands, some rafts can only hold so many sheep, so you will have to strategically drown some of them anyway just to get to the end of the level.\n\nAnd so it goes, sheep drown, sheep live, and as the game progresses you get to slice them in half with lasers (they get duct taped back together on the raft, don\u2019t worry), bounce them off trampolines, and feed them to wolves. Of course, wolves need rescuing too, so them too get to bounce about like little black motes of soot. A fed wolf can\u2019t bounce as that would cause nasty vomitory complications so they just sit there looking happy while the raft floats off into the sunset. While you tax your brain trying to work out how to meet all three victory conditions for the level or at least one of them so you can move on and see what devilry has been set in store for you next.\n\nVisually, this game screams out what it is, a mobile game that has come to Steam. With blocky, voxel style graphics, cutesy sounds and music, and a user interface that screams out \u201cI was on an iPhone\u201d in a loud squeaky voice.\n\nNone of this detracts from the inherent addictiveness of flinging sheep at laser beams, fences and the occasional kraken however, in fact it enhances the dark comedic nature of the game and has you giggling at the animated cut-scenes that explain the latest twist to the game play with visuals of bisected ruminants, flying ungulates, and snapping canidae.\n\nOn the whole, Divide by Sheep is a cute, enjoyable, darkly comedic time sucker of a game. It has a real \u201cone more level\u201d appeal to it that has had me sit to play it, and then wonder why my freshly made coffee is now cold on more than one occasion. tinyBUILD have made a bit of a corker here, and it\u2019s well worth the 4 quid it costs on Steam", "timestamp_created": 1479941544, "timestamp_updated": 1479941544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26873789": {"recommendationid": "26873789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041166275", "num_games_owned": 544, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1460832618}, "language": "english", "review": "Counting sheep was never this exciting and a test of intelligence.\nSave, drown, slice up, reassemble, burn, squash sheep, or let them be eaten by wolves.

app' screen, but separate volume sliders are always welcome and the only real negative I can think of is the lack of windowed mode. it's a must for a puzzle game like this, but I'd still recommend

It is, at its core, a puzzle/logic game. Don't let the mathiness intimidate you, if you are wont to be intimidated by mathiness. Players are able to engage in unlimited trial and error to sort out each level, as needed. Nevertheless, there have been 2 times (so far) that I've resorted to YouTube'ing a level to complete it (that's 2xs out of 100+?). So, in my opinion, Divide by Sheep is well balanced; the difficulty increases at an acceptable, steady rate which maximizes fun and minimizes frustration.\n\nIt *does* get a little repetitive at times, but Divide by Sheep is the sort of game that you can spend a couple of days away from yet come back to again (as opposed to taking a couple days off and forgetting the game exists) because the game really IS fun. Beyond the gameplay, the graphics are another positive point. The design/concepts are pleasantly ironic; there is a certain (and non-morbid) amount of satisfactory stress relief in killing sheep. Well. Not killing. Delivering them to the reaper. *cough* The cuteness of the graphics provides the perfect offset and absurdity level for what you will need to do in order to complete the levels of the game, i.e. kill sheep. \n\nOne (albeit obscure) criticism is that the comic strip-like stills between levels, which sometimes appear to \"explain\" new features added to an upcoming level, are often rather opaque in the sense that they can be very difficult to make sense of. Thankfully, Divide by Sheep is highly forgiving - you can reset any given level after experimenting to learn about a new platform \"The Hard (but still amusing) Way\". Because of this the, at times confusing, explanatory stills do not pose a significant problem. Consider it a pet peeve.\n\nOne of the things I found very helpful (even if I didn't often avail myself of the feature because I am a stubborn completionist who will try and try again until I must YouTube because all of the stars) was the ability to wave a surrender flag if/when I was stuck. I appreciated that this was possible even if I did not take advantage of it.This feature would, in theory and practice, allow me to progress through the game (without needing to cheat YouTube walkthroughs) despite only being able to complete one or two out of three deliveries in a given level. The flag waving prevents stuck-ness and provides a lack of gated-ness that many modern puzzle games lack. This feature made Divide by Sheep more inviting and took the pressure off for a not-really-particularly-skilled-at-mental-math sort of person like me. (I'm better with theory. I swear.)\n\nI 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a well-made puzzle game and to anyone who is more pedestrian about puzzlers as well. Divide by Sheep IS solidly organized, thought out, and skillfully crafted, yet it remains pleasing for those who are slightly less particular about puzzlers.  There is no game snobbery here. If you insist upon elitism in gaming or consider \"gamer\" as a status symbol, Divide by Sheep isn't for you, probably. This game is pure egalitarian entertainment with logic, fried sheep, half sheep, sheep souls, wolves, TNT, sticky platforms, pigs, YOU NAME IT.\n\nPS: As a professional educator, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the educational value of the game - whether for young math learners, older folks warding off the brain fog that comes with aging (I probably qualify for this category), or an ice breaker for ESL students (linguistic demand is low).

Music is getting really annoying really fast, but well I wasn't expecting a 10 out of 10 at this price, and  I guess it makes sense since the game is not designed to be played during long periods of time. It's not a problem thought, since you can just disable it and keep the sounds effects.\n\nI'd say you would need like 1 hour/world if you intend to finish it with all stars for each stage, at least for the 3 first world.

Divide by Sheep has one of the easiest concepts for a puzzle game but yet still manages to make your brain explode whilst still making you want to keep playing more and more. Although, I can definitely recommend buying this as it is really fun, it still has a few things which could be improved which I will explain in my Pros and Cons.  \n\nPros:\n\u2666 Great Gameplay that really makes you think without making you want to rage quit and never play again (There is the right balance here which makes it fun. It's one of those puzzles you just pick up and want to complete that no matter how frustrating it can be at times you never want to put it down until it's solved) \n\u2666 Decent number of Worlds and Levels (5 worlds, 30 levels a world, this is a good balanced number as it's not too few levels or too many. It doesn't leave you wanting more levels or make you feel like it's just dragging on and on becoming repetitive)\n\u2666 Awesome Cartoon Styled Graphics (This adds a nice edge to the style of the game)\n\u2666 Sound that just fits (Music and Sounds that can be listened to over and over again without sounding repetitive and annoying) \n\u2666 Decent Tutorials and Tutorial style (These are set of graphics/images before the level happens. They are well designed and detailed enough to understand what is going on which is awesome)\n\u2666 Not Repetitive (Each World looks graphically different from the last and incorporates aspects from the previous but adds something new. Also each level is scaled on from the last making each level a unique puzzle in its own. This makes the game fun and not repetitive)\n\u2666 Achievements are easy to get by just playing the game (Really easy to 100% if you can 100% all the puzzles)\n\u2666 Star incentive to keep trying a level until you 100% it (This is a nifty way to draw people into keep them playing a level until they 100% it and get all 3 stars for the level)\n\u2666 Awesome Graphical Story involving the Grim Reaper (For the minimal story in the game, it works)\n\u2666 Decent looking Steam Trading Cards, Emoticons and Backgrounds (Really well designed)\n\u2666 Controls just work (This is because the only thing you have to use is the mouse)\n\u2666 Worth the Price of $5 (At a $1 a world or $1 per 30 levels, you will definitely get your moneys worth)\n\nCons:\n\u2666 Don\u2019t have to rescue/kill all the sheep, pigs or wolves (I found this part a weird concept as it felt like I was completing a Jigsaw Puzzle for example without using all the pieces).\n\u2666 Ported from Mobile without 100% checking that everything is consistent for the PC version. (I say this as it says \"Rate this App\" in one of the tabs. This should say something like \"Review this Game\" and shows the Devs didn't bother checking it/changing it for pc)\n\u2666 Can't skip some cut scenes (Such as Intro Scene)\n\u2666 Some aspects seem randomly introduced such as Pigs (One second you\u2019re just playing with Sheep & Wolves and the next you know you have Pigs. I just felt they could have introduced them better in my opinion)  \n\u2666 Menu looks like Mobile still (This isn't a major issue as the game works fine, it would just be nice to have the menu looking more like a PC games to make it look more PC orientated then straight ported from Mobile)\n\u2666 No Graphics or Resolution options (This is annoying if you want to play in different size resolutions or change from FullScreen to Windowed Mode as this is the type of game that would suit Windowed Mode) \n\nSide Note:\n\u2666 Most people complain that this is a mobile port. In some aspects like the menus and options it is. However, if you can look past that fact, it is a really, really well made puzzle game that shouldn't fully be criticised on the fact that the Devs didn't fully change it for PC. With this said unlike some Mobile Ports, the Devs have made full use of the majority of Steam Features such as Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. Therefore, it's not just a straight Mobile Port in all aspects and the gameplay 100% works.\n\nOverall, even though there are a couple of cons, they are only minor things which could improve the game slightly. Therefore, as the game just works, has good graphics, a decent storyline, isn't repetitive and has a decent amount of levels, worlds and content that will keep you thinking and thinking... I recommend you buy this. You'll definitely get multiple fun hours out of this if you are into puzzle games or just want to sacrifice sheep...

There's no run and gun, there's no portals, there's no incentive to click as fast as you can, there's no minigames or leveling up. All there is, is a collection of levels with simple mechanics used in very clever ways, and a goal. That's right, it's just you and your brain. You can take as much time as you need, and retry at any time, but be prepared to do it a lot if you intend to complete every level perfectly. \n\nNever before has it been more difficult to simply kill one sheep, or feed a few dogs. In your quest to (sometimes literally) extract these cute animals, you will have to systematically divide, subtract, and add to the groups of critters. You have various tools at your disposal for doing so, including incineration, lazers that split individuals in half, drowning, replacing (and still drowning,) jump pads that split your group up and send them in specific directions, platforms that swap with each other, etc.\n\nSacrifice is the name of the game, here, and it's never been more cute or fun. Divide by Sheep starts off relatively easy, and with great pacing gradually introduces more features and difficulty, although sometimes a level or two might be easier or significantly harder than previous ones. All of the puzzles are completely solvable and require experimentaiton or calculation, but never abstraction; you will never have that moment where you have to look up a solution to a puzzle and then go \"How was I supposed to know that's what I was supposed to do?\" The design of the levels is brilliantly clever and you will find yourself feeling increasingly satisfied with figuring out how to beat them with a perfect score. Get ready, it's really addicting!\n\n[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]\nThe graphics in Divide by Sheep are pretty simple, but very effective. It has a classic isometric style with modern design, with an almost vector art aesthetic. The menu transitions and navigation are smooth and simple, and I love how the UI stays almost completely out of the way, however, I will fault it slightly for clearly being intended for touch devices, and for having a rate this app page. There is also no option to change resolution. There is, however, a button to make the gameplay more child-friendly, which is really cool, and considerate of the developers, because this would be a great mental workout for any kid who can understand the mechanics.\n\nIf you've looked at the screenshots or trailers, then you know most of what you need to know about the game's graphics.\n\n[h1][b]Audio[/b][/h1]\nSo there's not a whole lot to say about the audio in Divide by Sheep, except that I like the music, and surprisingly at no point found myself getting tired of it or completely tuning it out. The sounds are pleasant enough, and there's good audible feedback for actions and navigation. There are also no problems with the quality of the sound itself. \n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\nDivide by Sheep is an exceptional puzzle game that will keep you busy for quite a while. It is challenging and engaging but never unfair. The content to price ratio is very good, and I am entirely comfortable recommending the game at full price...in fact, they could have charged more and I would still recommend it at full price. Seriously, treat yourself.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1443187832, "timestamp_updated": 1443188328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674572110176086426", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18178703": {"recommendationid": "18178703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170641198", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 417, "last_played": 1443210045}, "language": "english", "review": "Divide by sheep....more like \"divide THE sheep\"!", "timestamp_created": 1443137229, "timestamp_updated": 1443137229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500243782997131348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18175283": {"recommendationid": "18175283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023019827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 808, "last_played": 1443952728}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall: Good to Very good!\nDifficulty: Medium-low to Medium\n\nLikes:\n- Good variety of puzzle mechanics\n- Some levels are fairly challenging\n- Great music\n- Charming graphics\n- Pleasant, Relaxing\n\nDislikes:\n- Instead of having a good selection of well-designed puzzles, there are just a lot of levels, both good and okay.

Math is a tool, just like in the real world, making it a wonderful educational game, a great way to practice the kind of problem solving that is at the core of mathiness.\n\nAlthough the game is hilarious (cutting sheep into hemispherical halves with their bones showing), it might not be appropriate for all children. Their \"parental control\" setting only removes blood splatters and could easily be turned back on by kids.

But then I'm no fan of match-3 games either.\n\nThe one nice thing it does is that it lets you literally divide sheep in half (you can set the amount of gore from the main menu). Other than that, it's a straight-up puzzler that I think of as a \"labyrinth\" game: figure out the correct sequence of actions to reach your goal. Some levels have multiple ways to achieve that, but there's no reward for choosing one over the  other. I should also mention that the difficulty ramps up nice and even over the first 30 levels (of 150), and that new mechanics are introduced with little more than a picture hint and an opportunity for the player to research what they do in the next level (that's good).\n\nA small nigle [i](steam doesn't let me spell this word correctly)[/i] I hold against it is that the game seems to favor playing by trial and error: when I want to do it perfectly and figure out a master plan before starting to move the sheep around, the game slows me down by making me do each hop (and animation) separately instead of doing broad sweeps: I wish I could swipe a group of sheep over several hops at once, or maybe swipe a circle on a group of islands and have every group make a hop to the neighboring island. Instead it is hop-wait-hop-wait, and precisely because the game avoids such grander mechanics, it's casual. Oh, and if you didn't turn the music off after 10 minutes I admire your patience. [There's more information on the music in the comments.]\n\nI don't regret paying 0.99 for this game (it is 80% off), but I had hoped for something more memorable which it ultimately isn't.

Often times, I would ignore blatant low-effort ports published on Steam for just another cash cow to milk. However, Divide by Sheep did surprise me in terms of its intelligent puzzle design. It first starts out simple enough with you trying to rescue specific amount of sheep in a certain order. This can be accomplished by utilising the size of islands, splitting certain herds with jump pads and so on. Soon, Divide by Sheep becomes a mashup of devouring sheep, sacrificing wolves or sheep for their souls, all while trying to give whatever the upper left corner of the screen at the current time point demands. I was really pleasantly surprised by how well the game gradually introduces more and more mechanics, melds them into more demanding puzzles and keeps you engaged and challenged throughout your playtime. At the same time, Divide by Sheep never pressures you, as the cute art style and relaxing soundtrack trot along with your gears doing the calculations. Should you be amongst the vast amount of people who never enjoyed maths in school though, you might not particularly desire to add, divide and plan ahead in Divide by Sheep. I personally enjoyed my time a whole bunch, except for the missing undo a move button, which led to me redoing a bunch of levels, as I out of idiocy did the wrong move a tad too early or too late. So yes, an undo button would have been great.\n[h1][u]VERDICT[/u][/h1]All in all, Divide by Sheep will probably not lead to you falling asleep while counting.

Even more so for saying I was actually going to ENJOY it, of all things. That was yesterday. Today we have Divide by Sheep, a hilarious little puzzle game that is full of charm and some very challenging puzzles.\n\nNow I feel before we move any further, we should really note something. This title is extremely App friendly in design. If you are somebody who gets easily bugged by that type of thing, you are going to grind your teeth as you gain 3 stars and see a complete lack of options menu. With that aside, I love Divide by Sheep. The game is disguised beautifully, but its all about math and putting numbers in the proper order to get the outcome you want. Using sheep, pigs, wolves, lasers and more, you will send the adorable little animals on their voyage to the hands of Death.\n\nThat's right, Death is lonely and wants a friend, but I mean Death is adorable, who wouldn't want to be his friend?\n\nSmall plot aside, the aesthetics and charm of Divide by Sheep is what got me hooked. This is incredibly important aspect to the game, otherwise it's just a math puzzle game. The dark humor is what kept me smiling, even when I got frustrated. So much so as a matter of fact, that if you are not a fan of math, you may not enjoy this title as much. You must bounce sheep or an assortment of animals to a raft that requires a specific number. Sometimes it's easy and sometimes it can be incredibly complicated. The difficulty scales rapidly and there have been more than a few times that Divide by Sheep has made me scratch my head and made my eyes go cross. More elements are introduced to complicate matters, such as limited number platforms, wolves that eat sheep, laser grids that divide sheep hilariously in half, and bouncing platforms that send your helpless animals flying.\n\nThat isn't to say that Divide by Sheep is too hard to beat or play though. If you can match just one of the numbers you are allowed to progress to the next level. Getting stuck is never an issue, and the challenge is one you set on yourself. Go for three stars or just say screw it and come back to it later, just like a real math test. Divide by Sheep has a large assortment of levels all with the 3 star challenge. The aesthetic of the levels does change from grassy halls to frozen tundras but for the most part, level design is always the same. Some floating platforms, which is your puzzle, and a raft to put X number of animals on.\n\nOn occasion after beating a number of levels, you are rewarded with an adorable piece of art, that usually explains a new up coming element in some manner.\n\nIt really is hard to find a fault with Divide by Sheep, because it's a very simplistic game. That in itself may be an issue though, because sometimes lets face it, math sucks. Mind you, this is why I'm a writer instead of a Architect or something that actually pays. But I digress. The point is, if Divide by Sheep had a fault it would be that it's a one trick pony. It doesn't exactly claim to be anything else than what it is, so this isn't a fault to the game. You should be more than aware what you're getting into if you buy this game. Aside from that and the App like nature of Divide by Sheep, it's bug free and is very fun to play. The replay value comes from trying to get 3 stars on every level, which unless you're very clever, is going to be long and challenging.\n\nThe options menu for the most part is non-existent, however there are parental controls if you wanted to leave the messy parts of the game out, like sheep being cut in half and leaving bloody messes. This feature while not incredibly important, is rather nice to be included and makes this game also a great learning tool. The music and soundtrack of Divide by Sheep are absolutely adorable and jaunty, matching the games almost carefree tone. It never really got grating on my ears or did any painful repeats. The music changes from area to area of the game thankfully so there is always something new to listen to around the corner.\n\nI have played plenty of puzzle games but none that actually made math fun for me. I am not huge fan of Sudoku or other games of its nature. That in itself is an incredible compliment to the games level design. After being stuck on a level for a while and finally beating it, you get the \"aha!\" feeling that is quite addictive. Divide by Sheep may not be incredibly innovative but I haven't seen many games like it.\n\nThere are some areas that Divide by Sheep could've added a little bit more to make the game user friendly. There is no hint button or any hand holding whatsoever, so if you bang your head against the wall, you are heading to Youtube or a forum for help. While there is a quick start over button, a undo last move button would've been very nice for some of the more complicated puzzles that involved many steps. While these puzzles are rare they do happen, and having to start completely over again left me a little wanting. \n\nDivide by Sheep is available on Steam and mobile markets, the price is representative of that fact at $4.99. This makes it an absolutely steal if you love puzzle games, plus hey, Steam achievements are always fun. You can always nab this game for on the go at $2.99 on the iTunes store. This game makes a great traveling companion. So if you are in the market for an incredibly adorable puzzle game that is going to give you plenty of bang for your buck and more than likely make you scratch your head, I can't think of a better game than Divide by Sheep.", "timestamp_created": 1438247717, "timestamp_updated": 1438247736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590342283248901367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17285881": {"recommendationid": "17285881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190855035", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1501999699}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi, i saw jacksepticeye play this game.

There are a tonne of different mechanics it seems as I'm only 20 levels in and already seen 6 different mechanics that add a lot of thought into the game such as little rat things that swallow your sheep. The game is laid out very mobile like but controls very well.\n\n*Gameplay*\n\nYou jump your sheep across islands that can only fit a certain amount of Sheep, if your sheep can't fit then they fall off to their death which may be nessesary. Like I said there are a tonne of mechanics that change the way you think and play.\n\n*Conclusion*\nThis game is very fun and easy to learn and I highly recommend picking up the game. I give it a 9/10 for being, fun, addictive and just awesome.\n\n*YouTube*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knF0_gD8u3c", "timestamp_created": 1435854876, "timestamp_updated": 1435854876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61508488655090332", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16845809": {"recommendationid": "16845809", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987930658", "num_games_owned": 3311, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1435785501}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is cute a s hell but also has some pretty dark homour it is out-standing on the music front and the cartoony graphics only add to whats already a really great package.
