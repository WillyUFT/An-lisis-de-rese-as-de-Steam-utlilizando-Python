until the last moments.\n- Music is near perfect, almost on par with the Persona games.\n- Character dialogue is hilarious and engaging, you actually care about keeping everyone alive.\n- Game-play is extremely unique and takes some brainpower to succeed. The truth bullets where you have to shoot down characters arguments with evidence you collect is one of the best uses of mental game-play I have seen in a video game. And its extremely satisfying when you piece together the whole murder at the end of every case.\n- Monokuma is one of the most zany and like-able villains in fiction and is the best character in whole game, hands down.\n- You will get to know a character so well and you'll become so invested in them that it really shocks you when you realize they are the murder in a case later down the line. One of the few games I've played that does this well.\n\nCons:\n- Too many Japanese people\n- There's a couple cases where if the murder just did one simple thing you would never be able to solve the case. A little unrealistic but there's literally a perverted talking robot bear cracking jokes every two seconds so who gives a f word.\n\n10/10\n\nTL;DR\nJapanese lawyer fever dream.", "timestamp_created": 1698308464, "timestamp_updated": 1698308464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662341654300689697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148895324": {"recommendationid": "148895324", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089472292", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2487, "last_played": 1698309567}, "language": "english", "review": "gnorp gnap", "timestamp_created": 1698305733, "timestamp_updated": 1698305733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148882789": {"recommendationid": "148882789", "author": {"steamid": "76561199488577204", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1698281178}, "language": "english", "review": "playing w a friend this time; her attachment to Byakuya and my transcended-through-years-of-my-life attachment to Celeste my beloved makes for the hilarious, and slightly mortifying on Makoto's end, free time events and interactions in which we discuss the finer things in life like coffee and tea and how superior both Celeste and Byakuya are, before they walk away and forget about our meaningless plebeian existences with a curt 'goodbye' and 'that will be all'---\n\nWonderfully entertaining game, i promise! 11/10 on characters", "timestamp_created": 1698282480, "timestamp_updated": 1698282480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148853807": {"recommendationid": "148853807", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086515095", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 266, "playtime_at_review": 2167, "last_played": 1700234837}, "language": "english", "review": "A great murder mystery game.

As more and more cases go by, despair sets in, as beloved characters get killed off or are proven as traitorous killers. While logic and deduction certainly have their place in the game, Danganrompa's heart is in its characters, its atmosphere and its style.\n\n[h1]Wherever there is hope, there is most definitely despair.[/h1]\nOkay, so first off - this game is fucking nuts.\n\nThe art direction is all over the place - pixelated items among anime-styled portraits, 3D rooms alongside 2D textures. It really is a mess, almost dream-like in its absurdity - and yet this artistic dissonance, perhaps intentionally, only improves its sinister tone.\n\nDue to its constant ping-ponging between humor and horror, the player finds themselves always unprepared for what is to come, lowering their guard with an absurdist skit only to get promptly hit in the face with a character death or an act of terror by the game's main antagonist, Monokuma. Just like the rest of the game, Monokuma seems innocuous at first - a cuddly teddy bear toy - only to prove himself throughout the course of the game as an absolutely vicious creature, yet still maintaining his composure as a 'tee-hee' cute mascot.\n\nThis humor, this humanity, I think, is the main drive of the game. Hope is given, and hope is taken - despair taking hold ever more frequently as cases unfold, with beolved characters getting killed off, or proving themselves as traitorous killers. While logic and deduction certainly have their place in the game, I don't think that's the game's focus, with its myriad of minigames and visual novel-esque systems - instead, it lies firmly in its characters, its atmosphere, and its style - which are all very gripping.\n", "timestamp_created": 1697200972, "timestamp_updated": 1697201049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148107052": {"recommendationid": "148107052", "author": {"steamid": "76561199546057685", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1048, "last_played": 1699207925}, "language": "english", "review": "Its amazing, I also may be getting addicted but thats okay", "timestamp_created": 1697157899, "timestamp_updated": 1697157899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148106987": {"recommendationid": "148106987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160434425", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2312, "last_played": 1625715815}, "language": "english", "review": "she hopein' on my peak till i despair", "timestamp_created": 1697157801, "timestamp_updated": 1697157801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749566614627838135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148092497": {"recommendationid": "148092497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288965504", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1217, "last_played": 1695626625}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a flipping good start of the series and sets up the second game nicely!!!!

The time between mysteries is slow, the time to gather evidence is slow, and during the trial, it feels like the game tries to make up for how slow everything else has been by suddenly throwing a bunch of pointless mini games at you.  \n\nNow, in its defense, it clearly was not originally made for PC gaming, so you can tell that some of the slow spots probably would have been more fun to maneuver on a console (some parts feel VERY geared toward touch screen, though that's just a guess), but after playing other detective games, I was really underwhelmed by this one.

Visual Novel is not a genre I've ever had much interest in, I have played a grand total one one other game in the genre and that was Doki Doki Literature Club, which I'm not sure even counts. I'm currently trying to learn Japanese, and saw this was a game where you could set the audio to ingrish or to nihongo, so I went with it's original audio to try to get some practice... sadly it's mostly sound bites of a couple of words, but I'm surprised to say I got really drawn in by the story. \n\nSo, the general premise is basically a mix between Battle Royale and Phoneix Wrights. If you don't know either of those, the first is the film and book that Hunger Games was ripping off. Far better as well I might add, it has a class of kids who know each other rather than strangers so there's a lot of interpersonal conflict and drama instead of a bunch of cardboard cutouts for our heroine to blow away for standing between her and her crush. It doesn't shy away from the fact kids being forced to kill kids is horrible, and it also has some masterful black comedy thrown in as well. The latter is a series of legal drama games that feature a guy in a blue suit who yells \"OBJECTION\". But I digress.\n\n Anyway, in this game, there is a super exclusive high school in Tokyo, which is attended by invitation only, the students for each year hand picked to be the cream of the crop and the hope for the future. All except yourself, who was the single student picked at random, presumably as a token gesture to keep the plebs happy. Being the odd one out in a school full of intense perfectionists, spoiled rich kids and celebrity divas would be hard enough, but upon entering, you pass out. Upon waking, it becomes apparent that something is very wrong. All of the windows have metal sheets bolted across them, the entrance is now a bank vault door guarded by automated machine guns. An announcement summons you to the gym, where a teddy bear announces that you are now obligated to spend the rest of your natural lives in the school, and that the only way you will \"graduate\" is by successfully killing another student and not getting caught.\n\nAs said, I was surprised at how engaging I ended up finding the story. There's a good amount of drama and intrigue from the premise alone, and there's a few little touches and minor details spaced out throughout that I found really intriguing and kept me going to see what the payoff was. I will admit there is a big plot hole and one or two of the plot elements are a little bit bonkers, but it's quite strong overall. The characters aren't the deepest, but I found I quite liked being around most of them, although a few are dead before you really get to know them and there are two who are so obviously coded as being nasty that there is little surprise when they do. There is another mode you can unlock upon finishing the game that lets you just hang out with them, but I can't say anything about it beyond the fact that it exists. They have enough depth to mostly not come across as being one note, and they do react relatively realistically to being stuck in the situation that they are in. I felt quite bad when certain deaths occurred, and the executions became a surprisingly bittersweet affair when most of the guilty parties were only guilty due to being forced into a horrible situation by the Bear. \n\n Speaking of the Bear, he's a really effective villain. He's basically a slightly less evil Mickey Mouse, the high pitched voice, the self obsession, the fact he has to slap his face on everything in sight should be quite familiar. Add to this the facts that he's an open sadist revelling in the pain that he is causing and a near Shodan level of control over the school, and the fact that he's just really obnoxious. Which does make things all the more awkward when he started actually successfully making me laugh as the game went on. He's one of those characters I find I love to hate, which I haven't got much of in media lately so it's nice to see. \n\nAnyway, on to gameplay, as I can't talk much more about the story without giving spoilers and I've already had to delete several accidental ones. The game runs perfectly well, I had no issues there, and the soundtrack is really nice. The game part of the game has three modes as such. The first is where you walk around the school exploring and being social (or lying in bed to pass time until something interesting happens if you are a speedrunner or have a crippling fear of social interaction or the ambient jazz), the second is where you investigate the murders and gather clues, and the third is the \"class trials\" where all the characters gather and try to work out who did it, with the Bear making it clear he will execute everyone except the guilty party if the wrong person is picked.  I'm not going to lie, it's fairly simplistic game play, but it is a very heavily story focused game, and it mostly gets the job done. Yes you are somewhat handheld, but the trials are quite exciting and feel suitably climactic as you work through all of the evidence, pick apart weak arguments and try to establish the pattern of events. You have to do a bit of thinking in them, and works as a followup to the investigations. They even have the trials auto save before every one of the in trial mini games so you don't loose a massive chunk of progress when you fail.\n\nAs much as I did like the game, I'd be remiss in not offering a few criticisms. It's an anime game, so if you hate the art style or very over the top characters you are probably not going to enjoy this. There are also the inevitable pervy camera angles, which there aren't many of, but they are definitely present. In the social section you wander about the school, and if you find one of the other students you can hang out with them. The issue with this is, as the game goes on and the bodies pile up, is that there's an ever decreasing number of characters, and it can become really hard to actually find anyone when the entire school is open. You can search through the somewhere around twenty rooms, each with a load screen (Which are nicely stylised, but are not the fastest) and not find anyone, and can look for a person in particular only to find out that they are in their room huffing and won't talk to you for this section. I'd really appreciate if the game marked the map or told you where they were, as wandering aimlessly round the school can get pretty annoying. Some of the minigames in the trials also feel a bit pointless. If a person is shouting you play a rhythm game, which I never understood but got through entirely via button mashing, and it feels at times like they add one more and more mechanics like spinning white noise and scanning just to pad things out. I guess it's to add more to the actual game play section of the game, but I'm not sure it really adds anything beyond annoyance. Whilst the Ingirisugo translation is mostly good, it does make a few bits in the trials very difficult to understand, some of the logic bullet sections I was completely stumped and had to trial and error my way through as I don't think the translation quite carried what was being said. The comic sections at the end of the trials, whilst cool also suffered from some of the icons being far too small and abstract to actually see what was on them, which was a blemish on an otherwise cool section. I also don't understand why, if you fail in a trial, everyone will turn on you and vote you as the killer. It only makes sense in the first trial, although admittedly it gets pretty funny when it happens right at the end. \n\nThose issues aren't deal breakers though, I enjoyed this and I recommend it as long as you are ok with anime and a lot of reading...  which if you are reading this you probably are, so go ahead.", "timestamp_created": 1695817688, "timestamp_updated": 1700236937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147115645": {"recommendationid": "147115645", "author": {"steamid": "76561199529377070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 3069, "last_played": 1699620205}, "language": "english", "review": "As a person who has recently finished playing the main story from start to finish (https://youtu.be/dbNCjQR-lu8), I absolutely loved it.

Perhaps they were addressed, and I missed the addresses, but here's what pains me:\n\n1. I don't recall a tutorial about the negatives in The Moment of Truth. If you seem to do the moment of truth wrong during those moments, perhaps a tip/hint should be displayed on the player's screen, reminding them what to do during it. Because surprisingly, I made it all the way to the last trial completely not knowing what to do when the moment of truth trial game turned negative. \n\n2.

The game falls victim to having a bad fandom, unfortunately, but the game itself is pretty good. It's the first game in the franchise and the 2nd best. It's story is enjoyable and the gameplay is fun. For those who like mystery games and visual novels, this one is for you. 7/10\n\n[h1] SPOILERS DANGANRONPA 1: TRIGGER HAPPY HAVOC REVIEW [/h1]\nFor all 3 games, I'll go in depth for reviewing the trials and some characters, skip if you don't care\nTRIAL 1: [spoiler] the first trial in the franchise and honestly, pretty disappointing. The culprit is obvious and the motive is weak. I think the culprit is less obvious in the Japanese version but I don't know for sure. This trial acts as the tutorial for all future trials and is definitely the worst 1st trial out of all three games but I'll cut it some slack for being a tutorial. 4/10 [/spoiler]\nTRIAL 2:  [spoiler] If you are getting into the danganronpa games, get used to your favourite character dying because that's likely the case. My favourite character died here and I was heartbroken, Chihiro will forever remain my favourite. Yeah, the trial hasn't aged the greatest but honestly, I still can't help but love it. It's cheesy and a bit far-fetched but damn, it really does do a lot to establish many characters. While the murder of Sayaka is the first case in the franchise, the death of Chihiro is what I really beileve kicked off the whole franchise. 6.5/10  [/spoiler]\nTRIAL 3:  [spoiler] Man, fuck trial 3, all my homies hate trial 3. As shitty as this trial is, it's still the best of all the other games (which doesn't mean this one is good, it just means the others are that bad). I don't even feel like going into detail because it's so boring, at least the other trial 3's were shitty enough to make me feel something. 2/10 (because at least the execution slapped) [/spoiler]\nTRIAL 4: [spoiler] I'm glad that this is the only case of suicide throughout all of the franchise because I don't think they could have topped this. It's structured amazingly and, although convoluted, it retains a sense of clarity when all figured out. It's a beautiful send off to a great character and provides a great emotional arc for Aoi (who I don't think acted that irrationally during the game). 9.5/10 [/spoiler]\nTRIAL 5:  [spoiler] Spawned a great meme.

RHYTHM GAME!! I would tell you how much I hated but that would encompass the entire deal and I don\u2019t wanna waste your time to give you context just imagine someone screaming into their pillow, how this is partially my fault because when I started this game it gave me the option of difficulties and I chose the hardest one which was mean because I told myself and my friend I will not start on the easiest or normal difficulty because I ain\u2019t no pussy\u2026.. that was a mistake and it turns out the game doesn\u2019t let you change the difficulty once you\u2019ve already said it in stone so I had to beat the entire thing on the hardest difficulty\u2026. My hubris was my downfall, anyway time to talk about the actual game and what I liked about it,first off the characters, Sakura is best girl and I will hear absolutely no evidence to the contrary, also I liked Mondo a whole lot I love his hairstyle even if it does make it look like he\u2019s growing corn on the cob on his head and he has a bunch of Joe Joe references in his origin story so that\u2019s always a plus, Kyoko while at the start was obviously pretty cold turned out to be a really amazing character, and at the start I did not like the protagonist and a christened him generic anime protagonist number 47, but now that\u2019s more of a loving nickname because he grew on me immensely\u2026 I did not like Sayaka moving on\n\nI could say more but honestly if you\u2019re interested in buying this game you might as well it\u2019s pretty cheap even if you don\u2019t get it on discount which I did not and I\u2019ve certainly gotten a lot of bang for my buck in terms of hours.", "timestamp_created": 1695220877, "timestamp_updated": 1695220877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146619659": {"recommendationid": "146619659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189678475", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2521, "last_played": 1692932460}, "language": "english", "review": "Is good", "timestamp_created": 1695169161, "timestamp_updated": 1695169161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146601174": {"recommendationid": "146601174", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070062914", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1903, "last_played": 1697769427}, "language": "english", "review": "me when the danganronpa is [spoiler] MUKURO IKUSABA, THE 16TH STUDENT, LYING HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN THIS SCHOOL. . .

The 2D character models on 3D backgrounds and how they incorporated that was actually pretty cool. Character models have a lot of fun variety, ranging from pretty average little dudes (Makoto and Toko), to conventionally attractive model-types (Junko and Sayaka), to genuinely unconventional and unique (Sakura, Hifumi, Mondo, Hiro, Celeste... honestly, most of them have some unique visual trait about them). The colour scheme and pink blood gives the whole thing a kind of bubblegum splatterpunk vibe that I'm super into.\n[b]CHARACTERS:[/b] Great range of personalities, and their different 'Ultimate Talents' lends some more differences between their backgrounds. You have the fashionista model, the jock, the stoic one, the prep, all those cliches - and then they often turn out to be nothing like you'd expect from those cliches. My personal favourites were Byakuya and his smug assh*lery, Chihiro and his sweet timidity, Sakura and her iron moral code, and Leon and his absolute belief in his own charisma - though I also grew oddly fond of Hifumi after playing through his School Mode route before anyone else's.\n[b]DIALOGUE/WRITING:[/b] Everyone kind of acknowledges this can get pretty wacky, and, I mean, yeah. There's a talking robot bear who sometimes speaks aloud in emoticons for the hell of it. Don't take it too seriously and you'll probably have a fun time. The plot twists are genuinely great if you go in at least partly blind like I did - I knew Junko would have some greater significance (can't really avoid that with how ever-present she is online) and I kind of got the general gist as to what that significance would be, and I was able to figure out some cases fairly easily, but others caught me genuinely off-guard, and it was super fun to play through them with my fiancee watching me as we both tried to guess what would be revealed.\n[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b] It's a visual novel, so expect a lot of clicking, a lot of reading, some dialogue options, and not a lot of physical gameplay. I enjoy visual novels, so the gameplay was enjoyable for me.\n[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] None.\n\n[b]Favourite Male Character:[/b] Byakuya, [spoiler]Chihiro[/spoiler], Leon\n[b]Favourite Female Character:[/b] Sakura\n[b]First Character I Liked:[/b] Byakuya\n[b]Favourite Character Design:[/b] [spoiler]Mukuro-as-[/spoiler]Junko (it's the freckles!)\n[b]Favourite Scene:[/b] The (true) ending\n[b]Least Favourite Character:[/b] Probably Toko", "timestamp_created": 1693955208, "timestamp_updated": 1697740932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145721417": {"recommendationid": "145721417", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998928043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "playtime_at_review": 6625, "last_played": 1700261574}, "language": "english", "review": "\"This isn't a school of hope, It's actually a school of despair\"\n\nI happened across Danganronpa a few years back and it borderline changed my life.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Everything about this game is really good. Presentation: I mean look at the visuals, and tell me they don't have any uniqueness. Soundtrack supports every plot point perfectly, some of the tunes fit the theme of despair by sounding menacing or creepy, and you are always waiting for something bad to happen when they play, but there are also some calm and funky tunes.. Gameplay is not anything interesting but the class trials are where this game shines this is the part where you have all the twists and turns and try to get the picture how it happened. Class trials are the best part of this they are so engaging and it immerses you in it.

I won't be brief and won't sugarcoat anything. [DOES NOT CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS! CONTAINS USEFUL INFO AND TIPS!!]\n\nMy Rating: 9.8/10 \n\nHere's Why:\n\nOverall, Dgrpa is an amazing series of games for those that wish to 'step it up a notch' with something unusual and original in the fields of genres like murder mysteries, psychological thrillers, 'whodunnit' uncovering and the overall unique vibe of 'wow, how am I not dead yet?' that all Dgrpa games I've played so far have, both by myself and with friends. \n\nNow, Dgrpa THH itself did not disappoint, as the unique storyboard and major plot twists absolutely blew my mind. It's so clever, and so interesting. The suspense of 30+ hours of game-play that lead to the last class trial [and what happened in hat class trial, which is just wow] was totally something I never would have expected if I hadn't seen the anime first [more on that in the 'tips' section].\n\nAs for the characters, that's an entirely different category of 'holy crap, wow'. It's crazy how all these different characters, with some of them having useless abilities [like, really? Ultimate Fanfic Creator?] can form such an interesting story and keep you glued to your screen without realizing you've become addicted to it. [Also, don't get mad or fret if you see your favorite character getting killed. This is Dgrpa. It's bound to happen sometime.]\n\nIn conclusion, the story was captivating and unpredictable, the characters very interesting and unique, the story well-made and packed with interesting little touches, and the world building kept me on my toes the entire time. The occasional long monologues and dialogues can become a little boring, and some things are predictable, but the suspense and intrigue of it all is worth every cent and every minute. \n\n-------- TIPS!!! --------\n\n1] I don't recommend watching the anime before playing the actual game, as lots of things are different, and rightfully so for 30+ hours of game-play need to fit into 13 20-minute episodes. However, really took away some very interesting and intriguing details and parts of it that are super worth it. I'm getting into the Future Arc now, so I'll probably write about that as well.\n\n2] The game contains constant flashes and bright colors, and I don't remember if there was a feature to turn that off, so that's a MAJOR EPILEPSY WARNING!!.\n\n3] Play the game in Japanese. Please. The original voices are so much better than the dub. [If you pick 'Japanese' as a language when it lets you, it won't change the lettering, and only will change the audio to be Japanese when the characters speak.]\n\n4] Before making any major mistakes, or if you feel like you need to, look up a Walkrthrough. It does help a bunch. [I'm putting links to that later on.]\n\n5] For gift-giving, check the lists of what each character likes most online. The Mono-Mono machine is valuable! Use the points you get from Class Trials and exploring to get items to give each character and improve your relationship with them.\n\n6] Use headphones. It doesn't need much explanation. It's just much better with headphones on.\n\n7] THE GAME HAS NO AUTO SAVE FEATURE!!!! BEFORE YOU LOG OFF ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO SAVE YOUR PROGRESS!!!! YOU\"RE GOING TO REGRET IT DEEPLY IF YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR TWO HOURS AND THEN LOSE IT ALL.\n\n-------- WALKTHROUGHS --------\n\nCHAPTER 1:\nhttps://www.ign.com/wikis/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/Chapter_1_Walkthrough\n\nCHAPTER 2:\nhttps://www.ign.com/wikis/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/Chapter_2_-_Boy's_Life_of_Despair_Walkthrough\n\nCHAPTER 3:\nhttps://www.ign.com/wikis/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/Chapter_3_-_A_Next_Generation_Legend!_Stand_Tall,_Galactic_Hero!_Walkthrough\n\nCHAPTER 4:\nhttps://www.ign.com/wikis/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/Chapter_4_-_All*Star*Apologies_Walkthrough\n\nCHAPTER 5:\nhttps://www.ign.com/wikis/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/Chapter_5_-_100_Mile_Dash;_Pain_of_a_Junk_Food_Junkie_Walkthrough\n\nFINAL CHAPTER:\nhttps://www.ign.com/wikis/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/Chapter_6_-_Ultimate_Pain,_Ultimate_Suffering,_Ultimate_Despair,_Ultimate_Execution,_Ultimate_Death_Walkthrough\n\nHope this helped.

I think half of it is really great, and half of it is really terrible. But do I recommend it? Maybe? Let me go over everything first.\n\nPros:\nI enjoyed free time. I thought traveling around the school was kind of annoying when trying to look for people, but you can just teleport places using the map so it\u2019s not a huge deal.\nChapters 2 and 4 were really great. The focus on the characters and their dynamics in these chapters easily made these the high points of the game.\nMost of the characters are fine. A lot of them aren\u2019t necessarily anything too special but I never found at least most of them to be super annoying or anything.\n\nCons:\nI don\u2019t like the premise. It seriously sounds like something I would come up with as a 12 year old. And it was very similar to something I came up with as a 12 year old so there is that. \nChapters 1 and 3 are dumb. Chapter 1 I can mostly excuse because in games like this, first cases are always usually pretty whatever, but chapter 3 is one of those chapters where everyone acts like idiots for the sake of the plot and the villain was completely obvious from the very beginning.\nI don\u2019t like the ending. I\u2019m not gonna spoil what happens at the end for those who don\u2019t want spoilers, but my god was this reveal incredibly lame. I actually enjoyed chapter 5 quite a bit but the payoff to it was not executed well. Also, this is a minor point but the final takedown felt like it came straight out of a pokemon mystery dungeon game, which is also a series by chunsoft. huh.\nThe gameplay can be\u2026 iffy. I don\u2019t hate most of the gameplay or the minigame focus in comparison to similar franchises. What I do hate is the constantly moving text and white noise of Nonstop debates, and pretty much everything about bullet time battles. Seemingly the more they add onto the gameplay, the worse it gets.\n\nOverall, I didn\u2019t hate my time with this game but it has a lot of problems with it. I can see justifying 20 bucks on it. It will hold your interest for what that\u2019s worth, but I just don\u2019t know if this game is for me. Now would I recommend it? I still don\u2019t really know. I\u2019ll mark my review as positive because I did mostly enjoy my time with it, but be mindful of the problems with it before picking it up.", "timestamp_created": 1693435724, "timestamp_updated": 1693435724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145331611": {"recommendationid": "145331611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440197350", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2786, "last_played": 1691537939}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, gave me 11 mental illnesses.", "timestamp_created": 1693414707, "timestamp_updated": 1693414707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145318571": {"recommendationid": "145318571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198946012086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1693639384}, "language": "english", "review": "Great", "timestamp_created": 1693399738, "timestamp_updated": 1693399738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145313486": {"recommendationid": "145313486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352837903", "num_games_owned": 1235, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2940, "last_played": 1693350652}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tanga rota.

Lo cual los capitulos son largos, mi consejo es que guardes cada vez por las dudas manualmente.

The class trials are the WORST part of this game which really sucks because I usually love games like this. The first trial is where they teach you the mini-games and the mini-games themselves are fine (excluding the one where you do the manga panels since that one is awful) and I even find them entertaining. The problem comes with the fact that after you finish the first trial you don't get to use any of these mechanics again for about another 4 hours of game play. I don't have enough time to run through the first couple of trials in one sitting so by the time i get to the next trial i barely remember how to do any of the mini-games. Sure there is a help menu but it breaks the flow if i have to load up the manual and remember how to play every single time i want to do it. It also doesn't help that they still introduce new mechanics such as skills and new variables into the mini-games that leave me overwhelmed by information. The skills are especially confusing on your first play-through as you get them quite often and don't know what any of them do until your second trial. Once you do get them they all revolve around stats that are vaguely explained so you'd need to look up a wiki just to see which ones are worthwhile or not. Even with all of these difficulties around the mini-games the trials themselves also drag on for a few hours and are sometimes a slog to get through. Parts of the game feels more like a chore than something fun and it dampens the overall experience.\n\nHowever Danganronpa has an impeccable story and stunning visuals accompanied by astounding music. The ideas that it explores and the concept itself is extremely interesting and the characters are very well written. Each character is special and different with their designs, attitude, and interactions with one another.

If you are really thinking of buying the game you probably read from other people's reviews about the gameplay, to not read spoilers etc. I wanna talk about something a little different. I would heavily recommend this game but i have to adress some things first:\n- this is a bit obvious but if you dont like visual novel type of games please dont play this\n- you should probably play this game during a vacantion. The main game is made of a prologue, 6 chapters and an epilogue. Each chapter is around 4 hours and its best if you play a chapter all at once.\n- this is a really good game but my experience wasnt really 100% perfect cause i expected from comments to be the best game imaginable. Its REALLY GOOD dont get me wrong but having very high expectations is gonna somewhat ruin your experience. Just play this for fun and try to connect with your favourite characters!\n- DONT SEARCH DANGANRONPA IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM!!! I searched the game ONCE on the youtube search bar and a few hours later i got recommended 1 video that almost spoiled my whole finale AND the 2nd game's finale JUST FROM SEEING THE THUMBNAIL. Pleaaaase dont google it AT ALL\n\nThats it i think. This is a bit of a weirder review but i wanted to cover everything that i wasnt warned about or that slightly influenced my experience negatively.

The mystery is incredibly fun to go through and figuring out the cases in the trial sections can require some genuine thought and a lot of A-Ha! moments. \n\nThe series as a hole has a large amount of Stock Anime Tropes (tm) though, so if you get turned off by something being overly weeby you might find it hard to enjoy. If you are a weeb though, how the heck haven't you played this yet?\n\nFor a review of the first game in particular, I think it's personally the weakest of the trilogy (though that's still a really high bar).

And how Byakuya ignoring emotions also becomes well..Almost how they all die in case 4! Karma huh! Some really sad parts though definitely hit hard. Like Maizono dying so early on.

is a surprisingly good game with some missteps. I came into this thinking it was going to be cringey and it was but past that it had an interesting story, engaging characters, and some good gameplay mixed with odd mechanics (more on that later). Overall my recommendation is that you should get this game on sale and go in with the mindset that it will be not super serious (despite the plot). My second recommendation is that you try out the Ace Attorney trilogy or better yet The Great Ace Attorney: Chronicles for a visual novel with better mechanics, writing, and story.\n\nTL;DR: It's better than I thought but I'd get it on sale or get Ace Attorney instead.\n\nNow for those who are more interested in my opinion lets get into the nitty gritty. Also these thoughts will be very disorganized.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]No spoilers[/h1]\n\nFirst lets talk about the gameplay. This has typically Visual Novel gameplay plus some free roam walking around environments and the Class Trials which are the main draw of the game. Now the class trials are very interesting because you are hearing everyone talk about their different interpretations all at the same time and you have to catch their contradictions in the act of it.\n\nThe idea is solid but the mechanics of it get a bit muddy. In Nonstop Debates you have to aim at yellow highlighted statments which you believe have contradictions. Then you shoot them with the piece of evidence (truth bullet) that explains the contradiction. Now this mechanic I don't really have a problem with but it can be awkward to add shooting mechanics to a visual novel? The other parts of the trial get worse mechanics in my opinion.\n\nNext is hangman's gambit where you have to spell out a word? But like you shoot the letters. It's just weird and is a time waster in my opinion but not out right horrible like the next mechanic. Which is Truth Bullet battles. They put a rhythm game into this visual novel. A RHYTHM GAME! You have to time shooting statements to a beat which changes. Also one of these is required for each trial! The only saving grace is that you can make these easier by setting your action difficulty down (which i didn't) but its still a stupid concept!\n\nSpeaking of difficulty lets go over that. There are two types of difficulty. Action and Logic. Increasing action difficulty makes bullet battles much harder and such a pain. Increasing logic difficulty increases the number of truth bullets in nonstop debates which I actually like since you are forced to think about what the contradiction is more. The feeling on getting like 10 different bullets and having to juggle them, while listening to the statements, and figuring out the contradiction is very fun gameplay for me but if that isn't your cup of tea you should turn it down.\n\nBetween class trials lies the weirdest mechanic for me. Free time! When your not in a class trial you are able to go around talking to other students and learn more about them. This to me is a cool feature as you get to learn about their backstories but also gain skills you will be able to use in the class trail. The only part I find confusing is the gift system. Using coins you gain through good performance in the trial or finding by interacting with objects you are able to play a coin game to win items. You can gift these items to other students. They will either like or dislike the item. For me this is a really weird mechanic. Like why? It just feel unnecessary. You can skip these free time segments but for me I did them. [Minor Spoiler] [spoiler]Now when you get into the late game with a very small pool of students free time makes less sense. All the remaining students I had already gotten their skill and talking to them during free time didn't give anything new so I just found a pain and skipped it. It's just so weird that this mechanic is here but this is kind of pushed aside for the 2nd half of the game. [/spoiler]\n\nOkay lets get to the other parts of the game: music and writing. Firstly this game's music is pretty good. It's a weird mix of EDM and weird noises but I enjoy it. Its very consistent and sets the tone very easily. I think my favorite songs are from the class trials and the investigation segments. My only compliant about the music is that if you finish an nonstop debate segment quickly the music switches to another song and you won't be able to hear the full song :(.\n\nWriting. This is a hard section and I will probably have to add more in my spoilers section, but this game has bad writing. But that's okay. For me I accepted it was going to have bad writing and let it surprise me if it got better. And it did. Now when I say it has bad writing I am talking about dialogue and narration. Half of the characters feel like caricatures and play into cliches. The other half are actually interesting even if they still are cliched. The dialogue feels like it was written by a first time fanfic writer especially with the main character's internal monologue. But even then I just skipped over the stupid dialogue. What isn't bad writing is the actual trails and story beats. I will say trail 1 & even trial 2 were very easy to solve but form trail 3 onward they were really good! \n\nOverall to end this nonspoiler section: I think this game is good but has a lot of missteps. For me those missteps did not ruin the enjoyment of the game but if any of these seem like deal breakers to you don't buy this game.\n\n\nOverall my score is 6.5/10. The reason I wanted to write this review is because I see this game either get lots of hate or lots of love. I think it's more in the middle. Its good but it has a lot of flaws hence a 6.5/10.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1690594026, "timestamp_updated": 1690594026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

worst game I have ever experienced at the exact same time. The entire game series follows a simplistic formula that on-paper is fantastic and opens the pathway to literally endless possibilities of character writing, yet in execution (insert a funny Monokuma joke here) they either nail it perfectly or write the worst characters and cases I have seen in my entire life. \n\nPushing past the game series as a whole and speaking STRICTLY about THH, it's... fine. It's just fine, nothing more. I can see why some people may adore this game and see why some people may hate it. Personally, it's not my favorite game, but it's not my least favorite either. \n\nFor the first Danganronpa game, Trigger Happy Havoc makes a pretty good statement of the tone the game is trying to go for. I won't talk about the gameplay, as it's a visual novel-- the gameplay is pretty much just clicking and then the occasional trial mini-game-- but more so the character's and the story, or more specifically the writing. \n\nTrigger Happy Havoc has a writing style that stands out amongst other visual novels as simplistic and easy to understand. Anyone could play this game and understand the characters. There's a reason several teenagers get into this series-- it's insanely easy to get into with pretty fun characters and sometimes soul-crushing writing. Talking strictly on the characters, the main cast is pretty solid with a few stinkers in the middle of it. Comparing THH to the other main three games, I think it has a pretty okay cast. Not at all the best but not at all the worst. Each character serves the purpose they are given pretty well and are all somewhat fun to look into and watch throughout the tragedy that is the main killing game. All of them have at least a little bit of depth to their actions and words.\n\nWith that being said, though, the main premise being a killing game means a lot of characters are going to die off before they can really shine. If I have any singular complaint with this series, it's the death placements. I'll avoid spoiling who dies where, but god, THH sucks with these placements. The characters that should have died ended up living and the characters that should have lived ended up dying, and I don't think that's just my bias against some characters speaking. The game sets up these interesting character arcs and then slaughters the character in cold blood before any value can be gained from them. I hate it.\n\nBUT, with that being said, when a character truly gets their time to shine, they SHINE. This typically happens in the ending or during specific murder cases, and god there are some moments in this game I literally will never forget. \n\nTLDR; The characters are either really annoying and bad or really good and entertaining. For this game, it's extremely mixed. \n\nAs for the story and the cases themselves, they are simply... okay. \nI think as a general note first, you shouldn't walk into Danganronpa thinking of it like a murder mystery. Sometimes the killer or victim is very obvious. I almost quit the game on the first case because it was so obvious, but that isn't the point. The point is to tell a story, and... well it's DEFINITELY a story! Haha. \nI haven't indulged in many games like Danganronpa, so I won't comment on the quality of the cases themselves too much, but I enjoyed them. Sometimes they're a little too complex or a little too simple, but I always had fun figuring them out (aside from one case. You know what you are). The emotional value of a case hinges on the characters, and like I said previously-- sometimes they end up incredible, sometimes I wish I didn't play the game.\n\nTo try and summarize to the best of my ability,\nIt's okay. It has some really good moments and some really bad moments, but is very fun overall. I personally think the highs make up for the lows. I'd recommend this, if not for this game, at least so you can start the series to play the infinitely better second game. \n\nSeriously Goodbye Despair is so much better it's actually unreal, but we'll get to that review another time <3", "timestamp_created": 1690374869, "timestamp_updated": 1690374869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.779598712921142578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142817950": {"recommendationid": "142817950", "author": {"steamid": "76561199040821286", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1809, "last_played": 1690346232}, "language": "english", "review": "DANGANRONPA\nepic jazz music plays", "timestamp_created": 1690354997, "timestamp_updated": 1690354997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142807212": {"recommendationid": "142807212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198889837355", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1045, "last_played": 1690337315}, "language": "english", "review": "its ok i gues....", "timestamp_created": 1690337348, "timestamp_updated": 1690337348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142802029": {"recommendationid": "142802029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155303445", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1726, "last_played": 1677876321}, "language": "english", "review": "the classic", "timestamp_created": 1690329557, "timestamp_updated": 1690329557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142775198": {"recommendationid": "142775198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386515161", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1688, "last_played": 1689982501}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it i suggest it.

Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was the second game I ever got on Steam, my first ever visual novel, and - for better or for worse - I think it will always hold a place in my heart.\n\n...But honestly, the plot of these games is a mess, the mystery isn't really engaging once you realize the characters can and will just pull things out of their ass mid-trial, and the characters themselves are little more than tired old anime tropes with nothing new to add to the table.

The main flow of the story is how the dialogue some time drags with unnecessary - unfunny - jokes or repeating the same information several times which slows the pacing, but this isn't a game destroying flow.\n\nThe characters are unique and have different traits and personalities but honestly I don't think I liked most of them, probably only two characters were more interesting than others while many of them felt like they were just there. The cast could have been utilized more in my opinion.\n\nGameplay is mostly point and click with you exploring the school, talking to people and collecting clues before the class trial which is a bunch of minigames. I enjoyed the visual novel aspect of the game, but the mini games were mixed bags. Some were fun, while others were done pretty poorly and sometimes even annoying.\n\nAs a murder mystery solving, I think most culprits were pretty obvious bar one case, but how the murder went on was convoluted in some cases and I don't think you can figure how every murder happened before the information provided to you during the trial. Some vital information and debates are mentioned during the trials and not during investigation, which makes figuring 100% of the case very difficult, but it doesn't mean you can't at least see the wide picture of the murder or figure certain aspects of it before the trial.\n\nThis is a solid visual novel game with a very interesting plot and weird but compelling setting that will want eager to see the end of it and discover the mystery of what's going around you.

Its fine for those who like that sort of thing but it is required to play through this mode a minimum of 3-4 times in order to get 100% which can take a while to do.\n\nProblems with this game include Trials 1 and 3 feeling \"weak\", the noticeable amount of fanservice, and although not directly related to the game the fanbase is absolutely wild and definitely should be avoided. \n\nAll around a pretty fine murder mystery game that I enjoyed playing, recommend it to any fans of games like Ace Attorney.

What's the reason behind this seemingly pointless suffering?\"\n\nI had a few theories\u2014maybe each character is actually a representative of an entire nation, and the school acts as an arena for the world's most powerful nations to resolve conflict in an altruistic way, pitting single representatives against each other so that ten people die instead of ten million.\nOr maybe it's some sort of Maze Runner-esque plot, where a seemingly unrelated societal problem can be solved by inflicting despair on these high-school kids.\nSince everyone's memories had likely been altered, maybe other things about conscious perception had been altered as well, and \"people killing each other inside a high school\" isn't at all what's happening in reality.\n\nI was so, so disappointed to find out what the actual answer was\u2014this seemingly pointless misery is being inflicted on these characters because there's someone who loves inflicting pointless misery. It's literally just an insane sadistic person living out their fantasy.\n\nPerhaps this game was worth playing, if only to get to the sequel games. Once you get past the first game's dumb premise, the second & third games are pretty enjoyable. And the beginning and middle of the game were very enjoyable for me.\n\nIf you or someone you know has sadistic tendencies: first off, I'm sorry, that sounds rough, but you'd probably enjoy this game with a central theme of \"hope vs. despair\".

This game is interesting throughout and as long as you use the map to teleport around, there's no real reason to get bored, so it held my attention well for the whole playthrough.

I won't spoil anything but I felt that the excellent writing and twists made up for the plot convenience silliness. There was even one point where I thought the game was using a really bad explanation and I was very disappointed only to be proven wrong moments later and I was impressed because I didn't see it coming. My only minor gripe is that I don't like mysteries where the audience could never have solved it ahead of time and there's at least one of those in this game.\n9/10 and I don't usually like visual novel style games, well done.

The initial setup and mystery are quite interesting. That's what keeps someone playing until the end, but trust me it's not worth it.\n\nThe gameplay is very weak, you don't get to actually solve most of the case, but instead use the clues to find contradictions while the solution reveals itself. There's very little thinking in most questions.\n\nThe characters are all high schoolers but they behave like spoiled children. The dialogue is so boring and repetitive (they remember the same things 3-5 times) that after the third chapter I skipped 70% of it and still got the story. The characters background is also not explored with one exception <spoiler> (kyoko) </spoiler>, nor provides anything interesting in any way.\nThe target audience appears to be teenagers, but the gruesome parts don't allow for such an age rating. I don't know where the good reviews are coming from. It's also themed around <spoiler>brutal murdering with nonsensical means</spoiler> which reveals something wrong with the head of the guy who came up with this.\n\nThe motives make absolutely no sense to a sound person as they are based on the word of a mastermind they all blindly believe, even though they clearly state multiple times it could be fake and it's just to create confusion and paranoia.\nAlso it appears the mastermind has a lot of power with very advanced tools, but none of it is anywhere in sight, before or after use. Sometimes you have the opportunity to investigate something that would expose a part of the plot but the game does not allow you to for absolutely no reason. After a couple of chapters, everything becomes very basic and all that technology is not used.\n\nThe ending is probably one of the worst endings in game history. I still can't believe I played 20 hours to see this. It doesn't answer 80% of the questions and leaves you to imagine the rest.\n\nThis game deserves a 1/10 really...", "timestamp_created": 1689165747, "timestamp_updated": 1689171847, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485294103622436523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141891150": {"recommendationid": "141891150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373022514", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1605, "last_played": 1689151152}, "language": "english", "review": "\nhttps://youtu.be/30Ysa3A2WMU", "timestamp_created": 1689151357, "timestamp_updated": 1689151357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141883648": {"recommendationid": "141883648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088915250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 3737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3737, "last_played": 1668686645}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the first ever Visual Novels I've ever played.

The opening of the game is extremely strong with the first two chapters being phenomenal, then it dips by a lot, then gets really good again, then just kind of falls apart in a few areas near the end. The characters are also somewhat mixed with about half of them being genuinely great, and the other half being a mix of underdeveloped or not very likable. A fantastic visual novel and great mystery held back by it's simplicity and the story feeling like it really doesn't know what it wants to be at a certain point and throws things at the wall hoping they'll stick.

Its so painfully obvious and I did not enjoy the case remotely even though I liked the characters I expected something more... IDK well thought out instead of a half assed attempt\n I think the final case, with one of the characters.. Its hard to explain without spoiling, but makes the entire story feel really fucking stupid IMO like cartoonishly stupid.\n Also very predictable twist for the murder case that is so obvious, but its still a solid case for a few aspects that make up for it.\n It also has a very hostile and toxic community in many many areas of the internet that clearly hate the game and the creator saying some of the most vile thing about both, but still try to act like the game is their entire personality. Im unsure about steams community for it but generally they seem chill with only a few of those hostile mouthbreathers here and there.\n The case trial mechanics are just all around unfun and awkward IMO, I like the idea but really it feels.. its just not good with many unpleasant aspects. Though I do like the idea of having skills you can learn, thats wildly unique.\n\n But for the good aspects of this game:\n Character breaks are cool but not because while its true characters would act a bit different if they are the killer, it just  spoils who the killer is but hey thats in itself in kinda neat I guess.\n At the end of the case their is a comic book \"Brain Blast\" so to speak kinda like the dumb auto solving box clicking in AA Dual destinies / SoJ but its actually good and doesn't kill the vibe of the game and usually cute art. \n The twists are mostly pretty solid, a few of them genuinely are surprising either because you refused to believe a certain possibility or just kinda wild.\n Cute/cool characters with unique personalities and all but 1 of 16 of the students are likable, also nice art sprinkled in that gives good service to them a bit, personally I like the Gambler Ultimate though she should be called the 'Queen of fumbling' but honestly I really do like them all barring the one I wont name.\n Interesting concept, while its overall a self defeating aspect, the idea of making fun characters and trying to make you like them even though you know all of them are going to die is done as good as it probably could have been.\n The vibe is cool, you definitely feel the MCs optimism rub off a tad on you,\n Oh yea, the text changing to match what has happened is REALLY cool and gives a feeling to check every single interact able every case or so just to see the new lines. Even a sad moment at the end if you check a certain door, small but you can feel that the devs genuinely cared.\n\nTLDR, its a handholdy mystery detective game that while is predictable at times and for 1 case awful, its not as amazing as AA ofc, but it holds its own enough to where it can still be played and enjoyed for its concepts and pretty solid twists and all around amazing cast of characters. \n\n If I had to rate it relative to itself, maybe like a 7.7~ depending on my mood and its probably better to rate each case.\n1: 8, Tutorial case, good you can see the twist coming at a certain point but great for entry case non the less.\n2: 8.4, phenomenal this one \"surprised me\" not a true surprise but its one that I didnt want to believe until you have proof even if you can narrow it down early.\n3: 5.5, (once again soft spoilers) I knew how this was going to go from the start from 1 out of character outburst and it felt very awkward, the plan was also stupid that only idiots could fall for it. You expected something more from all characters involved in this case.\nMany many details tip you off on this case, the sweat, the character breaks, the nonsensical events, ruling out the impossible so only the truth remains and it could ONLY have gone this way. Its almost like what NOT to do when making a case.\n4: 8, very Solid though some aspects are predictable, it felt fine all around with some red herrings. Victim was also a fun character and made the case very interesting.\n5: 8.2 somewhat predictable, though I really like how it turns out and gives me AA vibes to trust your client and Edge-worth, ontop of an expected twist but this case is also amazing.\n6: 7.5 Very predictable to the point I figured all the core aspects of the murder pretty much right off the bat, the twist is so obvious it hurts but with that said and the 1 horrid character has a funny portrait while talking but idk bad bad bad motive reveal IMO, I still liked this case as it felt fun and has a lot of time with some of the the best characters in the game. More fun in the investigation than the trial.", "timestamp_created": 1688084671, "timestamp_updated": 1688339691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679210901260375977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140936041": {"recommendationid": "140936041", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122196163", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4234, "last_played": 1693288645}, "language": "english", "review": "I went into this game completely blind. I didn't know what the basic premise of the game was going to be (other than murder mystery) or how the game was going to flow. As a result, the shock factor of the events that transpire were very impactful onto me as a player, and I think that's what this game is best at. As the first game in the series, it is able to surprise first time players and instill unsettling emotions unlike they have ever felt before. The atmosphere is probably the scariest out of all the danganronpa games, being the claustrophobic, strangely lit, and ominous school; and I feel like the other games have not been able to capture this feeling as well with its settings. However, I think the game relies a bit too much on this and doesn't quite age well as the series progresses, especially to fans who already know all of the surprises danganronpa has in store. The cases aren't quite as extravagant as cases in later games and none really stood out to me as particularly amazing. I still think they are all very good and fun at worst, but not quite up to the quality of the later games. The cast of characters is also mediocre to decent for me, aside from a few standouts like Kyoko Kirigiri (who is the best character in the series change my mind). It is for these reason that I think THH is the worst out of the 3 main games.

Most of the game is VN segments with the class trials consisting of the actual super satisfying mystery solving gameplay. You'll mostly be provided a \"gun\" loaded with \"truth bullets\" and you'll use them to shoot down golden colored text in statements that could present weak spots in an argument or lies, and by doing that, you'll reveal a contradiction and further progress the story, and as the class trials keep going you'll get more minigames around figuring out a word, arguing with an extremely pissed person, and finally concluding the case by making a timeline. DR as a series excels in making everything about the presentation of shooting down others arguments appealing. The vfx, the voice acting from Makoto, the presentation, it's all there and it's gotta be one of my favorite feelings from a video game, just calling someone out on their obvious bullshit. \n\nI really love the cast and how they're probably the most dysfunctional of the all the games. They're selfish and rarely consider you which leads to constant hilarity as Makoto is always getting thrown under the bus while talking about how important it is to work together. All of the cast except Hifumi are likable, and have many various talents that you may see yourself in, providing an easy way for you to end up eventually sad when they die horribly causing you to try and find a new character to replace that hole to lose them again. This is the fun of DR along with the looming fear of despair, so don't fear! Get invested and get ready to DESPAIR. These games rely on their characters, so if you end up not liking any of them or most of them, you're definitely going to have trouble trying to press on. If you feel moderately or poorly about a character, try providing them at least one FTE to see a bit more of how they truly act, you might really like what you see. DRs at its best when you've got multiple favorites, IMO.\n\nNow when it comes to where DR1 is lacking... \nThe pacing is a bit odd, there's not a lot going on in most of the chapters and that may cause a bit of boredom or aimlessness as you explore the school, they definitely could have added more events going on per chapter. \n\nThe character screentime management is a bit poorly handled, and the game isn't exactly great at providing you the right characters for the right moments or devoting more time to some of them. Too much of DR1 relies on you managing to \"pick right\" for the chapter to really hit like it should. I will not further elaborate but hopefully you'll understand what I mean as you play it.\n\nAnd finally, the stupidity of the characters in some class trials is really obnoxious and not at all entertaining. It's a bit frustrating to have characters not only contribute nothing, but then openly tell you they're useless or sidetrack the trial with their stupid side-tangents. A bit of it is fine but it can get really annoying when you're trying to focus on the serious discussion is going on and someone causes a debate with a statement that everyone should obviously know is incorrect. \n\nRegardless, DR1 is a fucking WEIRD game that I love with all my heart and was very happy to play for my friend. It's a bit rough, but it's a pretty good showing for the first of a series.", "timestamp_created": 1685720856, "timestamp_updated": 1687702860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707964599132537842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139401871": {"recommendationid": "139401871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813016264", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3346, "last_played": 1685323603}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es tremendo juegazo lo recomiendo", "timestamp_created": 1685672012, "timestamp_updated": 1685672012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139391719": {"recommendationid": "139391719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149717884", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_at_review": 10584, "last_played": 1699657714}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game so fucking much, its a classic.

I heard so many things about this game that were so good, but was never interested in playing it. And with enough motivation, holy cow. I gotta say. This. game. Is absolutely a masterpiece.....From start to finish this game straps you in for an amazing ride. With interesting story telling, unsolved mysterious, crime-scene detective work, and hour-long trials where you become your own lawyer. This game has the knack for wonder, the writing of an artist, the mystery that sucks you in and the best part about it. Is the fact that the longer you play, the better it becomes and the more you wanna know, what in the hell happens next?!?!? The art is so unique and brings life out of each and every character, the music is electric and groovy and never. gets. old. The characters in the game actually make you care for them and lastly the effort and the work that are put into this game. Also shows, and for that my friends I gotta say \" well ****ing done, I salute you \". Even after you are done with the game there is still so much to do, as there is side bonuses like: Character art/music tracks/re-playable cut-scenes/NG\"What if?\" mode and much, much more. \n\nNow word of advice is this.....I know that the gameplay can look. or be. Fairly boring, as it is a \" point and click \" game. So my best recommendation is to take each chapter into small bites, as well as realize the fact that the game is all \"build up\" and progressively gets more interesting the deeper you are into story. But when it comes down to it, you gotta realize that it is a visual novel. Which it is to say that the writing, character development and story are peak here and trust me...You will get your moneys worth. \n\nNote: Advice from a nephew to avoid spoilers for this game and its series. This game/fandom is spoiler heavy so the best way to avoid spoilers is to never type the name of the game. Anywhere. Never read off game reviews. Dont go on Youtube comment section. As well as skip the cutscene everytime you play the game until you beat it. \n\nGood \n\n- Cinematic \n- Unique 2-D Art style \n- Addictive Music\n- Creepy Atmosphere\n- Mysterious \n- Anime-like\n- Psychological Thriller\n- Exhilarating Story-Telling/Moments\n- 50+ Hr Game\n- Lots of Side-Bonuses \n\n\nBad \n\n- None \n\nStory Overall: 10/10\nGame Overall: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1682062321, "timestamp_updated": 1682062321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583759903907775879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137030164": {"recommendationid": "137030164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440565760", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1699, "last_played": 1651785128}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game series.

By the time the class trial starts, you have the necessary info, and you can draw conclusions and figure out who the guilty party is.\n\nThe games in the class trials (word-bullet games, an occasional hangman-type game, and a final comic book type game, where you put together the string of what happened) are entertaining.  There's one game (Moment of Truth) that pointless and aggravating, but the rest of the class trial games are decent enough, at least in concept.  The execution of the games leaves something to be desired, but you get the hang of it as you play.\n\nCons: \nToo much repetition.  Every day starts and stops with that stupid evil bear greeting you with the same phrases, letting you know it's day or night.  And every time you enter a room, the cutesy graphics kick in (i.e. all the furnishings and people drop/spring/slide into place) before you can continue.  Also, the post-trial segments (dealing with the guilty party) go on interminably long. And in between, you're often left wandering a large school, hoping to find something to move the story forward.\n\nThe characters: Most are bland or just unlikeable.  Only a few are interesting enough that I cared whether they lived or died.  Most of the girls are cute, though. \n\nThe non-trial segments: During actual investigation segments, there are at least things to do. But there's also a lot of time in the game when you're just wasting time until the next thing happens.  So you can wander around the school, looking for coins to buy random items to give to your classmates, or you can talk to people and try to get closer to them.  I think you're supposed to be developing skills for the class trials when you talk to your classmates, but IDK. Mainly,  it comes across as a bunch of filler time to make the game longer.\n\nAs I write this, the game is getting 'Overwhelmingly Positive' reviews, so maybe I'm missing something.

Envy is \u201cthe painful feeling of wanting what someone else has, like attributes or possessions.\u201d  If you're jealous, instead, you feel \u201cthreatened, protective, or fearful of losing one's position or situation to someone else.\u201d \nFor example, in the game, [spoiler] Toko says she's jealous of Aoi's breasts, but that is incorrect.

There may or may not be real tears in my eyes after 70 hours of exhausting all avenues of content. This review is written assuming that you have basic knowledge of the game's premise and some of the mechanics.\n\nI think Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is the best game in this series. From the tone, to the colorful cast, to the fun trial mechanics, and to the story, I genuinely think that there is rarely a moment where this game doesn't shine as a masterpiece of funny yet emotional storytelling.\n\nThe gameplay loop exists as a visual novel mixed with social simulator for most of it, with you reading the story and using the protagonist, Makoto Naegi to pursue characters you're interested in and learn more about them. It's fun if you're into that sort of thing. Every character presents a unique depth to them, even those that die early, and learning about them feels both rewarding and interesting. Their interactions with Makoto also lend a lot to him as a character as well, as you learn how he thinks of others and how he confronts their faults. Each character in this game is someone you can either relate or connect to, which serves to make their deaths, survivals, despair, and hope all the more captivating. In this cast, there's something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nThe trials, though, is where this game really shines. They take a couple of hours, with you analyzing behaviors and evidence to masterfully unravel what happened during each case. I don't have much to say about the gameplay itself other than that it's fun as hell! Seriously, playing the trials is the highlight of any run. And then, at the end of the trial, you witness the execution of the perpetrator of the crime in a beautiful cutscene that serves as a satisfying conclusion to their story. \n\nAnother place where this game shines is the soundtrack. Masafumi Takada did a great job composing for this game. The intro song is a BANGER. Nothing feels out of place or annoying, and when something is high stakes, the music makes sure you feel that tension. Beautifully done.\n\nI will say that this game isn't without its faults. 13 years after release, and there are certainly aspects of the game that aged poorly. The sexualization of teenagers, odd portrayals of mental illness, among some mildly offensive jokes can take the player for a loop. It's not enough to detract from the story, I think, and many fans have expanded on some of the offensive aspects to fit them in a modern lens through fanworks. You should consider it and remain conscious and critical of these things, but there's still room for you to enjoy the story.\n\nThere's also a lack of replayability. The story remains the same with only a few alternate cutscenes you can get. I think that the game is still good enough to replay after a while, though, as during my road to 100% Completion I did replay the story after roughly a year since I'd first played it.

As for the characters, they are all well drawn and unique in their own way. The music, also is brilliant and the English voice acting I think does a superb job. There should be characters you like, characters you hate and everything in between.\n\nThe plot is engrossing, full of twists, turns and more twists. I simply couldn't put the game down and despite the (30+) hours I've put in, it really did fly by. This isn't some 5-hour visual novel, you will really get your money's worth here.\n\nIt manages to combine dread with black humour wonderfully and Monokuma is such a lovable yet hateable villian. If I had to compare the game to something, I'd say it's like a much more entertaining version of the 'SAW' films.\n\nSo what didn't I like?\n\nThe cast is...brainless. If this is Japan's 'best and brightest' then they are in serious trouble. Outside of Kyoko (my favourite character), the entire cast feels exceptionally dim-witted. The first case should make that glaringly obvious to you. But even by the 5th case, when you have to prove one of the cast isn't a ghost (despite them standing in front of you), the low-IQ group just never get any brighter. Painfully obvious things are drawn out and discussed at length by the cast and you WILL be rolling your eyes as you wait for them to figure out the obvious.\n\nYou play as Makoto who is a nice-but-dim sort. Expect to have figured out the most basic things long before he has. It's frustrating and, despite the adult nature of the game, it sometimes gives the cases an almost 'detective-game-for-children' vibe to it.\n\nSpeaking of the cast, I found the female cast FAR more engaging than the male cast. Now, this is subjective and I know your initial reaction may be \"uh-huh, you love the waifu's\" but it's more than that. The girls are interesting, unique and quirky: Celeste, Sakura, Kyoko, Toko are all memorable. The guys are like bland, 2D stereotypes. Mondo, Hifumi, Kiyotaka, Leon...they are all just dull to me. Only Byakuya manages to stand out.\n\nFinally, the court-scenes are just a mess. The mini-games are absolutely awful. Poorly explained and just tedious in the extreme. By the time I got to the later cases and the (as I called it) 'Disco-Mode' activates and you have to shoot statements to the beat I was hating the mini-games. They disrupt the flow of the game and break up the narrative of the interesting cases. I have no idea why they thought this was a good idea. I liked the 'comic-book' puzzle and that was it.\n\nI'd recommend you buy Danganronpa to experience it for yourself. It has a plot and voice-acting way above the AAA garbage, it has a memorable cast and a wild story that Kojima would be proud of. However it IS frustrating, tedious and marred by poor design decisions.", "timestamp_created": 1679931557, "timestamp_updated": 1679999028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.747109889984130859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135540318": {"recommendationid": "135540318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094599951", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2759, "last_played": 1696017881}, "language": "english", "review": "A BODY HAS BEEN DISCOVERED!", "timestamp_created": 1679918606, "timestamp_updated": 1679918606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487804889678955078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135528445": {"recommendationid": "135528445", "author": {"steamid": "76561199131155767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2422, "last_played": 1684529025}, "language": "english", "review": "Nooooo!

Dangaronpa sucks in all three of these areas!\n- The debates are so easy, they insult player intelligence. In fact, if you do any reasoning on your own, you will have a *harder* time figuring out the right answer, because the game *expects* you to play dumb until you are led into the right hints!\n- The social stuff is very limited, there are no fun activities, farming gifts is really tedious, and character development is very shallow. So all this social mechanic is bleak and unrewarding.\n- And it terms of the narrative it's ridiculously dumb compared to other games in this genre. The first few chapters of the story follow a set of rules, laws that govern the game world, which you can use to build an understanding of the story. All of that goes way out of the window by the time you reach climax, which turns crime mysteries into traditional anime \"good vs evil\" struggle based in absolutely ridiculous ideas, like \"despair is actually a contagious disease\" shit.\n\nAnd to add to the pile of dissimilarities with the three aforementioned archetype games, the BGM, while not that bad on its own, is nowhere near the quality of Phoenix Wright, Persona or Zero Escape series.\nI did enjoy the Japanese VAs, though. In particular, Toko, Kyoko, Monokuma and Byakuya have their voices brilliantly performed.\n\nFinally, I'm confused about the target audience of this game. On one hand, it depicts some of the most gruelsome violence I've seen in VNs - though I admit I'm not too familiar with the horror genre. On the other... the blood in all pictures is neon pink colored, characters talk like kids, and everything's explained like the player is five. I understand Japanese writers' love for some high-school drama, but particularly in Dangaronpa the juxtaposition of adult themes with kids mentality is particularly jarring.... and it doesn't subside as the story progresses.", "timestamp_created": 1679365154, "timestamp_updated": 1679365154, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569216072559356689", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135071939": {"recommendationid": "135071939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166596237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1680128140}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a very good game, but still, I hate this game.", "timestamp_created": 1679364398, "timestamp_updated": 1679365147, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480158746242523193", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135066676": {"recommendationid": "135066676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198889771170", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5129, "last_played": 1641841570}, "language": "english", "review": "The sound of Monokuma's laugh still rings in my brain", "timestamp_created": 1679355937, "timestamp_updated": 1679355937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567460894584655762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135059835": {"recommendationid": "135059835", "author": {"steamid": "76561199025249832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4615, "last_played": 1621551851}, "language": "english", "review": "pls kick my ass Byakuya", "timestamp_created": 1679346542, "timestamp_updated": 1679346542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135044296": {"recommendationid": "135044296", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007549380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1306, "last_played": 1690433309}, "language": "english", "review": "given the chance i would do unholy things to the serial killer girl.", "timestamp_created": 1679329090, "timestamp_updated": 1679329090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135038874": {"recommendationid": "135038874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320272501", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1699044202}, "language": "english", "review": "tell them makoto", "timestamp_created": 1679323397, "timestamp_updated": 1679323397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777443110942840576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135035692": {"recommendationid": "135035692", "author": {"steamid": "76561199167875715", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1666, "last_played": 1627790330}, "language": "english", "review": "i bought all of them, so enough said", "timestamp_created": 1679319965, "timestamp_updated": 1679319965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135033463": {"recommendationid": "135033463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085153045", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1334, "last_played": 1679306556}, "language": "english", "review": "Was going in without knowing a lot about the game.

Sobre todo si hablamos de suspenso, misterio y buena trama.\n\nLa historia, o los hechos, giran entorno a 15(+1) estudiantes de la prestigiosa Academia Kibougamine, donde solo estudiantes Definitivos, es decir aquellos que destacan por sobre los demas en un ambito en especifico, pueden darse el lujo de pertenecer. Sin embargo, la cosa cambia cuando descubren que en realidad es una \"prisi\u00f3n\" de la que solo podra salir uno, pero con una condici\u00f3n: deberas cometer un asesinato sin ser descubierto. Sumidos en una constante desesperanza y desesperaci\u00f3n, tu \u00fanica mis\u00edon es escapar.\n\nLo primero que me llamo la atenci\u00f3n fue la premisa del juego: para que alguien pueda escapar, debe primero cometer un asesinato y no ser descubierto. Siendo algo que acompa\u00f1a muchisimo al juego es el misterio y lo introducen de una manera tan genuina, que automaticamente nos hacen poner en el papel, de no solo el protagonista, sino tambien del resto de los estudiantes. La manera que tienen de narrar los hechos e hilar las cosas a medida que la trama avanza, me parecio excelente. No hay por donde decir que \"es malo\". Por lo general soy de esos que abandonan una novela cuando se torna muy pesada en cuanto a dialogos, aun sabiendo que es el punto fuerte de una... yo s\u00e9 que algunos entenderan de lo que hablo, pero Danganronpa fue todo lo contrario.\n\nLos personajes, con los cuales no familiarizas mucho al inicio, se van desenvolviendo y con esto desarrollandose. No son nada en el final a comparaci\u00f3n de las actitudes que adoptaban en un inicio. Considero que es un punto fuerte del juego: sabe como desarrollar a los personajes sin que se vea forzado. Sin contar que te encari\u00f1as con ellos xd.\n\nTiene un visual arte fascinante. Cuando juego algo por primera vez, siempre priorizo el c\u00f3mo los desarrolladores pueden hacernos llegar, de alguna manera, el c\u00f3mo se sienten los personajes y para ello me apoyo mucho, no solo en los dialogos, sino tambien en las expresiones. Principalmente en aquellas de desesperaci\u00f3n, que es donde m\u00e1s hace hincapie el juego. De hecho se podria decir que tiene un contraste bastante bello con respecto a la desesperaci\u00f3n y la esperanza.\n\nCuando al inicio nombre algo de \"jugabilidad fisica\", me referia a que por ser una novela visual no todo va a ser un sinfin de dialogos y saltos de escena. De hecho lo compre sin saber, pero el juego te permite pasearte por el mapa, ya que por cada asesinato se realiza un Juicio Escolar, el cual tiene como objetivo descubrir quien es el asesino. Para ello, el juego, y como lo dije, nos permitira movernos por el mapa para encontrar pistas e incluso para afianzar las relaciones con los demas personajes, mediante un sistema de regalos,  utilizando el tiempo libre que nos dan. Esto nos permite ganar habilidades para cada juicio y utilizarlas a nuestro favor\n\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 de ser un juego totalmente surrealista, deja un bonito mensaje que no pasa por desapercibido. Danganronpa es sin duda alguna, uno de los mejores en su genero, y es una joyita que no deberias perderte de probar.\n\nTe recomiendo comprarlo en oferta, aunque tambien lo pagaria por el precio original ya que m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de ser un poco viejito tiene mucha calidad para ofrecer.", "timestamp_created": 1679205349, "timestamp_updated": 1679205349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498113185167312622", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134929310": {"recommendationid": "134929310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882909261", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2032, "last_played": 1597602359}, "language": "english", "review": "While playing this game all i could hear was a baby crying, there isnt a baby in the game and there isnt a baby in my house", "timestamp_created": 1679187546, "timestamp_updated": 1679187546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58355337381362915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134924552": {"recommendationid": "134924552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451792143", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3646, "last_played": 1679177744}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego ta bueno pero sac\u00e1rselo al 100% es muy tedioso", "timestamp_created": 1679181548, "timestamp_updated": 1679181548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134909480": {"recommendationid": "134909480", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228728718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2993, "last_played": 1691346221}, "language": "english", "review": "Danganronpa franchise is one of my favourite franchise with awesome storyline, mystery and the class trials were also awesome. \n\nIts really worth the Money.", "timestamp_created": 1679166183, "timestamp_updated": 1700599269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134900277": {"recommendationid": "134900277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072066672", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 2923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2923, "last_played": 1655657207}, "language": "english", "review": "Good book", "timestamp_created": 1679157540, "timestamp_updated": 1679157540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134894057": {"recommendationid": "134894057", "author": {"steamid": "76561199107788164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1687280143}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING I LOVE IT SO MUCH", "timestamp_created": 1679152135, "timestamp_updated": 1679152135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134856831": {"recommendationid": "134856831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390913369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1678, "last_played": 1611685034}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tengo que decir que soy una basura para este tipos de juego teniendo un IQ de Chimpance pero que me importa si me tarde una banda, lo jugu\u00e9 por las waifus nomas.

If we were to remove these vulgarities, the writing and cases are really really simple to understand and would have been fun as a middle schooler to play....but as an adult, just seem frustrating at how often the same thing is said again and again and again and again. If it were cut down and you actually had to use your brain rather than being led straight to each answer by the hand I'd give it an upvote...but it's just not fun because of how easy it is.\nCompared to Pheonix wright games, which were rated T in the states because they didn't go over the top with language and the cases weren't so violent, they were the perfect games to play as a middle schooler....kinda funny how a game with adult protagonists is aimed at a younger audience (or more general audience) than a game with \"high schoolers\".\nAlso if you play this game because you like gore, please seek therapy. This world has enough violence and danger in it already, there is no reason to add to it.

This definitely allowed to me to enjoy/remember each character that much more. The game-play itself tho apart from being used to get everyone completed for the achievements, can be very repetitive and boring at times, especially after the first run since all you are doing is grinding materials and holding whatever button it is to skip the process. The extra content with artwork and cut-scenes you can scroll through is a very nice touch, loved going back and watching the punishment times again [/spoiler]\n\nOverall: I would honestly give this game a try and see if it's for you.

entretenida al igual que la del 2 y la del v3, simplemente que con los proximos juegos se fue refinando y mejorando, ahora en temas de historia esta me parece la mas balanceada y solida de toda la saga, si bien la del 2 me parece la mejor de la saga, esta es la mas balanceada, ya que si bien en el 2 tenias el capitulo 2 que era facilmente el peor del juego y su final que era muy hit or miss, en este no hubo un capitulo que me disgustase mucho, todos mantienen casi el mismo nivel de calidad, y definitivamente este es el juego de la saga que tiene el mejor final de todos. \nYa con los personajes si bien varios me gustan hay otros que no tanto, siendo este para mi el juego que tiene al peor personaje de la saga como parte de su cast principal, Junko Enoshima, y hay otros que no me terminaron de gustar mucho (Makoto Naegi, Kyotaka Ishimaru e Hifumi Yamada por dar otros ejemplos), pero eso no significa que todo su cast sea malo, ya que hay otros personajes que me gustaron mucho (Toko Fukawa, Sakura Ogami, Chihiro Fujisaki y Byakuya Togami por dar unos ejemplos). en general este me parece el segundo mejor juego de la saga y probablemente el que tiene el mayor factor sorpresa en lo que viene a ser los casos y plot twists, y en general un juego que esta bastante bueno, no es una obra maestra ni en pedo (hay varias cosas que le quitan varios puntos), pero en general me pareci\u00f3 un juego bastante entretenido.\n\nRecomendado", "timestamp_created": 1677109858, "timestamp_updated": 1677109858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

If you REALLY like the concept you will enjoy it. But you have to be interested in this niche theme in the first place. I bought it on sale expecting well written and engaging murder cases to solve (because that's what the fans make it sound like) but the game holds your hand way too much.\n\nIt's very linear and predictable. Motives behind each murder case are either obvious, or extremely obviously setting up a twist. Even if you (the player) figure out what happened you still have to sit through a few scenes where the main character is clueless. You don't even need to think to progress. Just follow the instructions and markers and the game will reveal the truth. Honestly, it's quite jarring.\n\nThe \"social deduction\" aspect is also a bit underwhelming because the characters aren't properly fleshed out. Especially the main character whose entire personality is based around being just an average guy surrounded by prodigies. There is the ultimate gambler, the \"moral compass\", the otaku, the biker gang leader, the pro athlete etc. They all act like what you'd expect from their respective tropes with a few twists.\n\nThe character designs on the other hand are really unique. I like this art style a lot. Combined with great soundtrack and voice acting it creates a fitting mood for a gritty murder mystery game.\n\nUnfortunately, if you care about good character writing and engaging cases to solve... just play Disco Elysium.", "timestamp_created": 1676820364, "timestamp_updated": 1676820364, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732609808444976807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133176476": {"recommendationid": "133176476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275338281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 438, "last_played": 1676833367}, "language": "english", "review": "top tier soundtrack, great writing, traumatizing first hours, 10/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1676818187, "timestamp_updated": 1676818187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133172739": {"recommendationid": "133172739", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161714308", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1277, "last_played": 1681487070}, "language": "english", "review": "you can talk to byakuya<3", "timestamp_created": 1676814392, "timestamp_updated": 1676814392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133160356": {"recommendationid": "133160356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291035731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2282, "last_played": 1676915118}, "language": "english", "review": "sans", "timestamp_created": 1676799294, "timestamp_updated": 1676799294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605862677097320557", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133159940": {"recommendationid": "133159940", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229583748", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1680888716}, "language": "english", "review": "funi gmame", "timestamp_created": 1676798747, "timestamp_updated": 1676798747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133152629": {"recommendationid": "133152629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798559632", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2425, "last_played": 1682807755}, "language": "english", "review": "ace attorney in a high school", "timestamp_created": 1676787623, "timestamp_updated": 1676787623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604644715785980225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133147441": {"recommendationid": "133147441", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111852832", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1693061246}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let my playtime fool you, I've finished this game on Switch.

Extremely well written characters engaging in delightful, predominantly grounded dialogues ;\n+ Outstanding english voice acting ;\n+ Intelligently written and paced narrative that's presented in such a way that the player is rarely left clueless or blindsided ;\n+ The looming sense of mystery makes moving forward in the narrative an addicting experience ;\n+ A [b]whole[/b] unlockable mode that has the player go through the story in a completely different way ;\n+ Zero hiccups, glitches, bugs or crashes.\n\nCons:\n- All gameplay features fall between passable and downright bad ;\n- A certain degree of freedom is given to the player in an interesting setting only to then present absolutely nothing that makes exploring that setting worth it ;\n- Player agency is very limited, both within and outside of the narrative ;\n- A handful of the solutions to the mysteries presented are made fairly obvious well before it ought to have been intended, making some of the characters' reactions feel unnatural or awkwardly slow.\n\nDanganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a visual novel adventure originally release in 2010 for the PSP. The game would see a release on many platforms over the years, arriving to Steam in 2016. Being a visual novel first and foremost, the experience provided by Danganronpa is [i]mostly[/i] a timeless one, hindered mainly by the plethora of gameplay mechanics employed to keep the players engaged. Stemming in Japan's rythm games, assorted puzzle games and visual novels before it, D:THH's gameplay is an anachronistic mess when played on regular difficulty. These features are used to try and convey the atmosphere of a given moment and I can't quite say it fails at that, but it hardly succeeds at anything when it demands from the player to make [i]sometimes[/i] illogical choices and/or hinders the flow of the narrative. A gameplay feature that was seemingly teemed with potential of strengthening the narrative but ultimately falls short at doing so is the exploration sections of the game. It cannot be overstated just how interesting the setting was and how much freedom the player is given only to be met with a profoundly unexciting lack of development around the game's map.\n\nNeedless to say, at this point, but D:THH would've been better off [b]not[/b] trying to get one step ahead on the gameplay front. That's especially true when you account for the great cast of characters, the beautifully written dialogues that seem to perfectly complement each character, the mystery surrounding everything and everyone within the boundaries of the game and ultimately, the pace and cleverness of the narrative events where it all comes together so well. I can safely say that I've left a handful of 2 hour long sessions behind feeling like I could go for another two hours of it just over how intrigued I was. I've spent minutes on end at work wondering about the possibilities and sometimes digesting what I had seen on my previous evening of playing the game. It's like everything's presented and paced just so, and one has but to follow through to [b]know[/b]. The game is bountiful like that ; it gives and it leaves you wondering still, willing and wanting to take more. A few select characters are also easily the catalysts for this formula. Without getting into detail, the obligatory name-drop would have to be Monokuma - if you're new to the series, you just won't see it coming.\n\nI found that some things related to the narrative could've been done better, without having let the game down. Firstly, for a game tailored in Danganronpa's fabric it would've been pleasant to give the player some room for error, or perhaps leave something to be missed or found that could potentially alter the way the player perceives any given event. On a limb, I wouldn't have minded being asked to make a decision or two to influence the outcome of things, maybe get a secret ending, or simply learn something I wouldn't otherwise. Ultimately, I'm talking about player agency and replayability relating to the story - D:THH has none. Secondly, many of the events taking place will demand that the player [i]understands[/i] them before the game can keep moving forward. To summarize, perhaps due to how deep seated in logic the game is, you'd have a harder time finding an elephant in a football field than the truth behind some of the events taking place. This isn't particularly jarring considering the things that did bamboozle me and kept me interested and engaged.\n\nWhen you isolate the narrative aspects of the game, D:THH is a must play for any fan of visual novels and an interesting experience for anyone that's into any fiction or video games at all. Factor in the gameplay aspects of the game and you get yourself a bit of a mixed bag if you're not already an avid fan of visual novels. All things considered, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a game that deserves your time of day. And of course it does. There's a reason why it's a cult classic.\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1676201665, "timestamp_updated": 1681609694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662816822528839111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132671402": {"recommendationid": "132671402", "author": {"steamid": "76561199269565632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1631, "last_played": 1700763080}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game omgommgomgonmgokgmogmogmogmgomgmogmomgomgomgogmgmog", "timestamp_created": 1676167733, "timestamp_updated": 1676167733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132629093": {"recommendationid": "132629093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243486992", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 3005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3005, "last_played": 1642960311}, "language": "english", "review": "if you don't have sex play it (you will still not have sex but you will have played danganronpa which is a pretty good game)", "timestamp_created": 1676128956, "timestamp_updated": 1676128956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434373229742050171", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132526937": {"recommendationid": "132526937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144408198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 535, "last_played": 1656440548}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Monokuma my beloved", "timestamp_created": 1676045634, "timestamp_updated": 1676045634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132477716": {"recommendationid": "132477716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195052435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2644, "last_played": 1459437750}, "language": "english", "review": "Danganronpa 1 is a great visual novel for both newcomers and veterans of the genre, containing a great atmosphere and character writing that is both fun and engaging.", "timestamp_created": 1675960035, "timestamp_updated": 1675960035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132458584": {"recommendationid": "132458584", "author": {"steamid": "76561199017367257", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2159, "last_played": 1681410833}, "language": "english", "review": "Je trouve que c'est un tr\u00e8s bon jeux, avec une narration qui \u00e9tait vraiment sympathique a son \u00e9poque.

And I was instantly captivated by it and in fact played it multiple times over during the years, both on Steam and also on Switch.\n\nIt was the first time I saw the genre of \u201ckilling game\u201d, where a bunch of students from an elite school get trapped and are forced to kill each other to escape. Being a mystery the game of course builds itself on solving the mystery as for why they are trapped in the school and who is behind it all, over the course of the whole of the story. While during every chapter having to also solve a new murder case in so called \u201cClass Trials\u201d.\nAdmittedly some of the class trials, where you had to solve a murder, were a bit easier to solve than others, but they were all still satisfying to solve nonetheless with the clues you collected over each investigation. However the main mystery of the school, [spoiler]which is that the apocalypse had happened due to society issues with their worship of talent and elite that the antagonised used for their means,[/spoiler] really took me by surprise. But it made sense, because there is a lot of foreshadowing throughout the whole story that lead up towards the final conclusion.\n\nThe gameplay and style of the game is also something I really came to enjoy.\nEvery chapter is split up into \u201cFree Time\u201d, which is basically a novel game where you spend time with the other characters, give them gifts, become friends with them (which gives you special abilities during the Class Trials), and also learn their backstories. \u201cInvestigation\u201d that is more akin to a Point and Click style of gameplay, where you have to go throughout the school and collect clues to solve the murder. And finally \u201cClass Trial\u201d, which is a shooter style of gameplay where you have to solve the murder and find out who the blackened is through finding contradictions in what everyone is saying and literally shooting their words with your evidence, among various other quick time events.\n\nBut what I think really sells the game, together with the whole mystery of the series, is the cast. Because they are just so incredibly varied and over-the-top fun (which is on purpose, as the game exaggerates to make its point clear). They all have such unique designs, but when you come to know them over the course of the story you learn about their backstories and motivations, which really makes you root for them. Which makes it even more heartbreaking if they then end up dying as either a victim or a blackened.\n\nAlso what is worth mentioning is that there is quite a lot of bonus game content that you unlock at the end of the game. The most noticeable being the silly Dating Sim that you can play, to basically get the rest of your classmate's backstories that you didn't manage to get during the main game.\n\nAll in all I can only recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1675070254, "timestamp_updated": 1675070254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131858993": {"recommendationid": "131858993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383975747", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1484, "last_played": 1639983046}, "language": "english", "review": "my second favorite worst game ever", "timestamp_created": 1675069176, "timestamp_updated": 1675069176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781201362609863281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131841179": {"recommendationid": "131841179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275069633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1330, "last_played": 1611454513}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is definitely not for everyone, but if you're willing to put past any judgments you might have from hearing horror stories about the series and community on the internet, you might have a fun time either laughing at how shit it is or appreciating the good parts it does contain.", "timestamp_created": 1675039811, "timestamp_updated": 1675039811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131836550": {"recommendationid": "131836550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119785730", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1499, "last_played": 1678716200}, "language": "english", "review": "haha", "timestamp_created": 1675033048, "timestamp_updated": 1675033048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470588237047195435", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131816261": {"recommendationid": "131816261", "author": {"steamid": "76561199252683882", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1405, "last_played": 1684585075}, "language": "english", "review": "slay", "timestamp_created": 1675011750, "timestamp_updated": 1675011750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470588237047195435", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131813580": {"recommendationid": "131813580", "author": {"steamid": "76561199205655435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1129, "last_played": 1699073934}, "language": "spanish", "review": "dangangod", "timestamp_created": 1675009367, "timestamp_updated": 1675009367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476377934217453003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131797204": {"recommendationid": "131797204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365391186", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2283, "last_played": 1674988412}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Despair. 9/10[/h1]\n\n[b]Are you into detective novels and only started reading visual novels recently?[/b] Well, this is a huge recommend for you. Trigger Happy Havoc is the first entry of the Danganronpa franchise and a damn great one at that. \n\n[b]This visual novel is very good.[/b] The story is amazing. It sets up a great mystery that gets you really curious. And when the mystery eventually unfolds, you are pleasantly surprised and the mastermind behind it all is such a great villain. The characters are great, it's pretty easy to like a character and find one to be your favorite. Then, your favorite character dies. Never get attached to any characters in this game, I swear. \n\n[b]A visual novel is called a visual novel because it's got visuals. This one's visuals are great.[/b] The sprites, character design, the illustrations done for this game are nice to look at. Some of you might already know damn well that this game is famous for its pink blood. Pretty close to red. Oh, and some of you might also have listened to this game's soundtrack before. It's one of the finest I've heard from a game. The soundtrack is a banger and used incredibly well.\n\n[b]A bonus, the gameplay is surprisingly fun.[/b] Daily Life is the first act of the game. It is free roam and you get to choose how to manage your time, you've got many ways to spend your time. You can do Free Time Events, interact with classmates and strengthen your bond with them; you can even gift them presents. You can also find collectibles and collect Monocoins from all around Hope's Peak Academy, or you can just sleep through the day and proceed into the story.\nThen, we hit the climax and switch to Deadly Life. You investigate and search for clues and evidence to solve the case. Eventually, after you gather enough evidence, you open the iconic red door. The Class Trials, the last act of the chapter. The class trials have great gameplay mechanics that honestly make the game so much more fun. Not only is the story interesting and entertaining, the gameplay as well helps make the story feel even better. Once you find the culprit, you then get thrown into the final phase of the trial, execution. The execution scenes are BRUTAL. \n\n[b]Overall, a great game.[/b] The story, characters, art, gameplay: All great. This game also has a large following, so you can talk with other fans about the game once you finished it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1674994368, "timestamp_updated": 1674994368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131715423": {"recommendationid": "131715423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198980474711", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4498, "last_played": 1698173603}, "language": "english", "review": "Tell them, Naegi", "timestamp_created": 1674902649, "timestamp_updated": 1674902649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72983938455581665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131710942": {"recommendationid": "131710942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331975631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1340, "last_played": 1598217750}, "language": "english", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1674897137, "timestamp_updated": 1674897137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131705890": {"recommendationid": "131705890", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987759169", "num_games_owned": 889, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1954, "last_played": 1660519534}, "language": "english", "review": " the characters are fondly memorable.

Its only my second time playing one, and its a game to be experienced. The logic is definitely for those who have time to sit down and take notes, but in my book this is a game where it doesn't hurt to use guides. Especially considering the class trials. They are one and a half to two hour long scenes that you cant save during, so you pretty much have to make time for the game. Regardless, its phenomenal. The final trial almost made me throw my controller out the f*cking window after i lost the final strike, but it was at least generous enough to let you retry. Any other trial, if you loose you go right back to your last save. A bit brutal, but well worth my time and money. The ending can be described by the final achievement. Not a total let down or controller smasher, but it definitely could have been better.\n\nSide notes:\n-Vaped the equivalent to a pack of cigarettes during the final trial\n-Its a game that doesn't really benefit from being on one platform or another, so buy it wherever its cheapest or buy it physically if you're oldschool like me\n-F*ck Junko.", "timestamp_created": 1673862354,

Even the characters that I did not like as much were still well-written and brought something new to the table! In my experience, usually, games like this are very predictable and besides a few instances, I was left blindsided nearly the entire time which just proves how good of a narrative this game really offers the player! I will not get into spoilers but there are certain scenarios that were legitimately impressive narrative feats! This game's plot is some of the best writing I've seen in a video game ever! I will admit I was suspicious of this game and series for a very long time but I'm super glad I finally got around to playing it! There really is nothing I can criticize the game for besides nitpicking. I do not usually give this amount of praise to a game, especially this genre of game but it is downright one of the best games I've ever played and I cannot wait to play the next ones in the series!

MY... GOD... WHAT A GAME! WHAT A MASTERPIECE!\nGameplay: Good. At first I didn't expect too much from this game, but as soon as I saw trial gameplay I said OMG, this is just genious! As always Japanese are really genious at game making, I would never imagine what gameplay involving trial would look.\nStory: Good. Really liked the first 3 Class Trials, 3 is far my favourite, and the 6th trial was also good.\nOST: That dynamic music that plays when \"Make Your Argument!\", also Free Time and others are really good OSTs.\nGraphics: Really fell in love with that student-project-like simplisistic and basic graphics. You don't even feel the air, and that is what I liked about it, it is like a student made that game, but actually nailed colour selections with kinda cute graphics for school indoors.\nSchool Mode: OMG I played this mode 2 hours straight and didn't feel how fast time passed! Enjoyed every second of it! And the fact that you get every character's pants after fully increasing their heart rate is just hilarious! \nCharacters: Celestia Ludenberg, Kyoko Kirigiri, Chihiro Fujisaki (her sad and smug reactions are my fav LOL), Hifumi Yamada (SAAYYYWHAAAA), Aoi Asahina, Junko Enoshima and others. Byakuya at first irritating, but you like him with time, but couldn't love that annoying fujoushi Toko. Would love to hang out with Hifumi, Yasuhiro, and maybe Sakura. I knew all along that the mastermind was [spoiler]Junko Enoshima[/spoiler], but also had a little anxiety and fear that they would turn out to be a boring villain, but to my surprise I really liked them!

lo que llevo del juego solo fueron 6 horas desde la intro hasta la investigacion y concluyendo con el juicio. eso si tienes que estar preparado para leer mucho ser atento y rapido en el caso de los juicios y aun mas atento de que no te falte ninguna pista pues si te falta con que sea una no iniciara el juicio y eso te puede dejar estancado un buen rato asi que se atento habla con todos y checa todo es mas que obvio que es divertido pero no es un genero que a todo el mundo le guste igual si piensas comprarlo y crees poder con todo lo que requiere hazlo no te arrepentiras y si no sabes ingles

Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, a game that has left me with more questions than answers.\n\nFirst and foremost, let me address the elephant in the room: the characters. My goodness, they are a curious bunch, each with their own unique quirk and motive. But as the plot thickens and the body count rises, I found myself wondering: who can I trust? Is anyone truly innocent in this twisted game of life and death?\n\nThe gameplay itself is equally perplexing. On one hand, the \"Class Trials\" put my logic and deduction skills to the test, as I tried to piece together the truth from the conflicting testimony of my fellow students. On the other hand, the \"Free Time\" sections allow me to form relationships and uncover secrets about my fellow classmates, further muddying the waters of my own suspicions.\n\nBut the real mind-boggler for me was the story. It's a rollercoaster of twists and turns, full of shocking reveals and plot twists that kept me guessing until the very end. Just when I thought I had everything figured out, the game would throw another curveball my way, leaving me scrambling to reevaluate my assumptions.\n\nIn short, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is a puzzle box of a game, one that will keep you guessing until the very end. If you're a fan of mystery and intrigue, then this is definitely a game for you.

"last_played": 1650322868}, "language": "english", "review": "So real quick I actually have an extra 30 or so hours on this game but I mostly played it while my internet was out okay actual review:\nThis game has some of the worst written characters I've ever seen. The actual gameplay elements are pretty alright, but the characters oftentimes make that insufferable as well. You're given the option to spend time with the characters and get to know them better, which I did about half the time. The times I did, I was extremely disappointed as the characters proved to be completely one dimensional. They play to stereotypes and don't veer from that at all. There's the militant one, the mysterious one, the musclehead, the horny one, and it goes on. On one occasion I even talked to one of my favorite characters about their talent, which they basically told me was anime magic and not actual skill, which completely ruined one of the few characters I found tolerable. The big bad of the whole game had such an annoying voice and expressions that I took my headphones off for the last 3 hours and sat in silence as that was so much preferable to hearing them speak.\nThe story of the game is very back end heavy.

The Danganronpa series left a scar in my brain that cannot be returned. The sadest reality of the Danganronpa games is that there really aint no reason to replay them. They have zero replay value, but the game that you get is nothing short but a MASTERPIECE.\nAnd I don't use that term lightly. It truly is a masterpiece. All 3 games in my opinion.\n\nIf you choose to proceed with buying the game and trying it from here, I apologise in advance. You WILL beg for more Danganronpa even after you've finished all 3 relevant games. The games, in my humble opinion, are THAT good. I found myself absorbed in Danganronpa and, given the nature of the series, got terrified of just googling the games. You DO NOT want to get spoiled. Absolutely under any circumstances. Once you start playing the series, you have thus born a new form of internet paranoia, the terror of getting Danganronpa spoilers.\n\nThe price is SUPER fair in my book. The game is so well crafted and the sequels are equal, if not even better, in quality and story. I absolutely adored the games and all the characters. Mostly all. \nThe jokes are great, even the naughty ones and the fanservice ones. I found myself bursting out laughing several times! The soundtrack is absolute Banger too! I absolutely urge you to play Danganronpa. I want you to suffer as bad as I am. I would slit the throat of a goat under the dark moon Morrslieb if I could bring the tiniest hint about a new Danganronpa game. A reboot of the series or whatever. Anything! The games are THAT good and it's almost like a formula you cannot fail on (get good detective mysteries and absolute wack characters and you're set basically).\n\nDid I forget to mention to BUY Danganronpa and play the series? \nThat comes from someone who generally don't like Visual novels. This is in a league of it's own. As far as I am concerned, this game puts other Visual novels to a laughable shame. \n\nPeace!", "timestamp_created": 1671590358, "timestamp_updated": 1671590487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128932503": {"recommendationid": "128932503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203830141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1714, "last_played": 1669710882}, "language": "english", "review": "Very entertaining story.

The story is engaging, full of a colorful cast of characters, nail biting moments, interesting twists & turns, great writing, and asatisfying conclusion. The post-game content is quite plentiful as well. Court Sessions have full voice acting and the voicr performances for pretty much a of the characters are fantastic. \n\nGameplay mostly relies on your drive to progress the story and learn more about the setting and characters. It is very hard to not get attached to it all. Kyoko is my favorite character and she definitely isn't on my long list of waifus. The game mechanics really shine in the trials where you have to figuratively shoot down people's argument with bullets that hint at the truth. Soundtrack is fantastic and fits the tone and setting spectacularly. Character Art and Visual Presentation is great for it being a PS Vita visual novel ported to PC. \n\nIf you love anime aesthetic visual novels, you will love this game.

It's frustrating when I already know the answer, but the characters keep arguing for trivial reasons, and everyone just seemed like they are lost. The only difficult part is the game inside, it's 100% boring, and sometimes you can't success because the game itself was designed poorly instead of don't knowing what happened. \nMost of all, the developer is obsessed with sexualizing female characters, you can see several unnecessary CG about that. Since they are high-school students, it's even more inappropriate. Sexual harassment was written like a 'joke' in this game. Also it spreads stereotype of friendship between females.

"review": "Tried it very late - as many bought on sale as I heard a lot of good things about it and it waited patiently for it's time in my backlog.\n\nIn general, if you played Ace Attorney series or simply like investigations, here you will have six chapters to solve murder mysteries. Compared to Ace Attoreny those are fairly easy, with lot of clues easily given and murder cases itself being very logical when you get gist of each one. What is different is presentation - all characters and situations are completely over the top and very dynamic. The trials and investigations have a lot of smaller mechanics added, which makes it more fast-paced. Except rhythmic mini-game during trial, which is sometimes bullshit - all are just something to keep that crazy theme of the game rolling.\n\nStory itself is pretty solid, it's easily 20 hours of read and play through with no slog to it really. At the beginning it might be bit confusing as there's not enough descirptions for some of the actions you can do, but you easily get hang of it. I've also really liked big cast of characters from the beginning - while at very beginning it is bit overwhelming, it quickly sorts itself out and adds a lot of unique flavor to this game.\n\nIf you want to play on Steam Deck, it works really well. Only at launch you need to touch control press \"Launch\" as this is port and have its own launcher for setup, but out-of-box it works well. I had just one moment where I had game freeze for 20 seconds in Chapter 3 that might have been some temporary out of memory on my device, but except that it run really well.

Is this criticism well founded? Or is it just a classic example of people being negative for fun?\n\nThe original Danganronpa release in Japan over a decade ago, to pretty high praise. It was renound for its unique artstyle, mixing expressive pop art with dark and macabre tones, as well as its colorful cast of characters, and the tension and mystery that came from (at the time) a pretty unique scenario; the killing game. These elements are what drew me in a few years ago, and they totally engrossed me. I absolutely loved this game. I got all of my friends into it, and played it over and over to get all of the achievements. It wasn't until fairly recently that the game changed from being a pretty niche, well respected game to a popular franchise synonymous with cringe, which begs the question. Were we all just blind teenagers eating up something that totally lacks substance, or does this game just get a bad rap?\n\nWell, I would say that it has definitely begun to show its age, it still absolutely holds up. The artstyle definitely looks amateur in some areas, but it's still just as charming as ever. The plot and writing tend to be pretty goofy and melodramatic at times, it's still pretty charming, and the reveals still have some pretty good weight. The characters are still a ton of fun, and it's easy to see why so many people, (myself included) fell in love with them years ago. It's got its slow spots for sure, it can take a really long time to get going, and a couple chapters just totally flop, so it's definitely not for the kinda player who lives for adrenaline, but the trials and character moments tie it all together for me.\n\nSo overall, would I still reccomend this game to people today? Yeah, but mostly as an introduction to the rest of the series. Danganronpa Triggerhappy Havoc lays an excellent baseline for the rest of the series, and while it still absolutely hold up on its own, it's only a sliver of a pretty awesome series. Check it out if you love mystery games and don't mind some reading and point and click exploration. 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1666907376, "timestamp_updated": 1666907376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124456680": {"recommendationid": "124456680", "author": {"steamid": "76561199381134737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 875, "last_played": 1691359193}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1666857223, "timestamp_updated": 1666857223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124451726": {"recommendationid": "124451726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162296592", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2619, "last_played": 1658894378}, "language": "english", "review": "I came for kioko atleast 12 times", "timestamp_created": 1666845921, "timestamp_updated": 1666845921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124447590": {"recommendationid": "124447590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396856016", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1495, "last_played": 1666820909}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game, all the characters are very likeable and the plot is decent and is surprising at times.

This is my favorite video game series ever made. After playing through all 4 games, 100% completion for two of them, I can say that this is still the best game in the series. All of the characters in this game are so interesting and enjoyable. They all have their own complexities and quirks, and they are a joy to learn more about. This game has the strongest cast of the main trilogy.\nThe story is so well done. Despite being an odd concept, they really hit it out of the park. The game is somehow funny, while also really hitting the emotional beats it strives for. It has great suspense and dread built in, and you really do become invested. I love the message of Hope and Despair, and it really helped me in a time where I was going through a lot of difficulties. Also the strongest story overall.\nThe game play is standard visual novel flair. You click on items to look at them, and at the characters to talk to them. The trials are a bit more complex, but really this is quite simple. The other two games do definitely have more interesting game play, but for a visual novel, it suffices. \nSchool Mode is also a fun reward for completing the first game. It allows you to talk to the characters you may not have had time for when you were playing the campaign. It also allows you to go on special hang-outs with the characters to get hearts. You even get a special ending for each character you get 10 hearts with. It's fun, and a relaxing mode to learn more about the characters.\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone. It's engaging, humorous, and powerful. Even if your on the fence, give it a shot. I know you won't regret it. (Just ignore the fandom.) \n\nGrade: A+", "timestamp_created": 1665415619, "timestamp_updated": 1665415684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123635214": {"recommendationid": "123635214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200526637", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1112, "last_played": 1687183606}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, why?

mine recommended me this game. I was first hesitant, as I'm not really a big fan of Anime games, but this game positively surprised me!\n\nThis game is a detective game in which you'll need to solve a mystery. The gameplay is not really what you'd expect, it has some unique twists to it.\n\nI can't really tell more about this game, as every small detail would spoiler it, and ruin the experience. The only thing I can say is that investigating and solving the mystery was nicely done and always exciting! It never felt cheap and everything was quite logical.\n\nThe Art and \"Graphics\" are very, let's say, funky. I personally really liked it. And thanks to their unique style, it still holds up today and is cool to look at. Some artwork is a bit pixelated compared to others, due to the reason that it's a Port of a PSP game and now upscaled, but it somehow fitted very well with the general art direction. The music is also great and complements the gameplay very well.\n\nI might also give other Detective games a try thanks to this game.

Aside from that, the Danganronpa series is iconic. The plot is quite interesting but the characters and artstyle really made it the huge hit that it is right now. Some of them are memorable and complex. Danganronpa is a visual novel with minigame mechanics (shooting evidence, hangman gambit, rhythm games and a few other things); I'm not an expert in game genres but I think it's a really valid visual novel. I don't mind reading a lot (if you do, this game is probably not for you...) but despite the huuuuge amount of dialogue I didn't find it monotone. Trigger Happy Havoc is the most plain of the trilogy; while it does set the atmosphere and plot, the second and third game have a much thicker plot and interesting twist. The characters are quite interesting but the dynamics and relationships between them (as well as the gameplay) get better from game to game.

I highly recommend playing this game blind since theres no fun in solving mysteries if you already know whats gonna happen. 10/10 best game ive ever played\n[spoiler] sakura devistated me [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1664376608, "timestamp_updated": 1664376608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122963821": {"recommendationid": "122963821", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031835351", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1644, "last_played": 1685848985}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and easy to play with friends", "timestamp_created": 1664374165, "timestamp_updated": 1664374165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122948359": {"recommendationid": "122948359", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097694266", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1675543229}, "language": "english", "review": "yas", "timestamp_created": 1664340065, "timestamp_updated": 1664340065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122912041": {"recommendationid": "122912041", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111942030", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1696844050}, "language": "english", "review": "Danganronpa is cool.

Happy Havoc: Danganronpa and as said in the title - it's a really good game!\n\nIt's a murder mystery visual novel with dating elements, despite that description making it sound very generic it is anything but. \n\nBriefly speaking the game is very unique, it has engaging gameplay along with a dynamic cast of loveable character, plus some pretty neat art-styles. Most importantly the story is generally well written and despite the game being 10 years old has aged shockingly well. \n\nIf you like mystery games, anime or visual novels I highly recommend checking out Danganronpa immediately - do it now! Its the type of game that the less you know going in the better and I'm going to go into more detail now, so this is your final warning.\n\nFirstly the gameplay. Like most visual novels the majority of gameplay involves reading and clicking the A button, but Danganronpa does also quite surprisingly involve First Person Movement sections. In which you walk around the setting of the game, Hope's Peak Academy. It's also includes more interactive trial sections that involve a variety of different minigames that span from the player pointing out contradictions, to playing hangman with a gun, to a rhythm game. These section are really unique and add a lot of spice to the otherwise bland visual novel gameplay. Even when stumped by certain arguments or when struggling rhythmically I was having fun.\n\nThe art-style of the game is very anime-esque, but has an edgy and almost Western streak to it that keep it different from the rest. All the sprites are charming and give characters a whole lot of life. The game also features CGs which uses same proportions and general structure, but have an extreme amount of dept in shading. Making them stand out from the sprites and giving them a powerful level of materiality. Finally I can't not talk about the closing argument's which take the form of reconstruction the entire game as a comic. This is another fun gameplay mechanic which just has the best art-style, its totally subjective but I just adore it.\n\nBefore moving onto the written and conclusion, I want to draw attention to the voice acting in this game. All the character's are voiced, ranging from small audio snippets to accompany text to entirely voice sections during more important segments. I played the English version myself, but the English voice actors did an absolutely phenomenal job. Each and every performance brought the characters to life even further and were packed with emotion. Whether it be the most random gibberish you've heard or an emotional breakdown you can tell the voice actors put in the all consistently.\n\nFinally the writing. In general the writing of the characters and the story itself was good, with a few exceptions here and there. Unfortunately the game does not go without flaw or plot hole, but these flaws aren't ruining don\u2019t take from the overall experience. \n\nThere are many lovable characters who are good friends and nice people. But more impressively there are characters who are uptight assholes, yet they're written such that you enjoy disliking them. Wonderful antagonistic character that you take great pleasure in seeing them rightfully struck down from their high horse cough Togami cough. Personally my favourite character is the serial killer, Genocide Jack - she's so crazy and silly!\n\nThe story is interesting and fully of mysteries and twists all they way, constantly building suspense towards the final climax. Many points caught me completely off guard and surprised me. However even the less intense moments of the game, akin to filler content, are populated with the most bizarre writing and meta-jokes that made me laugh.\n\nSo yeah, all in all Dangenronpa is a really good game, if you haven't played it - you should! As for me - I look forward to playing its sequel, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair.", "timestamp_created": 1664083974, "timestamp_updated": 1664083974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122770881": {"recommendationid": "122770881", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231467613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2520, "last_played": 1669078974}, "language": "english", "review": "fun for a beginner like me who likes twisted tales", "timestamp_created": 1664057508, "timestamp_updated": 1664057508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122744574": {"recommendationid": "122744574", "author": {"steamid": "76561199136002108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1838, "last_played": 1673088763}, "language": "english", "review": "Pink Blood", "timestamp_created": 1664027296, "timestamp_updated": 1664027296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122739309": {"recommendationid": "122739309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292550175", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1370, "last_played": 1620320332}, "language": "english", "review": "mid", "timestamp_created": 1664020935, "timestamp_updated": 1664020935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122721689": {"recommendationid": "122721689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870240648", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1620, "last_played": 1665211081}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1663992292, "timestamp_updated": 1663992292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122715513": {"recommendationid": "122715513", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199185462", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1618, "last_played": 1663980466}, "language": "english", "review": "Hiro is a beautiful dumb boy and ig the games pretty cool.

The music is amazing, the investigation music being a personal favourite of mine.\n\nThe game can drag as the trials become more complex leading to bizarre twists and outcomes that will have you rolling your eyes, but I dare you to not want to know who killed who as the investigations suck you in. Some characters, though memorable, can feel a bit one-note at times, you will definitely have some who are your favourites and some you would rather not spend too much time with.\n\nAll in all, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc is an excellent experience that falls just shy of being amazing but nevertheless will confuse, shock, intrigue and amuse you as it pulls you into a crazy world of murder, psychotic stuffed bears, plot twists and despair.

These characters are well fleshed out (some more than others) and the story and mystery is the main focus, which they did really well. Also the class trials are very engaging and satisfying when you piece together everything clue by clue. Tiny warning though, sometimes for someone like me with a bad short term memory things get very confusing while figuring out what clue fits a statement if it's not explicitly said in the clue's description so while most of the trial is fine, I do have some problems at times, but nowhere near enough to make me avoid or recommend avoiding the game.\n     One thing I would recommend if you're completely new to the series: don't google anything about it. It's spoilers galore and the fandom can drive you away as there are especially many diehard fans for this game. Not saying they're bad, but they can get a bit, how would you say it... passionate. Also the fans get a bad rap for being cringy. \nDon't care about the DR fan stereotypes, just play it for yourself and experience the story!", "timestamp_created": 1662024424, "timestamp_updated": 1662024424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121501981": {"recommendationid": "121501981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033683279", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1631, "last_played": 1670405882}, "language": "english", "review": "Beary-good", "timestamp_created": 1661909933, "timestamp_updated": 1661909933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121488756": {"recommendationid": "121488756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242521204", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 639, "last_played": 1662066333}, "language": "english", "review": "\"danganronpa: trigger happy havoc\" is, first and foremost, an among us-like game and is absolutely not afraid to wear its inspirations on its sleeve. how well it lives up to the experience and memory of the original is debatable, however. in my humble experience, having involuntarily played through the game's first class trial a few times already, i can confidently say that \"danganronpa_1\" is certainly a game.\n\nstarting off, the first thing players might notice is that the setting has been drastically changed from the vast expanse of outer space to an average-looking, non-assuming high school, curiously named after the pope. as such, the crewmembers have been appropriately adapted and the main cast is now instead mainly comprised of high schoolers. moreover, rather than distinguishing characters by their spacesuit colours, as was so core to the identity of the original among us, the developers have strolled down avant-garde avenue and decided instead to give each member of the cast a personality and unique design, as well as their own 'ultimate' talent, be it programming, baseball, or even ???. it's just a shame there's no ultimate imposter, but the possibility of dlc is there, if not just to appease the old generations who still cling on to pillars of the old world, but i digress. this alteration, as unexpected as it may be, is welcome and while the simplicity of the original is to be dearly missed, i'm certain that this new step is for the better. \n\ndespite the veering off of the setting, the main plotline, thankfully, gives much needed solace and anchors \"danganronpa the first\" to its roots; the plotline will be familiar to anyone who's played among us in the past two decades: stuck in a confined area with other people, you (as the player) must survive a deadly game and weed out the imposters. one notable consideration is that in this game, anyone can be an imposter. this newfound freedom of choice seems to mirror, quite accurately, the direction that our outside world is heading in, intentional or not, and may leave a select few players disgruntled. for the rest of the population, however? we will remain completely gruntled. in fact, i bet most will not even notice these parallels. \n\nand now we get to the gameplay. \"dragonromper, trigger happy\" is, at its core, a word-like game, but i can't read. \nas much as i cannot stand this lack of consideration towards unable-bodied players, especially in this current century, i will still give this game the benefit of the doubt and trust that the reading bits are interesting and grammatically correct. despite this oversight, the game manages to work in some other enthralling gameplay mechanics such as walking and even sprinting, archaic systems of movement as they may be.\n\napart from the difficult movement-based sections, there are the class trials, which is where the meat of the game lies. during these sequences, your job is to determine who is, for lack of better words, sussy. surprisingly, there is no text nor voice chat, and you must instead rely on specific prompts and clues collected from investigations prior to, for lack of better words, sus a classmate out. this area of the game is certainly a step backwards from the original and heavily constrains player agency. nevertheless, as disappointing as it is, i can understand the removal of such a vital feature in order to accommodate shy and socially inept players, who, for reasons unknown, seem to occupy a large portion of the gaming community nowadays.\n\ngood or something idk i never played hades", "timestamp_created": 1661887878, "timestamp_updated": 1661888669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121485176": {"recommendationid": "121485176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271000435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 1662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1662, "last_played": 1566752595}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun.", "timestamp_created": 1661883026, "timestamp_updated": 1661883026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121439078": {"recommendationid": "121439078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353583357", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 2066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1163, "last_played": 1663503970}, "language": "english", "review": "Has Celestia Ludenberg", "timestamp_created": 1661802537, "timestamp_updated": 1661802537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514767944812774658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121401281": {"recommendationid": "121401281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355412941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1608, "last_played": 1602565069}, "language": "english", "review": "This happened to my buddy Eric", "timestamp_created": 1661736551, "timestamp_updated": 1661736551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543866574764251709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121361125": {"recommendationid": "121361125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157119721", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2915, "last_played": 1660369736}, "language": "english", "review": "Great plot, great characters, and fluffy bear.

well-known fandom, the Danganronpa games are known for being wacky and very popular. Unlike many other detective games, Danganronpa tests the logic of the player through various mini games. As the first game in the series, it is important to see how it stands as a game on it's own. \n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\n\nDanganronpa is known for it's characters being very \"anime\" like. Many of the characters in Trigger Happy Havoc are extremely wacky compared to others. This is a downside in some ways as observant players will be able to predict which characters are most likely to make it to the end (which are usually the more tame characters). Despite this, it is extremely interesting to see how some of these characters connect to each other and seeing some of them develop. I wouldn't say there is a single character that I would consider useless as they all have their own individual strengths and weaknesses.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nDanganronpa is a game that is best experienced blind as there are many plot twists that would be ruined otherwise. It is also engaging to the player that they go into this fully blind as it makes it hard to predict who is alive, who is dead and who is \"The Blackened\"? Unfortunately, Danganronpa's fandom, has made it extremely hard to avoid spoilers. There are small examples but one big example of this stems from this game. I will not describe in detail this twist but it is part of the reason why going in blind to this game is good. 15 students are placed in a \"Killing Game\". It is up to the player to solve the overall nature of the \"Killing Game\" while also focusing on each murder case each chapter.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nDanganronpa's gameplay is unique in the sense that there are several parts to it. \n\nAs a visual novel, you will be reading A LOT of text. And most of it is not voice acted. Text is voiced usually in really important scenes or during the Class Trials. You also have free time events. Where you can become closer with your classmates and unlock skills for use in the Class Trials. Investigation are also a thing. It is important players fully engage during these investigations as it helps greatly. And then we come to the main part: Class Trials. \n\nDepending on the difficulty players choose for Logic and Action, it will greatly affect how hard these are and how much the player is left to connect the dots themselves. Personally, I recommend that players play on Mean difficulty for both Logic and Action as it greatly helps the experience and makes you feel like you are actively taking part in the Trial. \n\nYou will play mini games in these class trials. Some are straight forward: hit the contradiction. However some are a lot more wacky. The main example of this is a mini game where you must essentially play a rhythm game. If the idea of wacky mini games puts you off, I would suggest you stay away from this franchise as these are a core part of the games.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nOverall, I would say that Trigger Happy Havoc is a very good game and starting point for the Danganronpa franchise. If the idea of lots of unvoiced text and wacky mini games puts you off, you won't enjoy playing this game. However, if you are fans of the detective/mystery genre, i would highly suggest you pick this up. UK price is \u00a314.99, which is worth it. These games are often on sale as well so it is well worth the price. Don't let the fandom of this game put you off. Most, if not all, forms of media have terrible fandoms.\n\nRating: 9/10 (Really good game.

It made NO sense. also pseuso deep. I mean, I really really hoped and expected that there was more to it, but nah. Just blahblah, so cheesy it makes you wanna go vegan.\n\nAnyone who thinks it's actually \"good\" is either very young, has no intellectual standards at all and/or has objectively bad taste and probably also thought the last GOT season was well written. Sorry not sorry.\n\nI am so disappointed. I finished the game a few months ago and started this review with a relative good mood and got more bitter and mad the longer I thought about it. Although the pros in terms of quantity clearly outweigh the cons, all in all, the bad ending ruined EVERYTHING and while writing I started to remember the feeling of being fooled by this spawn of satan of an ending more and more and now I'm totally furious and cannot recommend this trainwreck of a sh1tsh0w at ALL!\n\nIt is, in a nutshell, a really bad and childish explanation that seems like a very lazy cop-out.\nAs pretentious and insolent this undeniably probably sounds, it felt more or less like an attack on my intelligence! \nHonestly, I don't think it could have sucked more, even if the MC suddenly woke up and it was all \"just a dream\" (aka the \"plot twist\" we all came up with in our first writing assignment in elementary school)\n\nI was soooo hyped throughout the whole game for the grand reveal and thorougly enjoyed it, because I thought, no, I was CONVICED this has to be such a cool explanation why the hell a certain little event should lead to basically [spoiler] the apocalypse[/spoiler], because otherwise this would be ridiculous, right?! WRONG! I mean, it IS ridiculous, but the great \"explanation\" was, it is, because it is and we, the authors, said so!!!\n\nPeople comparing this to Zero Escape are insane. In Zero Escape, which I LOVE, things actually also matter in the big picture. The plot is a very carefully crafted construct of a lot of different storylines that beautifully come together to birth an amazing symphony of a story. Things that are bad are ACTUALLY bad and actually make sense WHY they are bad and why they matter in such a grand scale of things and HOW they happened at all. (also explained very well, in great detail and always accentuated with real life science and facts.\n\nZero escape, story-wise, is something I would recommend to someone who doesn't think they'll like anime (which VN pretty much are, even with 3D) because they believe them to be childish and silly, because it will prove them otherwise.\n\nDanganronpa THH is something I would definitely NOT recommend, as it will provide them with the false assumption that they were correct about all the bad stereotypes there are about anime.\n\n[spoiler]Sorry, but a bunch of teenies being slaughtered at school definitely is NOT an event that will lead to the whole world collectively falling into \"despair\" (such a cheesy stupid statement once you realize there is nothing more behind it!!) and will be so devastating the world will be forever ruined. Something like that sure is a tragedy, but aside from the victim's next of kin, no one's life will be shattered forever and no one will probably even remember it happened in a few month's time, let alone people worldwide![/spoiler]\n\nA lot of way more horrible, vicious and argueably \"evil\" things have already happened in the REAL world, that didn't effect [spoiler]the whole world[/spoiler] even in the slightest! (If you need and example, just google Junko Furuta, a japanese teen that has been horribly tortured in the 80ies beyond imagination, but be warned it is seriously traumatizing, so trigger warning, definitely don't read if you are very sensitive)\n\nJust because something bad happened, thinking that [spoiler]it will effect all of the civilized world in a grand matter always, forever and beyond repair[/spoiler] is just so stupid, silly, delusional, gullible, wishful thinking stupid kid's shit!\n\n[spoiler]The ending with the sphinx and Eiffel Tower was so totally ridiculous...[/spoiler]\nIt's just that.. this pathetic ... LAME description of \"uhhh things were BAAAAAD\" like some kid who wants to scare their friends by telling a spooky campfire story but they don't know shit about anything because they're a damn kid so it's only ridiculous.\n\nWhoever is responsible for this horrible plot should be ashamed of themselfes. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same prodigy who thought the name \"The Sexy Brutale\" would be a marketing stroke of genius. (it's not, it's horrible, most people only stumbled over this great game because it was part of a bundle)\n\nwhat Danganronpa THH is:\n\n-hurtful to the whole image of animes \n-a huge lost chance of actually being a great story\n\nI cannot stress enough how completely and utterly mega-bad and... abysmal the ending is, nothing short of a mood overkill, as it full-blown wiped out all the good things I felt for this game before. Ruined. Destroyed. Annihilated. DOA. Mutilated beyond recognition. (because all the time spent on the story and hints which is a LOT were for fucking NOTHING)\n\n\nAssuming most of us are out of school, our time is scarce. We probably all have realized by now that we will die leaving behind an incomplete steam library. So much Netflix recommendations by friends that will go unfullfilled and void. SO much places we will not be able to make it to. Therefore, wasting valuable free lifetime on a story that turns out to be the clusterfuck of clusterfucks just feels like a crime and if I wasn't a huge introvert with internet balls I'd consider suing the writer. (just kidding. although I AM livid.)\n\nIf you find typos, you can keep 'em.", "timestamp_created": 1659897578, "timestamp_updated": 1660035496, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532076537609100342", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120229266": {"recommendationid": "120229266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317854634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5685, "last_played": 1680627275}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend this game, started playing January 2022.

It uses the fact that its anime to its advantage, so when things are going well they seem innocuous enough, and when they aren't you'll feel it. If you like the Ace Attorney games, Danganronpa has some crossover with that series in terms of gameplay and general flow, and even a sort of suspension-of-disbelief factor (it takes place in a \"real world\", but some real interesting stuff happens akin to channeling spirits in Ace Attorney, etc.). Anime or not, Danganronpa has a good way of building characters up and then knocking them down, whether you like it or not, and showing you what characters are truly made of and why they act the way that they do, even if they initially seem two-dimensional. The narrative however is interesting, and you'll probably grow attached to at least some of the characters, so it's worth it to play through to the end. The voice acting is also a nice touch. In terms of the series as a whole, Danganronpa 1 is a good game with some flaws and interesting nuances (for better or worse) that you should play if it interests you. Danganronpa 2, its sequel, is probably objectively better, but can only really be fully appreciated once you play Danganronpa 1, for both gameplay/writing and continuity/story.

This game is rated \"Overwhelmingly Positive\", but it is an objectively bad game. Don't get me wrong, the story is interesting. The gameplay on the other hand is bad. At times, terrible. Chalk it up to our friends the \"Japanese Culture Connoisseurs\" so prevalent on steam being less than objective.\n\nThis game was originally made for PSP in 2010 and the gameplay would have bad even on that system back then. Apparently, this was meant to be a visual novel, but the developers were concerned that VNs had declined in popularity in Japan at the time, so they opted to shoehorn in some actual gameplay. \n\nGiven that the story is pretty engaging, initially it's worth slogging through the clunky interface and poorly explained, not entertaining mechanics. However, the point I just got to in the game bombarded me with the worst of these mechanics in a section where you can't save your progress for almost 2 hours straight. It was exhausting. I'm likely not going to continue playing this game. I'll probably watch the Anime and be done with it.\n\nStill here? Okay, I'll elaborate briefly on the mechanics. It's mostly an extremely clunky point and click. Navigation is very tedious. It asks you if you're sure you want to move to a different room every time, then you have to wait for it to load, then you have to watch it be constructed which is supposed to be cool I guess. The trials are supposed to be the meat of the game, where you go through and piece together what happened. It starts off promisingly, seemingly reminiscent of Ace Attorney, but then goes off the rails. There's only ever a few options to interject and they become increasingly illogical. Then you have to kind of shoot the thing you want to argue against, but it's super annoying and not fun. Then you do some stupid rhythm game that isn't explained and doesn't work well and isn't fun. Then you do a sort of jigsaw puzzle.

I recently starting playing through it again with my friend, and she's loving it as well. I would highly recommend this game! I can't wait to play the rest of them.", "timestamp_created": 1659455972, "timestamp_updated": 1659455972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count":

I'm tired as I write this.\n\nThe game is really good. all the mysteries are, well, mysterious. all the twists are very unexpected, including who dies (with some exceptions). all the characters are well thought out, as are their free time events. the game is really funny and dramatic, with any breathing time loaded with character development! the class trial system is incredibly unique, and the murders are very interesting, if far-fetched sometimes.\n\nhowever, this game isn't without its flaws. the biggest one being, you can only really play it once. It's a murder mystery game; that's the whole thing about it. once you know the mysteries, and how to solve them, all that's left is dialogue and perfection. you can get the dialogue through the School Mode, and perfection will be really easy since you know the answers. speaking of easy...\n\nthe game was way too easy. I set myself to the hardest difficulty, and got A on every trial. and not because I'm smart -- I suck at stuff like this normally, -- the mysteries were just too... simple. the answer is either obvious, or takes little to no time to find. however, randomly, you're thrown a question that takes a really long time to decipher an answer from, or you really need to use trial and error -- a thing you're not supposed to do -- to find the answer. one of the hangman's gambit sections was entirely BS; I got lucky to find the answer. \n\nI do not like school mode. they tried to let you hang out with any of the characters at your leisure, with a resource-gathering game to keep you entertained, but they failed. As I said before, you can see their free time event scenes, but you can also take them \"on a trip\" i.e. a date, to one of six places in the school. at first, it's charming, but it quickly gets annoying, as these dates are incredibly short, consisting of one choice, a reaction from the person, and a cut to when it's done. there's a reward in the form of a \"secrets reveal\" from a character you do this to enough, at day 50. I don't care enough to do it. Originally, I intended to do this with Chihiro, but after maxing them out, I'd need to play the dumb mini-game another 35-some times, and I don't want to, because it's really boring!\noutside of that, interacting with the characters in school mode feels way more useless when we're not in peril. \"tragedy creates bonds\" and all that. when there's no tragedy, and I've already been through tragedy with them, it just deflated all emotion I had about the characters. If you wanted replay value for a murder mystery game, change up who dies, who kills, etc. \n\nDespite all my gripes with this game, the first playthrough was amazing, i gotta say. that's why I recommend this. Not for replay value, but for the once-in-a-lifetime experience that is this game, and its successors. that's why I rate this game a \"great\"\n\n8/10, but I cannot play it again\n\nPS i dont think I can play the second one properly since I watched the Game Grumps play it...\nPPS yes, this is the shortened version of my review", "timestamp_created": 1659324093, "timestamp_updated": 1659324093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119851609": {"recommendationid": "119851609", "author": {"steamid": "76561199018432273", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1222, "last_played": 1672088695}, "language": "english", "review": "Why is it moving", "timestamp_created": 1659309721, "timestamp_updated": 1659309721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119850786": {"recommendationid": "119850786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869482638", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 499, "last_played": 1669195019}, "language": "english", "review": "A murder-filled mystery game where the characters are prestigious high school students.

It is a game which sticks to the basics and excels in all departments of story, music and gameplay without having barren virtual worlds, ultra-realistic graphics or a story which only serves to move the main character from one explosion to another.\n\nThe story is intensely exciting and excels in keeping you at the edge of your seat at all times, even though you're just reading lines of text and watching the scene unfold before you The characters are so much fun to play with and their character arcs have such an incredible depth that makes the most realistic-looking characters from other games feel like cardboard cutouts. The setting of Hope's Peak Academy is a fantastic one and shows the creativity of the developers to weave a story around a place wherein every room, corridor or even a bathroom can hide a mystery, waiting for you to discover and unfold. \n\nThe gameplay is quite simple and does not try to get too intricate, where its brilliance lies in. A great example is how the game plays with the concept of rules, where you'll say \"oh, there are only 5-6 rules in the  Hope's Peak Academy Handbook, what could go wrong?\" and this game goes on to show how intricately those can be broken, which makes the detective aspects of the game all the more exciting as you search for clues that will leave you at the end thinking that \"dang, I didn't know they could do this!\" With regards to the soundtrack, every single track is an absolute enjoyment to hear. They never get boring despite being repeatedly used and some of the music used in the class trials is arguably the best. \n\nAll this being said, its a phenomenal experience that is a must-play.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1658057426, "timestamp_updated": 1658057539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118949071": {"recommendationid": "118949071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240634338", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1533, "last_played": 1658051133}, "language": "english", "review": "\u4ec0\u4e48\u8d85\u9ad8\u4e2d\u7ea7\u7684\u4f20\u706b", "timestamp_created": 1658051257, "timestamp_updated": 1658051257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118925462": {"recommendationid": "118925462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354078226", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1244, "last_played": 1657868990}, "language": "english", "review": "Every character is interesting until they just fucking die.

The first game, Trigger Happy Havoc, came out in 2010 on the PSP. What Spike Chunsoft didn't realize was that years later, Danganronpa would absolutely explode as a series. \n\nPlaying this game, its pretty easy to see why. It takes the killing game concept, and turns it on its head. Instead of an all out battle of strength, its more of a game of the mind. Where you must kill, but you can't be caught, and those who aren't dead or a killer must figure out who the killer is to save themselves. The game also radiates a style and energy unlike any visual novel of the time. Something as utterly unique as Danganronpa was bound to blow up at some point. Especially during the time. But unfortunately, the series fails to execute on the potential of the concept.\n\nBut that's for future games. Let's talk about Danganronpa 1, which was overall pretty fun. I don't see why the game is sitting at a 96%, I would personally give it around an 85%. But then again, the game is so unique and is also filled with eccentric and likable characters, so I can see why that would excuse many of the games shortcomings. \n\nLets start with unfettered positives. The game has a fantastic visual style from the get-go. The music is also great, and the voice acting is also fantastic. I also generally enjoyed the exploration aspect, going around Hope's Peak and such. \n\nNow for the story. After playing the other games, this one seems almost quaint by comparison, but I enjoyed it overall. Its well paced and has nice twists. Not much to complain about, but not much to praise either. \nThe gameplay is also decent. The system of truth bullets broken up by questions and minigames is a great system. \n\nIn terms of negatives, I really was disappointed by how simple this games logic is. Even on the hardest difficulty, its not hard to deduce what the game wants you to shoot when. \n\nBut overall, this is a great start to the series, lets hope the games evolve from here.\nIn the context of the greater series, I would only recommend this game to see what all the fuss is about, and just hold off on the rest. Don't trudge through the rest of the series like I did.", "timestamp_created": 1657872291, "timestamp_updated": 1657872640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118839762": {"recommendationid": "118839762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293251984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3124, "last_played": 1662259212}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is fundamentally flawed. it is very fun", "timestamp_created": 1657869643, "timestamp_updated": 1657869643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118822797": {"recommendationid": "118822797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206017141", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 3352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3352, "last_played": 1657805250}, "language": "english", "review": "#FREECELESTIALUDENBERG", "timestamp_created": 1657837439, "timestamp_updated": 1657837439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118812323": {"recommendationid": "118812323", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123851617", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6660, "last_played": 1697979253}, "language": "english", "review": "#yass", "timestamp_created": 1657822761, "timestamp_updated": 1657822761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118792656": {"recommendationid": "118792656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412313164", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1355, "last_played": 1613362577}, "language": "english", "review": "why spikechunsoft insists on releasing 4 titles of garbage after producing zero escape is beyond me", "timestamp_created": 1657793813, "timestamp_updated": 1657793813, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118760735": {"recommendationid": "118760735", "author": {"steamid": "76561199151385738", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1757, "last_played": 1651893688}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun detective visual novel.

Chihiro had me in tears and Mondo's death and how Taka tries to defend him is heartbreaking. Also Genocide Jack is revealed which finally makes Toko really interesting.\nChapter 3 is a double murder, but I personally was not very attached to Hifumi or Taka. Celeste's execution is done really well, but it's probably my least favorite chapter.\nChapter 4 is the only suicide in the game and the relationship between Aoi and Sakura is the most amazing thing and this is easily the chapter you will cry the most. RIP Sakura :(\nChapter 5 is pretty boring, but there are some cool plot twists. The trial is easily the most nonsensical and boring trial, but the plot twists save it.\nChapter 6 is where the game's mysteries are solved.

where the only way out is to get away with murder, this makes for a very interesting game indeed.\n\nThe dialogue is top notch for a visual novel.  The US voice acting is very good and I really enjoy the expressions of emotions from each character.  You really get a sense of what each student's personality is like over the passing of in game days, even if some of them come off a bit stereotypical  \n\nWhat makes this game fun is a few factors.  Firstly, it's the paced story telling and the gravitation that a gamer will have towards the various characters.  Second is the investigation aspect.  When things go down and you have to get your facts in order, it's really fun to use your deductive skills in order to play out what is going on before you get to the last fun factor: the class trials.  This is where some people might compare it to games like Phoenix Wright but to me it's way different, as the spoken dialogue and collective reasoning between all the students to find the culprit is astounding.  They also have some nifty ways to mix up the questioning and accusations by having you do mini games.  \n\nThere's a very lite relationship system in place, there's exploration, there are mini-games after the end game and this game can/should be played through multiple times!  \n\nThis is one of my games that is in my top 25 games for sure!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1657122634, "timestamp_updated": 1657122634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118322465": {"recommendationid": "118322465", "author": {"steamid": "76561199245240490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 595, "last_played": 1686515556}, "language": "english", "review": "not bad, i really like visual novels and this didn't failed to impress me :D", "timestamp_created": 1657113455, "timestamp_updated": 1657113455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118304292": {"recommendationid": "118304292", "author": {"steamid": "76561199173223057", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3445, "last_played": 1691399800}, "language": "english", "review": "mid 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1657084979, "timestamp_updated": 1657084979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118295592": {"recommendationid": "118295592", "author": {"steamid": "76561199110732953", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1698, "last_played": 1657572630}, "language": "english", "review": "Monokuma is  a funny bear", "timestamp_created": 1657071928, "timestamp_updated": 1657071928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118286420": {"recommendationid": "118286420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198964287151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1122, "last_played": 1657401947}, "language": "english", "review": "it cool", "timestamp_created": 1657058650, "timestamp_updated": 1657058650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118285019": {"recommendationid": "118285019", "author": {"steamid": "76561199308082337", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2810, "last_played": 1657054949}, "language": "english", "review": "The storyline is very well thought out and i like the aspects of the linear stoyline.

came to p.c they are good for the time. my overall thoughts on each case/trial of danganronpas thh goes as follows.\ntrial 5: my opinion to short as a full trial but it isn't to bad just weak on my end\ntrial 3: everyone hates the double murder in every game and honestly same could be applied here for all the other games but this is the better of the double case murders and in my opinion doe it best\ntrial 6: a much better trial 5 and I kind of am a sucker for the final cases in each game and this one is to me a good trial and some people may hate this but, the ending and Junko can be, to me a good part in the trial also this trial leads to the ending of the game so there.\ntrial 4: Sakura was and may still be a fan favorite character I am on that train as well also the idea of it being suicide and not a murder is neat and sadly isn't seen much else in the other games to my knowledge but with sakura it  hits different being a character that was in my opinion a very good asset to the team of remaining survivors.\ntrial 1: honestly not that bad for an introduction to the games with being the first death a player would encounter being Sayaka but also the way the case is handled teaching you everything you are to do in the upcoming trials but also that with leon killing sayaka because she was going to kill the player is interesting plus Leons execution is brutal that being hit with baseballs may hurt at first but repeatedly hit is bound to kill someone.\ntrial 2: best trial in my opinion and the best culprit in the game, mondo being the killer of chihiro is really good as this chapter revolves around strength both mental and physical mondo killing chihiro  because he thinks mondo is weak (if you are reading this then here's a probably spoiler being chihiro is a guy) mondo showing remorse after killing chihiro and putting his body in the girls locker room to keep his secret is really good I am not going to dwell on this trial any longer as it be best if you were to experience this trial for yourself.\nAnd yeah that is my ranking on the original dangaronpa trial worst to best and honestly out of 6 trials only 2 I really hate or find weak and if best comes to show then I hope to see you after I finish danganronpa 2 and 3  and give you my ranking on each trial in said game. have a good time and see you next time bye\n", "timestamp_created": 1657051964,

If you're curious about Danganronpa but on the fence like I was, pick this up during a sale, play it, and if you enjoy it buy the other two.\n\nI was hesitant to start this game because the cardboard cutout art style for the characters really annoyed the crap out of me, but I picked it up for 8 bucks during a sale and liked it a LOT more than I expected to.\nUnfortunately, Danganronpa has some very...sketchy? design choices that really prevent it from rising to greatness. The class trial segments of the game can be equal parts entirely too simple and infuriatingly confusing. It has the same problem that the Ace Attorney series occasionally has, where from the beginning you're told to look for contradictions in the testimony and refute them with evidence, but then the game will present you with statements that don't actually contradict your evidence, and you're supposed to match the evidence with the statement. It feels very backwards to me.\n\nWhen I say \"too simple,\" I mean that the game intentionally narrows down your options into only a few, or sometimes just 1 correct piece of evidence. Before each testimony the game shows you a selection of evidence that it's picked for you to use, and I think that this really hurts those \"ah-ha!\" moments you get by analyzing all your collected evidence for yourself. You collect a LOT of evidence in this game, and I was pretty disappointed to find out that a majority of it is barely presented in the trial segments. In some cases you'll even just ignore your evidence in favor of using statements to contradict other statements (which, to be fair, is a good idea and a mechanic I enjoyed.) The onslaught of evidence collected during investigation segments led me to believe the trials would be long, complicated, and with plenty of twists, but the game limiting your evidence and not forcing you to really get familiar with all of your clues, combined with the trials being over before you even realize it, dampen the satisfaction of solving each mystery.\n\nThe trial segments also feature multiple minigames that you must play in order to proceed. To be frank, these minigames do not in any way, shape or form enhance the feeling of pointing out a contradiction, and in some cases it just feels straight up childish. I kid you not, one of these minigames is literally playing hangman. I can't help but feel that if they had focused more on just the evidence v. testimony aspect of the trials, and gotten rid of the silly minigames, it would've been a lot more satisfying.\n\nAt the same time, those things I disliked about Danganronpa are what give it charm and personality, at the very least, it's different. What I can't excuse is the typical anime stuff thrown in, you've got a schoolgirl calling a character that abuses her \"master,\" you've got cringeworthy talk about boobs in the middle of tense discussion,and you have an otaku \"gamer\" character that calls himself a pig and says they'll do anything to please their \"mistress.\" All of that is to say, I hoped for less anime nonsense, but it doesn't detract much from the overall experience.\n\nThe story is pretty gripping, and did manage to hold my attention the entire way through, the twists near the end and the final trial really tie it up in a satisfying way. The element that 100% saves this game for me though, is the music. Holy shit. Nearly every track is an absolute banger, but the only problem is the pacing of it. In a matter of seconds you could change songs 3 or so times, and it can get incredibly jarring.

One of my best friends was supposed to attend as a bridesmaid but she skipped last minute because of an emergency. To be honest I was mad she skipped because the emergency happened almost a week ago so she had time to figure things out and attend.\n\nSo what happened was that her fianc\u00e9 got a car accident and was hospitalised. He was hospitalised for 5 days and on Friday he got discharged to go home. My friend had told me from the moment he got into the accident that she'll skip the wedding just to be sure and I told her we'll see. So when I saw that he got discharged on Friday I expected my friend to show up at the wedding after all since his situation is not as dangerous right now and I texted her but she said that she'll not be able to make it.\n\nShe kept saying how he's still not well and being discharged doesn't mean he can stay alone without care for many hours and since my wedding day would start at 9am on Saturday with the prepepartions etc, the ceremony would be at 7pm on Saturday evening and the reception/party would last until Sunday morning hours she couldn't be away from home for that long and she said she could compromise if she could only attend the ceremony.\n\nI said I don't want her there just for the ceremony and she's a bridesmaid and supposed to be by my side the entire time. I also said that she should find him some care for the day so she can freely attend the wedding and I suggested inviting either her parents or a friend to stay with him for that day (his parents live far away). She said its not the same and she won't feel right being away for the entire day.\n\nI got pretty upset because she seemed to totally disregard my wedding after so long making preparations and while I understand its her fianc\u00e9, I was mad she didn't find a compromise to attend. She claims her compromise would be to just attend the ceremony and then go home again but she's a bridesmaid. If she's not there for the full experience it would be pointless.\n\nShe said I'm an AH for making her feel guilty about caring for her hurt fianc\u00e9 and she said that his situation takes priority over my wedding. She said she's not sorry for prioritising her SO's health over me at this point and if I was a good friend I'd understand instead of guilt tripping her and that I better not complain if I'm ever in a difficult situation and I need my husband's help and support and he chooses to attend someone's wedding over caring for his wife.

The art and music do a splendid job of tying it all together. \n\nIf you enjoy mystery or detective games, or are just interested this is an easy recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1656263026, "timestamp_updated": 1656263026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117661070": {"recommendationid": "117661070", "author": {"steamid": "76561199274394815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1665896219}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta bueno, en mi caso me entretenio en todo momento", "timestamp_created": 1656257926, "timestamp_updated": 1656257926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117650146": {"recommendationid": "117650146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880497900", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1524, "last_played": 1655895188}, "language": "english", "review": "Monokuma is a better judge then the supreme court", "timestamp_created": 1656247046, "timestamp_updated": 1656247046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117633978": {"recommendationid": "117633978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153840678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6166, "last_played": 1655867471}, "language": "english", "review": "11037/10 great game", "timestamp_created": 1656226927, "timestamp_updated": 1656226927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117630288": {"recommendationid": "117630288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076483317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1662263377}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has \"unique\" written all over it. \n\nThe style, the gameplay, the story... Everything in it has its own personality.

The rhythm game alone is definitely interesting, to say the least. If you don't want to play a mystery game like this with so many odd mechanics, I would highly suggest the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney trilogy that is also on Steam.
