But looking back in a time when subgenre stands firm again, while followups aged like finest of wines, original Returns really meanders.\n\nBasic lowdown - in game's setting, starting 1980s some divergences led to way more corporate future, and in 2012 magic awakened as per Mayan calendar, leading to elf and dwarf kids being born to regular humans, and spellcasting being quickly rediscovered as a potent and useful force on par with engineering and medicine. Going trough ecological catastrophes, wars, state dissolutions and corporate conflict world steadily turns into eclectic and unusual mix of trite on their own cyberpunk and fantasy concepts. There's megacorps run by instinctively greedy dragons, street samurais are either cyborgs or chi-channeling martial artists, and evil spirits are as credible of a threat as street gangs. The gameplay meanwhile, is a mix of tactical ability and weapon attack-focused turn based combat and dialogue conversations, with skills unlocking new dialogue choices and interactions outside combat, plus new cool combat moves. There's some neat ideas borrowed from original tabletop rpg, like charisma allowing you to learn how to talk with particular groups like academicians, law enforcement, street folk or criminals, more easily getting their vibes and earning their trust, and your choices which to pick are freeform once you unlock a new one. The art style is really neat too, a mix of low-poly 3D and painterly isometric art.\n\nNow where this doesn't age well is both the story, which while nice and a good introduction to setting just fails to bloom into something truly memorable, and then general gameplay variety just lacking comparing to what came later on with Dragonfall and Hong Kong. Balance or lack of variety for some freeform \"classes\" really can make gameplay feel like a slog at certain points, balance isn't as smooth so certain parts are too easy and others too tough, and in general the drive to push the plot isn't as strong despite having the same approach to raising the stakes from dealing with personal problems to saving the world or a multi-million popular metropolis as followups. While the followup expandalones I couldn't put down, this one I abandoned without completing - and that was before the CRPG revival got into high gear!\n\nIt goes cheap on the sales, but if you take the full trilogy and find this one uninteresting just move on to Dragonfall instead of assuming the entire series is same level of meh.

[/h1]\n\nShadowrun Returns is a remake of a famous very old Shadowrun game, more than that, Shadowrun includes other stories that you can play (by downloading them from the Mod Workshop), which means that you get great value from this simple-looking gem.\n\nShadowrun Returns is originally a CRPG, Tactical game where you play as... Yourself, a shadowrunner; individuals who take on jobs and heists that nets them a great deal of bank balance. After a job that went awry, one of your friends ends up dying! Upon answering a com in your appartement, you discover that the dead man has left you a voice mail, asking you to investigate his pending demise (the guy knew he was going to die, hence why the campaign is called The Dead Man's Switch). Quest after quest, you'll discover that the plot goes deeper than a simple shadow run gone wrong.\n\nAs in any other Shadowrun (or CRPG) game, you can be one of many classes; Decker, Shaman, Mage... Of course, being the promised prince that I am, I chose to go with Shaman, a mage that relies heavily on Charisma to be able to control outerworld demonic entities that you can summon from... trashcans lmfao! Welcome to Shadowrun, I guess. I've only played three classes in these games and they work great, you'll have no issues putting those Karma points into attributes you find would be useful. Visuals are average, very I might add, and here we pray that the devs could transcend Shadowrun finally to stand toe to toe against Next-Gen CRPGs like Pillars of Eternity.\n\nShadowrun Returns is a [b]7/10[/b], the only few things lacking are great visuals and an online multiplayer. Oh and did I mention that you could play as Cyberpunk Elves? That's right, Elves with visors and cybernetic augments... You should buy this game just for that!", "timestamp_created": 1693728572, "timestamp_updated": 1693728572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614941298961639404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145566881": {"recommendationid": "145566881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094453085", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1700, "last_played": 1693712898}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never played the tabletop RPG of this game, but the sci-fi with fantasy genre has piqued my interest.

It ran very well. Played as a female Elf, proficient with decking and rifle.\n\nIt was mostly what I expected, although it did surprise me in a good way with the quality of written dialogues; text boxes before missions during a loading screen almost felt like something taken out of the paper RPG with very detailed descriptions of a predicament your main character is currently in and his/her surroundings - it really helped in making the world just a tad more believable.\n\nThe whole setting is what drawn me to Returns and I wasn't disappointed in that respect, although I would have liked the city and its regions to be a bit more open, with more optional stuff to do - so I could actually feel like I am the runner who's pulling the strings here, making my own choices, rather than being pulled by developers to finish the main quest only, by completing a sequence of linear missions and locations.\n\nI've enjoyed the combat, it was balanced well, but not particularly deep or difficult; and very much enjoyed upgrading my character - there are no boundaries here after you pick your class and race which is fantastic (although a few limitations may occur). It is an approach that I wish more RPG games would implement, where you're not really limited by your chosen race/class, and you can still become whatever you want if you invest an x amount of points in y profession.\n\nStory wise it was pretty good and fun to follow how the events unfolded in the main campaign - it's the ending that sort of spoiled it for me to be honest, it'd be interesting to see how probable would be this scenario within the realm of the original table top RPG - because here, it almost felt out of place and it really brought down the overall feeling of a pretty solid game for me... at one point I just couldn't believe what was going on, it was such a drastic shift in the narrative.\n\nIt is a solid experience, took me about 19hrs or so in total. However I would recommend it to others only with the above caveats taken into consideration. I also bought Dragonfall which I believe is the second entry in Harebrained Schemes' Shadowrun Trilogy & from what I've been hearing so far it improves on Returns in almost every possible way, so I am quite thrilled about playing it later this year.", "timestamp_created": 1692996254, "timestamp_updated": 1692996254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145009310": {"recommendationid": "145009310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037605134", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1333, "last_played": 1693685774}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1692992581, "timestamp_updated": 1692992581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483189046382904053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144962369": {"recommendationid": "144962369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069485786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1213, "last_played": 1692936785}, "language": "english", "review": "It's was ok to be honest the stories was to short.", "timestamp_created": 1692937285, "timestamp_updated": 1692937285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507009804248809814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144906960": {"recommendationid": "144906960", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970527647", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1565939023}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish one could use a controller to play this", "timestamp_created": 1692867271, "timestamp_updated": 1692867271, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45899471640586853", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144831020": {"recommendationid": "144831020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025567381", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 666, "last_played": 1692755857}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool little game!

And it's also 10 years old already.\nSo there's not much to expect graphics wise.\nThe graphics are not terrible though. It's on par with many indie games release in 2023.\nThe one difference I found is that despite the view being isometric (which is common in RPG games), in this game you can only zoom in/out, but don't have an ability to change the camera angle (which has become the standard in modern game engines).\nAlso, there is almost no cutscenes and no voiceover. Everything is told via text.\n\n\nCONTROLS\nThere are 2 very important concepts in Application development (any application, be it a game or a social network)\nUI - meaning User Interface. How the screen looks like, how the buttons and menus look like. The graphics.\nAnd UX - meaning User Experience. How the application behaves. What happens when you click a button. How easy it is to find the things you want to perform. How intuitive the app is. How easy it is to perform common operations.\nWhile the UI here is not the best, as I mentioned, it's comparable to modern Indie games.\nThe UX, on the other hand, feels very very dated. Even for a 2013 game IMO.\nBuying, selling or swapping weapons is not very intuitive. And the game menus are not very well thought out.\nFor example, it takes roughly 6 clicks between different menus to switch a weapon or an item in your inventory.\nAnd it can only be done in your stash, or while talking to a vendor (any vendor in the game). But not anywhere else.\nAlso, your item list is not very well organized. \nSometimes you have a huge list of all the items. Sometimes there are filters by item types. There is uniformity.\n\n\nRPG\nThe RPG elements of this game, are a mixed lot.\nOn the one hand, any specific magical / weapon / armor path you choose to progress on, has very little progression.\nYou will only be able to get 3/4 progressively better item times for the entirety of the game.\nOn the other hand, there is a really decent variety of different tech/magical paths to choose from.\nThere are 4 ranged weapon paths, 1 melee weapons path, 1 thrown weapons path, 1 battle droids path\nAround 4 different magical spell paths\nPhysical body augmentation path\nAnd a \"hacking\" path\nAnd most of the things can be combined together, so you can both have cool weapon, a battle droid and summon a magical being, all in a single battle. (The only exception being physical body augmentation, which affect your magical abilities).\nThe skill upgrade points (they're called Karma points) are plentiful, you get them quite often - and can easily progress on any path you'd like (Although maxing out any path would be difficult, as they obviously need more and more points for high levels)\n\nThe good thing about this, is even though I'm entering this whole new world of D&D-style game. It doesn't feel overbearing. There are not dozens of classes and magical paths to choose from. There is no need to restart the game 3 times to create a decent character.\nEverything is pretty clear and straightforward once you start the character creation.\nAnd it's pretty easy to change the character focus on pretty much anything you like.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is pretty decent.\nExcept for the end game, which I found to be super hard (even on easy difficulty).\nAnd required me multiple game re-loads to finish.\n\n\nBATTLES\nThe battles are done in turn-based RPG style.\nMany weapons have multiple fire-mode types, which increase with higher level of weapon proficiency (i.e. spending skill points).\nAnd hit percentages on every shot.\nThere are also items that give you partial or full cover (in the tradition of X-COM games).\nThrowing grenades also have percentage chances, which define how close to it's target point the grenade will land.\n\nAn additional form of battles you have, and hacking/virtual battles.\nWhich are even more simplistic than regular battles.\nAnd have less variety of weapons and attack types.\n\n\nPLOT / STORY / WHY YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY PLAY THIS GAME\nAt this point you must be wondering what's wrong with me...\nI've basically described a game which is mediocre at best. And it's 10 years old to boot.\nSo why would I play this game? For over 20 hours? And even claim you \"100% need to play it\" ???\nWell the game plot/story is why.\n\nThe story is simply superb.\nFrom the beginning of the game, to the very end, you're gripped by the mystery, trying to understand who should you trust, who's out to get you, and who is the real killer ???\nI'm coming to this game in the heels of playing The Outer Worlds (https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014150309/recommended/578650/), which had everything this game doesn't.\nAmazing graphics. Amazing interfaces. Amazing weapon customizability and progression. But lacked the one thing this game does amazingly well - the plot/story.\nThe story is mainly told by text.\nBoth via dialog, and small remarks about how the characters look, act and feel.\nIt basically feels like a very very good Sci-Fi/Fantasy book, told via the medium of computer games (with some Turn-based battle scenes sprinkled in).\nNot just that the plot of the game is good. It's the writing.\nThe game is very very well written. From the plot, to the dialogs, to the small easter eggs or humor you see here and there.\n\nThere is not much in the sense of side-quests in the game.\nThere are a few, and they add some flavor, but very very little compared to modern RPG games (that have much more side-quests than the main quest).\nHowever even the small side-quests and dialogs there are, make the world feel very much alive and vibrant.", "timestamp_created": 1690013320, "timestamp_updated": 1690013551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662505865097045898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142530358": {"recommendationid": "142530358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100643498", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1812, "last_played": 1690022963}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely captures the spirit of the P&P RPG.\n", "timestamp_created": 1689952537, "timestamp_updated": 1689952537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142427444": {"recommendationid": "142427444", "author": {"steamid": "76561199427487571", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1368, "last_played": 1680666442}, "language": "english", "review": "This was great... a lot of people criticized the linearity, and it's true that it is pretty linear, but I still found it to be a lot of fun.

I have been a fan of the Shadowrun IP for many years.  When I heard that it was going to be resurrected in the form of a PC game after being a fan of the Sega Genesis Shadowrun game, I was super-excited.\nMany years later, I've attempted to enjoy Shadowrun Returns on multiple occasions, and I haven't been successful.\nIt puts me to sleep.\nIf you favor story-driven games that require a lot of reading (and I've done my fair share of reading, mind you; I am old-school to the point of having gamed for many years before voice acting in games was even technically possible) and aren't heavy on gameplay, then maybe Shadowrun Returns is a game for you. \n\nIt's not for me; I really wish it were, but after my fourth uninstall without getting more than a couple hours in, I can honestly say it's just not.\n\nObjectively speaking, I give it a thumbs-down not only because it's not for me, but because when you stack it up against other RPGs with tactical combat that have come out before and since Shadowrun Returns's release, it simply doesn't hold a candle and is fairly boring.  Tactical consideration during combat don't go far beyond \"well, I specced my guy as a melee dude, so...  I guess I'll get close and pummel the enemy while my caster people stay in the rear and cast spells.\"  At least in the main campaign that is supplied with the base Shadowrun Returns game (I can't speak for modded campaigns), exploration outside of combat is fairly tedious; it isn't always clear what's expected of you, and there isn't much offered in the way of venturing outside of the \"beaten path\" as it were.  \n\nOne positive that I can offer is that the game does adhere to the lore and world of Shadowrun and does portray them very well.  The artwork of the city streets is nice and colorful and manages to be dark and gritty without being overly grim.  But I just couldn't fight off drowsiness long enough to see the story through.  I should disclose that I haven't been much of a video game story person for a while now (probably since..... Dragon Age Origins and Star Wars: The Old Republic, though I thought Ni No Kuni was pretty cool), but if the gameplay were fun enough, that shouldn't be a problem anyway.\n\nI dunno; it's not that my expectations were super high, and I believe I'm being fairly objective when I say that this just isn't that good a game.  It hasn't aged well, it never really got me very excited to begin with, and I'm done with trying to like it.

No game is entirely bug free, but I didn't notice any in my playthrough.\n\nBut it does have some extremely annoying mechanics that would've dropped its rating down from 4 to 5 stars to probably 3 stars.  (I really do not like this horrible \"all or nothing\"  review system Steam has.  Having this binary thumbs up/thumbs down system doesn't allow any nuance - there can't be any \"in between.\"  You either like the game 100% or dislike it 100%.  And that's a big reason why I very rarely write reviews).\n\nThe first highly annoying mechanic is how Heal spells work.  If you play a mage or bring one with you, then you might as well dump your Heal spells roughly halfway through the game.  Here's why.\n\nThe stupid Heal spell will only heal the damage you took from the last attack that damaged you.  I guess the game just HAD to be different - and couldn't just have Heal spells heal a base amount of damage modified by the level of Heal spell, your Spellcasting skill and your Willpower skill.  Simple as that.  Although I guess the level of spell won't matter since I never found a Level II or higher Healing spell.  I guess that was for the best considering how crappy they are. \n\nThis kind of mechanic is especially frustrating since the AI likes to attack YOU - the player.  Thus your character will often be shot at and cast upon multiple times.  So if you lose 30 health from the first attack and 5 points from a weak pistol shot immmediately thereafter - the Heal spell will only give you back 5 points.  Yeah.  5.  That's it.  Stupid, right?\n\nIt gets worse.  Because damage taken from a friggin'  DOT counts as an attack even if you weren't actually attacked or hit by anything.   And there will come a point when everything is trying to DOT you.  The game is trying to chew through your resources so you have nothing left for the final battle.  And it works.   Thus, when you have some annoying DOT sucking away your health, you have no way to cure it.  So if you think that you can just throw a Heal on yourself when some crappy DOT eats your health down to 10 health - forget it.  The Heal spell will only give you back the damage the DOT took, which is usually a lousy 2 or 3 points of health.  I HATE this mechanic.\n\nIt also has a somewhat annoying - omniscient AI that always knows exactly what tile to stand in to avoid getting hit.  AI units don't just run behind a crate and hope for the best - like a real person.  I've seen AI units literally run to stand in an open tile - because LOS was blocked for all of my units.  No one could know to do that - but it does.  That's annoying, but not game-breaking.  I can live with it.\n\nThe worst bit with omniscience, however, is when even melee AI units will run past 2 or 3 of my guys to attack me.  The AI just loves to attack your character - because it knows that it doesn't have to defeat your whole team to win.  It just has to defeat you.  And I think that's a lousy superpower for the enemy to have.  It's very much metagaming here and I don't like it at all.  This kind of AI coding harkens back to the earliest days of PC gaming - because the computer always knew that your character was the \"weakest link.\"  Kill it, and the game ends - the AI wins.  Doesn't matter if I have 10,000 runners there with me.  Kill me and that's it.

I spent good amount of time during combat just funneling them into our overwatch cone of visions and just demolished these guys.\n\nI played as a soldier/hacker a la Motoko Kusanagi, and the game allows me to be as badass as her, although I only specialized in one type of weapon.\n\nRoleplaying-wise, it's very specialized. \"Multiclassing\" is not optimal in this case. \nIf you're a beginner, you should focused on playing an archetype first. Once you know how the game works, then that's when you can mix it up a little bit. There's even an option to customize your own archetype.\nThe character creator is good enough. Healthy amount of race types to play as. \nVisually, the character customization is fairly limited, which is fine.  \nThe skill checks are fun. Investing in stats is mostly useful.\nOh, you'll meet some fun characters along the way. They're good, not great.\n\n\nAny hard negatives?\n\nNo voice acting. This is more of my problem, having an attention span of a cat. \n\nSince no voice acting, a lot of reading. If this turns you off, I can empathize. \nBut to be fair, the prose is not exactly great, like it's okay. Spelling mistakes here and there. Unintentional, I reckon. And the way they present the texts are very intimidating length-wise. Hard to digest them sometimes.\n\nThe pseudo-Japanese 'omae' slang. It's not bad, it's just funny. \n\nThe game is good for what it is.\nReally enjoyed my time as a fantacyberpunk.\nA solid first game for the trilogy. Could've been better, and it'll get better later.\nFairly cheap as well these days.\nAlso, Coyote's a beast, man.", "timestamp_created": 1685001991, "timestamp_updated": 1695565219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138927920": {"recommendationid": "138927920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067271332", "num_games_owned": 1613, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1683569114}, "language": "english", "review": "Sadly, I just found this one a bit boring in terms of story and gameplay.

If you want full control over creating your character, it's better not to pick one.\n\nEtiquettes aren't particularly useful in the Dead Man's Switch base campaign, but Academic will net you a decent chunk of cash early on while Shadowrunner and Corporate will come up the most often.\n\nDon't ignore skill bonuses given by outfits. For example a Rigger will gain access to the incredibly powerful +2 AP bonus for drones at Drone Combat 9 which can be reduced to 8 by wearing an outfit increasing the skill by 1. Due to the way the skill system works, this single point is worth a whopping 27 Karma.\n\nConjured spirits have a chance to go berserk at the end of each turn, so it's best to keep them away from your party and close to the enemy to make sure the spirit goes after them first should you get unlucky.\n\nAction Points are the most valuable resource in combat, so boosting your AP with things like the Haste spell while reducing the enemies' AP with things like concussion grenades can give a large edge in combat.\n\nRanged Combat 3 (or Melee Combat 3) opens up your third weapon slot. This is especially useful for Rigger/Deckers who need three slots for a cyberdeck and two drones.\n\nWhile specialization is generally recommended, lightly dipping into other skills is cheap and often effective. A Shaman can expand their options by getting some Mage spells for example.\n\nCyberware hugely hinders a character's magical abilities. A physical class equipped with cyberware can consider some light investment in magic in order to gain access to simple buffs or magical healing, but on the opposite end pure spellcasters should avoid cyberware entirely.\n\nUnlike all other weapons in the game, sniper rifles get less accurate the closer you are to the enemy.\nThe highest-end guns in the game all utilize a Smartlink. When choosing cyberware, make sure you have a datajack if you want to take advantage of this.\n\nGood Indie game, cyberpunk theme.

Lovely! \n \n[b]\u2764\ufe0f\ufe0f Pros \u2764\ufe0f\ufe0f[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The game is based on the already established Shadowrun universe. Because of that, there is a lot of lore in place already allowing for great depth and detail in the world that you play in. \n[*]The story is good, albeit a little bit predictable. Even though you know what is coming, it is interesting enough to see how everything unfolds. \n[*]Graphics are okay - together with the music they really set the tone to create a cyberpunk-like ambience, but no amazing graphics card needed here. \n[*]Gameplay is alright - don't expect huge depth here, but it feels like an \"XCOM Lite\". There's cover and RNG when it comes to hitting your target, but it doesn't go much deeper than that. Enemy AI isn't that smart, generally they run up to you and attack.  \n[*]There are uniquely named classes, such as the \"Street Samurai\" and the \"Decker\" which brings a little diversity to the standard Warrior/Mage/Thief standards.\n[/list]\n\n[b]\u274c Cons \u274c[/b]\n[list]\n[*]There is no spoken dialogue. For a game that's very dialogue-heavy (basically, outside of combat you are talking) this felt like a missed opportunity. The game was funded through a (very successful) kickstarter campaign and that might have made it harder to find good voice actors, but that doesn't make it less boring. \n[*]The game is linear. There are optional quests but they are nothing more than a single-map side quest, to then continue down the line that the main quest has laid out for you. Nothing you choose at the start of the game (race/gender/class) affects what you'll end up seeing, besides some dialogue changes. There is an illusion of choice, but no matter how good or evil you are, you always end up going down the same path. \n[*]It's not a very long game. I heard that the other games in the trilogy were longer, but don't expect this game to take more than 20 hours.\n\n[/list]\n\n[b]Final thoughts[/b]\nShadowrun Returns is a good (re)introduction to the Shadowrun universe. While it's not an outstanding game, I'd recommend playing it for the cool lore. Definitely consider getting it on a sale. \n\nWas this review useful to you?

I suppose, in 2013, it might've been great; but given how we've had so many phenomenal RPGs since 2013, Shadowrun Returns does fail to hold up a tad. The visual are- admittedly, still good; though the character models are a bit jank. The combat is very simplistic; it's just the standard \"use cover, then shoot at the enemy as often as you can\", and occasionally casting spells. Nothing particularly outstanding- it's acceptable, really. Consider this a /tentative/ recommendation. If you want a short RPG that isn't a 50-hour grinder, you can certainly still find better short RPGs, but this isn't necessarily something to completely skip over either.\n\nMy biggest complaint; though, is that some of the builds are woefully... Underserved? Like, Decking for example, it's basically the \"hacker\" build; where you get transported into a neat little cyberspace area and fight intrusion countermeasures and other hackers to gain access to security systems, system logs, unlocking doors; etc.\n\nThe problem is, decking really only gets seriously used in 2~ missions; making it an INCREDIBLY expensive investment; and for those two missions, you'll usually be given a high-quality decker for cheap/free. It... Does feel a bit scuffed in that regard. Decking also usually isn't very \"interactive\" with the environment? For example, in one mission- there actually ARE turrets you can hack- and it's the only mission. All other decking interactiveness is usually just \"unlocks door leading to exit\" or \"unlocks the exit itself\", occasionally you'll get some lore scraps through it- and there ARE a few decking checks throughout the game that aren't actual hacking and just dialogue options; but they're so few and far between; and so lacking in serious use that it really does suck.\n\nRiggers, on the other hand- are drone users, and they are served a LOT. Most missions, especially later on; you'll find TONS of shafts that only the Rigger drones can access- and Riggers are also HILARIOUSLY powerful; especially as you level up even higher. To the point where you can dish out over 160 damage per turn, which- is enough to kill literally everything EXCEPT the final boss in a single turn. Most other classes generally don't compare in sheer damage output.\n\nOther archetypes/classes exist; and they're all somewhat middling.\n\nLeveling!\n\nYou'll only gain enough \"Karma\" (skill points) to seriously max out three skills and pick two to dump a few points into- for my character, it was Intelligence, which is the core stat for Rigging, which I also maxxed, and Drone Combat, which is a subskill of Rigging. Then, I put points into Body for survivability, and tossed in like two extra levels into Charisma for no particular reason.\n\nThe story itself is pretty good. Nothing particularly \"wow-y\", and none of the characters are *particularly* memorable, which sucks. The missions are all fairly standard; a mix of combat, general environment interaction, and investigation; given the story happens to be a murder mystery (That, for what it's worth, gets solved like... Halfway through the entire game, and the other half is just chasing down the murderer). The story is VERY linear though. You essentially can't veer off the road in the slightest; and in a manner, it is a tad frustrating. Most dialogue options all generally lead to the same-ish outcome, and there is only ONE side mission, which is a pure-combat arena that ends fairly quickly and whose reward isn't even really worth the amount of money you're spending on hiring your crew.\n\nOne thing of note; this game /apparently/ supports a high-quality campaign creator and has a ton of workshop support for it. I haven't personally tried it out; but it SEEMS fairly expansive, and there is a decent bit of stuff on the workshop. If the main story doesn't interest you; there's plenty of player-made custom campaigns in the workshop, it seems.\n\nAs for bugs? The game, as far as I was able to tell; only has one- and it's during the UB infiltration mission where you have to put on some janitor clothes. In one of the closets- theres an option to pick up a keycard, and another option to pick up a dwarf's uniform. I wrongly assumed every closet would have a keycard, so I didn't pick it up. HOWEVER, if you close out of the interaction menu- the locker is NO LONGER AVAILABLE for interacting, so make sure to pick up the keycard, and THEN go and find a uniform that fits your character.\n\nStill, despite all that; for a game that REGULARLY goes on sale for... Like $2- it's more than worth it for a short RPG you can complete in like two-three sittings, with a solid beginning, middle, and end that all cleanly wraps up and doesn't leave any real plot threads/loose ends. Plus, it STILL looks great; aside from the awkward stiffness of the character models.", "timestamp_created": 1673020165, "timestamp_updated": 1673020783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612150788307189941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130159957": {"recommendationid": "130159957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171582698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 45464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19614, "last_played": 1676344167}, "language": "english", "review": "great game but slow play and read everything", "timestamp_created": 1672890483, "timestamp_updated": 1672890483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129997929": {"recommendationid": "129997929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066620574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1194, "last_played": 1672708402}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet.

It's based primarily in 3d edition Shadowrun, so if you're a TTRPG player who has been playing in 5th ed or 6th World then this is going to look pretty different. No technomancy, fewer Adept specialties, and the differences between Shamans and Mages are more rigid. That said, you can go with an archetype or completely make a character from scratch using simplified 3rd ed rules (which is pretty fun if you want that nostalgia hit). The campaign is short (8-10 hours on average), but there are lots of excellent UGCs in the workshop to play, you can make your own games using the resources, and some dedicated players have updated all kinds of resources and campaign modules from 1st-3rd edition in the workshop. There's a lot more to do than just the base campaign. \n\nSRR is set in Seattle, one of the primary campaign settings for the TTRPG. The story is part fantasy, part cyber-punk, part Neo-Noir, and the right amount of goofy to be entertaining. SRR also retains a more accurate depiction of how hacking worked in earlier editions with opposed checks and IC warfare. This was changed in Hong Kong to a more real-time matching game (which is punishing if you're not good at that style of game). The user console can be used for QoL or to experiment with different karma builds (it can also help if there's a glitch). This world is intentionally dark. You're not a hero out to save the world in this game. You're trying to live from minute to minute in a world that is trying quite hard to ignore your existence or go out of its way to kill you.\n\nNegatives: None of the Shadowrun games have an accurate hit accuracy calculations for shotguns. Don't expect to hit anything standing in front of you even with high stats. It's a bit of an inside joke with the series.  The game is older and can be a bit glitchy on Windows 11 at times. Recommended to run it in full screen to avoid issues and saving often (keep multiple saves too since you can get locked into some runs and find yourself unable to proceed if you're karma is too low). Controller support is almost unusable. It really only works for panning the camera. You still have to use the mouse to select tiles to move to, zoom distances, and dialog choices. Even with third party controller interfaces it's just not worth it. The music can be very loud and the sound levels are different in the main menu versus in the game itself. Be careful when wearing headphones. The hit box for moving to a tile versus interacting with an object on an adjacent tile can be misleading. You might lose a turn if you're not careful in combat. Keep that in mind when you go to move or attack/interact that you have to be very centered on what you're clicking on. Zoom in if in doubt.\n\nFinal Verdict: Definitely recommended.\n\nNotes: I own the original Kickstarter editions of all three games. Depending on what the current Steam version is of SRR, you may open the game and have it say it's \"Dragonfall\". If so, you have both games in one. If it says \"Shadowrun Returns\" then you will need to get Dragonfall separately if you want to play both games (some UGCs require both). Hong Kong is always separate and the extended edition of that is recommended since the ending falls a bit flat otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1672047563, "timestamp_updated": 1672047563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129310250": {"recommendationid": "129310250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010851321", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1693801335}, "language": "english", "review": "Preface: As of this review, the Shadowrun Trilogy is on sale for $10 on Steam.

The story is great, the setting and characters are top-notch, and the combat was not super complicated and very fun. The only gripe I'd say I have is some of the.... weak? visuals, but they don't take anything away from how awesomely fun the game is, just a minor annoyance. This was my maiden voyage into the Shadowrun universe and I'm hooked! Steam also has the native Linux versions of the game which is a plus!\n\n9/10 for me, and I can't wait to get into Dragonfall!

I played the original SNES, but I was young when I played it and I never understood it until later when we figured out it was magiccyberpunk/detective-gangfights. Key been detective to get the items and clues to advance forward. Yes, this game is more linear than the original SNES. I felt I got lost running around Seattle there more than this game. I felt too boxed in. Let me explore. Are they not after Sam Watts? Why are they not going for the protagonist who is Sam Watts's avenger for $100K? LOL!  Love the $100K, but it should pay upfront instead of pandering here and there. The game is great, but a major update needs to be done. Unlike the SNES, you can update the game. Sooooo.... update the game with a bigger map on all zones, more characters, and the ability to get the $100K upfront to modern prices (if you can tie it to modern indexes, even better just it make if feel more real). Use an API to the gun price indexes or something.  I still recommend the game.  I know it this modern version is like a boxed-in CyberGang-Magic_XCOM play, but you know what I mean.  It can still be a CyberGang-Magic_XCOM, but make it feel bigger and you can do that without changing much of the conversations.  In addition, the voices should be given real life people. I would invest in live actors and given them game more of the open SNES feel, where you can get lost  in side quests that help the story line.  If you are going to own \"THE GANG-XCOM\", then go all the way if you have the budget. You would definetly get more sales and more improved reviews. Again. This Shadowrun is better than the SNES in so many, so I do recommend it. BTW, the outfits could be less weird when it comes to armor. I am buying body armor. I am ok with haiiwaiin shirt, but the character, make it look like real armor.  I see SF dudes in Iraq during OIF wearing civilian clothing, but they still had body armor and ammo pounches over the plates. I still do not need see how a weird glowy gas mask goth outfit give me 4 Armor.  I like the concept of looking-cool with body armor, but make it practical and make sense. I still dig the idea of gas masks (since there are smoke grenades and acid and other things in Shadowrun), but make it an item with sidepouche on the character and as a AP1 for doning the promask.

It's a fun setting, and the game does a great job at introducing it.\n[hr][/hr]\nWhat's immediately striking about the game is the excellent soundtrack and wonderful hand-painted backgrounds and character portraits.  These all come together to set a great mood.  Less impressive are the 3D models for characters and enemies, but they get the job done.\n\nThe game is extremely linear, with you being taken from one mission to the next with a small base of operations to visit in between missions, where you can purchase equipment and hire the rest of your team.  There really aren't that many options for equipment, so you quickly end up getting top level gear halfway through the game.  Luckily, the game is paced quite well with experience point (\"karma\") rewards during and after missions, so you won't be maxing anything out until the very end of the game (especially if you are playing as a hybrid class).\n\nThe combat works fine and is \"tactical\" in the sense that you have more options in battle than in most other RPGs.  You can take cover behind things for defense bonuses, select different fire modes for your guns, and make use of all sorts of spells including summons.  Having said that, combat is not very difficult at all on the default difficulty level, and it's mostly enough to just stay in cover and make sure to reload whenever you have a chance.\n\nThere is a heavy focus on story and dialog, though the text is generally well-written and not overly verbose.  I enjoyed the story, but it will all depend on whether you find the unique setting to be fun or too goofy to take seriously.  What's even better, is that certain dialog options will only be available if you have spent enough points in certain attributes/skills.  It would probably be fun to replay the game as a totally different type of character.\n[hr][/hr]\nAlthough I enjoyed the game, there were a few things I didn't like.\n\nI don't mind a linear game, but I do wish you had the choice of doing some optional missions in between story missions.  I was also unpleasantly surprised at how few equipment upgrades there are; I continued to use my starting shotgun for nearly half the game, and only upgraded to a better one for the last couple of missions.\n[hr][/hr]\nHaving said that, these are only minor complaints for what is overall an enjoyable little game.

There are a few technical issues reported and still not fixed, I've encountered only one of them (event trigger not going off in one of the later levels) but who cares at this point.\n\nBasically, if you want to play a dnd/cyberpunk/shadowrun campaign, but have no people to play with, this is a decent substitute until you find someone to play an rpg with :D", "timestamp_created": 1664641026, "timestamp_updated": 1664641026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123131250": {"recommendationid": "123131250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005737452", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 11856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11856, "last_played": 1430749246}, "language": "english", "review": "I have always been a fan of the Shadowrun games.

I first played this game near it's initial release at the end of 2013 and got pretty significantly far through the game, and then did not play it again for almost 9 years until a random night this month where I redownloaded it and completed the game, after having given the series thought over the past several years but never re-engaging.\n\nShadowrun Returns is a tactical turn based RPG in a cyberpunk-fantasy setting based on a popular tabletop RPG.\nThe setting is a little ridiculous in the sense that it attempts to combine high-magic fantasy including elves, orcs, and mages alongside the cyberpunk trappings of high tech, body modification, and matrix-style mental interaction with the internet. It's a weird juxtaposition and honestly, it often doesn't make sense, but it's something I really enjoy and is the main highlight of a game like this.\n\nThe gameplay is a very typical CRPG top down perspective kind of thing with tactical turn based combat with basic point and click controls for when you're out of combat.\nTo be honest I'm not a huge fan of this sort of gameplay. I don't particularly care for tactical RPGs, especially when they try to make their reputation for having combat that is 'brutal' and 'unforgiving' and in addition to that it just seems incredibly disjointed for a game that tries to have elements of exploration and story interaction, that is often bogged down by having to interact with those things in a turn-based, tactical system.\n\nThe story however, while not stellar, is pretty good, and serves as a good introduction to the Shadowrun universe, which is what I believe the developers were hoping for. To be honest the story itself kinda glides over me most of the time while playing this but it serves to just expose me to the cool setting. Which is what I really want.\nSimilarly, the art, is not necessarily that exceptional, but it absolutely serves its purpose in immersing you further into this setting and communicating the tone and feel of this world that you're playing in.\nI can say the same thing about the soundtrack as well.\n\nOverall, if you want a cool exposure to the Shadowrun universe, and are willing to slog through some uninteresting combat to do so, I would absolutely recommend this game. If you don't have much of a tolerance for those things, or if you're hoping for a deeper experience story wise. I can't say I do.

Declaring his death by a murder, he wants you to find out who killed him and bring justice. This calls for a trip to Seattle, where you will have to deal with mysterious Emerald City Ripper and his murder spree.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nReturns is an isometric, turn-based title, featuring linear gameplay with small and medium sized areas you travel through to complete objectives and push story further.\n\nBefore you actually get into a game, you have to create a character! So first you pick prefered race and optionally, an archtype. Here we have fantasy classics with futuristic spin. You can focus on killing things with melee or ranged weapons, utilize technology to control deadly drones and hack different elements, or use magic to kill enemies and buff your allies.\nYou are also free to go for mixing different types together for hybrid builds, good at both but great at neither.\n\nOnce that is over you can start enjoying a game, location by location, in a rather uncommon for RPG's combination as most of them tends to go for open world approach.\nWhile making your way through the areas you can interract with few items, including NPC's who might give you a side quest or two, and enviroment, usually different lockers and crates containing items.\nGame features only one location you constantly revisit, which serves as a hub where you can restock your supplies, buy and sell your equipment or hire few mercenaries for your party, for more combat focused bits.\nGame uses nuyens as credits, you can collect them through exploration and objectives completion. You cannot collect such elements as weapons or armor in the field, so don't be shy on spending them!\n\nAnd it's definitely worth to spend those hard earned nuyens, as combat won't be screwing around with you.\nIt's a typical turn based one, you and each member of your party has a specific amount of action points to spend during a turn and it is your call on how you waste them. Moving, reloading a weapon, utilizing items, every action costs.\nAfter done turn, your enemies do their move, occasionally there are also neutral opponents on a field doing their moves too.\nGoal in combat is to not get killed, and if you fail you have to use a revival kit in specific amount of turns, or your character dies forever-ever, and that would suck.\nGame features classic percentage system, so every action that is performed on enemy, from typical weapon shot to magic spell, has X percent of chance to hit. You gonna miss 80% shots and sometimes hit 50%, that is how those games roll and how my eyes roll sometimes when I play them and miss those high percentage ones.\n\nWhen it comes to equipment, it's depending on your character, but no matter who you play as, you have option of storing few items with you that can be wasted during or in-between combat, such as medkits, and everyone can wear some sort of clothing to provide better Armor. Additionally, if you on your journey find a usable item and your equipment is full, you can send it to a Stash in hub location to exchange or pick it later! Rest of items is dependable on class.\n\nShadowrun doesn't feature xp system. Instead, by completing objectives and quests you recieve Karma, which can be spend on skills in a menu.\nSkills don't stand out, you have few focused on specific playstyle you took and they branch out, plus few universal ones like Charisma. Amount of Karma you need for a skill depends on it's level. To unlock 5th Charisma level you will need 5 Karma, to make an example.\n\n[b]Playtime, replayability and other modes[/b]\nGame took me 8 hours to complete.\nIf you were a fan of the combat and want to try out different playstyle in it, you can give this title another spin.\nOutside of main campaign game comes with, you can look for user generated ones which can be found and downloaded from the internet! So if you want more Shadowrun, you can dig a bit to find some user made content to increase your playtime.\n\n[b]Pros and cons[/b]\nShadowrun's science fantasy setting is definitely what got me interested in a game, and one of strongest points of it. I'm surprised by how well fantasy elements have been intergrated into this futuristic settting, and how you can enjoy dropping fireballs as an elf mage or hack different systems as a rogue dwarf and it feels ordinary. While I am a bit dissapointed about linear approach to a world design, what is here is very good and I hope it works as a great foundation for other games to build on.\nAdditionally we have simple but enjoyable turn based combat, decent variety of locations you explore on your way, and solid roster of interesting characters you encounter. Easy navigation and equipment menu means that even if you are not into isometric crpg's you will have a very easy time figuring all mechanics out.\n\nNegatives! Unfortunately linear design and massive amount of skill trees don't go hand in hand. My biggest issue is that game doesn't offer a lot of secondary options when it comes to beating the areas like usual, more open world titles do. Don't get me wrong, you can, every once in a while, use Charisma or some hacking skill to find an alternative way through a location, or to gain more credits from an action, but for the most part it's just guns blazing that game pulls out.\nSkill trees are simply to freaking packed to actually be coherent with what game offers. You have to be from the start, very decisive about your Karma usage, let me put it that way.\nThis connects to previous issue in very simple way, some skill tress are utterly useless in the game and just a waste of Karma, giving you a false sense of bigger amount of options. So I think, or rather I hope, that next entry of Shadowrun which I will play sooner or later, has reworked skill system or simply changes approach to locations in order to give player more freedom and reason to look into some of the options it offers.\n\n[b]Final words and conclusion[/b]\nDirector's Cut offers you Soundtrack and illustrated PDF of short stories written and edited by Jordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun!\n\nShadowrun Returns with uncommon science fantasy setting and good gameplay is a title worthy of playing, and a solid starting point for those interested in Shadowrun universe.\n\nCheck out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/] my curator page [/url] for more reviews!", "timestamp_created": 1662831428, "timestamp_updated": 1662831428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690940916538238525", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121994346": {"recommendationid": "121994346", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983754536", "num_games_owned": 700, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 785, "last_played": 1486940012}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1662752568, "timestamp_updated": 1662752568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464601784944534302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121973761": {"recommendationid": "121973761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328577316", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 624, "last_played": 1662723905}, "language": "english", "review": "Great rendition of Shadowrun's RPG.

We all love venerable RPG properties like Battletech, Dungeons and Dragons, Cyberpunk and yes, also, Shadowrun.

LOTRO.  World of Warcraft?  It could have been?  It's a rich universe, so why shouldn't game developers treat this with that level of relevance?  Hahaha, no, this is HBS and Paradox.  So this is a mobile app.  It was made for iPhones.  It's dumbed down and thickened up and lightweight as all hell. \n\nTake the rules for Shadowrun.  Deep and brilliant, right?  Eviscerate them until about 5% of those rules are left.  Dumb them down.  Strap them onto an extremely linear story and a clunky screen tapper mobile interface.   Polish nothing, and test the game only on iPhones.  Ladies and Gentlemen:  I present the result, Shadowrun Returns.  \n\nAdding a severe insult to injury, there's no UI scaling in this mobile app, so if you own a gaming PC, it won't display properly on your UHD display, text will be simply too small to read.  But remember, HBS/Paradox only tested this on mobile phones. \n\nThis game is also ancient, launched in 2013 (But remastered... slightly).  And despite the remaster, they didn't bother making the game well on modern PCs.  And yet.. they still want $15 for this massive disappointment. \n\nI gave this a solid attempt despite all the problems...

Looking forward to picking up DLC at next sale.\n\nCharacter Tips:  None of the races are bad and you won't really feel the maximum stat limits in the default campaign.   Samurai is simplest to play and you can almost solo the whole campaign on normal (with some of the default mission teammates.)  Mage & Rigger (turn on drones which become team mates) are also pretty straight-forward, Shaman is good but some limits to summoning based on mission, while Adept can be used but just wasn't implemented well.  I don't recommend Decker as a primary class as 80% of the game is non-VR and the number of times you can hack a turret or something is very limited and simple to accomplish.   You can hire team mates of any class so you can always try them out (you just don't get to pick their specific spells/programs/gear).\n\nStat Tips:  You'll end up earning a fair number of Karma points thru the game.  Body is important as you'll get targeted a lot and Quickness and Willpower help determine how easy you are to hit with physical and magic attacks respectively.   The majority of attacks will be physical as you'll tend to target and take out enemy mages/shamans quickly.  Make sure you have 3-4 body min and focus on your main stats.   Early stats are cheap so you can shore up a secondary skill or two (like decker) mid-game.   Cha 4 gets you through most skill checks and pick whatever conversation specialties you want.  Action points are the most important stat in the game but you can't control the amount (2 to start, 3 later)  Note that Armor can't go above 10 so factor that in as you look at your gear/cyberware/buffs.   Hit % becomes increasingly more difficult so you'll want to ensure you have plenty of buffs/skills to help.\n\nGear/Spell Tips:  The game limits your options with the number of weapon, gear, and spell/special ability slots you have available to carry stuff into a mission.  Haste (increase AP) is the single most powerful spell in the game.  Spells have different power levels (1-4 for example) which you'll be able to upgrade as you get stronger and increases impact and/or duration.  You can equip multiple levels of the same spell (Haste 1 and Haste 2) so you can cast one while the other is cooling down.   You get special abilities with weapons as you increase skill and you can see what they are on your Karma increase screen.  All the weapons are workable but Rifle (with the Full Autofire skill at level 3) is probably going to become your mainstay damage dealer if you  have it.   Note: Don't bother with the cyberlink for weapons before the end-game as they only become available in the late missions (also don't get confused with the Ingram \"Smartgun\" SMG description, the true \"linked\" weapons are clearly marked).  \n\nCombat Tips:  Manage your AP points carefully, buff your main damage dealers with Haste and Aim so can lay down the hate.  Haste stacks so you can get 5 or more AP without too much difficulty mid-game.   You can also bolster your team with Drones and Summoning.  Armor buff your team but remember the 10 max.  A support mage can/should burn through their entire AP each turn just buffing round-robin through your team.  Take out mage types first and finish off weak enemies as anyone on the board gets their full actions the following turn.   I never really used much gear or any of the drugs in the normal difficulty.  But remember that magic healing only heals the damage from the last attack, so if you take a 10 damage hit followed by a 5 damage, a heal will only restore 5.    It's worth throwing heal spells immediately after damage (topping off) as you may have to burn a first aid kit later if you wait and take another hit.   Overwatch is a great function and appears when you get combat level 4 (range/close).  It allows you to reserve some AP and pick a direction to \"cover\".  If an enemy enters that area you get a free attack (you can pick things like autofire if you have the 2 AP it costs).   It's a great way to cut down enemies or heavily damage them before your turn starts.   Note it looks like a little wifi symbol in the lower left weapon selection area when it becomes available.\n\nThose are a few things I picked up from the guides and my playthroughs.

I do enjoy the dialogue and the world building where this game is it's strongest. It has a good story going for it so far. Now I am new to this type of genre of tactical squad turned based gameplay or whatever it is called but I liked it. Though I can see how if your used to playing something more complicated this game might be a little simple. It is a linear story with some side actions you can do to get more Karma(this games exp points) and or money. Money is a big thing to manage at least for a first time player as I didn't know what to expect. As I thought I find something to sell in the last combat encounter but I didn't so the next mission I did that I needed to do get more money I could only hire one other person since I didn't have enough money.

Some things arent apparent but you kinda just pick it up as the game progresses.\n\nNot a whole lot of gear to choose from and gear is locked behind story progression. Typically the characters they give you are pretty useful for the scenarios they put you in. The weapons are typically useable but its very noticeable that if you dont stat for a specific type of weapon then that character will be pretty useless in combat.\n\nFor example I used mostly the fixer contacts for most missions because I was Mr. Krabs Jr. with my money.

Granted, it's a decade old so I have some leniency, but it does not excel in any way, on top of having a few game design hurdles to overcome and an inherent clunkiness due to its age. I'd like to give it a neutral review as it's not a [i]bad[/i] game and there are things it does well, however whether it's worth playing over its successors or competitors in the genre is arguable at best.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI shall leave the gameplay section for the end as that's where most of my issues come into play. Story-wise you play as a shadowrunner, essentially a mercenary trying to figure out the killer of his late friend. In classic RPG fashion, along the way you get to work with a number of characters, both as  part of your team and as contractors or flavour NPCs. The writing for the main story is alright, although it's not the most memorable, especially once some of the twists come in, but the characters you meet are at least passably written in a believable way that adds some flavour to the world. I especially appreciated being able to talk to the vendors between missions to get a bit more lore out of them but whether I'd consider any to be truly memorable is rather unlikely. In spite of the shortcomings, the worldbuilding is quite fantastic and it servers as a good introduction to the world without making it feel overwhelming.\n\nThe story itself is entirely linear and although conversations have dialogue choices, including stat checks, they either don't matter or only affect monetary rewards, rather than give you more options or change the story in any way. Likewise, when it comes to sidequests (if you can call them that), the limited amount of them tend to either be in the way of your objectives due to the linearity of the game, with one exception that represents a separate mission in a new location. These usually boil down to exploring your environment for one of the very few spots you can interact with to find some item or information someone is looking for.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are user created content packs for the game, although most seem to be abandoned or moved to Dragonfall instead so I'm not going to cover them. It might give you some extra content if you enjoy the game though.\n\n[h1]Visuals & Audio[/h1]\nThe visual style is one of the strong points here. Although some of the areas get a little repetitive, it carries a strong isometric art style which lasts the test of time. The game itself has few bells and whistles when it comes to flashy tricks but what's there works and is generally clear enough. One thing I especially appreciated was the variety of default character portraits that matched the look of the character models, making it just that little bit more accurate despite the limited customisation.\n\nAudio-wise there's nothing to write home about. The music serves as a good backdrop for the setting and the sound design is okay for the most part even if a few weapons sound rather underwhelming.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nI'll try to keep this brief. Ignoring the hub and story areas, the main crux of the gameplay consists of turn-based combat with an action economy, backed by gear, consumables, stats and skills - About what you expect from an RPG. There's a mixture of gunplay, melee, minion control in the form of drones and spirits, and spells, most of which functioning analogously for the various classes, although you are by no means restricted by your starting class.\n\nOutside of combat, your choice of loadout is somewhat limited. New gear unlocks throughout the game which is a direct upgrade of its predecessor. If you can go without an upgrade earlier on it'll give you more cash to work with later on, which is ideal. The same goes for all aspects of equipment, being limited to three or four tiers of effectiveness. Your stats and skills are going to be the main point of investment, since those are always going to be useful and as long as you specialize in at least one weapon skill and gear up for it you're almost guaranteed to roll through most of what the game has to offer. The other choice you can make at this point is to hire a team before each mission. The concept is great but in practice you are disincentivized from doing it since it represents a money drain with no lasting benefit beyond making the combat even easier. I invested into drone control for a permanent companion instead and the money saved on mediocre pawns definitely paid off in the end.\n\nThe combat itself is\u2026not very interesting. Regardless of your character, enemies are braindead and their tactics are very limited, making most of them fall to simple tactics such as backing up to trap them, or taking pot shots and going out of sight. Near the end of the game, vents allow drones to freely kill all enemies and duck into them, trivializing those encounters. There are a few battles where gimmicks are introduced however they came across more as tedium than engaging sadly. Even worse, some sections during missions have no enemies yet you are still locked into combat movement, meaning you need to agonizingly slowly move your characters forward one by one. \n\nAlthough everything is technically functional, most elements come with some degree of clunkiness to them, part of which could be due to the age of the game but it does not do it many favours. On top of those limitations, myself and many others have experienced softlocks that required reloading so keep a series of saves ready between missions.\n\n[h1]Completion[/h1]\nSeeing as the game has no achievements, there's nothing much to say here. Content-wise the game is entirely linear and the few sidequests aren't really missable and only tend to reward more experience or cash so you're likely to see most of it fairly quickly.

You can miss one shot and per round and still kill  the spirit bug.  if you dont kill it then it forms back into a physical bug and you have to kill it again...repeat this process...\n\ni finally turned the game off when, while have an 86% chance to hit with both characters, i was missing 2 shots per round.  so, kill the physical bug, shoot the spirit bug twice, miss twice and repeat the process again and again all the while the bugs are whittling down your character and your NPCs.  its fucking stupid and it took me out of the game.  im not sure how you hit 50% of the time with an 86% chance to hit - and this is a theme throughout the game, but you really notice it with these bugs because its so vital you hit them twice while in spirit mode.  so fucking frustrating.  i thought id finish the game then this bullshit happened.  im done.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1648708998, "timestamp_updated": 1648708998, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527826189994812012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113043467": {"recommendationid": "113043467", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991984454", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1429, "last_played": 1649457413}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy to learn and fun to play.

THAT was a bad decision. It came out in 2013 I think and yet feels worse to play than Baldur's Gate 1. Literally just clicking around the map and trying to interact with stuff was such a chore, half the time when you click someone to talk to your character just turns to them and the dialogue box doesn't even open. Then in combat the UI is atrocious where entire classes are devoted to using spells but all of your spells are in a drop down menu with no ability to hotkey them, requiring so many clicks just to cast a spell that could've been bound to Q and done on a hover-over mouse target. \n\nThe story was shockingly simple for having the possibility of sci-fi and fantasy to draw from. It's also shockingly linear. I thought a defining point of this genre was being able to tackle problems from multiple angles, but almost every mission has exactly 1 solution, you gotta talk to this one guy and get a thing to put next to the thing and sneak in, no you can't talk your way in, no you can't brute force your way in. I feel terrible for anyone who wanted to engage with the game's one sorta unique feature, hacking, because there are literally like 4 places in the entire game where it can be used whatsoever, and only if your main character is the hacker because a hacker party member is, for some reason, unable to be used unless you're in combat. Not that they're any fun to do because they play the exact same as combat, just spam clicking on enemies as you shoot whatever your default weapon is, occasionally clicking through 3 drop down menus to cast a buff spell if you feel like it. By the time you finally have a party, which is like half-way through the game, you end up just forgetting about cover and spells and drones and all that shit and just hire a ton of dudes with shotguns to blast apart anything that walks your way. No point in having a balanced party for skill checks because only your main character is allowed to interact with objects, so why not just spam AoE infinite ammo no cooldown guns? \n\nI got about 75% of the way through the game and was just trying to get through the arduous combats as fast as I could until I encountered a bug where I became unable to pass my turn or take any actions during the final encounter of a huge area, and the game has NO quick save feature (or rebindable keys for that matter holy shit) so when I reloaded I had to do the entire mission again. Fuckin abysmal, I threw in the towel.

Certain events on a couple of specific missions would repeatedly fail to trigger, effectively soft-locking the game and forcing me to reload prior saves or even restart entire levels from the beginning in the hope of magically avoiding whatever caused the failure to occur on the previous attempt. These problems were admittedly very few and far between, but when they did crop up they were absolutely impossible to ignore.\n\n     The fact that these issues exist (with no reliable, easily implemented workaround or troubleshooting available either on the game's Steam forums or anywhere else on the web) in a 'finished' game is unacceptable. And since this is now a bit of an older game and development on it has completely stopped, there is no prospect of these problems ever being resolved. It seems unfair that the developers are still able to sell this game in its current state without at least providing some kind of disclaimer on the store page to warn potential buyers before purchase.\n\n     It's a shame, because if it weren't for the glaring issues outlined above, Shadowrun Returns would easily get a thumbs up instead. The game's graphics are not bad for its age, character creation is varied and interesting, the plot is compelling enough to keep you invested in what's happening, the campaign is reasonably long, etc. But it's just not worth the frustration or wasted time of having to deal with those bugs in order to get at the good parts when there are so many other great RPGs to choose from on Steam that have all the same selling points AND run smoothly. \n\n     If you're already a big fan of the Shadowrun series and/or you got the game in a bundle then by all means give it a try, but don't say that nobody warned you.

Someone once said to me, \"I fear what you'd say about Shadowrun Returns if you think this game is bad\"\n2. I was kinda curious about it as it kept on popping up when I was checking out other titles \n3. It was on sale for \u00a32.74\n\nShadowrun Returns is an incredibly short and easy game. My run time doesn't give an accurate idea of it's length as it was left on idle for a duration multiple different times. It can definitely be completed in or under 10 hours.\n\n[h1]THE VIBE[/h1]\n\nShadowrun Returns can easily be understood if you think of it as the love child between Blade Runner and Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nIn the not so distant future, magic has come back to our technologically advanced dystopian world. The game drips attitude and personality, so much so the song It Can't Rain All the Time from the movie The Crow can feel perfectly at home here. The game also provides plenty of that Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines vibe in regards to tone and general world building.\n\n[h1]STORY SET UP[/h1]\n\nYou are a Shadowrunner, an individual who runs jobs outside of the black and white lines of the law for anyone willing to pay. The story greatly revolves around a Deadmans Switch which can be thought of as a last will and testimony sent to - in this case - an individual automatically when they die.\n\nWhen your old Shadowrunner buddy Sam dies, you receive his Deadmans Switch asking for his killer to be caught for a handsome reward.\n\n[h1]DIFFICULTY[/h1]\n\nI played the entire game on the hardest difficulty and found this ridiculously easy the vast majority of times. When it wasn't ridiculously easy it was very easy. In short, this game provides zero challenge. \n\n[h1]CHARACTER CREATION[/h1]\n\nLOVED IT! This game does something that most RPG, CRPG etc etc etc games does not..... it allows you to create a character that actually looks like the profile picture..... mind blown! All jokes aside, you can actually make a character that looks like the provided profile images. On that basis alone, I love it.\n\nYou get to select the obvious stuff such as gender and race. The races are human, elf, dwarf, orc and troll. Each race as you may expect provides a stat buff or increase if you prefer.\n\nThe stats in Shadowrun Returns follow a very simplistic logic. Example, if you want to increase your health points, you put points in your Body. Level one Body costs 1 Karma point aka upgrade point. Level two costs 2 Karma points etc. The rest of the categories have some sub categories such as Spellcasting is under Willpower. In other words, the more proficient you want to be in something, the more it's gonna cost you (upgrade point wise).\n\n[h1]GENERAL GAMEPLAY STUFF[/h1]\n\nShadowrun Returns is a very short and linear game that really provides as a good opener for the Shadowrun series. Combat is like the plot, very short and linear with little to no thinking needed. In some respects the game is almost like an interactive book. Only two fights at the very end change the formula a little bit.\n\n[h1]LIKES[/h1]\n\n* The world is genuinely cool\n* I liked the fact you are the main character only, there's no companions per se\n* Character models look like the profile images\n\n[h1]DISLIKES[/h1]\n\n* Feels like a really polished section of or DLC to a 'main game'\n* It was confusing how the inventory works. Swapping and buying items is easy but at the start of the game, you have no indication of how it is done or where your loot or inventory actually is. It isn't explained either from what I can remember.

The main one for me was that the enemies only want to attack your character even if there are 3 more on your team. This is so bad that even if your character is hidden behind all 3 of them, the enemy would rather rush across the map to shoot it than shoot someone else.\n\nThat was the most annoying thing it the game. Other are: you cant click on a tile if its behind other character because the model blocks the view, if you clear out the map you will still be locked in turn based movement for some reason even though no enemies will spawn which is pain in the ass, character upgrades are really boring and basically water down to: \"you will have bigger chance to hit someone with weapon X\" and gun/spell upgrades aren't interesting they just do more damage, the parts where you hack computers are just combat that has the same mechanics as normal combat and more smaller things.\nAlso personal preference: game relies too much on RNG for me and makes me want to uninstall when I miss 50% shot 7 times in a row.\n\nGame starts really good and pulls you in quickly but in about 30% of the game theres not much more you can experience.\nYou have the same routine: go on a mission -> come back to the hideout -> buy upgrades -> hire the team -> go on next mission. \n\nAfter all it costs 3.74e on sale so its worth the try but dont expect anything groundbraking", "timestamp_created": 1645985022, "timestamp_updated": 1645985022, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111170282": {"recommendationid": "111170282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089787824", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2006, "last_played": 1649312957}, "language": "english", "review": "...", "timestamp_created": 1645975991, "timestamp_updated": 1693977532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111038655": {"recommendationid": "111038655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296138374", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1645845474}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm writing this review after finishing the game on normal difficulty so take what I say with a grain of salt.

I was fully prepared for a significantly less refined user interface, and the loss of many quality of life features. What I wasn't prepared for was the drop in writing quality.\n\nWhen compared to the stellar writing in both of its sequels, Shadowrun Returns suffers quite heavily. Where Dragonfall and Hong Kong do an excellent job of crafting diverse narratives in which characters' cultural backgrounds are centered, Returns falls back on countless tired and cringeworthy stereotypes. Where Dragonfall tells the story of the members of a found family dealing with grief and loss, Returns deprives you of party members, and has you go it alone for most of the game. Where Hong Kong tells excellent disability narratives through Gaichu and Ambrose, Returns [spoiler]removes the arm of a main character, replaces it with an identical prosthetic, then moves on with barely a second thought[/spoiler]. Even the sentence-level writing suffers: I lost count of the number of times a new character was introduced with the exact same language, with nothing but a few adjectives and metaphors swapped around. It got exhausting very quickly.\n\nAs much as it pains me to say it, if you've never played a Shadowrun game before, I highly recommend starting with Dragonfall or Hong Kong.

Well anyway, I do have dragonfall dlc version, but with it not being able to be bought anymore because of director's cut, I'll just focus on the main game. So lately I got into shadowrun nostalgia trip and replayed all three games. I replayed return's main campaign on easy mode, but I still ended up remembering why I had so frustrating time on my first run: so I played as squishy shaman without any pistol skill focused on shaman abilities. In main campaign instantly your main character goes down, its game over :P Game lacks lot of quality of life from later games like docwagon kits being automatically used if you have one equipped, being able to have your party members' drones enter vents and such. Still though main campaign ended up being better than I remembered, I think having more reasonable expectations and being able to survive much easier helped with that.

Most of the options seem to boil down to range, melee, pet. \n\nThe game isn't overly difficult (thanks to a save feature that didn't exist at launch) the story for a cheap game is good.

Great, cyber-punk noire atmosphere, with a dash of fantasy. The mechanics felt like a marriage between the Shadowrun tabletop RPG (at least, 5th edition) and X-COM (only, you know, fair).

It does say that in the tutorial, so that is entirely on me). It makes good use of buffs, debuffs and cool-downs.

They are back to back bugs, but the Steam forum should be able to help you out if you encounter them. While the art style and character portraits are good, my 3D avatar never looked great.  I went for a decking build, which is pretty fun, but I was disappointed that none of the cyber-enhancement options ever felt like they were worth getting.  Even though the ending of the main story-line was satisfying, I didn't feel like there were enough side-missions or enemy variety for such a diverse world (there is a map editor and fan-made modules for download, though I don't know how they are).

[b]I'd buy it at full price if I had a job, but you can get it at generous discounts for as little as 3-4$ since it was released almost a decade ago.[/b] One more thing before diving into the review: this is the first part of the Shadowrun trilogy, and if you just want to experience Shadowrun glory for a single gameplay, head straight to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/300550/Shadowrun_Dragonfall__Directors_Cut/] Shadowrun: Dragonfall[/url], which outshines Dead man's switch in all aspects.\n\nShadowrun is a renowned table-top system introduced in 1989, which is alive and well, introducing the sixth edition in 2019. It mixes fantasy features with cyberpunk efficiently and entertainingly. Racism is alive and well since Humans hate Orcs, Elves are arrogant towards Humans, Everyone despises Trolls, and Dragons are mighty capitalist overlords conspiring to rule all the races. Furthermore, there's tons of hacking, The Matrix is worse than Neo could've imagined, and people with salary jobs are simply called \"wage-slaves\". It's the near future, so to speak.\n\nAfter releasing games for SNES in the early 90's, and an FPS for Windows and Xbox in 2007, Shadowrun took a break and was revived via Kickstarter by Harebrained Schemes, which is now owned by Paradox Interactive. Kickstarter was a massive success, raising 1.8 million dollars, way above the required 400k. And here are the results of this generous funding.\n\n[b]This game is beautiful.[/b] The graphics pass the test of time, with a classic isometric view, a well-done cyberpunk architecture/atmosphere, and a wonderful, although slightly repetitive, soundtrack. It's a narrative-driven experience with a light combat system, which may be disappointing for combat lovers, but is welcomed by those seeking a good story. I loved this mix, just as much as I love Jack & Coke. \n\nYou'll dive into a neo-noir kind of detective story-line that's immersive and gives all the motivation you need to push forwards. You actually care about NPCs (although Dragonfall is way ahead at that), intuitive dialogues, and a spoonful of humor appropriate for a dystopian setting. A minor spoiler ahead: [spoiler]plot twist and the second part of the story might seem out of context, but those are the actual events that happened in Seattle 2054, as written in the New Seattle table-top book. However, I found this narrative twist unnecessary and would've continued the crime investigation line.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]The replay value is minimal[/b], and even though there are different ways to complete quests, it doesn't matter too much at the end. This game is best experienced as a linear immersive story-line, which will leave you wanting more. [i]Luckily, more is what you'll get since they released Shadowrun: Dragonfall and Shadowrun: Hong Kong in two years, one after another.[/i]\n\nDead man's switch could be better. The Matrix and combat systems, items, replayability. But it doesn't spoil the game; it just means it's a first attempt at successfully introducing Shadowrun as an isometric RPG.

The ending does feel like a cop out, but I'm told that later iterations of the franchise make up for it in terms of refined mechanics and sheer story duration. Shadowrun: Returns instils the belief that it very well could, and I'm tempted to buy out the franchise. \n\nAs someone who doesn't really go for the RPG genre, the game does a great job stringing the player along by providing you with heaps of resources to use as you go along. Not necessarily items, but money and upgrade points (Karma). As a habitual resource hoarder that played on normal, I was disappointed when I finished the game with a boatload of coin and level up points. I expected the game to be a bit longer, so I held on to a sizeable amount of both for at least a quarter of the game. Don't do that - it made me feel as if I held myself back from enjoying the game as it was meant to be played. The game actively punishes resource hoarders. \n\nGo all in on skills that seem interesting to you, as it feels like there's just too much choice and too few levels to make the most out of their diverse skill trees. Because the game offers so many unique ways to go through it, I do have this strange itch to re-specialize my character and run through the game with a better understanding of the game's unique mechanics - hacking, spells, and synergy between different character specialities all seem incredibly convoluted as you go throughout the game. By the time you think you have a handle on it, the game ends abruptly. \n\nI just feel slighted by the game's duration. It offers a highly intricate skill tree and breadth of spells, weapons, and other modifications. But, you could easily beat this game in 8-10 hours on an average difficulty. I do wish this game dabbled in more sidequests to avoid the feeling of not feeling like any of the choices you pick matter - you're just playing this game with too many options on too little time. Is it a life metaphor?

While I never played the tabletop I always thought the lore was rather interesting and I enjoyed the SNES game I finished long ago.  \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, the combat is similar to XCOM with its overwatch and cover systems.  I love the XCOM games, so I enjoyed the combat in Shadowrun Returns.\n\nMy playthrough involved a Troll Physical Adept who used unarmed combat, which is considered to be the weakest archetype in this game.  Even with a less than optimal character choice I didn't have too much trouble beating the game.  In fact, I utterly wrecked the final boss, though the level before that was more difficult due to the crits I took from powerful ranged damage. I also didn't have to spend a lot on equipment, so I ended up with tons of money for hiring runners. \n\nThe RPG aspects are decent but not as complex as other cRPGs I've played.  It seemed more combat focused and there weren't a lot of points of interest to explore, so if you're looking for a cRPG that focuses more on obtaining knowledge and talking your way out of things, Planescape: Torment is a better choice.  If I decide to play this again, I'd probably go with a Decker since that opens up a lot of additional rewards and it seems to fit the theme better.  \n\nThe story is a straightforward and linear murder mystery, but it gets creepy at times, so I enjoyed it.  It explores a lot of the things that make cyberpunk games enjoyable such as meatpuppets, corporate scheming and battles in cyberspace.  The one complaint I have is that the player character isn't affected by the game's plot so if you're looking for character growth this isn't a good game for that.  \n\nI haven't played Dragonfall or Hong Kong yet and they seem more developed than this first entry in the series, but Shadowrun Returns was a fun experience overall.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1632818589, "timestamp_updated": 1632818589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100030538": {"recommendationid": "100030538", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993796215", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 881, "last_played": 1632729102}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game overall, good story, characters and x-com style gameplay makes their job", "timestamp_created": 1632729255, "timestamp_updated": 1632729255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465909093618392944", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100027679": {"recommendationid": "100027679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025157903", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1008, "last_played": 1632720983}, "language": "english", "review": "While I loved playing this game for the 16 hours I did, there is an enormous and 100% game breaking bug in it.  \n\nWhen you get to a certain point in the game (after a LOT of character advancement and skill development) you need to enter a building to kick off a chapter.

In return, you get no sentient androids and the topic of transhumanism is kind of taken for granted and never touched upon. \nAnd while I'm not too fond of fantasy [except for Conan-like grimness], I think it fits very well here and it's surely a breath of fresh air that gives Shadowrun a personality of its own.\n\nNow... the first thing you'll notice is that the writing is damn GREAT. It really sets the tone: the characters speak in a variety of slangs according to their identity, there are plenty of environmental descriptions that may as well fit in cyberpunk novels, and so on.\nOverall, the atmosphere is top-notch and the seedy, corrupt and poverty-ridden urban sprawl we love so much in cyberpunk media is definitely there 100%. As someone else already said, it's 'true cyberpunk'.\n\nI felt the start to be too fast, tho. You get thrown into the story with no introduction at all. It all happens quick and basically assumes you're familiar with Shadowrun already.\nPlus, the gameplay mechanics REEEEALLY take their time to show up, so the first hours just feel like a very well-written novel accompanied with an hyper-basic combat system.\n(The ending is great, although I wouldn't have minded one final stop by the Union. So that's a bit rushed too.)\n\nBut give it time.\nThe first hours may feel like an eternal introduction, but after that it'll be a pleasurable ride!\nThe skill tree may seem irrelevant at first, but it will really make a difference later on.\nThe combat system gets more and more satisfying the more you play and advance with your character, also thanks to bigger fire power that is accompanied with gratifyingly fat gun sounds. And btw, the soundtrack is also really good and gives off that cyberpunk vibe quite well.\n\nThe story is very intriguing and the characters very interesting folks (the companions too)!\nSo yeah, I really enjoyed my journey to get justice for Sam, and every new detail I discovered felt like an exciting twist to the plot.\n\nPlot and awesome dialogues will keep you hooked, but don't expect an open-world game: there's a hub you always get back to, but it's a linear trip through predetermined areas.\nIn fact, there are plenty of stakes to attest the woodiness felt at the beginning... You'll get used to it, but all the limitations are still downside.\nIndeed, the linear progression, the almost non-existent environmental interaction, the impossibility to kill anyone that isn't an enemy, etc. make you feel very routed into a specific direction.\nBesides, the talk options (even tho always top-notch, quality-wise) are often different ways of saying the same thing, and I felt like the choices that actually mattered were very few... most often it's just a matter of taking the secondary quest or not.\nThere's still some space to 'do your own thing' through the character's skill tree, which is fun to build, but I think it's fair to say that Shadowrun Returns doesn't let many doors open for experimentation and sandbox elements. Or, actually, it never does.\nOn this, I've gotta say that it's the polar opposite of Deus Ex.\n\nThat depends on what you're looking for, as for considering it a good or a bad thing.\nPersonally, I'm obsessed (not pleasure, just compulsion) with seeing every single pixel of any game I play, so I often end up abandoning free-roaming games because they're a bit too much to handle for me.\nHad it been more open, instead of linear and strict as it is, I might haven't enjoyed it as much.\n\nI beat it in 20 hrs across 4 straight days and all the cons ceased to matter as soon as I got deeper into the plot.\nI mean, it's really addictive if you let it be. It's exactly what I needed right now and I think it's really immersive and fun to play.\nBefore this I played 2 short games and before that I've had a 3 years long phase of disregard for singleplayer games and hadn't played anything at all in a year.\nThe amount of hours I spent daily on this, considering what I just said, speaks for itself.", "timestamp_created": 1631814531, "timestamp_updated": 1631903355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552238762378692627", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99456313": {"recommendationid": "99456313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139385941", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1608165488}, "language": "english", "review": "I mainly played this on GOG, so my hours on Steam do not accurately reflect my experience.\n\nAs a cRPG, its decent.

Not only that this game might be the title responsible for the comeback of classic isometric CRPGs, but also compared to many other CRPG titles of this new era it doesn't feel under-cooked, nor directionless. It's one of the few modern CRPGs with a good combat system in my humble opinion. I might be biased, but I do prefer this kind of tactical turn-based combat to the so called \"real time with pause\" combat, which is trying to be both tactical and action-like at the same time, while it fails at both. I don't hate on \"real time with pause\" RPGs, but the turn-based combat system is simply the superior choice for me. So in this regard I think that the authors made the right decision when they introduced this well designed turn-based combat system. If you are anything like me, you are going to love it. The karma system confused me a little at the start, but when I got into it, I found out that it's actually very well thought-out and functional system, which is easily understandable. I know that some people have criticized it for its simplicity, but personally I don't see a reason to make it more complex. That would feel forced and unnecessary to me. The game is little bit more linear compared to most RPGs, but I must say that I was glad for that fact since it gave the story much more natural flow.

The game was originally released as a [url=http://www.shadowruntabletop.com/]tabletop[/url] game and also a part of a [url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/532/Shadowrun_Trilogy/]trilogy[/url], with this game being the first. As someone who never played the original tabletop game, this will be my first time stepping into this series.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- 4 difficulties\n- Limited resources\n- Freedom to build the character that you want\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- No skill reset\n- Some puzzles don't give enough hints to solve them manually\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like turn-based strategy games that are heavily focused on the story, buy this game.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe visuals in [b]Shadowrun Returns[/b] are not that different from the environment that we see today, filled with hi-tech technologies to make it fits the cyberpunk-themed world. Despite it combining both cyberpunk and fantasy themes, I didn't find any trace of fantasy from the visuals. The environment still looks good as long as you are not looking at the character models closely, although the top-down view helps a lot. Character portraits are also good enough to please you with their gorgeous look, even for the ugliest man that the game claims to be.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nYou need to read a lot to understand the story, and by that, I mean a lot. The game does a good job to convey what a mere portrait couldn't do by explaining everything that a character looks like or do, which helps to see their personalities. The inner monologue that you have when you are moving between places also helps to resonate with what's going on in the main character's mind.\n\nThe use of exquisite words might make the story to be hard to read to some people. I had difficulties understanding some words and there were times when I had to reread the same dialogues over and over. Luckily, the game does a good job of doing a recap of the current situation, which helps a lot to confirm my assumption and inform me of the info that I missed.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2547533564\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nI didn't expect that the gameplay will be this detailed and varied, giving you more options on what you can do in combat. Characters are divided into several races that have different traits. From there, you can build the character to be what you want - you can wield guns, hack computers, shoots magic, operates drones, summons spirits, or do a combination of them. You'll also have stat points that you can allocate to accommodate these skills, and if it's not enough, you also can buy gears to increase your stat. Everything is customizable to allow you to create the character that you need.\n\nFor a game that allows you to customize a lot of things, I found it hard to believe that it also limits your freedom by providing limited resources. It was hard to decide my character's build since you only have limited stat points with no option to reset them. Moreover, you also have a limited amount of money to buy gears and possibly consumables, and there are just too many options to choose from. In the end, I chose to build a character that didn't need much tinkering. It did work after some adjustment, although I wished I could reset some of my stat points after realizing that I invested in a stat that I never used.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2547533758\n\nThe game is mostly linear, with you having to talk to characters to progress the game. You'll be able to select between several options to progress the story which will lead to a conversation between you and other people. Despite the many dialogue options, everything will eventually lead to the same conclusion, with you having to deal with different dialogues. There are some exceptions, although they usually don't matter for the story as a whole. Your stat will also help to skip through some parts of the game if you have the right stat to back it up.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nCombat is the same as other turn-based strategy games, with you having up to four characters in your party. Although you'll start solo, the game will allow you to hire more party members for one mission later on. All combats are scripted, meaning that you won't deal with it unless you need it to progress the story. There will be times when you have to deal with more than battles in the same area, and you need to conserve HP between battles.\n\nThe addition of [i]deckers[/i] helps to make the combat more colorful. You can think of [i]deckers[/i] as a more improved version of hackers, where you can project yourself in cyberspace. They will be able to do this while you're in combat, allowing you to do two types of combats at the same time. Since [i]deckers[/i] will be alone in cyberspace, they will be able to summon some programs to help them, provided that they have the summon programs equipped. This will make them weaker in real-world battles since their equipment slot will be filled with [i]decker[/i]-related items. The non-[i]deckers[/i] will also need to protect the [i]deckers[/i] while they are connected to cyberspace since they will have their hands full with virtual battles. Sadly, there aren't many areas where you can do these things. I wish the game will also explore more into this side.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2547533500\n\n[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]\nI finished the campaign in 12.5h in the easiest difficulty. There are four difficulties in total, and since I'm not good at strategy games, I found the difficulty to fit me well. There were times when my party members died since I wasn't being careful, but you won't have trouble in defeating the enemies as long as you're careful. You don't have to worry much about your build either - I admit that I spent a lot of my stats on a stat that I never used, but I still able to do fine in battles.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nSome puzzles don't give enough hints to solve manually, forcing me to brute force the solution if I didn't have the right stat to bypass them. The accuracy for some characters is also messed up - I could get a very low accuracy even when I am standing right in front of an enemy.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI prefer to call [b]Shadowrun Returns[/b] a visual novel with a turn-based strategy element rather than a turn-based strategy game due to its number of dialogues. I didn't mean it as a bad thing though - the narrative does a good job to let you immersed with the world, although people who hate reading will find the number of dialogues to be daunting to read. Moreover, there are a lot of subtle details that you need to figure out which can be easily missed if you just glimpsed through the texts.\n\nSurprisingly, they also didn't slack off on the gameplay department. I was surprised to see how well-thought it is, with the various builds that you can try out and use. Although I couldn't try all builds because of the resource limitation, I could try some of them by hiring people that use that build. Sadly, there wasn't a lot of combat in this game, or maybe it's overshadowed by the numerous amount of dialogues. It's still an enjoyable game though, and if you like to play a game in such settings, this is your game. Just make sure to read the dialogues as you play - you'll miss a lot otherwise.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1626332148, "timestamp_updated": 1626334700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792479634284973145", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95752965": {"recommendationid": "95752965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040604509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1626450803}, "language": "english", "review": "Engaging story, good graphics, and while I have played the pen-and-paper years ago, enough info that I don't think it helped much.

In my opinion this game is an option ONLY for hardcore Shadowrun fans AND if it is on a high discount.\n\nPro:\n* Shadowrun :)\n* Nice sound\n\nCon:\n* Graphics is really annoying: The isometric view sucks and you cannot change the camera position. For a turn-based game this is really bad when you move into a position just to find out that you cannot aim at your target. The turn may be lost and you even want to re-load.\n* The game itself is way too linear. Basically there is no freedom - you follow the story. Period.\n* Actually you can move in small - sometimes tiny - maps only. No way to explore anything outside the small/tiny maps.\n* It's not immersive at all. I never had the feeling to really be there and feel \"Shadowrun\" if you know what I mean. Lack of ambience.\n* A lot of text reading - no voice over. Maybe acceptable back in 2013.\n* Fights are very repetitive and short.\n* Basically the game alternates between you talking to people (read text, few dialog options) and then you fighting. Then repeat.\n\nThe game felt boring to me and at some point I just wanted to finish it. That's actually really sad because I've read some really great Shadowrun books and I think the setting has definitely great potential for a PC game. But this game did not pick up the atmosphere. Maybe due to the fact that the whole story basically unfolds via dialogs the story itself is quite short.

It's a bit more like an adventure game than most CRPGs I've played, but still pretty cool for the atmosphere. I did have one constant gripe throughout, though - the UI didn't seem to always engage my clicks where I wanted. It wasn't a big issue....until close to the final encounters.\n\nMy game just kept soft-locking after some scripted dialogue interrupts combat. And there were about 3 fights before this happened, where you are stuck in combat the whole time, and (genius decision here) you can't save in the middle of combat. Fallout, a game that came out over a decade before SRR, handled turn-based combat better. What. happened. here?! Worse yet, I found a forum post that stated in 2014 about this issue and was revisited by someone in late 2020 to confirm that this game breaking bug still exists 6 years after release.

For those unfamiliar with this series Shadowrun started out as a tabletop RPG and has seamlessly made the transition into a computer RPG series thanks to the team at Harebrained Schemes.  These are very much story-driven games featuring a brilliant tactical combat system to support the gameplay.  I loved Shadowrun Dragonfall when I played through it close to five years ago and I finally got the chance to play the Returns, the first game in the series.  As someone who likes to play lots of different games it is always a challenge to commit myself to a lengthy RPG.  That said I find the Shadowrun universe such a interesting setting and I'm so glad I had the chance to revisit it.\n\nShadowrun Returns starts when you get a video message on your computer from someone you used go running with.  See shadow runners are freelancers who get paid to do other peoples dirty work.  Turns out your friend Sam has met his end and he is offering you a reward if you can find out who killed him.  If working for a dead man isn't interesting enough you start to unravel much bigger plots at play.  You'll start by investigating the local bar where Sam used to spend much of his time at.  Conveniently this bar happens to be a great place to pick up some jobs and the supplies need to go along with them.  Eventually you meet one of Sam's relatives and find out they have ties to the Universal Brotherhood, a religious organization which, after some investigating, appears to have some nasty secrets going on behind the scenes.\n\n\nYou'll spend an equal amount of time or more in battle as you will reading the massive script that makes up the storyline.  Shadowrun Returns is a tactical strategy game where you'll find your team and the opposing forces on a large grid often compose of multiple rooms and scattered furniture.  You and your opponents takes turns and on your turn each of your characters usually have two actions they can take.  Whether you move, attack, or use an ability these each will take one action point.  When you go to attack an enemy you see a percentage of the chance that you'll land a hit on them.  This percentage has many factors that go into it such as the distance between you and your foe, your proficiency level with your weapon, and whether your opponent is out in the open or behind cover.\n\nOnly your main character will you need to level up stats for as all your other companions you'll just hire from the local network of available shadow runners.  There are some major skills such as Quickness, Strength, Intelligence, and Willpower.  Each of these skills has subcategories which can only be leveled up to as far as you have leveled the overlapping skill.  This means it will probably be best to focus on two or three areas to specialize in rather than attempt to be a jack of all trades.  There are different archetypes that specialize in close quarters combat, magic abilities, decking (hacking), summoning spirits, and rigging drones.  Having a team that compliments your own skills and gives you flexibility in combat is key to surviving the rather unforgiving scenarios throughout the game.\n\nI've always enjoy tactical RPGs from Final Fantasy Tactics Advance to Banner Saga and I can confidently say that the Shadowrun series can easily stand with the greats.  What is most unique about Shadowrun is the incredible universe the games are set in which combines cyberpunk and fantasy in a wholly-believable modern setting.  Even aside from the deep and fascinating storytelling is a equally complex but manageable combat system and character progression.  As you barely get through one fight to another each new upgrade you receive feels like a godsend and will provide just the edge you need to survive your next encounter.  There is a lot of reading to get through to enjoy the storyline but if you don't mind that and wish to sink your teeth into a deeply rewarding tactical RPG look no farther than Shadowrun Returns.", "timestamp_created": 1618157823, "timestamp_updated": 1618157823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570405960083007813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90139810": {"recommendationid": "90139810", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970613265", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 596, "last_played": 1430944511}, "language": "english", "review": "Play Dragonfall instead!

Shadowrun Returns at least offers diversity in engaging battles, since there\u2019s also plenty of options in character creation. But there\u2019s still some pacing issues in the beginning. And if it wasn\u2019t for the fascinating setting and great artwork, I probably would\u2019ve given up sooner. Thankfully, the narrative escalates not too long and does end in places for further expansion.\n\nI mainly play for the story. And I was hoping that Shadowrun would be exceptional because of its interesting blend of swords-and-sorcery fantasy and Neoromancer-esque cyberpunk themes. \n\nShadowrun Returns takes place in a futuristic but decadent Seattle in 2054. The world is ran by large corporations and a growing cult with humans and mythical races and creatures, such as elves, dwarves, orks (sic), and trolls. A fascinating setting with many possibilities to explore, right? But after finishing it thought, I can\u2019t really say that I was fully satisfied nor downright disappointed. It\u2019s.. just ok. \n\nThere are factors that may have contributed to what I feel about the plot. The writing can be awkward at times (they switch the f-word with \u201cfrag\u201d and sh** with \u201cdrek\u201d) and the pacing can be slow. But the dialogue isn\u2019t awful too and does have its moments, and they aren\u2019t few. As for the pacing, this is only an issue to me at the start where they seem to attempt to do some worldbuilding and tone-setting through exposition. Furthermore, the title does have DLCs so perhaps I can try those out to get a better look into its world and lore.\n\nIts combat system also balances out the shortcomings of the narrative. There\u2019s plenty of ways to go about a battle because of the diversity of its character creation\u2014another good thing about the game. Players can choose a path of magic or technology. And this doesn\u2019t mean a predictable dichotomy of melee and ranged attacks, by the way. You can opt to be a sword-wielding ork that can withstand magic assaults or become an elf decker (hacker) who can be destructive when infiltrating the matrix.\n\nPerhaps the best thing I like about this game is the artwork. Though it depicts a somewhat pessimistic outlook of the future, Shadowrun Returns offers tons of great design in landscape and architecture. Because of this, it perfectly contributes to the tone and atmosphere of the game.\n\nHaving said that, another thing that bums me out is that there\u2019s very little exploration. I suppose I should have done my homework on this end, but I expected it to be an open-world or something close to that. But it\u2019s not. So you only get to see a small portion of Seattle. Still, it isn\u2019t a major issue to me.\n\nI'll consider trying out the additional content. But for Shadowrun Returns, it's a decent 12- to 15-hour RPG if you just want to finish the main story. I can definitely see people spending more time trying out other builds and finishing the side quests. \n\n3/5", "timestamp_created": 1616329445, "timestamp_updated": 1616329445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88798238": {"recommendationid": "88798238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037459998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 7826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7673, "last_played": 1625968418}, "language": "english", "review": "still fun", "timestamp_created": 1616286039, "timestamp_updated": 1616286039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88796524": {"recommendationid": "88796524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872391733", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 8452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8452, "last_played": 1585925214}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fine, played it a little", "timestamp_created": 1616283455, "timestamp_updated": 1616283455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497379422187805176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88796368": {"recommendationid": "88796368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050255700", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5726, "last_played": 1653275255}, "language": "english", "review": "I have enjoyed playing ShadowRun the video game for years.

The gameplay and way you can build your character is pretty varied but the lack of impact that positioning has on the combat makes it less complex than it should be.\n\nAnd another gameplay element that I wish was more developed was the mercenary hiring system but my idea of what it should be would probably make the game fundamentally different because I'd want it at least developed to the point of being like MGSV's background base system so there maybe I would be asking for too much or something that's not really what the game is about.\n\nThe main highlight of the game for me were the quests where you have to do corporate espionage that isn't just 'Go kill thing for banker man'.\n\nBut I'd recommend it for anyone who likes RPG's with lots of dialogue checks akin to FNV because there's a metric fuckton of them.

Additionally, it's shipped with an official campaign called Dead Man's Switch. Therefore, I'll split this review into two parts: one is for the gameplay and the other is for the official campaign.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nOverall, the gameplay is inspiring at first but deteriorates later due to the lack of balance. On the one hand, it offers you so many races and classes which seem to derive lots of possibilities, on the other hand, the combat system disables most of them. Ranged samurais predominate the battle field, eclipsing the mages, shamans and riggers (the class who use drones in a combat).\nWhy do I attach so much importance on the combat system? That's because the others are irrelevant compared with the combat. You don't have to restart when you have no one to deck (the hacking in this game) or to convince the npc, because the campaign always leaves another approach as an alternative. However, when you lose a combat, you lose literally and have to restart. In other words, the combat system dominates the others.\nThis does NOT mean the game is unbalanced, though. On the contrary, the game gives you many extra options by adding these subordinate systems and can surprise you very often when you're not playing as a gunner. \"Inspiring\" , as I said before.\nThe unbalanced system is actually the combat system itself. Mages can wield powerful magic, shamans can summon devastating spirits and riggers can deploy versatile drones. However, mages suffer from long skill cooldown and high missing penalty, shamans' spirits can accidentally escape as an new enemy and riggers' drones are expensive comparing runners for hire. Besides, deckers can only control gunturrets in few cases (not drones deployed by your enemies), while eloquence is totally useless during combat. Nevertheless, close combat is risky and ill-advised because of the mechanism of overwatching. Generally speaking, gunners are too strong to be defeated. I played as a dwarf decker who also specialized in pistols at first, ending up as a pistol user who had a few tricks in decking :-\\\nThis game features an additional set of combat called decking, which takes place in a cyber-world. Some may find it innovative while others get annoyed. \nApart from these shortcomings, the combat system of this game is similar to XCOM series, including \"99% then miss\" :-P . Thus you can enjoy it if you like both XCOM series and text-based rpgs. And this game has a \"save rewinding\" mechanism, which allows you to recover your deleted saves, which really saved me once.\n\n[h1]Official Campaign[/h1]\nNow let's switch to the dead man's switch. Generally speaking, it's an ordinary whodunit with several gameplay bugs (personally, I only experienced once and it was negated by frequently saving). Thanks to the vast setting of Shadowrun and the diversity in the combat system, the campaign is still interesting enough to be enjoyed.\nThe artwork is excellent. It's challenging to create harmony when cyber elements collide with magic, but they succeeded. Soundtracks seem a little repetitive but not annoying.\nThe quality of the official campaign became worse after mid-game, which might be attributed to rushing. Some typing error occurred in some late-game dialogues, such as \"the the only one\" and \" by the by\". [b](Spoiler warning)[/b] What disappointed me most was [spoiler]the insufficient description of Lynne, the female elf cousin. On the basis of the description, she had no motives to enter such a cult. In my opinion, it makes this deliberately designed story with nesting conspiracy incomplete. [/spoiler]Despite this, the story is well-crafted with plenty of decisions waiting to be made. It captures the spirit of cyberpunk, and can be further improved with voice-acting.\n\nAs a Kickstarter project, Shadowrun Returns is not a disappointment. However, it's not extraordinary, either. The enriched gameplay system is not well balanced thus it's hard to say that there is replay value in this game even with Workshop contents. The official campaign seems more like an unfinished masterpiece.\nOr maybe I'm too harsh on an indie game.\n\n3/5 Enjoyable", "timestamp_created": 1612071271, "timestamp_updated": 1698470498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531186699867248535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85662572": {"recommendationid": "85662572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027448965", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 316, "last_played": 1612058344}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, challenging turn-based RPG.

Sometimes the interface is a little clunky but in general it works.\n\tOn normal, the fight difficulty is weird : I made a specialized tank and he wiped the floor with every enemy encountered, on the other hand, the stat distribution of your team is quite weak, so even the gunfighter you hire will underperform in the fight.

However, I believe I have a solid grasp on what makes this game special so I've decided to review it only six hours into the game. Some of my pros/cons may or may not extend throughout the entire game.\n\n---\n\nShadowrun Returns is an exceptionally atmospheric cyberpunk RPG. Alluring neon colors are balanced by the dull grays of the concrete jungle. A murder mystery blossoms into a much more complex scenario that delves into the dark themes that are signature to this genre. The soundtrack evokes mystery and a sense of modern wonder. Tie this together with one of the more intriguing cyberpunk franchises out there and you have a great recipe for an instant classic of a video game.\n\nDon't go in expecting a Deus Ex or Cyberpunk 2077; this game is linear almost to a fault. There is virtually zero exploration and the storylines don't really branch beyond some basic choice-and-consequence. The greatest shame to this linearity is the fact that the Shadowrun franchise is extremely compelling. It marries traditional fantasy with the dystopian themes of the cyberpunk genre, creating a world that has literal technomancy: magic and technology together. This is a fresh concept, indeed, as most cyberpunk content focuses more on the classic definition of \"high tech, low life\". Shadowrun takes that and blends it with mystic elements to create something that truly stands out among the genre. As a result, I just want to take my time and really explore the world and concept that Jordan Weisman devised.. but due to this game's linearity, the full extent of this exploration is limited to simply looking at the game world as I progress through it. Fortunately, this game's art is phenomenal.\n\nThat leads me to point out two of the game's strongest points: storytelling and atmosphere. Due to the linearity of the game, the story is very focused. It's not about accumulating side quests and grinding to max levels. This game is about creating a character you want to play and then progressing through a great story, meeting memorable characters and just soaking in the exceptional cyberpunk atmosphere. Despite being an isometric RPG, this game has absolutely zero trouble immersing me fully into the world. The game's story does a solid job of not only immersing the player into the world but it also really serves to teach new players the core principles and lore of the series. That's something that not every game can pull off easily. The atmosphere constantly gives the player the feeling of living in a near-future world where technology and society have gone wrong; with magic added to the mix, it truly gives the game an ambient sense of oppression, like society is truly teetering on the edge of total collapse.\n\nI should also mention that the game's combat system is actually quite solid. I'm NOT a fan of turn-based combat systems at all (with the exception of Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games). That being said, Shadowrun Returns' combat system is simplistic in a great way and manages to somehow avoid many of the things that typically frustrate me about this sort of combat. I've seen many compare the game's combat to XCOM and while I own an XCOM game, I have yet to play it so I can't really speak as to the accuracy of that comparison. All I CAN say, however, is that it gives me classic Fallout vibes, minus some of the really irritating aspects of those games' combat systems. It's a simple as action points that determine how far you can maneuver and whether or not you can even fire your weapon. It's certainly nowhere near Larian's level of brilliance but it serves its purpose well. I've never once felt irritated/frustrated by this game's combat which is a MAJOR accomplishment for a turn-based combat system, in my book.\n\nOverall, as long as you go in with realistic expectations and as long as you have at least a passing interest in the cyberpunk genre, I'm certain you'll enjoy this game. I actually bought this game well over a year ago in response to my first bit of interest that I had toward the then-upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 and it served as a pretty decent introduction to the genre. I followed it up by buying the rest of the trilogy and the entire Deus Ex series and now, with 2077 finally out, I consider myself to be quite a passionate fan of this genre of fiction... but I digress, this game is fantastic and I definitely recommend it. Just remember that this isn't Fallout, Baldur's Gate, etc. It's very linear, but it's extremely well-written and soaked with cyberpunk atmosphere. If you're looking for a fun game to play on the side while enjoying Cyberpunk 2077, or just want to give this genre a shot, definitely consider grabbing this one!", "timestamp_created": 1608554112, "timestamp_updated": 1608554112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596141993999481201", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82726883": {"recommendationid": "82726883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051262703", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 750, "last_played": 1540720142}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome rpgwith captivating script and good mechanics", "timestamp_created": 1608427099, "timestamp_updated": 1608427099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82724276": {"recommendationid": "82724276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133125215", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 1088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 518, "last_played": 1608563440}, "language": "english", "review": "Katana beats gun, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1608423865, "timestamp_updated": 1608423865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82636948": {"recommendationid": "82636948", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977924508", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1608615057}, "language": "english", "review": "Tightly paced if somewhat simplistic mechanically.", "timestamp_created": 1608312399, "timestamp_updated": 1608312399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82617828": {"recommendationid": "82617828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042607269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1221, "last_played": 1545453656}, "language": "english", "review": "Double plus good", "timestamp_created": 1608290681, "timestamp_updated": 1608290681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82579499": {"recommendationid": "82579499", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981226734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 971, "last_played": 1602433487}, "language": "english", "review": "Played through multiple times.

I got this game because I'm an RPG fan and will buy almost any RPG game.  I didn't really understand much of the Shadowrun world so I can't really comment on that - someone who is a fan, might enjoy it.\n\nHowever, as an RPG fan, I can't say that I really did.  It's a short, basic game.  There are supposed to be different ways to build a character (and hire runners to balance the party out) and certain stats can let you do things differently (maybe find a different route, get more money, etc.).  Yet, the game never really captivated me (again it might just be because I'm not a Shadowrun fan) and I ended up just using cheats to buff my character (i.e. all money and karma I needed). It felt like even cheats didn't make much difference in the long run - I never felt like i was in danger of dying, seeing all available options just showed that while different ways of doing things was nice in theory, it never really felt meaningful (just more like the game made it so you would never be locked out of something no matter your build).\n\nCombat felt just too slow for my tastes.  My main issue was that once in mission, you are always in turn base, which meant it took a long time for you to gather your party together so you can move into the next room as a group instead of just one person who would get slaughtered.

Yes it is a pro because since it is all text-based, I do not get too distracted and I can really pay attention to the lore. When there are too many side quests, and tons of text to read (like Divinity, which I love anyway) I loose context and forget things, this never happens in this game. The story is simple but it captured my attention for the entire game. \n- The combat is hard enough (normal difficulty) to keep me concentrated but, at the same time, it is not too complicated to cause any rage-quit.\n- The drones were a lot of fun. I love this type of builds, but only few games have this class (rigger) so it was a nice surprise to have an \"engineer-like\" character.\n\nCON\n- The karma system is not very intuitive. It is not clear what advances every new point gives you.

I had to do a quest without my drones to avoid a loop.\n- This is not really a con, it is more a suggestion for new players: save.the.hell.out.of.this.game.

Aunque yo no lo considerar\u00eda 'rol' del todo y lo meter\u00eda m\u00e1s bien dentro del saco de t\u00edtulos similares a XCOM.\n\nTengo sentimientos encontrados con la obra, que me ha dejado buen sabor de boca entre muchas puntillas que no acaban de gustarme del todo. Como resultado de un Kickstarter puedo decir que promete mucho llevar a videojuego este sistema y no han hecho un mal trabajo, pero se nota que ha quedado much\u00edsimo por pulir/a\u00f1adir. En las doce horas que me ha durado acabar la campa\u00f1a (algo que como ya he dicho me resulta poco) he encontrado una traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol penosa plagada de erratas, much\u00edsimos bugs y poca libertad limitada a los escasos y peque\u00f1os mapas por los que moverse. Aviso, con cierta dureza, que el control y los men\u00fas resultan algo engorrosos, m\u00e1s cuando has terminado un combate y est\u00e1s obligado a seguir realizando acciones por turnos. Es un detalle infumable.\n\nPara empezar dejo claro que resulta mejor darle ca\u00f1a en ingl\u00e9s sin dudarlo, ya que la traducci\u00f3n llega a puntos que te marean o pierdes el hilo de la trama. El argumento de la obra es genial y el punto fuerte que me empuja a recomendarlo, con un par de compa\u00f1eros y NPCs carism\u00e1ticos que te da tiempo a encari\u00f1arte aunque no de disfrutar. Sin embargo, y aqu\u00ed es donde voy a empezar a lanzar piedras, en la breve experiencia me he topado con muchas cosas que dificultan disfrutarlo.\n\nYa de base hay un bug bastante molesto que deja la partida en medio de un combate, sin pasar entre turnos, obligando a cerrar el juego y cargar la escena por donde guardaste antes de la susodicha batalla. Me ha pasado un par de veces y si es una pelea larga sienta como una patada en el centro de gravedad. Adem\u00e1s de eso la m\u00fasica da errores y se solapa si por ejemplo estas con un Decker surfeando por la Matriz o los enemigos a veces actuan de forma bastante extra\u00f1a, exponi\u00e9ndose a los ataques debido a una IA muy b\u00e1sica que no cambia aunque aumentes la dificultad. Como resultado el juego es muy f\u00e1cil. He llevado un elfo samurai de melee sin hechizo alguno y muchos implantes que no han conseguido tumbarme ni una sola vez en toda la campa\u00f1a. Sab\u00eda de antemano que lo suyo era un Adepto para ese tipo de personaje pero tir\u00e9 de Samurai Callejero (que aqu\u00ed suelen llevar armas de fuego, lo que me hace dudar de la denominaci\u00f3n 'Samurai') solo para demostrar que a base de golpes en seco pod\u00eda acabarlo.\n\nDicho esto tambi\u00e9n carece de contenido y variables. Donde hay que interactuar en cada mapa viene marcado dejando las posibilidades bien obvias como si llevaras anteojeras para caballos, por lo que solo hay que seguir las marcas realzando que tu avance es una l\u00ednea recta. Hay muy poco armamento y armaduras que me dan la sensaci\u00f3n que son como la tapa dura que cubre un verdadero sistema de rol y por su brevedad tienes acceso a ellas en cero coma. Siquiera voy a mencionar la carencia de misiones secundarias, una perla muy gorda.\n\nY ya por \u00faltimo, pero no menos importante, hay clases que son pr\u00e1cticamente in\u00fatiles en la campa\u00f1a. Un claro ejemplo es el Decker, que solo necesitas de verdad uno en todo el juego y te lo consigue un NPC. Eso de meterte en la Matriz es flipante, pero he llevado uno a la misi\u00f3n final como resultado tuve un runner in\u00fatil, aunque como ha sido f\u00e1cil no fue problema alguno. Todo lo dem\u00e1s es divertido de viciar aunque con evidentes diferencias en cuanto a eficacia, pero como montas tu grupo antes de cada misi\u00f3n puedes probar distintos formatos de equipo que se adapten a tu estilo y as\u00ed equilibrar la balanza.\n\nEn definitiva recomiendo darle un tiento aunque no esperes nada del calibre o complejidad que portan los cl\u00e1sicos del g\u00e9nero. Aunque puedes subir con karma los atributos, habilidades y hechizos del personaje, eso es lo m\u00e1ximo que encontrar\u00e1s para tener tu chute rolero. Yo jugu\u00e9 una vez a Shadowrun (2e o 3e), ya que soy de D&D, y lo recuerdo mucho m\u00e1s extenso y completo en comparaci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, las opciones de di\u00e1logo son escasas (quitando alguna opci\u00f3n extra depende del Carisma y el atributo al que est\u00e9 ligada) y todas ellas llevan pr\u00e1cticamente a lo mismo. Eso s\u00ed, tengo que probar Dragonfall y Hong Kong porque han pulido los puntos d\u00e9biles que tiene la primera entrega y huelo llevarme m\u00e1s de una sorpresa. Shadowrun Returns es para echar un rato y la rejugabilidad es escasa o nula. Eso s\u00ed, la ambientaci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s que flipante.", "timestamp_created": 1607011768, "timestamp_updated": 1663173522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575027048587799072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81459070": {"recommendationid": "81459070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972111673", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1656336024}, "language": "english", "review": "FUN!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1606910352, "timestamp_updated": 1606910352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81458377": {"recommendationid": "81458377", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991475407", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 861, "last_played": 1607289263}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy to learn the system.

Sam died and before he died he recorded this video so that you could track down his killer and get a reward if you find them and bring them to justice. A detective story unfolds as you are trying to find out who killed him and why. The game will just immerse you in the story which is very well written and is also lots of fun (with lot of references to previous games and lore).\n\nAfter you find the killer and find out why Sam was killed you will also uncover a horrific fact about a cult that wants to bring extraplanar creatures into the realm that would most probably just devastate it. The problem? These creatures are pretty much immortal unless you get your hands on a special prototype weapon that can kill these spirits. The final fight is probably the biggest downside of the game. You need too kill the creature with conventional weapons first (or Magic or spirits). Next round it will turn into a spirit that is immune to all this but the prototype weapon. You've got that one round to hit it 3 times in order to kill it and you've got max. 80% chance of actually hitting if you are standing close enough. You've got two shots before you need to reload and have 2 (max. 3) characters with this weapon. If you don't succeed it will turn into a physical creature again and you gotta try again. The final fight thus is rather annoying and long. \n\nAs for the graphics, I really like the hand painted ones but the 3d models felt a bit bland. The graphics in overall creates a good and fitting atmosphere for the game.\n\nMusic and sound effects is another story. This might be just me but I have to say that both were rather jarring. While the sound effects are ok in terms of not sounding totally out of place they still didn't sound quite right for my ears. The music I didn't enjoy at all. There is no voice acting. \n\nThere are two parts to gameplay. The game is story driven so mostly you will be reading dialogues and descriptions of scenes or characters. Depending on how your character is build (which skills it has) you might be able to choose different answer or actions. My character turned out to be charismatic Decker specialized in melee combat. The reason was that thanks to high Charisma I got to talk my way through dialogues, being a hacker allowed me to do some necessary running around Matrix safely. Being good in combat is probably a necessity since you will go on runs that will sooner or later end up being pure tactical turn-based combat. You will have 1-4 characters to your disposal. Each character has action points that you can spend each turn to either move (and attack), move, attack, use magic, summon spirits, use items. You can hide behind object to make it harder for your enemies to shoot you. You also need a good line of sight and distance to actually hit. Flanking is also something to consider. If all your squad will end up in one place you are certainly going to get hit by a grenade.\n\nThe game on the default difficulty is very easy so you don't need to worry about spending karma (the points that are spent to level up your skills) in a wrong way. The HUD is very basic but shows well your equipment and skills. You have a limited number of slots for everything, if you have more items they will go to your stash. You can either get items from your stash by physically going there or enter it when buying/selling stuff. At the beginning of each part of the story you will be allowed to change the stuff in your inventory so you don't need to go back in between chapters.\n\nVerdict\nShadowrun Returns is well polished game for a kickstarted funded game and it did the original p&p Shadowrun justice. It has a nice and well written story that has a twist that some may not enjoy that much. It has certain but limited amount of RPG elements, you can choose your class, learn skills and develop them. You can buy equipment, spells etc. The combat is tactical and turn-based, a pretty much a copy of X-com combat system. One of the things I enjoyed is walking in the Matrix (uses the same combat system).\n\nThe not so good things about the game is that the story is very linear and the world is not really open. You can walk around a bit but you can't interact much outside of the main story. You also hire runners for each run and you can't change equipment or develop their skills.\n\nIn general, this game is a relatively short adventure game that introduces one to the world of Shadowrun, tactical combat and some RPG elements.\n\nI'm not entirely sure to whom I'd recommend the game. I'd say that players like me who spent hours and hours playing Shadowrun in the past will enjoy this game. I'd also probably recommend this game to players that don't have much experience with gaming or are looking for an easy game to play.", "timestamp_created": 1606747272, "timestamp_updated": 1606747272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528005301952362061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81184373": {"recommendationid": "81184373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198864753338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 593, "last_played": 1606723246}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me 9.9 hours to clear it on normal.

You can choose to be a gunner, blade, hacker, etc, as well as more magic. You can also choose to modify your body with tech, but doing so causes you to lose touch with magic, if you choose to go that route. \nThe class system is not tied to the narrative, but certain activities require skills checks, the most common of which I encountered are intelligence/hacking/strength skill checks. I wish there were a few more skill checks in more narrative influencing setups that pushed you in a other directions. As it is, you can just go pure hacker and most of the story will be cake walk for you. The story parts, not the combat.\n\nThe tactical turn-based gameplay is how all the combat in this game is done. You get a set amount of action points and you cycle through your team, then the enemy does the same. Before most missions, you will be given a chance to purchase teammates to deploy, but you only get them for that one mission, which I didn't like much, as I didn't get a chance to bond with them. You do get a few recurring characters and they gorw on your a bit.\nBut what I really, really hated was the % hit chance this game employs. It plays like Xcom, where you get a % chance to hit depending on how far you are from the enemy, and unless you have leveled up that combat style, you will miss a lot. It is best to pick one weapon style, be it swords, guns, or magic, and stick with it, as you don't have the inventory space to hold multiple weapons.\n\nI would say that the inventory management in this game is a bit frustrating, as you need to be in the home hub to swap equipment. Also, enemies will not drop equipment. At best, you will find frag grenades in the occasional box, but you will mostly be rewarded with money for completing missions.\n\nIf the text is small on a 1920x1080 monitor, change the ingame resolution to 1360x768.\nIf the game is a bit hard and you don't mind a bit of cheating, Ctrl+F1 will open up a dev menu for you.", "timestamp_created": 1606369817, "timestamp_updated": 1606626284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79984325": {"recommendationid": "79984325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147450016", "num_games_owned": 890, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1813, "last_played": 1518711788}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, fun combat all in all great serries as a whole", "timestamp_created": 1606341342, "timestamp_updated": 1606341342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79842002": {"recommendationid": "79842002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094021929", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1388, "last_played": 1460178457}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a fan of the Shadowrun setting, I would say this is worth skipping a cup of coffee to buy.

It's based on a tabletop game with rich lore, set in a universe that combines cyberpunk and high fantasy elements. It has inspired a few 16-bit games in the 90's that had enough following to succesfully fund a [i]Kickstarter[/i] campaign that resulted in this video game. There's also plenty of references to those retro games that fans of the franchise will appreciate. But you don't have to be familiar with the lore to enjoy the game. I wasn't, but still understood what's what.\n\nThe progression is linear, which might be a problem for some, but I actually liked that, because I didn't have to spend time backtracking, and all the explorable bits were conveniently placed on the way towards the mission objectives. The missions are really well designed (with multiple stages, not too rushed, not tedious, with fun little twists). You just start the game and immerse into the story. The levels are intricate and detailed, conveying a cyberpunk atmosphere similar to [b]Deus Ex[/b], but with magic and metahumans (elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls). The game features 6 main classes (archetypes), which all are well balanced and, along with the equipment options, offer a 50/50  choice between magic and tech.\n\n[b]Shadowrun Returns[/b] is also relatively easy, and, as such, serves as a good introduction to turn-based squad games. If you have previously played games like [b]X-COM[/b], this will be a walk in the park for you.\n\nFurthermore, [b]Shadowrun Returns[/b] has a level editor and numerous mods. After finishing the main game, you can explore the community mods, many of which are full-scale campaigns with detailed stories. Or, if you have the patience and time, you can design your own. The level editor is intuitive and relatively easy-to-learn.\n\nI really don't have anything bad to say about [b]Shadowrun Returns[/b]. For what it is, it's great.\n\nBut for the game as a whole, for the experience and fun factor, [b]I give it[/b]: [u]8/10[/u].", "timestamp_created": 1604925451, "timestamp_updated": 1604925947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552086889743804932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78992869": {"recommendationid": "78992869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021671754", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 1519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 905, "last_played": 1695499675}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story writing and solid tactical combat.", "timestamp_created": 1604924244, "timestamp_updated": 1604924244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78985306": {"recommendationid": "78985306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058984338", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1604133964}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is pretty cool, but you can just buy Shadowrun: Hong Kong and install a mod that recreates this game's campaign.

Got to play it because I had no idea what to play, a full library and this was second in the recommended queue.\nTl;dr: the game is good, but mostly because of the immersion.\nAnd now for the longer version. I'll start with the bad parts, The combat is rather simplistic, not very challenging after a certain point (played on medium though, would suggest the hardest difficulty as I played the sequels on hard and it was still quite easy). The big plot twist in the story does feel somehow artificial. The game is quite short. I finished the whole campaign in less than 15 hours and I am very much the completionist type. Only had one go at it with a smoothtalking elven sharpshooter with augments. May or may not revisit at some point, mainly because it's so short and I can try out builds.\nThe great selling point of the game is the world and the immersion. Getting contracts for dirty work against corporations in 2054 is fun fun fun. Also, there's human augmentation and a reasonably fresh approach on magic. Despite its shortcomings, it leaves you with a feeling of wanting more at the end. \nAll in all, would recommend mainly as an appetizer for the series, as there are a number of moments in the sequels that will get *Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at the screen* reactions or make you smile a bit. \nSmall spoiler: the sequels are MUCH better.\nBriefly tried user-created campaigns, not a big fan.

The lack of choices do not matter much, though I did notice that, in some cases, if I had increased my charisma, I would get certain dialogue options available. This would've been fine, had it not been for the fact that I still got the same choices despite my lack of charisma. I simply had to keep the dialogue going for a little bit longer before I had the option. I also feel like some skills were wasted, charisma being one of them. I chose to play as a mage, but found myself just using a gun most of the time. Perhaps this is just me, but I feel as if they didn't do the mages properly here.\n\nTo keep things short...

But after actually playing XCOM, similar in combat, and other rpgs, Shadowrun falls short in execution.\n\nIMO, the biggest issue is inconsistency with probability and the number displayed. Maybe I'm going crazy, but the %'s do not appear to be accurate to the actual probability. I find things like using the right range when it's an S, M or L attack will give you a better shot. It's also really stupid how some characters are point blank and still 50% or worse! And 50% hit 2 out of 5 or worse. You definitely get a bonus from backstab that's not reflected in the %. But getting a backstab is almost impossible in the game because the characters turn around if you run around them. Sure, that's fine because why wouldn't they, but then why implement it? The only time you get backstab is when you attack from multiple angles, but if you are in that position, you're most likely already winning. And in this game, you never attack from multiple angles, usually the enemy reinforcements get the flank on you as the infiltrator. It is also so bizarre how we are using guns but it can end up in weak, normal, crit, and often times you get weak simply because they are facing your character.\n\nIt doesn't have all the bells and whistles of XCOM (not that it requires it), but the story/writing is also juvenile. It was great when you're just starting out and getting hooked in to the Shadowrun universe. But the way they weave in the plot with the mediocre combat just doesn't work out in the long run.\n\nAnd at the point where I'm reviewing the game, I think conversation locks using epithets and attribute levels is a joke in the game. You don't get much, just a minor alternative to progress through the same story. Like a little extra gold or saves you some combat.\n\nI want to say it's between a thumbs up and thumbs down? It's worth it enough to finish what is a story in a unique universe. But there are a lot of things wrong with it that if you can't love the first 20 minutes, you probably won't like it at all.", "timestamp_created": 1601250951, "timestamp_updated": 1604802850, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76611654": {"recommendationid": "76611654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176629082", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 348, "last_played": 1695786716}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a fan of the Shadowrun universe and lore.

Like most RPGs, min/maxing is the key to success; pick a primary method of attack, boost your skills, increase your hitpoints and your dodge abilities and you will be fine. Having the ability to cast healing spells or taking mercenaries who have the healing spell is very, very useful.\n\nFor a game that is in large parts centred around dialogue, the dialogue choices seem kind of meaningless and selecting different options doesn't seem to change the outcome of the conversations or the way the game unfolds. You can spend karma (XP) points to gain new \"etiquettes\" which allow you to automatically pass a few speech checks in the game - opportunities to use these special etiquette skills appear very infrequently and some don't seem to appear at all. Unlocking all of the etiquettes is very expensive in terms of karma points and simply not worth it.\n\nLikewise, the hacking skills seem very expensive and don't appear to be all that useful either. If you have no hacking skills, the game just assigns you an avatar provided to you by another in-game character, rather than forcing you to enter the virtual world and complete the hacking tasks yourself.\n\nWhile I could criticise the game for it's slightly clunky feeling during gameplay or the way the RPG systems seem to present a world of choice while ultimately still being quite limited, it must be considered also that this is a cheap game, made a few years ago with a relatively small development team. For 15-20 hours of fun, I think it's worth playing if you like cyberpunk settings, isometric RPGs and noir detective stories, just don't expect anything that is going to change your life.", "timestamp_created": 1600015766, "timestamp_updated": 1600015766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75916469": {"recommendationid": "75916469", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993378807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 631, "last_played": 1600881159}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a raw goodness to this classic game.

The central problem that I have with the game is that it is too short, though I do have a few gripes with your character stats. I enjoy short games and experiences, so let me explain.\n\nThe base campaign, Dead Man's Switch, felt like skim-reading an good novel. Most story characters you interact with only once, but are they written as if they have tremendous impact on the plot and main character. The story is like a murder mystery or police procedural, but I can't remember any discoveries you make that didn't feel like accidents. The primary obstacles seem inconsequential since they change or get overcome every mission. \n\nThis brevity leads to some dissatisfaction with the game's mechanics as well. There appears to be only one optional mission, and it could have easily been added to the linear plot. The shopkeepers refresh their inventory precisely 3 times during the campaign, so the end-game gear feels only incrementally stronger than the starting setup. You hire party members for missions, but they all have mediocre stats marginally better than your starting class. And although the game seems generous enough when allowing you to upgrade your own stats, by the end of the campaign I didn't feel any kind of mastery in even my highest stat area. \n\nSpeaking of my highest stat... Charisma is garbage in this game. In dialogue, it can occasionally give an alternate option which sometimes nets you a little extra money. However, charisma checks never allow you to unlock quest options that you couldn't get otherwise (either through another stat, money, or just... clicking to the next dialogue), and can be used to change someone's mind in an important way exactly once (to avoid a fight... if you happen to chose the right option during character creation, so it is not guaranteed). Now the developers were very clever and included some combat uses of charisma. However, these options are of little use in the best case, and have tremendous player-killing downsides in the worst case. The \"good\" abilities include a minor buff, a pitiful debuff, some extremely limited crowd control, and a spell called \"Silence\" which causes a character to not make any sound. The only problem with that last one is that this game does not feature stealth. I can recall a single mission in which you could sneak up behind an enemy... but doing so does not require \"Silence\"... and in every other instance enemies instantly see you. The ability with downside is summoning. Summoning either requires an expensive consumable item or for the tactical map to generously offer a location for summoning. When you summon a spirit, there is a random chance every turn for that spirit to irreversibly change from a party member to an enemy.

I have played the tabletop version of the game, and was unimpressed really. But this is about the game.\n\nI have never really been able to get into this game, or enjoy it. I feel like despite it advertising itself as an RPG, it railroads you pretty hard. It is more of a tactical turn based shooter like XCom or something, than it is a role-playing game. Character creation is fun, and at first it seems like there is so much that you will be able to do, so much diversity, so many different characters to make and experience the game in different ways through. This turns out to be an illusion. The etiquette system is pointless really, with almost no changes to the game as a whole. There are so many of them, as well as persuade, intimidate, etc etc. You would think that you could make a 'face' character focused on Charisma and charm and such, to talk your way through the game, but you can't. I can't emphasize more strongly that this is just wasting points.\n\nYou need guns, and you need spells. You really need spells. Playing a spell-caster makes this game easy mode. Playing anything other than a spell-caster, or a really powerful combat character will see your game ruined and you dead. The tech specialists in this game are disappointing, especially the ones who go into the matrix like computer realm. It is so pointless, it might have been removed completely from the game and no one would notice a difference. I could say more about this game, like the lack of compelling characters, or the boring music, or the fact that I don't really like the combat in this game (and it is mainly combat), etc, etc. Take it from a person who loves RPGs, both on the tabletop and in video games, this isn't very good.

For fans of the tabletop RPG first published in 1989 (raises hand) you'll find a classic rendition of one of the games's oldest and most beloved scenarios here. \n\nThe gameplay is simplifed turn-based grid \"X-COM lite\" with a fun and straighforward decking (hacking) minigame.  Shadowrun's greatest strength was always in its writing & world building, and that's present in good quantity.  This is a game to be read and savored, as are its two sequels Dragonfall and Hong Kong.  If one finds oneself skipping text, it is advised to save the game and pick up when less tired and more amenable to reading comprehension.  Because the game is a bit threadbare here and there, you'll want to cooperate with its spirit to get the most out of it.  That's truly the only way to get full value from this game -- read it like the visual RPG novella that it's trying to be, and enjoy the set battles in between the narrative arcs.\n\nShadowrun's other major strength, character customization, is here in spades as well.  Though the RPG system is very simplified compared to the textbook-like qualities of the tabletop game, it allows the player to enjoy any or all the iconic archetypes of Shadowrun as their main PC.\n\nSee you in the shadows, chummer.", "timestamp_created": 1595978372, "timestamp_updated": 1595978372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73431172": {"recommendationid": "73431172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104556588", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 726, "last_played": 1595965557}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encant\u00f3 la historia, algo r\u00e1pida no m\u00e1s de 12 horas para acabarla.

And then we have Returns.\n\nShadowrun Returns is split in 2 acts. I would say the first act is actually great. The second half however visibly loses steam and devolves into a slightly underwhelming ending. This game is quite obviously a proof of concept, which had to pave the way for the following masterpiece.\n\nFor this reason I recommend playing it last - I enjoyed it very much, but chances are I wouldn't have played the whole trilogy had I started with Returns. Dragonfall, on the other hand, made me completely obsessed, so much I started Hong Kong on the very same day I finished it.\n\nAnd now - I'm thinking of getting a SNES emulator to try the 1993 Shadowrun.

You do have a crew so it's possible to pass, but it's just stupid that such a blatant, game-breaking bug - which has been reported and talked about since release - has been around for over 6 years.

No. What it does offer is an entertaining, surprisingly ambitious narrative (with a number of satisfying plot twists), memorable characters and a reasonable degree of player agency within its linear framework.

Well worth your time and money! 5*", "timestamp_created": 1593202575, "timestamp_updated": 1593202575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616171479225158691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71412720": {"recommendationid": "71412720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850682860", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 947, "last_played": 1593186979}, "language": "english", "review": "short but fun", "timestamp_created": 1593186992, "timestamp_updated": 1593186992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71401139": {"recommendationid": "71401139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198812882618", "num_games_owned": 822, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1784, "last_played": 1593260465}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good RPG game.

The story is compelling and involved, but the dialogue and outcomes don't seem to matter aside from trivial consequences that fail to affect the main plotline.\n\nOn my first playthrough, I played the game blind, using the flashback scene as a tutorial to discern basic functionality and navigation, on the hard difficulty setting.  For a novice to the game, this was not challenging.  Even while I played against type as a Troll Mage/Samurai hybrid and wasted karma, this difficulty was hardly \"hard\".  I didn't learn about the ability to reload guns until using the Aegis guns on the final mission; even without reloading guns and budgeting ammunition, this was quite an easy difficulty level.\n\nOn my second playthrough, with a better understanding of the Mage, Samurai, and Shaman classes, I built I hybrid Mage/Shaman to complete the \"Very Hard\" difficulty setting.  With the exception of the early game, prior to having access to the Seamstress Union to obtain the basic Mage weapon, this difficulty setting has been mostly a breeze.  \n\nOn \"Very Hard\", there are some really frustrating occurrances that occur in the Matrix, which seem to be a result of the higher difficulty setting and are inconsistent.  The enemies are accurrate to a much longer range and deal higher damage.  However, when using the Docker recommended later in the campaign for the break-in to get Aegis, this game-generated character is unable to land a majority of hits at point-blank range and it gets worse at longer ranges.\n\nThe game prides itself as a setting in which magic and technology merge, but casting the \"Aim\" spell on the Docker doesn't transfer into the Matrix; likewise for \"Haste\" to provide an additional action point (AP).  The second spell failing to affect is most concerning since the Docker itself has the same AP in the physical world as it does in the Matrix.  This seems to imply that a Docker needs greater proficiency to have more AP in the Matrix, but this implication is unsupported by the karma skill selection.  If AP in the Matrix is proficiency-based, I would expect a less experienced Docker to have less AP in the Matrix and a more experienced Docker to have more AP.  Unfortunately, the skills do not support this.\n\n\nOther cons:\n* How does a game with such minimal requirements take so long to load a save game or switch between scenes?\n* There are shortcut keys, but the only way to know about them is through the tips in the loading screens; no in-game list or way to edit\n* Dialogue options appear before the character learns of the information relevant to the dialogue option; e.g., Dresden having an option about the Seamstress Union before it's mentioned\n* Unable to change equipment (armor, spells, weapons, etc.) of hired mercenaries\n* Unable to browse items or spells while an action, such as casting a spell, is being performed\n* Leylines are invisible outside of combat\n* Spells cannot be used outside of combat; e.g., \"Heal Wounds\"\n* Unable to loot enemies\n* Main plotline doesn't change based on player decisions\n* Inventory arrangement is randomly sorted on every load\n* Unbalanced skill leveling; had 68 unspent karm left on \"Very Hard\" at end of game (could have easily been 100 if not testing dialogue options for outcomes)\n* New characters do not start with equipment reflecting skillset: a classless character with all karma in Willpower and Spellcasting starts with a gun instead of Powerbolt\n* Despite constantly returning to the Seamstress Union, some sellable quest items are removed from your inventory if you do not sell them immediately after returning to the Seamstress Union before departing again\n* Group members can be targetted through portraits, but do not list effects on mouse-over unless casting\n* Statistically improbable outcomes in Matrix: missing three times in a row with a 50% chance-to-hit is 12.5% and routinely occurs with chance-to-hit of 60-plus\n* Statistically improbable miss rate on bug spirit forms in final level: missing five times in a row with a chance-to-hit of 70-plus for each character (two of seven shots hit); often, expect at least 30% to miss despite greater than 50% chance-to-hit metric displayed over enemy\n* Not being able to traverse alleyways supported by art but not by engine\n* Matrix enemies routinely attack from across the visible level with a success rate of about 30%; for \"Dodger Persona\", the chance-to-hit is below 50% and rate of success at this same distance is nill on three strikes in a row\n* About 10% of the time, at the beginning of a round, the game decides the character you must use and you cannot select another character\n* Avoiding the trap tile in the Matrix for the \"Elevator Control Node\" in Telestrian's office prevents access to the node until the trap tile is triggered\n* All buffs are lost (reset) when leaving one area of a level to proceed to the next, but countdown timers and AP are still current; can't buff after clearing an area before proceeding to the next\n* In the beginning, combat ends when all on-screen enemies are killed; later, combat does not function like this leading to using AP to navigate entire levels tediously", "timestamp_created": 1591895830, "timestamp_updated": 1591895830, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586439073085784912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70589504": {"recommendationid": "70589504", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985058328", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 963, "last_played": 1591803202}, "language": "english", "review": "An fine old-school turn based 'adventure'.\n\nLet down by an abysmal in-game economy and un-entertaining endgame.", "timestamp_created": 1591805499, "timestamp_updated": 1591805499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70585669": {"recommendationid": "70585669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799697141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 420, "last_played": 1675049415}, "language": "english", "review": "turn baised combat, free exploration.\ncool world and fun conversation choices", "timestamp_created": 1591799537, "timestamp_updated": 1591799537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70454311": {"recommendationid": "70454311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019458006", "num_games_owned": 847, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1184, "last_played": 1591555745}, "language": "english", "review": "Backed it in the beginning, forgot about it, remembered, played it, liked it.", "timestamp_created": 1591555789, "timestamp_updated": 1591555789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70442856": {"recommendationid": "70442856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312485004", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1592401820}, "language": "english", "review": "a good game to relax with, turn based combat like xcom", "timestamp_created": 1591539989, "timestamp_updated": 1591539989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70426698": {"recommendationid": "70426698", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972060669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 1233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1233, "last_played": 1591513283}, "language": "english", "review": "That was fun.

After a few hours I really felt like it was my jam. Intriguing story, great worldbuilding and some decent characters.

Almost everything has to be approached by fighting with no way of getting a strategy in place beforehand since you can only control your character outside of fights and there is little interactivity with the level unless you're playing a decker (eg. a hacker). All you do is walk into a room and get attacked instantly since the game gives the priority to the ennemy 2/3 of the time. Assembling a team before each run is cool on principle but you have so little intel before any run that you can't adapt to the mission.\n\nThe turn based gameplay was fine at the start but lacks depth, especially compared to the games that have come out since 2013. It's a cake walk most of the time until the game hits you with a nonsenical difficulty spike or 6 75% shots missing in a row leading you to die in a stupid way. I know about dice roll mechanisms. I've played pen and paper RPG, Darkest Dungeon and XCOM, so I'm familiar with bad luck, but the combat in Shadowrun Returns isn't engaging enough to make me want to start the fight again from the beginning.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to finish this one, especially because the story didn't keep me interested all the way.

For one reason, THE STORY. \"Shadowrun Returns\" gives you a classic tabletop \"Who done it?\" murder mystery premise, while at the same time giving you the unique sense that your character (The one you just made up 2 minutes ago), and their motivations are completely personal, real, and justified through it's amazing writing and dialogue selection. The other Shadowrun stories are good, but never captured this flavor, falling into the trap of more traditional Bioware style RPG's. \n\nOne of my favorite deviations from the typical RPG mechanic, is that there is NO PARTY of companions at a home base where you can regularly drop in for backstory as you level up. Companions come in and out of your characters story, in a realistic way depending on the choices you make. They seemingly have lives to live, and don't simply want to hang around in the same spot for the entirety of the game waiting for you to take them into combat. You are a lone Shadowrunner, making your way through the gritty city. Sometimes you make friends you can call on, most of the time you hire mercenaries when you think you'll need it, and sometimes people hire you, which fits perfectly into the Shadowrun world. Instead of stay at home companions, you have a fully realized cast of NPC's throughout the city, that have rich histories that you can and probably will want to find out more about. \n\nGameplay is linear, but my god is it clean. This is a throwback to a time when you didn't have a million fetch quests, and a trillion collectables, where every townsperson has a sidequest and audio recordings to look over, and an open world so huge you have to quit your day job to get from one side of the map to the other. You have a singular mission, and sometimes you have an incident or two that is so involving and you get so invested in that you have to stop what you're doing and help that person out (Or not), but then you immediately get back to the meat of the game. This creates a cohesive momentum to the game I haven't seen in a long time. \n\nCombat is simple, and the UI is far from perfect. Decking in particular leaves a lot to be desired especially after having played the other Shadowrun games, but it is entertaining enough to get you through to the next best parts of the game, and mostly true to the tabletop version. \n\nLoved it, wish there were more like it.", "timestamp_created": 1587936133, "timestamp_updated": 1587936133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68072084": {"recommendationid": "68072084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028303820", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1903, "last_played": 1639369333}, "language": "english", "review": "all the shadowrun games are great! especially this one", "timestamp_created": 1587923090, "timestamp_updated": 1587923090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68066306": {"recommendationid": "68066306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025510729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 645, "last_played": 1588227182}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun, quick RPG.

They especially did a great job balancing out turns between those in combat and your decker(s) in the Matrix, which was always a hard balancing act when playing the TTRPG. I'm also a big fan of the Shadowrun setting and lore, and there were definitely many nods in the game to lore that was established in the novels, even including a few characters like Harlequin and James Telestrian III. (Which, as a side note, the novels are all available in ebook format again now that the long-standing rights issues were cleared up.) Add on to that the fact that you can also create user generated content (from things like avatars to a full fledged story campaign), and you're looking at basically the Shadowrun equivalent of D&D 3E's Neverwinter Nights. I fully enjoyed the campaign (although I loathe bug shaman *shudder*), and I'm looking forward to sinking my teeth into Dragonfall next.\n\nI originally backed this on Kickstarter (and then the same with Dragonfall and Hong Kong), and I don't know why I hadn't finished this before now. Originally, I spent some time playing Dead Man's Switch on my Android tablet, but unfortunately HBS recently removed it (along with Dragonfall; as far as I know, Hong Kong was never ported to Android) from the Google Play Store to avoid having to make changes to comply with GDPR. (Which doesn't make sense to me, but that's what their support folks told me.) So PC is pretty much the only option to play it at this point. I'll also note that it does work with Macs running an OS version predating OSX Catalina (I played this primarily on a Macbook using OSX Mojave); Apple dropped support for 32-bit apps in Catalina, and all three games in this trilogy are. Given what occurred with GDPR, I would very much not expect them to be updated to 64-bit apps to work under Catalina and future OSX releases.", "timestamp_created": 1587281590, "timestamp_updated":

That may not sound like much but it's a very short game.\n\nLinear - Only 1 side quest and most of the \"optional objectives\" are as straight forward as \"pick up this impossible to miss item in the next room\". Sometimes you have multiple choices, however there are rarely consequences for anything you choose. You get a large choice at the end of the game but as far as I can tell, it only changes flavor. Even choices like race rarely come into play. There's a mission where you have to infiltrate a base, and it's one of the only non-linear sections of the game but few options are locked out based on your race and class. Want to disguise yourself as a janitor? Okay, there's conveniently a janitor outfit for every race in the lockers. Didn't invest in hacking skills but want to make a fake ID? Just memorize some names instead of hacking. Why bother giving me a choice if all options are open to me regardless?\n\nPacing - What the heck is up with the pacing? It feels like they intended to have a lot more plot development that was cut in the final product. As an example, you rescue a character that becomes a semi-regular companion early on in the game, and despite it clearly being explained that you've never met this person before you saved them, she's talking like she knows you in the next encounter with her. I feel like there was going to be a side quest or something with her that would build up that friendship, but it's not there.\n\nMixed:\n\nCharacter portraits - they're usually fine but hipster orcs and metrosexual trolls are a little bit jarring.\n\nPros:\n\nGameplay - no major issues, skills work as you would expect. My only complaint with this is how easy many bullshit misses there are. If I have a 99% chance to hit, I would expect to hit my target at a higher rate than 9/10, whereas 99% seems more like 7/10. Below 50% and you're better off just not bothering. Otherwise it's fine. Nothing to write home about but if you like turn based, somewhat tactical CRPG combat with light investigation elements you will probably enjoy this.\n\nVisuals - Fine, most things look nice.\n\nStory - Despite the aforementioned linearity and pacing issues, the story is quite nice. It starts out as a cyberpunk noir where you investigate a murder, before eventually a larger, lovecraftian conspiracy unfolds. It REALLY needed a few missions to pad this out and let the larger mystery unfold slowly, but overall I liked it.\n\n\nOverall its a neat little crpg but it feels more like a high quality mod than a full game.", "timestamp_created": 1586228035, "timestamp_updated": 1586228035, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66781556": {"recommendationid": "66781556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102218097", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1167, "last_played": 1586212707}, "language": "english", "review": "An outstanding gaming experience that will leave fans of XCOM-style games wanting more.

I strongly recommend to all fans of Shadowrun Returns-like games, but I think it's a game that someone won't like for too many dialogues.\n[b]\n\u2714\ufe0fSoundtrack\n\u2714\ufe0fThe plot of the game\n\u2714\ufe0fDialogues\n\u2714\ufe0fAdvanced skills system\n\n\u2714\ufe0f\u274cGraphics\n\n\u274cShort\n\u274cNo open world and few side tasks\n\n[b][u]Rating: 7/10[/u][/b]\n\n[i][h1][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34408584/]Follow my curator for more reviews[/url][/h1][/i][b]\nATTENTION!\nPlease note that this is only my evaluation and opinion of the game.

There are 8 or so different classes and you can spec into however many you want.

A couple times I got a mission and only had enough money to hire 1 other person (was getting girl free at the time) to go with and it made the mission reeeeeeally hard. Keep that in mind while playing.\n\nGraphics are a bit dated but if you play zoomed out as much as I did you don't notice. Besides some rooms staying black and the contents of the room taking a couple seconds to load. Old machines should be able to run this game well though.\n\nHad a couple bugs (this is where the save game feature kept me from never touching this game again).\nI had a mission I had 2 game breaking bugs in which I had to load a previous save and figure it out. \n\nA girl was hacking a machine, at first kept freezing at my turn. Couldn't figure it out after multiple boots and integrity checking. Then, randomly, it gave me my turn. Turns out it wasn't loading the other NPC as a playable character to hack a computer and freezing instead. Then it randomly worked. AFTER THAT. I beat the mission, just had to run out the door, and when it was that NPC's turn she wouldn't walk any where. After about an hour of reloading and trying different stuff I actually died in the computer while hacking (was kind of like \"omg this fucking sucks I'm about to fucking drop this game\" and ran in without summoning my partner and died) after I died I was able to MOVE my NPC then rehack and IT WORKED! \n\nHaven't had any other issues and I love the game still.

Mainly out of a lack of patience. Going into this I was worried it was going to be 'RPG elements and then some'. Quite the opposite, actually. The game's moderately complex when it comes to the RPG mechanics but keeps almost all of it simple to understand and explains everything you need to know.\n\nAnd that's impressive, because you've got some serious freedom in how you build your character. The game frequently reminds you to make a decision sooner rather than later as to where you want your build to go. I went with Assault Rifle primarily and dipped lightly into Wisdom (for an extra spell slot and to facilitate a buff + healing spell) and some Charisma (for etiquette-specific speech checks) and there was very little I couldn't handle, which is where my team fits in.\n\nI want to pre-emptively tackle decking. Decking is awesome. I got a little bit of a taste in it but felt that all in all the opportunities had more potential than proper execution. This is something that's addressed quite well in Dragonfall, but that's for another review.\n\nFor a tabletop universe that's returned from the shadows (pun not intended, or maybe a little bit) to tackle the gaming scene again, there's a lot of minor gripes that are forgiveable that have, again, been largely addressed in Dragonfall. Despite there being no voiceovers, there's a lot of personality to the characters you run into, but they're not unforgettable. Coyote stood out the most, but even she wasn't much of a character in the long run, and the Harlequin character that joins you right for the last mission is stuffed with personality but only has the length of one mission to really shine. That's too short. Again, however, Dragonfall addresses this.\n\nShadowrun Returns isn't awfully long, but it's a good test whether this style of RPG is up your alley. If it is, I'd not only heartily recommend Shadowrun Dragonfall, but I'd also prompt you to give Divinity: Original Sin 2 a try. I feel that, in terms of mechanical atmosphere, both games have a lot in common. \n\nFinishing this urged me to give Dragonfall a shot, the completion of which subsequently has inspired me to look out for the next time Shadowrun: Hong Kong is only sale, no matter how shallow a sale it might be.

It's relatively linear and there's not much narrative reactivity compared to the later entries. Still, it's an engaging campaign and does an excellent job introducing (or reintroducing) Shadowrun's cyberpunk setting. The writing is generally very good, the characters memorable, and the combat engaging. More importantly the themes are on-point and the presentation perfectly evokes that \"Shadowrun\" feel better than any of the prior attempts. And, of course, there's the enormous appeal of user-created modules, of which there are many, some of which are genuinely excellent.\n\nI've seen some people advise skipping the first game, because Dragonfall--and, later, Hong Kong--are such big improvements. And while I agree that the latter two entries in the trilogy are significantly better, I would still recommend playing Dead Man's Switch.

Very story driven game that starts with you attempting to find the killer of your best friend. It is set in seattle in the future with a very grunge mystical steampunk vibe where the world is ruled by corps. There are elves, humans, trolls, orcs, dwarves which are all playable races. There was some tension between races but I dont feel like the game got into that nor did it necessarily need to. There were a bunch of classes you can choose from like samurai, mage, shaman, rigger, decker, etc. RIgger and Decker are cool since Decker allows you to \"hack\" into computers and enter a virtual world and is relevant in the plot although you always have one at your disposal when the story counts on it. You get whisked into a plot that is half noir half fantasy. I was actually enthralled with the story the whole way through. It\u2019s a short game (8-10hrs) but they did a fantastic job giving the characters dimension and some dynamic change. I didn\u2019t feel all that attached to the characters or my own character for that matter but i generally really enjoyed the story and felt like the characters were real. \n\nThe world building was also fantastic. They did a good job of showing the daily struggle people face, the dark sides of society and capitalism. You are essentially a mercenary that runs heists. It didn\u2019t feel all that Seattle but I got some vibes from it here and there, but mostly with the journal like entries when you\u2019re loading into a new zone. I think the Im a tad biased since Im from seattle and have a better picture of it in my head than the game had. The environments were a little boring at times and kinda felt all the same at the end. They did always try to set the scene well, but that\u2019s hard to remember when you are just seeing the some corporate and dingy areas all the time. I\u2019d like to see more diversity there. \n\nMusic is great but I like future synth. It\u2019s a bit overdone in games now but they did a solid job of it adding to the game\u2019s theme. Sometimes it was a bit repetitive \n\nThe combat was turn based 4x game. I like all the various classes and weapons choice but they don't seem to do things all that differently. I was an elf samurai with max quickness and nearly max pistol. You can diversify slightly but you do mostly have to stick with one track if you want to be formidable in combat. Combat can get challenging at time but for the most part was very manageable on normal difficulty. I\u2019d like to see more diverse weapon systems and magic systems but i also didnt explore it as much as I should have. The armor was also pretty boring and I dont think they did as much with the cybernetics as they could have. \n\nThere were alternate dialogue choices based on what \u201cetiquette\u201d you have which added some fun variation but overall I dont think it impacted the story much, which is good or bad depending on preference I suppose. I think this game excels with the plot so I\u2019m fine with it not diverging much and just having the dialogue choices add a bit of flavor to interactions here or there. \n\nOverall, fricken solid strategy game with a great plot to back it up. I\u2019d like to see an improved weapons and armor system, but I think for what this game is going for it did it really well. \n", "timestamp_created": 1581558953, "timestamp_updated": 1581558953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63399363": {"recommendationid": "63399363", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024692544", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1691375335}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall good game.", "timestamp_created": 1581531380, "timestamp_updated": 1581531380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63330709": {"recommendationid": "63330709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065356541", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1137, "last_played": 1581414704}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1581414145, "timestamp_updated": 1581414145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63326733": {"recommendationid": "63326733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005987692", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 864, "last_played": 1581470890}, "language": "english", "review": "recommended for fans of classic turn strategy rpgs, only this is a light strange themed one.\n\npros:\n-a different world and its mood\n-initial story pulls you in (death man switch campaign)\n-light gameplay\n\ncons:\n-linearity and lack of depth in gameplay only complemented by the strange archetype classes that could make you play a second time.\n-the story starts mixing too many things from different worlds for my taste (cyberpunk+shaman+big conspiracy+alien spirit insects? ok..)\n-progression bugs", "timestamp_created": 1581406127, "timestamp_updated": 1581406127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63246167": {"recommendationid": "63246167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043311822", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3719, "last_played": 1579230118}, "language": "english", "review": "I originally started off on Shadowrun for both the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, and then Shadowrun (the shooting game) and finally here on Shadowrun returns.

The game was set in the 2050's or some such, which back then felt like it would never come. So like, another game that was way more popular because it was the \"granddaddy\" of this hobby called Dungeons & Dragons, or D&D, was pretty cool and all. You had elves, and dwarves, and large metal pointy sticks to stab at things with, and magic! And there was another lesser known game Traveller that had spaceships and mutants and laser guns and aliens and stuff. Then like these dudes at FASA were like, \"Whoah, lets put peanut butter in with the chocolate and stuff and make Fantasy Sci-Fi\" and so they make a really amazing backstory based on the earth of the 1980's and extrapolated out about 70 years into the future adding in lots of future technology, magic, and even explaining why there are elves and dwarves and even dragons when we don't have those today (as far as we know).  SHADOWRUN was born and it was mega wiz, chummers.\n\nSo fast forward a bit to 2008(?) ish and while several good console and computer Shadowrun games had been made it had been a long time since any good ones and so Hairbrained Schemes did a Kickstarter to fund Shadowrun RETURNS, an all new SR engine for making SR stories, and of course, it came with a 20+ hour adventure, Dead Man's Switch, which was a little rusty at launch but is really solid as of this writing.\n\nThis is essentially a turn-based, tactical team-based RPG where you control one main character that has a lot of NPC's and hired hands to fill out a team of Shadowrunners, folks who get paid on the down-low to do illegal and very probably immoral jobs, with much discretion, for large sums of Nuyen (cash). The Dead Man Switch story is set in Seattle and an ex-Seattle runner RETURNS to Seattle to solve the murder of one of his old running chummers.  The first mmm 2/3 ish of the story is about solving his murder and a series of serial killings, while making friends and influencing people and gaining personal wealth and power. The next part diverges into a \"save the world\" kind of story kind of based on some of the stuff from the first part but that's when it gets kind of weird, but still fun and cool. I feel like the first part of Dead Man's Switch that is about solving the mystery of Sam's murder is great, and then the part near the end where you solve the big crisis is just pretty good but since it didn't feel very natural (in many ways, hehe, no spoiler) it almost felt like they needed more foreshadow during the mystery part about the ending in some way where maybe you encounter just little teasers of the \"weird stuff\" before the big all-out shindig.\n\nAll in all, this is a strong recommend A+ and one of the most satisfying RPG games I've played on any platform, and I've played literally dozens of them on many platforms going back to the Atari 2600. I would not rank it quite as high as Dragon Age Origins which I still think is my favorite PC RPG of all time, but it's in the same league as that, Fallout, Planescape Torment, Baldur's Gate, etc. \n", "timestamp_created": 1580094381, "timestamp_updated": 1580094381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62484358": {"recommendationid": "62484358", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970719052", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1432567715}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10\n\nShadowrun Returns is a reasonably accessible TBS (Turn Based Strategy) game that isn't ridiculously difficult.

The RPG aspect of the game is very complex, you got all sorts of skills to level up, magical: like spirit control, chi, conjuring, spell casting; combat: like melee, dodge, shotgun, machine gun, strength. decker type and/or drone control like. Depending what path you choose you could master one of the five or four classes that the game has, Shaman, Mage, Decker (hacker), Drone Expert, Samurai, (and there are few more). Then if you want, you could refine that even more you could create a Mage that's has expertise in ranged weapons (for example), or a Decker (hacker) that it's also a Shaman. Also you got other skills (none combat based) that are important for interacting with elements and talking with NPCs... Shadowrun, Decking, Socialite, Corporate, etc. Those skills are very important in some levels it makes the mission a lot easier. Sometimes with those speaking/hacking skills you could make an enemy surrender, make a smart computer open a locked door or make an enemy leave the battlefield instead of having to kill it.\n \nApart from your character which can be any class of the ones mentioned, (shaman, mage, etc). Also it can be an Orc, Elf, Human, Dwarf, etc. This also have some impact on the skills tree, some races have more resistance to melee combat and other are more skilled in magical aspects. So a character can be very complex.\n\nIn the first missions you are alone but as the game progresses you have to assemble a crew. A good hint is always to have a decker, hence some missions can't be even be completed without it. ( In other versions of the series some mission require a drone expert).  Most of the mercenaries (shadowrunners) cost money some of them are free but just 1 or 2. I normally carry a Decker, a Samurai or combat expert and another Mage or Shaman. Some ppl play different styles because there is plenty of possibilities on how to finish the mission, that heavily depends on your skills and also on your crew. \n\nI chose being an Elf Mage, with Mages you can summon spirits that are like dummy warriors that have a limited lifespan. And Elfs have better bonus points in spirit control and spirit summoning.  \nOn my crew I like having another mage/shaman also that can summon spirits makes combat really easy because instead of having 4 characters on the battle you have 6, it's a killer advantage. But there is catch summoned spirits spells and other casts are really expensive, (at least the ones that are powerful), so you have to do some side missions to earn enough money to be able to buy enough magic weapons/spells. \nYou might choose another path for example when I played SR Hong Kong (the first of the series I played) I chose combat samurai. Maybe that's what you should choose if you are a newbie to the series, imho is much more simpler only reload the weapon, take cover and fire.... but remember to supply yourself with a LOT of medical supplies (maybe you could carry a powerful Mage/Shaman that has healing capabilites also). \n\nAt the start you will find yourself dying a lot, the game is not that difficult but yes it's rather complex. I really didn't fully understood everything till I finished SR Hong Kong (which was the first I played). But once you master it if you like RPG/Strategy games it's very satisfying.\nThen there is the story. Prepare yourself to read a lot. It's an important part of the game sometimes NPC's will give you hints to earn cash or acquire items. The first time I played the Hong Kong version I practically skipped every dialogue because it can be really tiresome. That made the game a lot more difficult, because I was short of cash. But  anyways if you are the kind of ppl that don't like reading you can skip most of it, it is doable.\n\nOverall I think is a superb game with lots of depths and complexity, I think that maybe some day I will play it again. Also there's quite a lot of replayability  because depending on the character class you choose the game is different also what character classes you carry on your crew changes the game. But the enemy AI in the combats will mostly do the same thing there also a lot of scripted combats and environments ... so it has replayability but to some extent. \n\nthe only issue I found is like many games it doesn't disable compositing so if you have a screen edge set up to trigger a desktop effect it can bother sometimes.\n\nPlayed on KDE Neon 5.17.3 (Ubuntu 18.04 based).

As a fan of the SNES version back in the day, I can say that Harebrained Schemes know how to tickle at my nostalgia while adding a XCom-like combat system and expressive dialogue to boot. \n\nThis game's atmosphere and lore can be summarized by imagining a Tolkien fantasy world where the technology of the future evolves with the various races of Elves, Trolls, Humans, and Orcs. The setting is magic vs machines, tomes vs tech and that's still a very untapped genre (Shitty Netflix \"Bright\" Movie notwithstanding).\n\nThe Good: Setting, characters, customization, and player expression. The soundtrack ain't bad, either- particularly the opening theme. \n\nThe Bad: Story is far more linear than I care for, and the environments- while pretty- aren't interactive.

There are many reasons, but let's stick to the main ones:\n\n[b]Non-interactive environments.[/b] Almost nothing on the map can be interacted with. I can forgive dated looks, it's content, not glitz, that matters. But where is the content, I ask? Exploring maps will yield maybe one side mission, one extra thing to sell, etc. That's it. Exploring every nook and cranny is hardly worth it and largely unrewarding. Almost no enemy leaves loot behind or a body to search - except for a few key clues and items.\n\n[b]It's a railroad![/b] Enter an area, beat the main thing in it, go to next area. You have no choice where to go. You rarely have a choice about anything! You can occasionally do a side mission or obtain an extra thing, but the game funnels you through a series of areas that could be seen as individual missions. No open world, no choices. The game would have been a great platform for making your own runs, given that an isometric game like this makes asset reuse and new maps cheap. But so far the game's decision graph is pretty much entirely linear.\n\n[b]Does it matter what I say?[/b] While you get to chose the tone of the conversation, you rarely actually get to chose what to say. And I don't think the tone will matter often if at all. Be snide or be nice or be uncaring. That's flavor, but what else? I get a distinct vibe that dialogue options all lead to the same outcome. They are pseudo-choices.\n\n[b]Missing info.[/b] What skill do I use with what gun? Couldn't find it. What does the Suppression program do - what is an \"alarm level?\" Missing bits of into are everywhere. The game does not explain itself very well.\n\n[b]This is not Shadowrun.[/b] Shadowrun is a game about carefully planned and executed runs. Often planning a run takes as long as executing it. Intel is key. Timing and work split are of the essence. What remains in Shadowrun Returns? You often blunder into a scene (and this is supposed to be a \"run\") with no intel, you fight two combats, then pick up everything. Normally drone operators and deckers would provide you with enough information to do your job and apply force only when necessary. You strike when necessary or get out without even leaving a trace. That's the Shadowrun ideal. \n\nWhat does this game do? You rush in, bump into the enemy, then shoot your way through. D&D with guns and cyberdecks.\n\n[b]No party.[/b] At least no party you can control. People join you and abandon you without you having any choice over it. You only get to build one character. You better make the character decent in combat because you cannot rely on being complemented by others. I built a decker but then optimized her for firefights. Because that's. All. That. Ever. Happened. For quite a while. Later on decking becomes important, too. And you get to hire runners for individual jobs which allows you to plan a little, but with little intel it's a way to trade money for a party to match your style (more magic or more firepower or whatever). \n\nYou can also equip people from your stash. So putting stuff in there can be helpful in the early game when you get companions with no choice as to who they are. Can at least buff them somewhat.\n\n[b]Conclusion.[/b] The game tells an interesting story that immerses you into the world of Shadowrun. It rarely explains much of the background info but you can ask about key concepts. Interaction with the world is oversimplified. This is neither a game about choice or truly different outcomes, you get to experience what they very strictly laid out for you. It still happens to be some fun. It isn't a good RPG, though, in many ways that have nothing to do with its retro look. A retro RPG can still be rich in choice and allow varied interactions with the environment or make exploration interesting. But this one... doesn't.", "timestamp_created": 1574113057, "timestamp_updated": 1574113057, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727089166641235352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57402856": {"recommendationid": "57402856", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975982402", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 996, "last_played": 1673149478}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game: great battle mechanics and character building; fascinating plot.  more interesting than the novels, great way to introduce yourself ot the shadowrun lore if you're looking to get into it.", "timestamp_created": 1574048993, "timestamp_updated": 1574048993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57380571": {"recommendationid": "57380571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003331239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1432, "last_played": 1654119692}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story, fun turn based.", "timestamp_created": 1574015686, "timestamp_updated": 1574015686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57342060": {"recommendationid": "57342060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318747720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1559364978}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall decent game.

I personally feel like a private detective, and I can tell the developers put love into their game. I personally enjoyed the vacation themed armor, felt like a tip of the hat to the Ben 10 universe. Anyhow this is a review, lets get to the bones. The game's atmosphere is refreshing, however it feels simple. You can only ever do actions in combat or otherwise prompted. Sure you can walk around and run into a prompt but that's about it. I love the game's system for magic though damn if I wish it didn't front with the cybernetic augmentations. So let me get this in plain view. You can wield/equip anything you want. There are no class restrictions and you can literally build into anything though racial traits do have limits. I personally feel that magic is weak in comparison to bullets, as most weapons do 10*attribute adjustments, and magic is a base 10+(Lvl of spell) though the devs thought it was balanced due to some magic being able to ignore armor amounts. Though this innt a guide to damage output, lets continue, the story is alright, you're playing as a hired (thug/decker/mage/etc whatever you picked) that is trying to hunt down your old time thug mate who went on several jobs with you and always had your back. I am definitely hook on the plot, the whole mystery rpgs elements are unique to me, and I look forward to continuing my game. The combat is turn-based, and you have 3 slots for weapons. I chose a mage starting class but dropped my basic mage attack for a actual weapon that does damage, and I equipped spells instead. Speaking of equipment, I wish there were more options to armor. The current armor choices are all one-choice selections. Mage armor set/Decker set/Armor dealer set/etc. I wish it could have been more of a armor piece for body set. IE. Chest piece/arms/legs/etc. Although it didn't disappoint me too much to throw me off the game. That's just the equipment though lets talk more about the combat, I personally wish I had more moves, but if we take the idea of the turns as seconds it makes sense that I would only have 3 moves before my turn ends. Recap, there are weapon slots, spell slots, and also item slots. You might be wondering well what if I fill those, and I'd say get ready for a walk, because unless you are buying something your extra junk is stored in a locker at the safehouse. Wow you get a safehouse? Yes, but the game isn't open world. Its more of a linear story, that opens up a large area for you, so you may miss out on content if you rush through and skip by to do only the story. I personally dislike rpgs that do that, but I am still in it to win it for the Shadowrun.\n\nIn summary, the game personally feels like a rpg detective game, with turn based combat, and linear mapping to open an map area. That prefers to keep the idea of class option open to the player, which has full digression to go a full build, or branch to different classes/weapon traits.", "timestamp_created": 1573624363, "timestamp_updated": 1573624363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57075589": {"recommendationid": "57075589", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978153897", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1573602558}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun cyber-punk RPG.

I thought this story was going to be a generic murder mystery, but it turned into something else that was very interesting. It seems like the dialogue choices are flavour-text and don't change the overall game outcome, but that's totally fine for a game that wants to tell a story.\n\nCharacter creation is based solely around combat, and whatever classes or skills you don't take on, you can fill with teammates and mercenaries. The combat is fine for a turn-based strategy game. It can force you to diversify your team between the cyberdeck, magic, or weapon user, and the random-number game actually makes sense. I've played other TBS games that are frustrating and encourage save-scumming by having an unfair RNG, where everything hits you but you can't hit anything. This one makes sense because you can have supports buff/debuff combatants, take cover, and flank appropriately, while your enemies are trying to do the same.\n\nA couple of pieces of advice on combat to make the game more fun: use items liberally, because you'll always find more. Focus on what you want to fight as and spend money to fill in the gaps you need. I found myself at the end of the game with way too many consumables and cash, while playing conservatively in fights which deprived me of having a lot more fun in this game.\n\nThe artwork looks great, between portraits and 3D models.

Shoot, move, or use item and that's about it. XCOM allowed players to cover each other or pass turn to take advantage of moving enemies etc. The game also really lacks combat balance.

In addition some hit chances are blatantly unfair, When you have a character who's main weapon is a shotgun go to point blank range and still only have 50% chance to hit with no cover for the enemy to hide behind yet when the enemy goes to attack at those same point blank ranges and even medium ranges they hit 95% of their shots? its not a good time.

I hope that helps you to make a decision.", "timestamp_created": 1568937369, "timestamp_updated": 1568937369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55165816": {"recommendationid": "55165816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826764118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 4391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2431, "last_played": 1592975423}, "language": "english", "review": "I started this and was immediately impressed a Steam Punk /X Com 2 hybrid that works was disappointed when it ended...Consider this a very positive review.", "timestamp_created": 1568791231, "timestamp_updated": 1568791231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55150275": {"recommendationid": "55150275", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999282226", "num_games_owned": 933, "num_reviews": 201, "playtime_forever": 1169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1169, "last_played": 1568697590}, "language": "english", "review": "Shadowrun Returns is the first game in the rebooted Shadowrun trilogy, along with Dragonfall and Hong Kong. Being the first game, there's definitely some hitches in the game that hold it back from being as good as the ones later on down the line. For those new to the series, Shadowrun is a cyberpunk RPG series about being a \"Shadowrunner\" - expendable black ops people who undertake secret missions for the highest bidder, engaging in corporate warfare and the odd bit of world-saving.\n\nThe game plays like a streamlined X-COM: turn based tactical combat using cover and abilities and the occasional rage at RNG. A very streamlined version of the tabletop system is used, and all classic shadowrun archetypes are more or less supported through the vanilla campaign. Support in user generated content (\"UGC\") will vary by module. The artstyle is bright and colorful with stylized caricatures of people that let you immediately identify the different metahuman races in the game at a glance. Music is mostly ambient and honestly, mostly forgettable, but fits the feel and environments you're in.\n\nThe game setup is not that of an open world, but rather linear connected levels that you cannot return to once you're finished with them. Make sure you do all of your exploring before you move on, since there's no way to \"farm\" money or equipment or anything. I was a little disappointed because I originally thought it was a more open world game with more sidequests - the experience in all three games is very much a linear guided experience, so know that going in.\n\nArchetypes and skill levelling all give you abilities you'll want to use constantly. Even something as simple as a 10% aim buff, or 2 armor, is worth spamming constantly. Offensive magic is powerful as well, but I had better luck spamming things like Haste, Armor, Aim, Heal, and Barriers for my team.\n\nThere are a few gripes with the game that I have that are for the most part solved in later games:\n1: Summoning spirits is just bad, IMO. You can only do it in certain parts of certain maps, and you have to give up part of your shaman's turn to do so. The more actions you let the spirit take, the more likely it is to break free and turn hostile. Alternately you can spend money on a consumable to do it anywhere, but you still have to \"feed\" it action points a and it can still turn hostile. It felt like a very hamfisted approach to spirit summoning. Rigger drones were much more managable.\n2: The AI has an incredible bias towards attacking the main character, and the MC's death is a game over. This pretty much forces you to make a very tanky character and max Body very quickly, unless you want to have to constantly hide your character. I didn't want to do that, so I went with a physical adept and stabbed everything to death with ranged backup.\n3: Money can be pretty tight until the last third of the game. If you want to be a full roided out street samurai, you'll need to save money somewhere, and you may need to do that by hiring less runners. The game is soloable by street samurai and a correctly built physical adept, it's just difficult to do so. The game is also pretty good about giving you discounts on \"important\" NPCs, or mandatory hires (such as Deckers), so it's easy to save money while making an effective team on the cheap. Some of the NPC runners are definitely way better than the others. Make sure you get your money's worth.\n4: I found Decking to be of limited use as a main character. It does let you access some hacking and side loot, but any mission critical situation, the game gives you a mandatory decker NPC you can use that can handle the situation just fine. The matrix sections aren't difficult, and add some fun parallel combat and exploration to realspace fights.\n\nOverall the game is a pleasant experience, and feels like a Shadowrun game. There's not a lot of \"choice\" to be made. Dialog options mostly exist as a way for you to inject your character's flavor into the situation. Skill checks are sometimes called for in dialogs and let you access extra information, or have extra ways of approaching situations. Especially in the second half, the game's battle maps do very well at giving you a lot of different approaches to a situation based on your team composition. I would recommend the game to anyone looking for a medium length turn based tactical game, and anyone who enjoys the Cyberpunk aesthetic. The game often goes on sale for extremely cheap,  sub 5 dollars, so keep an eye out.", "timestamp_created": 1568702188, "timestamp_updated": 1568702249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710097968578338623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 8156, "total_negative": 1008, "total_reviews": 9164}, "cursors": {"AoJwnvn7nu0Cc+yw0gE=": "Thu Nov 23 23:25:52 2023", "AoJwjPHjmYkDf6mGnAQ=": "Thu Nov 23 23:54:01 2023"}}
