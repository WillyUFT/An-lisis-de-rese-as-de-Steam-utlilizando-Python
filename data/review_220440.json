He gets better through out the story. The characters are too vulgar and swear too much especially the 2nd boss. The combat is still great with the angel and demon weapons. This also got the best platforming in the series so far. The bosses and levels are simpler than past games but still enjoyable.

"language": "english", "review": "DmC Devil May Cry was a decision made by Capcom to reboot the Devil May Cry series when Devil May Cry 4 didn't meet their projected sales. The idea was to reboot it to appeal to a primarily American audience, much like they were attempting with other reboots so that they could grow the franchise. The result was a mixed bag among fans. After playing through all of the prior DMC games, excluding 2, as I'm planning to play it last, I understand the fear that players were going through, especially since they were expecting this to replace the original series and for the questions and setups created by Devil May Cry 4 never to be finished. No matter if that's what Capcom was planning or not, we ended up getting a Devil May Cry 5 from the funding of this game. So, knowing that this didn't replace the original series, I believe that this game was reviewed a little too harshly. \n\nThis game, unironically, has two of the most creative levels I have ever seen in a video game, and I recommend buying this just to see those two levels. I won't spoil them, but I will say that if you have any experience with epileptic seizures, then you should avoid this game at all costs. Traversal is more fun than it's ever been in the series, with Dante having the ability to glide and grapple hook around levels, and even use the grapple hook to pull platforms. There were challenge missions based around traversal that I had no issues with due to how smooth it is to traverse around them. The iconic backtracking of the series, where the player could return to previous areas unless the path behind was destroyed (often signalling an important boss fight coming up) is missing from this game, but you still have the ability to replay prior levels if you need to grind to get more powerful for a boss fight, although I didn't find them to be too hard in this game, as they were mostly easy to read and dodge if you know what you're doing. \n\nThe story's okay, but quite a few scenes are filled with a very cringe-inducing amount of profanity, but it's very easy to shift past, for the most part, as it can be pretty funny in some occasions. There are a few cutscenes present that are extremely cringe-inducing, seeming to think that including sex randomly makes the game more mature (I don't hate sex scenes, but one in the middle of this game is extremely out of place in this game), but they can be skipped since the cringey cutscenes provode literally no exposition.\n\nThe combat itself might be the smoothest any Devil May Cry has had, being extremely streamlined for easy combos, but the placement of the dodge buttons on controller (bumpers) are a little distracting since they're above the triggers, which are used to keep your non-sword weapons active. The use of holding buttons to change between three weapons is very creative, and prevents the spamming of one button, like in DMC4 and DMC5, to swap between several weapons to get what you want.

Applying that experience make it easier to combo without getting hit. It might sound silly but it is what it is. I find also that enemies that are not in your camera view won't attack you, making it good to focus on enemy.\n\nI played through all difficulty modes after that. Learning how to counter each enemy. Juggling between all weapons using it as efficiently as i can. And it's more fun than i thought it would be.\n\nThe dlc might not have that many arsenals. But it give you some badass move that require correct timing.\n\nDefinitely bot that bad of a game some people made it out to be.", "timestamp_created": 1692602292, "timestamp_updated": 1692602292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563358783721923828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144679700": {"recommendationid": "144679700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058282190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 752, "last_played": 1692545365}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juegazo!

it's a good game but it kinda disappoints me about it. The camera angle can be a bit weird in certain areas like tight or small spaces, and you can't map out your gun special, which makes the character constantly jump  or shoot and can't do your gun special unless you change the key for your gun. \n\nThe game is kinda short which makes it a bit disappointing, and replayaibility wasn't that good. If it had the replayability like Dishonored 2, the game would be significantly better. And something was just lacking as I played it, and I can't quite figure what it is. It's a fun game but not as much as I expected it to be. I used to play DMC 3 on my ps2 way back when I was a kid, and that was really fun, so maybe that's why it was a bit lacking.

While scrolling through my library today, I thought \"hey, why not? why not try something new?\" \n\nAnd yall.... I tried. I tried SO HARD to like this game that I continued on sacrificing my hours hoping it would get more interesting. Nope. I just cannot click with it. The story is ok, the controls are okish (I'm playing with an Xbox controller) but the main character. Oh boyyyyyy. \n\nOne of the most unlikable personalities I've come across in a game. And I'm not even talking about his looks right now because I'm actually ok with it. This is the FIRST game of this series that I purchased and played. I didn't even know who Dante was before opening up this game (I'm a huge fan of RE though, esp 2, 4, and 7 so I wanted to branch out and try other Capcom games. Plus this game looked similar to Bayonetta, which is another game I love).\n\nBesides the main character, I also didn't like the platforming setup. There's not much to say about it. It feels annoying having to jump and shot in the right position to get points while aiming for the red sacks. I couldn't get to a couple limbo souls because I couldn't reach those areas even though I'm pretty sure I was supposed to be able to reach it. And the jumps kept not registering on my end when he was going to and fro floating platforms. It got frustrating that I took a break for a couple hours to eat. \n\nSorry to all the die-hard DMC fans but I just don't get the love for this game. I will try the originals though, just to see if this one really was just the bad egg of the basket.\n\nNow all that being said, It is on sale right now. If you DO want to try it just be warned that the refund button should be the second button you press after the uninstall. Edit: and TIME THAT BEFORE 2 HOURS TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT REFUND! (I'm not eligible because I bought this game years ago.

La narrativa trabajada es la que m\u00e1s engancha y mejor nos cuenta las personalidades de cada personaje, sumergi\u00e9ndonos de lleno en este cuento de los or\u00edgenes del atractivo Dante. Por fin empatizaremos con \u00e9l y entenderemos mejor su relaci\u00f3n con su familia, otros interesantes personajes y los demonios.

this game is best evaluated as just a game on it's own, and not relating to the Devil may Cry series as a whole. Mainly because a lot of the reboot changes are weird, but the game is still fun.\n\nFor example, the story isn't very interesting. It's very AAA... if you know what I mean. All DmC lore is thrown out the window in favor of all these new details, and it's very disappointing. \n\nThe gameplay on the other hand, is great! The combat feels like a Ninja Theory game, which is fine because it's still fun!. Being able to switch weapons by holding the triggers is a great change, and I'm disappointed it's only in this title and not in DmC5. Not every part of the gameplay is perfect though. Most bossfights are pushovers. If the boss is 2x taller than your character, then they're easy. Additionally, there is a lot of platforming sections, which become instantly boring on the next playthrough.\n\nThis game is like the Dark Souls 2 of the DmC series.

The story has gotten much better in sense and perspective, and was what drew me to try this iteration swapping from Capcom to Ninja Theory. This was one of the most regrettable decisions I have ever made. While the combat is the best I've tried in a long time, this remains the only improvement. The story is lacking until the end, with an unfulfilling conclusion and an insult to the works of Capcom. The cast, though admittedly talented in projecting the characters, appear to have had a hard time keeping character. While on the topic of characters, Ninja Theory seems to be more interested in mocking the original games and destroying the reputation Capcom built for DMC which is why they most likely took back control over their franchise, and finally the name \"Dmc Devil May Cry\". What even is that?! What is it supposed to mean? Is it just supposed to be part of the name to make it sound cool or is it supposed to drive the point that it's a \"Devil May Cry\", like naming it \"Devil May Cry: Devil May Cry\"? I'm sure Ninja Theory put alot of time and effort into programming this thing, however it just didn't work in there favor. I hate this the fact this game exists and wish I have never played it. My second review on this platform may be 10 years late, and I hope its my only negative rating but it deserve a -10 out of 10, I don't recommend this game for anyone trying to get into this series or at all.

There are mods that fix some things, but they can mess up stuff and there is no way to enable manual lock on. I have played DE on Xbox One, but decided to buy the PC version to try it out.\n\nOverall I think this is a pretty good game, even if the opinion on it isn't well regarded in the fanbase. Soundtrack is pretty good too. I would recommend just treating this as it's own thing when you play it.\n\nTLDR: PC version is outdated, Xbox One and PS4 versions are better by far.", "timestamp_created": 1687031729, "timestamp_updated": 1690866168, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726757049560546875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140205871": {"recommendationid": "140205871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968280216", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1695654187}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Jugar con vergil es cine \ud83d\udeac", "timestamp_created": 1686994493, "timestamp_updated": 1686994493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140197281": {"recommendationid": "140197281", "author": {"steamid": "76561199293679668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1698205193}, "language": "spanish", "review": "simplemente epico \ud83d\udeac", "timestamp_created": 1686979498, "timestamp_updated": 1686979498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140195662": {"recommendationid": "140195662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968753476", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 796, "last_played": 1676608100}, "language": "english", "review": "we shot an evil pregnant woman in her stomach", "timestamp_created": 1686976577, "timestamp_updated": 1686976577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479570686817169189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140194691": {"recommendationid": "140194691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363678844", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1670, "last_played": 1687313155}, "language": "english", "review": "It's my 3rd time completing on 3 different platforms lmao.

It reminds me of Bayonetta, but I feel like the controls are far easier to work with. I like all the jabs at corporate greed and the sprinkled in humor is a big plus. I am usually quite bad at games that contain move lists. I was still bad at this game I am sure in comparison to those who can just reflexively recall the whole move list and pound out moves in rapid succession. The difference is I didn't feel so bad about it because my grading somehow was always around SS, S, A and B. In Bayonetta I was lucky if I could survive the levels. I really enjoyed the game's pacing - each level was long enough for me to play a few and put it down. I am very glad that game development studios consider people like myself who just want to unwind, enjoy the story (for what it's worth) without it feeling like a second job. This is the first DmC game I have ever played so I was quite lost as to who all the characters were, but I don't think it took anything away from the game play for me. It was just mindless fun. There were same damn good levels that were very enjoyable. It's funny because it's almost overwhelming with how many weapons and moves there are - I would get confused at times. However, once you get in a groove, the game play flows so well and it has the right amount of story, travel and action - never too much of any, it's perfectly balanced. I strongly recommend this game for some good fun. Looking forward to playing the rest of the franchise now.", "timestamp_created": 1686363472, "timestamp_updated": 1686363472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139802053": {"recommendationid": "139802053", "author": {"steamid": "76561199296218825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1698486904}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is really bad. it disrespects the original fans. do not recomend", "timestamp_created": 1686344443, "timestamp_updated": 1686344443, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.390002220869064331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139781813": {"recommendationid": "139781813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798190072", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1686313526}, "language": "english", "review": "DmC Devil May Cry : Vergil do everything to avoid paying taxes\nThis is what happen when you handed your Jap IP to a western studio, they created a generic action adventure game instead of a fun spectacle fighter, it's like dark souls without the souls. This game is more like a maybe than a recommended, it's not bad enough for a no but not that good either, go play DmC5 if you have already played other DmCs, ignore this one like it doesn't exist.\n\nIf you have never played DmC or have some money to waste then this one is an okay game, the core gameplay is still good, combat is solid, you can use this to kinda get familiar to DmC combat. One thing they did well is that they solve the platforming issue in DmC, platforming feels kinda good in this game, your jumps actually have some forward momentum. Weapon movesets are good, input aren't hard but the double forward in just weird especially on controller, way more awkward than lock-on + forward.\n\nThe game has a lot of stuffs I really don't like, I highly doubt I'll ever play this again.\nTry too hard to be edgy,cool. \nWhy is Lilith look like she's full of botox ?\nMain villain is lame AF, a demon in human form controls everything using dept, really ? His final form is just a giant pile of goo with slow and easy to dodge attacks.\nVergil feel useless the entire story and acted like a dumbass in the end, the build up in DMC5 is so much cooler. There's no motivation in this Vergil, there's no POWER, lacking plastic chair is why he sus.\nOverly used red and blue colors, hard to even see anything on the screen sometime especially during the chaos of battle, the entire game is either red or blue.\nWeapon designs are lame, generic, there's no zing in them, they just look like normal weapons.\nThe dodge is weird, the first 90% of the animation is super fast but the last 10% suddenly its like slow motion with no iframe.\nThere is no freedom in combat, you're forced to use demon/angel weapons for certain enemies, too many gimmick fights using demon/angel mode. Unlike in other DMC where you can just use one weapon and one attack to clear the game if you wanted nobody cares. I never felt like I want to do a cool combo in this game, most of the time I have to pay attention to what kind of enemies I'm fighting, do I need to use angel weapon or demon weapon.\nthe A + X input is ridiculously hard because its required both button to be pressed at the same time without any amounts of delay, they tried to simplify inputs by removing lock-on and style switch but ended up making it harder by having too many inputs overlapped each other while having to juggle between rebellion, angel weapon and demon weapon\nBoring generic enemy design, most enemies are just humanoid with some kind of mask or armors, horrible bosses design, literally can't remember a single boss fight from this game and I literally just finished it, it's so boring and uninspired, one of the boss is literally just a giant baby with one of the worst camera angle ever, it's so low you can't see anything coming from the ground because the camera is trying to focus on the head and everything is so fkn dark, the entire boss fight is just fly toward the boss, hit the eyes, pull Lilith out, hits her, repeat until she die. Probably one of the most boring boss fight I've ever had.\n", "timestamp_created": 1686316023, "timestamp_updated": 1686316121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139779993": {"recommendationid": "139779993", "author": {"steamid": "76561199368231568", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 660, "last_played": 1687602539}, "language": "english", "review": "gud", "timestamp_created": 1686313081, "timestamp_updated": 1686313081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139773396": {"recommendationid": "139773396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067674060", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1605128030}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es el peor de la saga desde mi punto de vista.\n\n   1.

It isn't objectively bad but it has a number of elements I don't like and in total I just can't say I enjoyed it enough to recommend it.\n\nThe lore was very interesting. I kept feeling like I was missing something, probably because this was my first exposure to the franchise. Graphics are pretty good. I'm positive I bought this because of Dante's pretty face.\n\nIt reeks of being a console game, and by that I mean there are short, discrete levels, levels are divided up into tiny areas to fit into a console's limited RAM, you are mostly forbidden from backtracking (doors snapping shut behind you), and it makes a big deal out of scoring points like an arcade game. Lots of fighting and areas don't feel very organic - it all feels carefully scripted and doesn't flow naturally. Frequently the game asks me to fight a half dozen enemies at once to try to make me feel badass or whatever, but to me it feels like the game is trying hard to make me have a power fantasy and the fact that I notice it so easily harms immersion.\n\nControlling the camera is a consistent problem. When I try to rotate the camera it frequently gets stuck on a nonexistant wall, as if to try to force me to have a certain perspective. Never before have I seen a game that fights me so hard with the view. I try to look around and the game just says nope, can't do that. I had to wiggle my mouse a lot and eventually the camera lock would let go but never for long. Nothing in the settings for it either. There are lots of secrets that you can't get on your first playthrough, but I don't judge it to be fun enough to justify playing a second time. Looking for secrets was made more challenging by the camera shenanigans. One level, I think 11 or 12, was taking place in some narrow corridors and getting through that with the janky camera was the worst.\n\nLevel 13 and 14 had incredibly irritating flashing lights. Some parts of my display were extremely dark and a few spots extremely bright, with the lights shifting and flashing all the time. It is so hard to see what is going on, and dodging out of the way of something I can't even see for the flashing lights is unreasonable. \n\nMost enemies feel like they soak up entirely too much damage. I can just keep smacking a baddie over and over and they just never seem to want to die. Bosses are even worse.\n\nHealing is pretty hard to come by; I never got much money to buy healing items and barely any healing drops from defeated enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1685268301, "timestamp_updated": 1685268301, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139131206": {"recommendationid": "139131206", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961596898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 977, "last_played": 1685315391}, "language": "english", "review": "DmC: Devil May Cry occupies such a strange spot within its own franchise.

You'll once again take on the role of Dante in a re-telling of Dante's fight against Mundus and rivalry with Vergil. We're changing up the formula a little this time though. My best way of describing DmC is \"what if you asked the world's biggest nu metal fan (Slipknot, Korn, Linkin Park, Disturbed, etc.) to make a DMC game?\" Seem interesting? Let's talk about it.\n\nDmC's gameplay is largely the same from the main series. It's a spectacle fighter melee action game focused on weapon-swapping and building up stylish combos to get that juicy SSS (SENSATIONAL!!!) rank. You'll obtain three different guns and five different melee weapons. Your melee weapons include Rebellion at the start, followed by two Demon weapons and two Angel weapons, to represent Dante and Vergil's half-demon nature. I want to talk about the control scheme a little. On keyboard and mouse, your regular Rebellion attacks are on left-click. However, holding down E when you left-click will hit with the current Demon weapon, and holding down Q when you left-click will hit with the current Angel weapon. Scrolling up once swaps your Angel weapon, and down once swaps your Demon weapon, and clicking middle mouse swaps your gun. While initially this controls scheme seemed really absurd, the more I played with it the more it actually seemed very fluid, reducing the amount of time I spent swapping weapons in combat, and I almost wish they kept something similar when they made DMC 5. \n\nAesthetically, DmC is very gritty and dark, very appropriate for the nu metal scene at the time of its release. In comparison to the main series focus on Italian architecture and religious/angelic imagery, DmC feels very grounded, American, and demonic. It's not necessarily a bad thing, I would just describe it as different, and in this regard, different is actually good. It feels like a unique take on the classic DMC formula that we had seen four times already at that point. There are some instances where the modern spin feels bad; people often reference Dante and Vergil's outfit design feeling weird and off-putting, and the bold-face text that pops up all over the environment can seem immersion-breaking at times. On the other hand, the soundtrack of nu metal/screamo that plays during combat is absolutely stellar for a fan of said genres. Overall, it's different, for better or worse.\n\nThere are some aspects of DmC that are pretty rough though. The story is very lackluster. Despite it more or less being a re-telling of DMC 3, the stakes of this story seem almost silly at times. Dialogue feels un-inspired and lazy, with Dante's usual quips and jabs mostly defaulting to variations of \"Fuck you\" and \"Suck my dick\". Vergil is unrecognizable in terms of personality, and only gets remotely close to DMC Vergil in the final mission. The twenty missions you'll do are often broke up very choppily, in a way that makes it feel like a mission often ends on a commercial break rather than a true ending. A fair handful of missions also lack substance, comprised of either parkouring through the city or chase sequences or both, with little story or combat involved. There is in my opinion *one* good boss fight, with the rest either being mediocre or downright bad. Slight spoilers, the final two boss fights are incredibly boring, which is incredible because I didn't know you could make a [spoiler] Vergil [/spoiler] fight boring.\n\nIn total though, I'd still recommend checking out DmC. DmC is still pretty faithful to the original series and actually gives a lot of inspiration for the development of DMC 5. I'd recommend you wait till it goes on sale for like 75% off, and I'd recommend you play the entire main series, or at least DMC 5, first. But overall, it's a decent 6.5-7/10 from me, worth a one-time playthrough for the LOL's and the soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1684872176, "timestamp_updated": 1684872176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685208261013031006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138728363": {"recommendationid": "138728363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045987070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 802, "last_played": 1552003394}, "language": "english", "review": "i never played a DMC before this one.

I'm pretty sure this was a joint effort project between studios to make a \"re-imagined\" version of the game and holy shit this is one of those moments where you realize Capcom needed to sit down with their audience, hold their hands and have to tell them \"don't worry, DMC 5 is  still going to happen, this is just a side project, we're not canceling OG Dante\" because I'm pretty sure if everyone went into it with those expectations, they would of given this a chance instead of throwing a tantrum and treating the  game like their unwanted  step-child.\n\nQuick thing. This game has its technical flaws.  I noticed after a fight, the game did not progress, this happened twice in a row  only. Sometimes I'm pretty sure the controls aren't matching what I want them to do entirely but this could be on my end and it was super rare and other little janks here and there. Nothing that made me too upset.\n\nThe gameplay is definitely interesting with the angel and demon enemies and trying to play it a bit like a puzzle. It's hell on harder difficulties but it's creative and I gotta give them that. I understand this is 'different' from the rest of the series but the criticism for 'different' is probably from the 'diehard' fanboys who will gladly defend a game that sells a reskined version of its predecessor so I tune them out. I  also hear people say it's too easy and I'm writing this in the middle of a Son of Sparda  run but I do remember it being easier on lower difficulties. But this is again a person to person thing. You will never satisfy everyone.\n\nThe  art? Oh GOD it's so good. The music, level design and the story  is actually pretty good as long as you don't bitch about \"THIS ISN'T DMC\" and realize it's a re-imagining. If you don't like the occasional raunchiness, I get it, it does get a little eye roll in some moments but I feel like the critics of the story are ignoring all the good moments it has and even ignore moments in the story that are plot hints just to shit on it. Dante being edgy? I feel like the word edgy  changes from person to person. Because I think there are people who would call literally every character in every game 'edgy'. \n\nLook. I'll defend this game to my grave because it simply does not deserve even half of the hate  it gets. A lot of the criticisms I see are -very- immature (\"DANTE LOOK'S GEH!\") and you should be going into this game expecting a lot of fun in a -very- trippy  world.\n\n\"Try opening your mind, it's all

Sadly this game is boo boo. I'm only going to keep it because it's part of the collection. Why The Eff did they change the combat style? Why is launch & helm breaker a different button than the regular sword combo button? Why are there 2 different buttons for sword attack? who is that helping to seperate it? Now instead of circle to dodge its r1 or something lame. Sigh. DMC1 was a ground-breaking game-changer. DMC2 was kinda boo boo, but at least was playable. Using Trish with the Sparda sword kinda made up for Dante being so floaty. DMC 3 was not bad at all. DMC 4 was awesome, but I would prefer just a game with Dante & Trish. Nero didn't really impress me that much. He just wan't very interesting. I would prefer just Dante & Trish & maybe just make Nero unlockable if anything at all. Artistically this game looks great though and has an awesome looking style. It's intense & would be aweseome IF ONLY they kept the same combat style that was always the same way in all the games prior. I have DMC 5, but haven't had a chance to start playing it yet, but I am optimistic. After the way they did Dante in DMC4 I believe thy are absolutely on the right track. Changing styles with the cross pad was a great move! TBH DMC is probably one of my fave game franchises. Please don't change anything like this again and make it weird, just keep improving and always lead with Dante. Just my opinion & preference.

encima del 4 porque el Nero del 4 no me termina de agradar, mientras que el 5 aun no lo pruebo.\n\nEso si, los jefes son realmente decepcionantes, lo que es peor es que los enemigos que te encontras en el mapa son mas entretenidos de derrotar y cuando te vienen en grupos variados resultan un mayor desafio que los propios jefes, personalmente hay uno que se teletransporta al que odio con toda mi alma, me caga todos los combos y termino con una C o B como mucho.\n\nFuera de eso el sistema de combate es de los mejores que probe en los dmc, el cambio de arma es sencillo e intuitivo y puedes hacer una gran cantidad de combinaciones en medio del combate variando de armas angelicales o demoniacas, ademas de la propia revelion, los mapas alientan la repetici\u00f3n, pues hay partes que solo podes acceder teniendo un arma o habilidad que se consigue mas adelante y, como en todos los dmc, el sistema de clasificaci\u00f3n al terminar la partida te hace querer repetir, yo personalmente no

Also when it was released the design of the letters, life bar, and details like that looked mimetized as a part of the windows 8 enviroment and that combination was a good look, even if windows 8 was a bad OS.\n\nEnemyes 3/5 The minor enemies  where reall cool like a mix from the puppet and the crows demons from Devil may cry 1 (2001) i really liked that goth touch for a fight opponent. The rest of them have the look of a baby and it makes sense because an important element of the plot is related to, for me less is more sometimes.\n\nGeneral rating 4/5 Even if I hated this game at first time i played since 2013, I have to admit, that his gameplay talking more specific about the fighting system is a masterpiece and challenge at his own way, its sofisticated and it was really fun for me expend hours and hours doing combos at the bloody palace, \nAlso a disapointing thing is that Vergil hasn't bloody palace and the history could be improoved, anyway it is what it is.

The HD collection was my first introduction into the series and was kind of slow. It wouldn't hurt to play this standalone game first to get into the franchise. The combat is really satisfying and smooth. The art style for this game is fantastic and very appealing and is the best part. The game has aged very well unlike the first three hd collection games. I did not get the vergil dlc because its only like an hour and a half to two hours and for the price wasn't really worth it. Youre not missing out on much. Dante is alright in this game I prefer dante from the third game. Vergil is really cool too. The thing that makes this game stand out the most from the hd collection is the overall understanding of the story.

I would even reckon its the first game I'd recommend for someone just getting into DMC, the combat is simple but has its room for potential. The demon weapons work as very beginner, non combo weapons that pack a punch but in later stages of the game i've only ever used them for Trinity Smash and Snake-Eyes. The angel weapons imo is where the game leans more into juggling, however the combos are pretty simplistic and repetitive at times, with the angel and demon lift a baby could juggle an enemy for as long as they like. The biggest gripe for me was the button layout for controller, it made no sense to me to have two evade buttons by default whilst not being able to map the devil trigger or the jump shoot buttons eg. Rainstorm, Kablooey shots into those buttons. I mean they had a whole ass franchise to work with here for button layouts. Aside from the 'decent' combat, the cutscenes were questionable especially any involving Lillith and Mundus. For the boss fights the only ones that stood out to me was the Bob Barbas fight visually and both vergil fights (main game and dlc) theyre a good bit of fun but i find that vergil randomly walking and doing nothing breaks the immersion. Overall the game is good, far from best but with todays DMC standard from 3 and especially 5 youre definitely better off spending your time on those games.   Cons: Lacks combat polish, story is meh and some enemies bring the combat quality even lower (witches mainly) Pos: Visually the game is great even to this day, missions like Devil's Dalliance, Bad News and Vergils downfall are aesthetically pleasing, the game is a solid start for the genre/series given its simplicity and most importantly.

On one hand, it is a solid action game with cool move-sets but on the other it has so many annoying mechanics and enemies that it makes the experience a mixed bag. Dante has 5 unique melee weapons and they are all very fun to use equally. They give the player many tools to play around and have fun with  but they all feel a bit too clunky. The Ranged Weapons are all horrible and not fun at all to use and they also kinda fucking suck. Overall combat is pretty good but it has many flaws, becomes a bit repetitive, and I would blame that on the enemy design.\n\n The enemies range from punching bags to extremely annoying ones requiring you usually to use one specific tactic or weapon to defeat them.This makes the game lose its fluidity and forces you to not experiment and just spam whatever is most useful. The bosses except for one (BOB) are mediocre but pretty innocent over all .The art direction in this game is pretty awesome and overall very unique compared to any other game I've played. Limbo is a pretty cool concept and could use a bit more work but overall, really nice to look at.\n\n\nThe story:This reboot of the franchise is known for the completely terrible story and not in a good terrible way. Dante is extremely poorly written and that is a highlight of the story. The way he talks to his enemies is extremely funny. He talks like a 13 year old kid on xbox live and that is very entertaining in its own twisted dumb way. The problem is he only does that for around 5-10% of the time and the rest is just PAINFUL TO GET TROUGH. The story takes itself incredibly seriously and expects you to be invested but I bet you won't give a single shit about any character by the end of the game. Also this game has cutscenes EVERY 30 SECONDS. It tries wayyy too much to be cinematic and it fails drastically. \n\n\nTLDR: Solid short action game, would recommend if you skip any cutscene where Dante doesn't talk about how he fucked your mother last night.\n\n6.5-7/10 Interesting game.", "timestamp_created": 1679405195, "timestamp_updated": 1679406005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135091276": {"recommendationid": "135091276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198439762125", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2140, "last_played": 1682444641}, "language": "english", "review": "It is surprisingly underrated\n", "timestamp_created": 1679399924, "timestamp_updated": 1679399924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135091137": {"recommendationid": "135091137", "author": {"steamid": "76561199175911060", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 868, "last_played": 1679070245}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una obra de arte", "timestamp_created": 1679399793, "timestamp_updated": 1679399793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135080882": {"recommendationid": "135080882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025277780", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1642111808}, "language": "english", "review": "-", "timestamp_created": 1679381537, "timestamp_updated": 1679381537, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135080812": {"recommendationid": "135080812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404567324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2198, "last_played": 1679480861}, "language": "english", "review": "Vergil Must Cry", "timestamp_created": 1679381370, "timestamp_updated": 1682290842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135068537": {"recommendationid": "135068537", "author": {"steamid": "76561199442641113", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1696637077}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game.

As a reboot of maybe the best hack and slash series out there this game has a lot to life up to. The game is 10 years old now and even compared to other DMC games this is still a REALLY good hack and slash.\n\nMy one big complaint is that the story is really bad. It isn't original at all and the execution of the story isn't that good either. Almost all characters are very boring. A lot of things here are talked about but not explored at all, for example angels, this is something completely new here compared to regular DMC yet the game practically never explored that angle of the story. Combine that with the game ending on a MASSIVE cliffhanger and the story just kind of ends up being bad and getting in the way of the game. If you haven't played a Devil may cry game before you might find some value here but past that it is a waste because there was a lot of potential here due to the interesting setting.\n\nThats right the setting is actually amazing. Limbo is this dimension that exists outside of the normal world. Thats where the demons live and its an extremely interesting and original setting. Its where you pretty much do all of your fighting in game and it creates for locations so interesting and original that I have almost never seen them before in a video game. Seeing the broken world, having the world talk to you and exploring some really creative locations is seriously incredible. Another part of the setting that I really like is that Vergil is much more of a brother to Dante in this game, in pretty much every DMC game its immediately fight fight fight but here you can explore a much different dynamic which is really cool and has a lot of potential. This unique setting combined with the strong combat give more then enough reason to play this even 10 years later. \n\nTalking about combat lets get into the meat and bone of this game. Its a hack and slash game and its a DMC game. That means its all about style baby and this game does that very well. DMC is usually quite a difficult game especially at higher difficulties, this game on the other hand is MUCH more accessible. It could be because I played a ton of Hack and slash games at this point but I really felt this was one of the friendliest and most well designed game into teaching you how to explore your options. What do I mean with options? Its simple, in pretty much any hack and slash game you can usually default to some standard combos and do fine. BUT doing that is usually pretty boring, so this game teaches you how to REALLY make use out of all the weapons and abilities you unlock throughout the game. Does an enemy give you trouble? Try out some of the weapons and see how the enemy reacts to that. The only other game that is even friendlier for beginners might be hi fi rush but that also is a much more modern game. As it stands this is a great entry point for people who want to get into hack and slash games or those who just want to chill and enjoy a well put together hack and slash.\n\nThere is 1 thing I didn't talk about in the combat or the setting but that is nonetheless very important. Modes, in the 2nd mission dante unlocks the ability to switch weapons/modes. He is the son of an angel and demon which means he gets to switch between both those modes. The controls for this are really great on a controller and allow you to flow between weapons and combos extremely easily.  Switching between mode is important not only for combat but also because the game has a heavier focus on platforming and interacting with the stages. My only regret here is that the angel part of the story and the world doesn't get explored. But this mode switching stuff is really creative and feels very unique to this game. There are a couple of other games that do mode switching as well but I haven't really seen one be this backed into the core of a hack and slash game like this (Outland is a 2D action platformer that also has this type of mechanic). Major props to the devs for thinking and implementing this system in this way.\n\nAll in all there are other things I could nitpick about. For example the game auto locks onto targets, great for beginners but for people like me who attack with more intention it can be frustrating to attack the wrong enemy. Some stage mechanics can feel outdated. The game can be a bit too simple at times. Especially compared to modern entries like Bayonetta 3, DMC 5 or Hi fi rush this games complexity can leave something to be desired. But those small things don't detract from the overall feel of the game. DMC is extremely creative and every stage feels fresh and interesting.

And it isn't the Dante we know.\n+ for 10 euro on sale, the game is great and you are buying the full edition. From it, you only need 2 DLCs -  costume pack and weapon bundle. Choose the \"Neo Dante\" skin and the samurai axes. That's it, the main character looks and feels awesome now. And if u say this Dante sux... do u even played DMC 3???\n\n- story isn't that great and it doesn't take part in the previous or the new games. \n+ the main idea of the story is good and it is 1000% relatable to today's world. The massmedia is everything, telling you to consume more and more harmful low quality products, the lies on the tv etc...\n\n+++ the music is awesome.\n+++ the gameplay is better then any DMC game ever.

This also weirdly enough felt like the first game in the series, and apparently is, this series for some reason has a weird order of game story. As a result I think I might skip 1 and 2. Jump to 3, 4, and 5. But this definitely isn\u2019t a game to skip. Definitely play it first. \n\nSpecifically in the story, I like how there\u2019s twists and turns, and it\u2019s easy to follow. As someone who can be overwhelmed by information, it\u2019s very appreciated to see a game be easy enough to follow. \n\nGraphics aren\u2019t massively amazing, but it is flashy, and the art design is really good for demons, Dante, abilities and weapons. It\u2019s pretty easy enough to see, but there are visual indicators that aren\u2019t that great, when you get the angel hook and demon hook stuff. It could have done with a text indicator alongside it, as a quality of life. Subtitles are also weird, they\u2019re all clumped together, meaning the next piece of dialogue is in the subtitles, and not paced at all. It\u2019s all one sequences rather than spread out. Also the animations and combat are responsive and smooth. \n\nBut the combat is where this is gold, and this is where it clicked for me. It clicked when I unlocked the hooks. This combat is so satisfying and interesting. Minus the shield and parry enemies, but they are so good. I\u2019ve never found a game with a more satisfying combat system, and there are combos to add on top of that. It isn\u2019t as unga bunga as other games, which isn\u2019t a problem, because some combos are easy to remember. Though I prefer unga bunga, it is easy enough to play remembering just a few combos and upgrades. I played on Human difficulty (The easiest) and it was challenging enough as is. One other issue I suppose is that dodge can sometimes feel like it doesn\u2019t work. And the narrow time window to dodge some enemies makes it inaccessible. This game sorely needs accessibility options to do better really. It\u2019s not friendly to anyone with motor or cognitive impairments. Also not suitable for anyone prone to seizures. A lot of this forced shit is what can really sour games. Because this really feels like a game made with love, but clearly not consideration. \n\nFor some reason I never got enough red orbs to upgrade everything which is a first? This game seems to want you to grind it which is a strange design choice. Once is enough for me to be honest, I don\u2019t feel as though this is a game I\u2019d want to 100%. As I\u2019d get too frustrated easily. \nVoice acting is nothing notable, it\u2019s just fine. Music is good, there\u2019s some metal tracks, some um, electronic? Not sure what you call it. There\u2019s just some good music here, nothing notable though, but nothing insufferable, as I would have worried about with the electronic music, since my sensory issues could be easily overwhelmed by it sometimes. \n\nBut, there are other major flaws I have to bring up separately. \nFirstly, some of the combat and mission design feels very dated, to the point where it's unplayable and unpleasant. Secret missions in particular. Fight enemies in circle. Fight enemies without getting hit. It's not fun. I played on the easiest difficulty for reference since I don't like a challenge, and this was too challenging. Later enemies are stupidly unpleasent to play with, namely those dreamrunners. Enemies that parry are just shitty. And then on the final boss fight, there\u2019s a gamebreaking bug where he just keeps healing and Devil Trigger doesn\u2019t work against him, and can\u2019t be attacked. Either way, another accessibility issue is the lack of a map. I have no idea what instalment of the game this is, because this is my first Devil May Cry game. But it is dated in this aspect, most 2013 games have a map where there are collectables. This one doesn\u2019t for some reason. And given the collectables which by the way, some can only be obtained through later upgrades, it feels very behind in terms of accessibility. It\u2019s a game that requires replayability to be completed, and that feels really unsatisfying as a completionist myself. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s a good game for a one time play through, but I can\u2019t really say it\u2019s good for multiple. The DLC I never realized existed, feels unnecessary. \n\n(Note: learnt this is a reboot? What?

Noteworthy is his ability to use his sword, Rebellion, like a grapple hook on both enemies and certain terrain to either pull himself towards the target, or the target towards him. This gives him the mobility of Nero while having the combo variety of Dante with some of Nero's moves mixed in. The result is very fun.\n\nOverall if you're willing to treat this as its own thing, it's actually really fun. I personally prefer the story of the mainline games, but I will say that this does have some franchise potential if they decided to revisit it down the line someday. Just call it an alternate timeline/universe, problem solved. The story here isn't really even all that bad, it's just different.

As a fan of DMC from the initial entry into the series on PlayStation 2, I loved this game. I am glad that years later, people agree that it is a great game that many folks slept on because it attempted to take DMC down a different path. It is unfortunate that when a game could have simply had a different title, that it would've been treated differently from the beginning. But, that's all in the past. This game is great. It was great from the get go. And it is now appreciated more than ever. It was a complete, quality, OG-Capcom feeling action game that had no microtransactions, no monetization, just typical early 2010's add-ons, and most importantly - and this is a big one, and it really nailed it - it was fun to play. 9/10, am still playing nearly 10 years later. The \"next-gen\" updates it got both on Steam and from being ported to the PS4/Xbox One generation of consoles made it even better than it used to be. I played it originally on Xbox 360 when it was native 720p @ 30fps - and get this, I still thought it was great. haha\n\nThe edgy ass story is garbage though. lol Fair warning.", "timestamp_created": 1678895725, "timestamp_updated": 1678895725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134619385": {"recommendationid": "134619385", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037163330", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1697316705}, "language": "spanish", "review": "TA WENO\n", "timestamp_created": 1678742509, "timestamp_updated": 1678742509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134618615": {"recommendationid": "134618615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198909366048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1681931408}, "language": "english", "review": "dante is hot \n", "timestamp_created": 1678741440, "timestamp_updated": 1678741440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134608591": {"recommendationid": "134608591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357142434", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1678729892}, "language": "english", "review": "Nnnnot Steam Deck compatible.

Ninja Theory did this series justice there. I didn't mind their version of Dante but the one liners get old once in awhile but when the combat starts you can zone out in the fights. Boss fights are fun. The costumes are amazing! The one I used the most was Neo Dante. The soundtrack... The soundtrack is amazing, The amount of heavy metal in this game is perfect. You can find a combo of weapons that makes you ultra braindead for combat. The second weapon for the angel side I forgot what they were call but HOLY HELL you can go full smooth brain with.

I only recommend it for its gameplay. Other than that, I personally can't just ignore the story and characters, no matter how much I try to and I did try to like this version of DMC, but it just ain't it really. Not for me at least. \n\nThe story starts off ok, but kinda goes downhill as I went on, I had to look it up on Youtube to see if it gets better, and honestly it doesn't at all, it actually gets worse. It's nothing new really, Dante and Vegil end up being enemies once again, it would've been cool if they stayed like partners, I mean it would be something new.\n\nCharacters kinda get a bit better, except for Vergil who just goes downhill completely for me, which is funny to me because I f*cking love Vergil in the original series, but here, I hate him more than whoever in Capcom made those lazy ports for older DMC games on PC. Dante gets a bit better, like he is cool, but nowhere near cool as original Dante. \n\nGameplay is pretty much good for most part, expect the part where you can kill certain enemies with certain weapons. It's the only thing I like about this game, and for some of you that might be enough, but not for me. \n\nIt's one of those games that you're either gonna like or dislike, and me personally I am more on a dislike side. Like I said though, if you can ignore the story and are just in for the gameplay, give it a go then. \n\nAlso why is it called DmC Devil May Cry?

with a relatively limited arsenal of weapons, what i feel doesn't work is it's identity, it had a solid fundation to work with back when it was revealed in late 2010 but failed to build upon it properly due to fan backlash and pressure from capcom.\n\nCharacters feel two dimensional even with their attempts to show more than what's on the surface, this could be due to the game's relatively short duration but honestly it just seems to be a result of bad direction, the plot twist is barely hinted at and as a result feels forced for the sake of necessary conflict and a need to feel true to the original series.\n\nArt direction is shoved in your face from the very start, it's not afraid to overstay it's welcome and you can tell the developers took their time to make the game look as good as they could, it's a testament of what Unreal Engine 3 was capable of, some people might find the colors overly obnoxious but in my opinion this sentiment mainly shows in the orange areas.\n\nThe music reflects the attitude of the game, it's loud, abraisive and rebellious, it mainly features Combichrist and a bit of Noisia here and there, it's one the game's better aspects.\n\nAll in all this is a great game but it could've been better if only it had more time and a chance to show it's true face, if you know the history of the development of this game you would know what i'm referencing, sadly this will probably never happen as DMC5 released to critical acclaim and blew this game out of the water in practically every aspect, still, if you haven't played this game already you still should, it's still a solid overall 7/10 experience.", "timestamp_created": 1677936214, "timestamp_updated": 1679310355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

Trickster being a style about movement, and Swordmaster about swords, or gunslinger about guns, you get the picture.\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry takes on the gameplay by doing away with that mechanic, and making the game more freestyle, getting rid of the style switching and just reverting to Angel and Demon weapons, which have their own neat powers.\n\nThe game controls amazingly, and the gameplay is extremely responsive and intuitive. \n\nThe soundtrack is possibly the best in the series considering this game's reputation, with Combichrist and Noisia producing most of the soundtrack.\n\nThe story is surprisingly decent if you just think of it as a spin-off and not an actual story in Devil May Cry's universe.\n\nOverall, a very fun experience and worth the money.\n\n", "timestamp_created":

In order to appeal to a western audience, Capcom rebooted the franchise and handed development duties over to a third party, Team Ninja. What we got is a game that is absolutely solid and enjoyable, but feels more like a well produced Devil May Cry clone than full fledged title in the series.\n\nGameplay is solid, but has been simplified to an extent. Enemies are just as agressive and hit hard still, but they now telegraph their attacks more and dodging is all around easier to do, likely containing more I-frames than in DMC 3 and 4. The stylish action of the previous titles is still here, but now feels quite optional. Spamming the same few combos will still get you a SSS rating if you know how to dodge, so mastery of different weapons isn't a requirement for the SSS achievements for all levels. The non- combat sections do get a bit repetitive, even with kind of fun traversal mechanics and all semblance of puzzles have been removed from this one, not that they were too prevalent in the previous titles. The same traversal tools, basically being a move that pulls you towards things and another that pulls things towards you, are also useful in combat, helping with closing gaps and maintaining and prolonging combos. My main grip with the gameplay is that there is no lock-on, which makes flying enemies more difficult to deal with than necessary. I understand that this has been rectified in the PS4 release of the game, but the PC version hasn't been updated to reflect this.\n\nBoss fights are stylish, but almost brain dead easy, as much like the other enemies, attacks are telegraphed far in advance and seem to have a generous window in which they can be dodged. Bosses also have quite obvious weakpoints and definitely feel more \"video gamey\" than previous or future entries would. That said, the design of the bosses is fantastic and I had a lot of fun fighting a Bill O'Reily espy who appears as a giant VR head. \n\nLevel design is interesting and varied, but as mentioned before, gets bogged down through being overlong and just being backed with grappling points pits and all of that. The collectibles and secret missions have been significantly pared down compared to other entries. Red orbs are now a currency to buy consumables, much like in DMC4, but upgrades are now essentially bought by 'levelling up' from collecting enough white orbs dropped by enemies in combat. I thought this system worked well and incentivises stylish play as more orbs drop in relation to your stylish rank. Red orbs do seem few and far between, but the lower prices compared to the other titles does reflect this. Green orbs are present, but are actually very rare and never dropped by enemies, making mid-level healing something thats especially difficult without using consumable items or rinsing Devil Trigger. \n\nThe story is fairly well done and gives a more grounded version of Dante. I know a lot of fans werent a fan with the edgy, more youthful aspects of the character, but he works well and this serves well as an origin story. By time the credits roll, this version of Dante isn't so far removed from the mainline games' portrayal. The writing is solid and cribbing from movies such as \"They Live\" and investing the DMC story more in relatable urban enviornments instead of Gothic castles and the like, made this one feel fresh and likely informed the design team some what when it came to creating Devil May Cry V.  While this isn't the best story in gaming, its probably the most grounded and cohesive one in a Devil May Cry game and is pretty easy to follow. \n\nSo overall, was this game a mistake by Capcom? In my opinion, no. I found Devil May Cry 4 to be slightly mid and can understand how the franchise wasn't really appealing to a large audience. The game reviewed well at the time despite negative fan reaction and gamers who played it for what it was found an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, the climate at the time meant that single player titles weren't as in fashion anymore and a lot of the series existing fanbase had turned against Capcom without really giving this game a fair shake. \n\nSo to sum it up, while I'm glad the mainline DMC games returned with V, I feel like DmC was a great attempt at a reboot and part of me wishes we could have seen what was next for this slightly edgier, but deeper version of Dante. If you haven't played this before but like the idea of the character action genre, this is a great entry point. If you bypassed this out of some misplaced sense of betrayal from Capcom, give this a try, it might surprise you.", "timestamp_created": 1677002341, "timestamp_updated": 1677002341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133251672": {"recommendationid": "133251672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396405081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1677342039}, "language": "spanish", "review": "locura", "timestamp_created": 1676921896, "timestamp_updated": 1676921896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133251067": {"recommendationid": "133251067", "author": {"steamid": "76561199129993006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 971, "last_played": 1698852907}, "language": "spanish", "review": "te kiero mucho dante emo", "timestamp_created": 1676921169, "timestamp_updated": 1676921169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133232412": {"recommendationid": "133232412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317790700", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1684611730}, "language": "english", "review": "Devil May Cry Devil May Cry", "timestamp_created": 1676898178, "timestamp_updated": 1676898178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133229723": {"recommendationid": "133229723", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126072719", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 455, "last_played": 1676411682}, "language": "english", "review": "Pasaka ne geimas", "timestamp_created": 1676893793, "timestamp_updated": 1676893793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133229171": {"recommendationid": "133229171", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992340940", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 1466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1688583979}, "language": "english", "review": "A cool game, recommend to other players.

Notorious for being the exact opposite of what fans expected after DMC4, it\u2019s a huge let-down while also being a competent game. It lacks complexity in its combat, the writing is bad and most characters are infuriating - especially Dante - all in the name of \"making DMC more accessible\". It\u2019s not a bad game in and of itself though, and would\u2019ve been better off without the DMC license attached to it. Recommended if on sale, but keep in mind this isn't the typical DMC formula.[/h1]\n\nDmC is one for the history books. A word about its development is required for context: Capcom wanted a more accessible DMC title and Ninja Theory, a studio with some chops in character-action games (and more recently of Hellblade fame) would be hired for the job. NT really wanted to stay faithful to the originals, but Capcom kept pushing back against that. Fans didn\u2019t take the new direction well at all (understandably so) and NT took the blunt of the criticism - something they would in turn handle in the worst possible manner. The internet doesn't forget.  \n\nThe game came out and it \"didn\u2019t find its audience\" - because said audience only ever existed in Capcom\u2019s focus groups, if at all. Nobody wanted a toned-down combat system that\u2019s admittedly pretty good, well animated and very stylish but way too easy for veterans and probably too hard for newcomers at the same time. The story and general vibe that reeks of early-2010\u2019s emo edginess along with terrible writing sealed the deal: as a DMC game, it was dead on arrival. Oh and Dante? He\u2019s annoying. [i]Really, really annoying[/i]. \n\nIn hindsight though, the game is alright and it feels good. Animations, effects, graphics and sounds are all pretty darn good and the OST is a banger featuring Combichrist and Noisia.\nThe combat system is basically a streamlined version of DMC3 & 4\u2019s. I\u2019m not good at DMC - in fact DMC3 in normal mode is still a real challenge to me - but I did manage to S rank all missions in Hard (SOS) mode. It was a good challenge and felt really good to play overall. \nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that it has just enough depth to require some mastery and practice, ultimately giving you that feeling of having improved as a player but not enough to satisfy the combo junkies and I totally understand how lacking this must feel to them.\n\nOne thing to note is that this PC version is a really good port, but it\u2019s the original release. A \"Definitive Edition\" was later released on 8th gen consoles with a bevy of gameplay tweaks, making for a better experience overall. There are mods to replicate some of those improvements, but not all of them sadly. Needless to say, the Definitive Edition wasn\u2019t released on PC and most likely never will be. \n\nIt\u2019s often on sale and in all honesty you\u2019ll most likely have a decent time with this game. However, if you\u2019re a die-hard, air-dash-cancelling-backroll-trickster combo junkie, then this isn\u2019t a game made for you and I really, really empathize with you: Capcom did you dirty on this one. \n\nRecommended if on sale, with the DLCs \u2013 hard pass if you\u2019re any good at character-action games and you\u2019re looking for a fix. \n\n[spoiler]Low-key? Play this game while being drunk. It elevates the whole thing. No really, it's one of those games that's a treat with a couple beers.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1675689068, "timestamp_updated": 1675689068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586613297462463379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132304194": {"recommendationid": "132304194", "author": {"steamid": "76561199219616256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1697943067}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego muy god controles brutales y se pueden hacer combos facilmente, la dificultas si es hardcore pero un muy buen juego", "timestamp_created": 1675662003, "timestamp_updated": 1675662003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132291133": {"recommendationid": "132291133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057068503", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1675560478}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego es realmente divertido y ambicioso. \u00a1El reinicio de series populares que no podr\u00edan ir mejor!

you help out a group dedicated to exposing the conspiracy to anyone who is willing to open their eyes.\nThe gameplay is stellar as well, combat feels smooth and you are given a variety of toys to use such as the standard sword, pistols, angel and demon weapons plus more as you make progress, and each weapon can be given upgrades to make you even more formidable in later levels.\n\nThe part i loved most about the story is how well done the boss fights are, especially vs Bob Barbas, whoever designed that entire sequence deserved a raise for how thoughtfully executed it was.\nSecondly we have the

To elaborate on the combat mechanics: Fake Dante's moveset is a dumbed-down version of Dante's and Nero's moveset in DMC 4. No more Style Switching, or Styles at all for that matter.

The gameplay is just PERFECT. The music is awesome, with one of the best OSTs I have heard in a video game.\nCompared to hack and slash games that were released in 2013, like MGR: R this game is MILES better in terms of gameplay. (as much as I LOVE MGR)\nSo, what went wrong? The game had no character, no confidence in itself, unlike MGR.\n\nThe problem is, it tried to reboot DMC into a direction that fans of the series didn't like, so it was bound to fail.\nAnd the developers were frustrated with how the fans were getting mad about \"small\" changes such as Dante's new hair colour (which is understandable to be frustrated about, imagine working on a game for a long time only for it to be hated because of a hair colour change, a change that was forced by Capcom, but at the same time, the fans are also right since the white/silver hair is one of Dante's defining features that the reboot Dante feels like a different character, which he kind of is) that they tried to make fun of the older games in their presentations, interviews and in the game. This didn't help their game sell on release, obviously.\n\nThe [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgfXeUldLt4] trailer [/url] also showed a completely different game, one with a much darker tone that looked very, very cool. Too bad they had to change it after the reveal due to fan reactions.\n\nThis game had an unfortunate development. Capcom forced the devs to change everything about the game to distance themselves from the older games as possible, to give it a more \"Western\" feel. This was common at the time, as Capcom kept sourcing out games to be made by western devs, and wanted the games to feel \"Western\". This included changing Dante's design. The [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/DevilMayCry/comments/9bwa6m/early_dmc_dante_designs_were_more_faithful_to_the/] original concept. [/url]\nCapcom wanted the remake to be as different from the original DMC as possible, which hurt Ninja Theory and the game a lot. Then after the reveal trailer they had to change a lot of elements in the game due to the massive backlash that they got from the fans.\nOne has to wander, what was their original vision like if Capcom didn't force changes? Or even how the game would have turned out if they stuck to what was shown in the ad?\n\nIs the gameplay is better than DMC 3/4/5? No.\nIs is better than every other hack and slash game in terms of gameplay? To me? Absolutely. Every game I have ever played were you control a third person character and had combat in it paled in comparison to DmC in terms of gameplay. (Besides the mentioned games.)\n\nOh well. At least Itsuno loved it, and wanted a sequel to be made for DmC. And DmC has also inspired a lot of things in DMC V.

playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.", "timestamp_created": 1672779887, "timestamp_updated": 1672779887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190507411956787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130024923": {"recommendationid": "130024923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322672504", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1687886583}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay melhor do que o DMC 5", "timestamp_created": 1672750371, "timestamp_updated": 1672750371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130002821": {"recommendationid": "130002821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094834942", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 752, "last_played": 1685993768}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly this game gets too much flak for deviating from the aesthetic and certain systems of the original game, but it still is a great game in its own right. If they put in styles, and had a style switcher, I think this game would be just as well-liked as the others. If nothing else it doesn't suffer from the horrible camera problems most of the other games do (with the exception of DMC5), and you are also imbued with two alternate weapons pretty early so you can actually enjoy making unique combos from an early point.\n\nSomething everyone hated, and that they rectified in the Definitive Edition on consoles (that you can still mod out on PC), is the color-coded enemies which are only vulnerable to one type of weapon (Angel/Demon respectively). This completely takes out 2/3 of your arsenal which defeats the purpose of the game. Fortunately as I mentioned you can mod them such that they are vulnerable to all weapons... I highly encourage you do this as fighting these enemies is a massive damper on the experience otherwise.\n\nThe boss fights don't much compare to that of the mainline series, but the enemies are generally fun to fight and not frustrating either; I feel some enemies in DMC3/4 were straight up designed to be annoying first rather than challenging.

I'm pretty sure you'll love it.\n\nOne last thing: The Soundtrack is AWESOME!!! probably one of the best if not the best in the whole series, I loved the soundtrack so much that I made a cover of one of the songs, check it out: https://youtu.be/UWQlA0ga5zs", "timestamp_created": 1672149647, "timestamp_updated": 1691334944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129403043": {"recommendationid": "129403043", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064666071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1689205565}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta weno pa pasar esta calor cl", "timestamp_created": 1672121356, "timestamp_updated": 1672121356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129392221": {"recommendationid": "129392221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102043750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2197, "last_played": 1694217914}, "language": "english", "review": "very good, yes", "timestamp_created": 1672110194, "timestamp_updated": 1672110194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129391215": {"recommendationid": "129391215", "author": {"steamid": "76561199021245323", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 494, "last_played": 1656129173}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no des bola a los rumores, es excelente", "timestamp_created": 1672109252, "timestamp_updated": 1672109252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129381015": {"recommendationid": "129381015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342585212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 820, "last_played": 1675046760}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un Hack n' slash muy bueno pero con una historia sacada de las pel\u00edculas de Canal 5.\nBueno para pasar el rato.", "timestamp_created": 1672099520, "timestamp_updated": 1672099520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129374229": {"recommendationid": "129374229", "author": {"steamid": "76561199173609036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1673793540}, "language": "spanish", "review": "que juego del bien, me lo acabo de terminar y en mi opini\u00f3n es fant\u00e1stico, hay  que decir que nunca jugu\u00e9 un devil may cry, este es mi primero y me pareci\u00f3 espectacular, lo jugu\u00e9 cuando era mas chiquito a este juego en la ps3 y lo volv\u00ed a jugar y me encanto.

I went in expecting a crappy reboot, and instead got one of the best DMC games there is. This was more fun than 5 for me, especially because of the focus on just Dante and not 2 other guys as well. To put it simply, there was nothing I hated. Music? Bangers. Gameplay? Flowing. Environments? Unique to say the least. This game doesn't have you switching weapons, rather you hold down left or right trigger to switch to an angelic or demonic weapon. Each specified for a specific style of combat. This leads to some of the most fluid and simply fun weapon switching I have had in the series. The game was rough, but didn't want me to suffer, and was a solid but easy enough challenge throughout. I love the metal soundtrack that accompanies the demon busting, and the environments. Beyond a chefs kiss. These were more than just \"Guys look it's kinda hell\" they were amazing demonic corruptions of seemingly normal places, and other times it was gothic madness. I can't say anything in specific, but trust me. It is great. The story was something I heard many gripes about, but I loved it. Campy, Edgy, Way-To-Serious goodness that I love. Something as simple as Dante telling a boss to F off is hilarious to me.\n\nOverall, Amazing. Better than 5 because of it's focus on Dante in my book.

It all looks so beautiful and I could look at the landscapes for hours. There are also so many ideas that you would never find in the main series, like fighting a news reporter in a news station, or even a demonic night club. The gameplay is amazing as well, and I genuinely had more fun with it than the original DMC1.\nThe story is also surprisingly good. I feel like they wanted to make a DMC game, but they had so many new ideas and concepts that went against the established rules of the DMC universe, so they decided to make a reboot, and I'm genuinely not complaining.\nThey honestly could have changed all of the names and tweaked the story a slight bit and they could have had a completely original franchise, but I'm glad we got what we got, and I actually would not mind seeing a sequel.\nOverall, very underrated, and I highly recommend it.\n8.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1671253269, "timestamp_updated": 1671253269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424242407083511353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128692965": {"recommendationid": "128692965", "author": {"steamid": "76561199068177963", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1211, "last_played": 1684841865}, "language": "spanish", "review": "que mira bobo anda pa alla", "timestamp_created": 1671236013, "timestamp_updated": 1671236013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128666555": {"recommendationid": "128666555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238497356", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1148, "last_played": 1679660958}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the most fun I've ever had in a hack-and-slash game.

They replaced the obnoxious 90s Capcom castle backtracing across a needlessly large map with uni-directional levels\n2. Although the levels are easier to progress through, Ninja Theory replaced grading level performance based on orb collection with grading based on discoverable souls/keys to encourage exploration and secret-finding for each mission\n3. DmC replaces the need to manually equip melee weapons with using 3 different melee weapons using no trigger, LT, and RT. More interesting / seamless combos.\n4. Instead of needing to use a multi-button combo for dodge (why was that ever a thing), they've assigned dodge to RB\n5. Ninja Theory dropped the unnecessary upgrade currency and variable cost of abilities of previous games with straight-forward upgrade points, and generously give you several moves for each weapon from the jump so you can... have fun with the game.\n6. They improved the design of Nero's grab by allowing you to pull in or pull towards every enemy in the game, instead of being able to do just one or the other in DMC4. \n7. The \"puzzles\" of the DmC franchise are done away with entirely (e.g., activating and pushing a statue towards a pedestal)\n8. The secret missions are much less sweaty/obnoxious to play through\n9. The auto-lock on camera is surprisingly intuitive, and the camera during action is less intrusive than previous games\n10. The move set in general, across all three melee weapons, feels more expansive and intuitive to use than previous games\n11. The crappy platforming in previous DMC entries, where if you mess up you have a mandatory arena fight for 2 minutes, is thankfully dropped in DmC.\n\nThe game feels great to play, the big block text in levels + collapsing environments of purgatory class up the joint, and the soundtrack is the least-bad of all DMC games thus far.

I'm largely going to review this as its own standalone thing, because it's a different dev and a different universe. Though obviously I have to compare and contrast for context and gameplay.\n\nThe game on the offset is a lot easier and none of the timings are difficult to grasp. The enemies all have gimmicks that require timed attacks or specific moves to take down but their cycles are slower and their attack patterns are more obvious, making it a lot easier to play and feel competent. The rating system is also really forgiving but if I remember DMC4 was also kind of like that. I don't think this is necessarily a negative for casual play it just means you aren't gonna be hitting a training mode to get down timings to just fight regular enemies, though you may have to exploit that in the difficulties where the enemies are more plentiful and move faster.\n\nThe primary gimmick is that you're the child of an angel and a demon (instead of a human and a demon) so you can choose between your angelic powers and your demonic powers. they're locked to keys you hold down while you perform the actions, and I think it's a fairly straight forward system that's easy to grasp. I would say as a whole there's a lot more platforming but I think that's a good way to actually train up the grappling mechanics for combat and provides a little more variety than just being shoehorned into arenas.\n\nThe plot is a plot. As a whole I don't like the plots of any of these games. This one is consistently not good but the performances are fine which make it more tolerable. It's also standalone and they don't try to create an overly complicated deeplore around it (to its credit, DMCV  handled its lore burden pretty well)  I think most of the plot is stupid and, paradoxically, I think Dante is the best part. There are a ton of scenes I saw beforehand I thought were just clever edits or youtube poops but no, they're really just absurd in context too. He's kind of something closer to Nero being an obnoxious punk ass kid more than a suave bounty hunter. Nero is probably my favourite character from the main series which might be why I didn't mind this as much as other people did. \n\nOne weird thing about the plot is Vergil seems a lot more... defined? I didn't play 3 special edition so Vergil was introduced as a big bad in a tower and that was basically his full context for me in the original series. Now he's a very dated-even-when-this-came-out capital A Anonymous hacker that bonds with Dante over the story and eventually goes off the deep end. I actually think it kind of works structurally and gave me more of an emotional impact by the time I got to the fight rather than suddenly introducing him in the third game. I don't necessarily like Vergil in either series but I think this one wins by a hair, if only because his famous line \"I've got a bigger dick\"\n\nGraphically I think the game is great for the target system. Really solid use of colour palettes. Most of the actual environments are kind of that \"floating brick vaguely european town\" otherworld vortex thing that virtually every game of this era was designed around, but it does break out of it enough that it doesn't get grating. It also had the advantage of coming out much later in the console life cycle than 4 did, which I think shows its age a lot more and also had a notoriously bad PC port. This game ran really solid even on my old gtx560m laptop at the time. \n\nAlso the soundtrack is good. Noisia and Combichrist aren't artists I listen to in my off time but I think the work both of them did in this is superb and is the one thing about this game that fits the brand. Noisia handled a lot of the environmental music while Combichrist did basically every action theme and, no complaints. \n\nThis game is regularly cheap, and worth a pick up if A) you're just curious how dumb the game can be or B) the main series is a little above your punching weight. I think difficulty wise it lies somewhere closer to Bayonetta where the challenge is there if you insist but it isn't going to shame you if you don't want to sit around learning combos instead of playing a video game.", "timestamp_created": 1667113725, "timestamp_updated": 1667113725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653501331806182861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124613261": {"recommendationid": "124613261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132334496", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1667864643}, "language": "english", "review": "mmm kill", "timestamp_created": 1667074721, "timestamp_updated": 1667074721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124609637": {"recommendationid": "124609637", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975257709", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1691805491}, "language": "english", "review": "     This is a game that raises a lot of questions.

While DmC takes a new approach on the music it is still amazing, i find myself listening to the main battle themes pretty often.\n\nIn this game you have the ability to instantly swap between 3 weapons as you want, Rebellion to start with, Arbiter, Eryx, Osiris, and Aquila. Along with dual pistols, a shotgun, and an explosive dart gun, and you can either use one weapon 90% of the time or just mix and match combos till the enemy dies\n\nThe story isnt bad, the only thing about it is that sometimes it feels like you missed something because as a spoiler, [spoiler] the end just kind of reveals something never really said by a character before that final chapter[/spoiler]\n\nOverall i wouldnt say to skip this game, it isnt canon, it might not get a sequel (still gonna hope for one) and the new dante seems more spiteful than the original, but its still a fun game to play.\n\ndont ask bout the vergil dlc i didnt buy it cuz the sale ended\nRated 4/6 on the DMC tierlist IMO", "timestamp_created": 1664413904, "timestamp_updated": 1672476562, "voted_up":

People who dislike this game just for those reasons don't take the time to realize the good parts about it. For example, some things this game did that was great was being better than dmc 2, having the best noncombat gameplay in the series by far, having a cool soundtrack, and trying something new. Trying something new can result to being awful, bad, good, or amazing. So obviously a lot of people don't like the choices made for this game, but its not all bad. Combat was as expected, and story was mediocre.\n\nThe bosses in this game though are pretty much all the same. They are all mini game bosses and its all the same thing, dodge stuff, shoot stuff, then you get a few seconds to attack the only place where they take damage. Nothing special here.\n\nThe weapons though in this game have a twist to them. There are angel weapons which are fast but deal low damage, mainly used to move around the enemies. There are demon weapons which are slow but hard hitting and can punch through shields. I think this is a pretty cool and welcome edition to this game. However, there is this really annoying mechanic where with some enemies are color coded. You can only damage red enemies with demon weapons and you can only damage blue enemies with angel weapons. And many times throughout the campaign, there will be these really annoying parts where they put both red and blue enemies in the same place and those parts can get extremely irritating especially since their attacks are unique and they can work together to make you die. For example, a blue enemy can freeze you for a few seconds and a red enemy can make the ground around them lava and can burn and hurt you. Put these together, and you have a few seconds where you are frozen while standing on lava and repeatedly taking damage.\n\nEven with a fair bit of negatives, this game can still be really enjoyable.

"review": "I know many people look at the number on the review and say: 6?! Really? Without getting into the review. Listen, I loved playing Devil May Cry; but there were too many things I didn't love about it. After playing through the game once I can safely say: \"I'm glad I played it, but I'll never play this again.\"\n\nAlso to note is my relative inexperience with prior games. I have played  DMC games in the past, but never religiously.\n\nThe Good\nThere plenty to love about DmC. The first of which is Dante. Walking through a fun house during the first level, a deranged doll springs into Dante's face. The moment is meant to scare the gamer, but Dante simply exclaims \"whatever\" and keeps walking. I laughed out loud. The writing for the game is great and it comes out in little moments like this.\n\nThe music and level design in the game are like PB&J. Nothing is better than taking a group of enemies head-on while some headbanger metal plays in a disco night-club from Hell. Levels were never confusing or unfair. When blended with the kinetic music it's tough not to get into the demon killing spirit. Or the 'killing a giant demon baby' spirit.\n\n\nThe graphics are amazing. The game looks very pretty with no noticable texture issues or anything.\n\nThe Bad\nI understand the original games were episodic. The break up of the 20 episodes was so jarring it actually pulled me out of the game. A good example is when you meet a demon and must retrieve his eye. You know immediately that an entire level will be devoted to this task after you meet him. After that level the story continues. It makes you go \"Yep. Side quests that are main quests.\" It took me out of the story when all I wanted to do was simply continue on with more missions.\n\nHigher scores require speed and variety. Although the majority of the weapons are fun, you will pick favorites and use them more than the others. I found the Arbitor, Aquila and Ebony and Ivory to be my trinity of weapons. I also found it difficult to force myself to use something like Kablooey when I didn't want to.\n\nThere are hidden keys and such scattered across all the levels that force you to play through the game once to unlock all the abilities and weapons, then return to prior levels in order to retrieve them. It's tough to explore a level or try platforming to reach a key I see, when it's not possible to retrieve until I unlock a specific weapon 5 levels later. This game relies on repeat playthroughs to find all the keys and I just didn't love it enough to replay just for collectibles.\n\nAlso Witches. Those awful stupid witches.\n\nBorrow or Rent it\nDmC is basically an in-between. The creators wanted a game the revitalized the Devil May Cry franchise by creating a new audience while trying not to alienate its original fanbase. If it could have picked one direction or the other I think the overall flow of the game would've been better. This game was stuck in the middle.\n\nDespite its flaws, it's a must-play.

The game is sometimes a bit too gross; the story is kind of cliche. Dante evolves throughout the story, so I suppose I can say he is improving (I can't take Kat seriously, she is just a teen eyecandy I guess) and I feel this whole Vergil line was pretty rushed and odd at the end. It felt so out of the blue.\n\nI probably could have not finished the game if the gameplay hadn't been enjoyable, but it is! Now I won't complain about the camera and the enemy lock because I read this is fixed on consoles. Yes, not seeing who you are attacking was a big problem for a while. After a that, I guess you can get used to it. The music was a \"blurry metal mishmash\" but fit the theme.\n\nSo far, this doesn't sound exciting, I know. But overall, it somehow works! After I finally found my favourite weapons, my best strategy for how to avoid enemies and how to worry less because of the camera problem, the gameplay carries the game. The majority of the levels are cool, (the Disco level was such an attack on my eyes, but that is the most memorable one.) they tried to play with this limbo idea. There is a ton of art that you can unlock by playing the game for collectionists. (The alternative Kat designs were better, just saying)\n\nOne more thing: This Dante is edgy as heck. I did laugh at some of the things he said, and you know what? This game is like the end of the 90's or early 2000's bad action movies. It is kind of a stupid story, with neat action, all for show, but overall it is a guilty pleasure!\n\nRecommended! (At a discount, the price tag is too high.)\n\nHowever, the Vergil DLC is NOT recommended. It doesn't add anything new to the story aside from showing he is being crazy. Even worse, the cutscenes are just quickly drawn pictures, not even cinematic like in the main game.

The game regularly tried to fight me on this, making regular references to other DMC games that add nothing but comparisons to something better. And yet, even giving this game enough benefit of the doubt to make you weep, this game is just... not very good.\nI'll start with the good; the visual design of the levels are often gorgeous, even while the actual level layouts are poor to mediocre. Limbo looks genuinely cool, there are some interesting setpieces, even when it's trying too hard by having blueprints for a heist appear over the level it's at least a nice idea. The highlight of the game are a scene where pizza covers Dante's dick, and the first few bosses, specifically the foul-mouthed succubus (who talks like a self-parody and is one of the only non-sexy succubi I've seen in media), and the Falcon News boss (who has aged like a fine wine). And sometimes, traversing environments with the grappling hooks and aerial movement can be fun.\n\nAnd that is where me being nice ends.\n\nThe gameplay is... above average. It's better than most generic PS3 generic action games, but considering that's the core selling point it isn't really amazing. It's playable, when you aren't dealing with the more annoying enemies, and fortunately the combo meter is incredibly easy to get good scores on so not being good at it doesn't matter. I'd call it a good starting point for the series, but the plot is also repugnant. Dante is consistently a horrible, unfunny person, the plot is a mediocre \"chosen one\" story where another chosen one is constantly stood five feet off camera, usually not doing much until the badly-foreshadowed twist. The subject matter is often so edgy that it actually wraps back around and becomes funny, although sometimes it is just tasteless. Not even offensive, just... not adding anything of worth. I have been told it very much misses the point of the rest of the DMC series, but even in isolation it isn't a good story. It is very amusingly bad though. The game tries to take things clearly not intended to be taken seriously and then plays them completely straight, makes political commentary so laughably on-the-nose that I'm not sure they even realised it was political commentary in the first place, and gives characters no real traits, motivation, or anything to flesh them out beyond their shallow roles in the plot. It tries to reinforce the tension between the player and the main villains by regularly cutting away to them having sex or whatever they felt would be most shocking, but Dante doesn't interact with them until they're boss fights so there's no real connection beyond a vague feeling of \"I should probably do revenge for my dead parents now I remember them, I guess\". Even during my favourite boss fights, I could have cut out Dante and replaced him with a sexy lamp with a collection of weapons and it probably would have improved things.\nBut despite everything, I see potential here. The game should not be a Devil May Cry game, it shouldn't have these characters with no arcs, and they should really hire someone to make it so that I can go backwards in a level after I miss a collectable I just saw without falling through the world for some reason (I mean seriously, I can make the jump, why the hell did they remove collision? Like, I had to backtrack through that point later anyway and the collision worked then, so someone deliberately decided to fuck me I guess?).\nBut like... I can see something this game could be. A game where you kill demons while bad metal music plays, where the cool visual design combined with good level design, where Dante actually grew from being a dick to being nicer rather than just... getting a crush on a woman who looks like a teenager but still being a massive dick anyway?

Dante is an unlikable dosh, he doesn't really change much at the end of the game either. Virgil is kind of a wimp through the entire campaign, he obviously can fight but no were near as strong as Dante until you get to his DLC campaign where he gains power and now is basically just the villain 2.0 Cat is just a damsel in distress most of the time, but at least she is a bit more useful than another girl from DMC 4 that we all know about.... Overall the characters are just lacking.... I didn't really like any of them. \n\nThe combat is also pretty decent, its pretty clear that they wanted you to make you feel like a cool guy without having to reach the high skill ceilings from the other mainline DMC games so the combos feel somewhat limited even as you unlock more of them. Having Blue Weapons damage only Blue enemies and Red Weapons damaging red enemies was stupid though, it was fixed in the definitive version of the game but the PC release never got that version sadly. \n\nThe majority of the enemies are pretty generic though, pretty uninspiring.... I like the whole limbo setting that you have to fight in but yeah the enemies could have been worked on just a bit more. \n\nMusic is okay, not my favorite soundtrack though and nothing overly memorable. \n\nBoss Fights are very VERY few compared to the rest of the games.... Barley any bosses in this game, but when they do it does feel very unique and climatic. \n\nI'm surprised how many people liked the game though, considering the heavy backlash this game got over dantes design which is understandable he kind of sucks in the game as I mentioned before.... But it defiantly is a complete game so, no were near as bad. \n\nI recommend it in the end though, obviously not my favorite DMC game but I think its better than DMC 2 and maybe even DMC 1 just a bit.... Would I want a sequel to this game? Ehhh it depends on how they handle the story and if dante has any development... maybe change that boring devil trigger they have too but yeah its not a bad game as I said.... worth playing at least one time.", "timestamp_created": 1657928787, "timestamp_updated": 1657928787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118876012": {"recommendationid": "118876012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060075555", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1657926839}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1657926723, "timestamp_updated": 1657926723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118874717": {"recommendationid": "118874717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217431949", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1657992378}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1657924490, "timestamp_updated": 1661982946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118841429": {"recommendationid": "118841429", "author": {"steamid": "76561199243498236", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 614, "last_played": 1696033857}, "language": "english", "review": "I have now played this game from start to finish, and i have to say i had never been interested in the DmC series and i can now say that i am overwhelmingly invested in the series.

You fucked girls here and there, and you have a John Wick-like ability to kill everything before you. But there's a catch: it's full of cliche. It's like if an 18 year old was to direct a game in terms of plot. A pretty letdown, not worth for the story, sorry.

However, as most will tell you, the story drags this game down from potentially being a favorite of this series for me, to being only a middle of the road entry.

As well, the gameplay suffers from some issues with enemies restricted to a certain type, and a undebatably worse version of devil trigger.

The DLC must also be purchased separately, so no playable Vergil unless you want to pay extra. \n\nStill, this version goes pretty cheap so if you have no prospect of obtaining the other one I would say it's worth considering giving it some time. The game definitely falls short of the heights of the others in the series, but it's pretty fun for what it is, despite some problems.\n\nIn terms of the combat mechanics: the depth doesn't come close to something like DMC5, but Dante has a decently varied moveset which is easy to deploy and fun to explore. Tearing through demons is satisfying and cool, so I'd say on that basic level it's successful.  The main drawbacks come from enemy designs, with the worst moments coming from multiple enemies spamming hyper armoured attacks constantly, and colour-coded enemies that prevent you using your full arsenal. Of course you can learn to play around these quirks, but it feels like the game is working against itself sometimes. Boss fights are also few in number and generally uninteresting to fight. \n\nNon-combat mechanics are really tertiary in a game like this, but it's probably worth mentioning that the story and characters are something you will either love or hate. Or both. There are also traversal mechanics which offer some basic jumping puzzles between fights and hidden paths that lead to secret missions. Personally I found the pacing much better in repeat playthroughs when I was able to skip cutscenes, ignore alternate routes I'd already explored, and get straight to the action. But if you appreciate the adventure/exploration side of games like this then I think you'll probably find something to like here.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the level design. You spend most of your time in a sort of demonic corruption of the real world called \"limbo\" - the upshot of which is that the environments change around you a lot and you spend considerable amounts of time on platforms suspended in a void. This is actually quite welcome because it gives you the option of throwing enemies to their death in some circumstances, and the positioning of bottomless pits makes fight arenas varied. The aesthetic of racing through a reality that is hostile to your presence is also petty cool, though it sacrifices the sense of place you might otherwise hope to get while exploring. \n\nOverall this game has its fair share of flaws and contradictions, but if you can accept that about it then there's a fun experience to be had.", "timestamp_created": 1657652991, "timestamp_updated": 1657652991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538582503795623779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118698420": {"recommendationid": "118698420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985083561", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1657640251}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very nice\n", "timestamp_created": 1657638702, "timestamp_updated": 1657638702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492520987987518311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118681221": {"recommendationid": "118681221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066263952", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 845, "last_played": 1658014953}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es casi perfecto, su \u00fanico defecto es llamarse Devil May Cry.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\n", "timestamp_created": 1657155136, "timestamp_updated": 1657155136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464993387460708618", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118344575": {"recommendationid": "118344575", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063039453", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1656547709}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta wa ta entera wena", "timestamp_created": 1657138324, "timestamp_updated": 1657138324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118344278": {"recommendationid": "118344278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375998801", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1672074609}, "language": "spanish", "review": "uwu", "timestamp_created": 1657137998, "timestamp_updated": 1657137998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118332254": {"recommendationid": "118332254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865808546", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1656933663}, "language": "english", "review": "underrated", "timestamp_created": 1657124655, "timestamp_updated": 1657124655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118308501": {"recommendationid": "118308501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042971217", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2507, "last_played": 1676644199}, "language": "english", "review": "Not like any other a must try game", "timestamp_created": 1657092418, "timestamp_updated": 1657092418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565038979053497314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118306958": {"recommendationid": "118306958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198949455257", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 712, "last_played": 1697665200}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta bueno.

They story of Dante and Virgil is entertaining here, albeit a little \"teen angst-y\"\n+ GRAPHICS are solid and the game runs really well, even on lower powered PCs. I know the game has been out for a while now, but if you're playing this in 2022, you're going to have a great time as long as your PC isn't downright ancient. \n+ STEAM DECK OPTIMIZED! If you have a Steam Deck, this is a great game to show off the console. I am running easily at 60fps\n\nCons:\n- VOICE ACTING the voice of Dante is... a bit corny. I think the original game's tone is more goofy and over-dramatic, which I think is pretty fun, but it seems like they tried to make this Dante a little bit too \"cool\" and most of the time he is just cringe.\n- WRITING is fine, and again, I like the story and characters overall.

Very hack n slash, but the gameplay doesn't feel very satisfying; lots of VERY LONG animation locks that prevent dodging (enemies can literally start their wind up after you started the animation already and finish attacking you while you're still stuck in the animation), very few combos so you just end up doing the same 2 or 3 attacks over and over again. \n\nBy mission 3 (out of like 20?) I was already skipping the cutscenes because they were so boring and uninteresting and the dialog was so cringe-y it was like nails on a chalkboard. I'm probably not going to finish the game because by mission 8/9 the game, combat, and level designs are so repetitive it's just not fun to play, not to mention the \"hardest\" difficulty (without completing at least 1 playthrough) provides next to no challenge at all...

Lo \u00fanico que hab\u00eda o\u00eddo antes de la saga es que est\u00e1 hecho b\u00e1sicamente para molarse, ser visual y est\u00e9tico con tus ataques y b\u00e1sicamente sacarse la polla, y la verdad, es as\u00ed, se nota y se disfruta cada segundo. Tienes tantas armas, ocho para ser concreto, que puedes usar simult\u00e1neamente en mitad del combate para generar combos espectaculares, moverte de aqu\u00ed para all\u00e1 fren\u00e9ticamente, y destruir cada enemigo nuevo que se plante delante tuyo que es imposible aburrise. Adem\u00e1s la historia est\u00e1 bien, los bosses son muy divertidos, aunque cuando coges r\u00e1pido los patrones se hacen muy sencillos, por lo que a la vez permiten modificar la dificultad del juego en hasta 6 o 7 niveles. Los momentos de parkour son muy buenos, intuitivos y a la vez lo suficientemente complejos para que en ocasiones tengas que buscar bien para recoger el item que buscabas. El sistema de items y desbloqueables de cada nivel est\u00e1 muy bien, hay pocas cosas, unas almas encerradas, unas puertas y unas llaves, cuando consigues la llave correcta en la puerta correspondiente abrir\u00e1s un reto externo al nivel que pueden ser desde matar unos enemigos sin repetir el mismo ataque dos veces, o hacerlo sin recibir ning\u00fan golpe, y que te dar\u00e1n alg\u00fan objeto para mejorar caracter\u00edsticas de Dante.

It works, is decent and if you can get it cheap, is worth it. \n\nBy the way there are some amazing levels, I love the art style, the limbo ideas, there are so many good ideas here, but it some times feels so underwhelming. \n", "timestamp_created": 1655169826, "timestamp_updated": 1655169826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116943599": {"recommendationid": "116943599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060977892", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1656781484}, "language": "english", "review": "As good as i remember it to be.

Reason for it being, it's a reboot. It was launched in 2013, 5 years after DMC 4, which already had mixed opinions. The game was originally planned to have a sequel, but after releasing DMC4's special edition in 2014, Capcom decided to rekindle the flame and bring the old series back with DMC 5, leaving this one to be seen as the black sheep of the family. But why is that, most reviews here are positive so what's the deal?\n\nWell, in a word, change. DMC was already known as one of the best action series ever, with DMC 3 being loved by everyone and 4 bringing a new story with a new protagonist, that overall got a pretty positive response from the community. People already knew that Dante's arc was over from DMC 1, so the best move was to introduce new people into the mix. 5 years passed, no new game was in sight, a reboot is announced, with familiar elements but not familiar faces and a new sort of \"vibe\" and different gameplay mechanics. Some people liked it for what it was, and some people hated it because of what it wasn't.\nNow, there are problems with it, even I have to admit it.\n\n- Dante and Vergil are completely different people, there was potential, but the essence just wasn't there. \n- The game was launched in 2013 which was [b]the[/b] year of edgy games, so it gets kinda cringey at times. \n- Enemy color coding is a bad idea and it's very poorly executed here.\n\nBut does that hurt the experience so much it's just better not to play it?\n\nNo, absolutely fucking not, this shit rocks.\n\nDmC takes a lot from the old games and improves on it, and although some things could've been better, there's a lot more good than bad here. The game still follows the character action, hack and slash vibe the originals had, but has a new take on some things. Gameplay is still awesome, we still hack and slash the shit out of everything, the lack of lock-on really doesn't make that much of a difference here since the game was made with that in mind, and although I wouldn't mind it coming back (which the special edition did bring, we just didn't get it), I don't miss it that much. The new weapon system is amazing, there are some flaws, but compared to DMC 3, there's a lot more \"on the fly\" variety. You get 5 weapons, Rebellion for base and other 4 that you unlock through the story and can switch to and from with just the press of a button. It's really intuitive and fun, specially since combos are \"saved\" when you switch weapons, so you can start a combo with a light weapon and finish it with a heavy one for optimized DPS. All of the weapons feel great to play with, too. They each have their use and work perfectly when used right, which is exactly what DMC is all about. Variety, fun, and style. And oh, does this game have a lot of that. As I said, the vibe of the game changed, it's a lot more apocalyptic and chaotic, the music is mostly metal (which I LOVE), the scenarios have this sort of corrupt vibe about them, like you're in a distorted world (which is actually true). \n\nThis was actually my first Devil May Cry and I loved every second of it. I then found out about the original series, bought all of the games and played them one after another until I reached 5. Funny thing about this game is that a lot of mechanics and concepts we see in DMC 5 (the best one in the series) came from this baby right here. In DMC 5, the levels are a lot more linear, there's almost no backtracking, a lot more fighting and less parkour bits [spoiler]fucking DMC 3 and that turning cubes level[/spoiler]. Well, DmC is the same, the levels are a lot more straight forward, and even though collectibles are definetly still a thing and exploring is encouraged, everything feels natural. Even Vergil gets a gift from his alternate self, being able to summon a doppleganger just like DmC's Vergil. All of those things made DMC 5 the game it is today, and it probably wouldn't have been the same without this one.\n\nPeople hate on the game because Dante isn't our wacky woohoo pizza man and Vergil looks more like a redditor than he looks half demon, but you have to understand. This game is not Devil May Cry. It may have the same name, but it's a completely different thing, with a different personality and goals. It won't grab that much of your attention with characters and sibling rivalry, but it has a ton of character to it. The faces may not be very memorable, but the combos, sounds and feelings will be. Now, I love DMC 5, it's still my favorite, I think it's the best in the series and it brings out the best in the hack-and-slash genre. But DmC still has a special place in my heart, and it has enough different mechanics for me to keep coming back to it even after playing DMC 5's campaign multiple times over.\n\nI had tons of fun playing this fucking thing and probably will have a lot more when I play it again, and I would honestly play it over some of the originals any day, so give it a try, because I think DmC is one of the best hack and slash games out there, flawed as it may be, it's absolutely SSSensational.", "timestamp_created": 1653888485, "timestamp_updated": 1692476370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116201605": {"recommendationid": "116201605", "author": {"steamid": "76561199278726288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 551, "last_played": 1656799396}, "language": "english", "review": "tak sesuai ekspektasi", "timestamp_created": 1653841992, "timestamp_updated": 1653841992, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436465948820114136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116191371": {"recommendationid": "116191371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030425231", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1958, "last_played": 1653855241}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun on Steam Deck.

game with all DLC, while it was discounted for around the price of the DLC at full price. \n\nThe game is liner and the development was really focused on console players as a target audience, not many people know  publishers ruin games by dictating to developers to cut games into pieces increasing cost of development and always ends with limited time left for release and content being cut because of bad management from a publisher.\n\nThe game is best played with a controller, expect to break your keyboard in half after it stops working with this game from mashing keys and have a few extra

The story is engaging and well written. The characters (besides Dante & Virgil) are actually likeable and have unique personalities. The game play is very addicting and the upgrade system is decent. There is a decent variety of enemies and I will definitely be doing another play through. So the game has a lot of replay value for me. \n\nMy two main gripes that I have with this game, is that the controls are good but the 3D camera perspective is just annoying. I had a lot of times where the camera would glitch into a wall or during crazy fights it just cant keep up with the hectic combat. Now I did get used to it, so its not a deal breaker but just gets annoying at times. Lastly, there are a few boss fights that it does not clearly show you what you have to do to beat them. I find this annoying, now yes, I can just play and figure it out but then it costs me more health than its worth. This is especially annoying for the final boss battle. \n\nAnyways, the game is great and totally worth the money!

But does the game really deserve it's own hate?\n\nPersonally speaking I enjoy every aspects of the game, minus the presentation. Do note that I've just only completed the vanilla game, which means I haven't play the [spoiler]Vergil Downfall[/spoiler] DLC. Here are the breakdowns for the game\n\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The gameplay is solid and fun, there's some platforming segments that (depending on the player) might add more variety to the game, or will become a nuisance during their playthrough\n[*]New gameplay formula which introduce both demon and angel weapon style with their own use\n[*]Multiple enemies with their own gimmick that you need to overcome\n[*]Challenge room for those who seek specialized challenge\n[*]Some level design is really good and totally different from the previous entries\n[*]Some things that I find bad from gameplay aspect are : \n[/list]\n[olist]\n[*]There are some elite mooks with special gimmick which will hinder your own pace\n[*]Lack of bosses to fight, [spoiler]with the total of only 6 bosses to fight[/spoiler], some are interesting and yet some are quite tedious\n[*]No lock on feature which will make the game's combat mildly frustrating since you can't target specific enemy\n[/olist]\nI can't stress enough how much I find the game's core combat gameplay are way more fun than 3 (yes, yes, boo me)\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nIt's your generic \"this world is controlled by a demon, we must fight for our freedom\" story. With it's own twist of course. But yes, compared to the other game's story. It's kinda weak, but still enjoyable overall. Since you know, this game used to be a new foundation for the new rebooted series.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\nIt's not like the music is bad per se for me. It's just I got too focused on the combat so I don't really pay attention to the game's soundtrack. So it's not bad but kinda forgettable? Also heavy metal music is a hit or miss for me.\n\n[b]Graphic[/b]\nFor a soon to be a decade old game, the game's overall graphic still holds on. The presentation of the game however is come down to your own preference, especially if you've played and enjoy the game's other entry.\n\n\nAll in all, DmC Devil May Cry is a solid entry for those who wants to get into Hack and Slash game genre. It's fun, it's stylish, and it's crying on the corner because fewer people likes it.\n\nIt's a bum that the definitive edition that fix some of the issues I mentioned above isn't on PC.", "timestamp_created": 1652101044, "timestamp_updated": 1652101090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554485201835632324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115203781": {"recommendationid": "115203781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187419314", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 454, "last_played": 1692394260}, "language": "english", "review": "galt scene", "timestamp_created": 1652100441, "timestamp_updated": 1652100441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491944760084152222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115200572": {"recommendationid": "115200572", "author": {"steamid": "76561199188442180", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1652222369}, "language": "spanish", "review": "tremendo juegazo.", "timestamp_created": 1652094387, "timestamp_updated": 1652094387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115190213": {"recommendationid": "115190213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205485905", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 751, "last_played": 1652059004}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]The Unbiased part...Demon Dancing...[h1]\n\nThis game succeeds on many fronts and falters in others, while it has many problems with the identity of the dante character it knows what it wants to portray, and does it with mid 2000's cringey badass sensibilities.\n\n>weapons and combos\nall reasonable and satisfying, being able to chain combos from one weapon into another provided great depth and variety which i loved, shame about the demon/angel evades needing too many buttons to properly activate for me (this meant i never really used them) but i played this on M+KB  so perhaps i was asking for it. \n\n>levels and maps\nbeautiful colour scheming in most levels with nice detail and lovely white text appearing from the antagonist narrator, which is a first for me in a game but gave it a nice sense of everyone vs you. maps had bonuses to discover and optional challenges to complete and while i did not find them all i did all that i could, note that some are too difficult in the current time and are designed to be done later when you are replaying the game with the entire arsenal at hand. the art of the levels is somewhere you will not be dissatisfied\n\n>characters and story \ndante and his gang are okay looking, kinda punkie, kinda street nice blend, kat did not inspire any strong feelings however. enemies are the \"mechanical\" silent hill sorta variety, imagine a steampunk gothic demon angel with a mask, a few skelly men and a few rats are thrown in aswell. \n\nthe bosses are all good, some even amazing (im looking at bob specifically here) very fresh takes on boss fights in my view, and none were TOO HARD?

Still, there's some cutscenes that revert back to Dante's default look which is kinda weird, but no big deal.\n\nIf you're into solid hack n slash games with no filler definitely check this one out.", "timestamp_created": 1651781970, "timestamp_updated": 1651781970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547445476055145264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114993854": {"recommendationid": "114993854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198934224372", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 2794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1700113075}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juegazo hermano ! muy recomendado y si lo compras en oferta es una ganga! viva '' Devil My Cry''", "timestamp_created": 1651767080, "timestamp_updated": 1651767080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114955016": {"recommendationid": "114955016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376117292", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 9098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1657811881}, "language": "english", "review": "story 4/10\ngameplay 8/10\ngraphic realy clean\n\ngood game  <3", "timestamp_created": 1651700075, "timestamp_updated": 1651700075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491944760084152222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114925954": {"recommendationid": "114925954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397539487", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1688454837}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buenosima historia y jugabilidad, es un buen DMC a su manera, ojala tuviera continuaci\u00f3n.", "timestamp_created": 1651653122, "timestamp_updated": 1651653122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114902696": {"recommendationid": "114902696", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971291372", "num_games_owned": 2349, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1264, "last_played": 1651605698}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive gameplay, witty dialog and fun bossfights.

This being the first time I played it, I found it had several good game play ideas, with the problem some get in the way of it's own intentions. \n\nFrom the top, the story is a bigger focus than before, for the negative. Not only you have to suffer many in-game slow walky parts that we all got sick off even before the eight gen, there's a couple of missions that are almost lacking in combat or have it focused right after several of these guided points. A real flow-killer.\nAnd the story itself is questionable at best, and I'm being generous. I absolutely dislike the inclusion of angels, as it robs the series own title of weight, on top of putting Donte on a level that makes him ironically less empathetic. \nDonte himself is as much of an ass as the memes would make you think, but the moments that start showing his character development are surprisingly well done, and come across as genuine, especially from the voice performance. Vorgil is the one who really gets trashed around, having too little of his own reinvented personality, with his euphoric presence and women's rights advocacy being the highlights of a disappointing character.\n\nGameplay wise it's an even more mixed bag. Several moves and weapon uses are streamlined, and it is possible to have both fun encounters with decent combo variety, the controls aren't as bad as originally thought and the animations do enough of a job to sell every impact. Weapon switching is easy to get used to as well, and several mechanics are experimented and added, to the point we would see some elements inspiring 5 down the line, such as the grapple.\nHowever, there's many nagging issues, from color coded enemies, no lock on (a can of worms), the lack of styles means some actions like rainstorm require pressing two buttons instead of just Circle/B, an overly generous style meter, an almost annoying focus on platforming in some admittedly pretty and creative environments and very simple boss fights with too many repetitive elements. At times you'll be frustrated with some encounters, or flat out almost tired of these floating paths.\n\nAs negative as that last part might seem, the gameplay is still decent enough that it carries the game and maybe a replay or two, and if you enjoy some cringe the plot is so obscenely over the top it can have it's genuine appeal. Given the fact that it goes cheap and there isn't much of a reason to be upset anymore, I can encourage giving it a sincere try. Maybe you'll like it enough, appreciate what's good, and laugh at the bad. \n\nAlso I highly recommend playing it in Spanish for the best experience.", "timestamp_created": 1649993727, "timestamp_updated": 1649993727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621749401092529297", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113850350": {"recommendationid": "113850350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227400828", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1043, "last_played": 1663616991}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanta, es como si todas las ideas ridiculas conspiranoicas fueran verdad, y salvar el mundo est\u00e1 en las manos de tres boludos en vez de naciones y grupos de gente grande organizado.

"language": "english", "review": "A game that's way better than how hardcore Devil May Cry fans whine about it, and is genuinely fun, but ultimately kind of disappointing.\n\nThe combat is fun. The basic flow of hold right/left trigger to use different weapons, then use the d-pad to switch between these weapons is surprisingly entertaining. The enemies that can only be attacked while using specific weapons are annoying, but it's only in the later difficulties that they pop up to the point where it kind of sucks and breaks up the flow of combat. The music is also a standout. While nothing I'd listen to in my own free time, it fits the mood of the game perfectly, and gets you appropriately hyped up for the many fights the game has to offer.\n\nBut really the disappointing thing is the story. You should never play a DMC game for the story, but the general setup of Dante and Vergil teaming up to fight an evil fox news host and an evil demonic banker who wants to control the world through poverty has a lot of promise. This is ultimately squandered because both Dante and Vergil are completely boring. Dante's only real character development is he falls for the graffiti artist love interest. Vergil basically never does anything but hack some computers and shoot a pregnant woman through the stomach with a high powered rifle. By the end of the game I was honestly felt more for the evil demonic banker whose wife and child were killed by our protagonists, than our actual protagonists.\n\nAnother disappointment is the setting. The game immediately sets out giving you this whole human world/demon world thing that feels like They Live, where all the billboards display capitalist propaganda, and the surroundings shift and warp into these twisted views of what's actually around Dante. This seems awesome. In reality, this is really only used in the first level, and throughout 70% of the game you're basically just going through sewers or nondescript \"hell\" areas that just look like big caves with rocks floating around. To be fair you do go through an evil office building, an evil dance club, and very briefly an evil fox news broadcast, but these are all underutilized and extremely short.\n\nGoing further, the whole feel of DMC is ruined. There's basically like 5 bosses in the whole game, where most DMC levels typically end with a big boss fight. The bosses themselves are usually pretty fun, but you can count them on one hand, and most are extremely gimmicky. Most DMC cutscenes also typically feature extremely stupid, but entertaining, choreography where our protagonists are surfing on missiles, flamenco dancing through demonic attacks, and generally doing extremely goofy but entertaining stunts. In this game, there's basically one example of this, where a nude Dante gets dressed in one motion while the shitty camper RV he lives in is being flipped around while random items keep getting in the way of seeing his dong. Aside from this, Dante basically just walks around and talks in the cutscenes.\n\nTaken as a complete reboot of Devil May Cry and considered completely apart from the other games in the series, it's really not that bad. The story is disappointing, the use of the initially clever setting sucks, but the combat is really fun. Based solely on this I still recommend the game. Who knows, maybe if Ninja Theory got to do another sequel they could've ironed out the issues over everything around the combat. It's just not really a good Devil May Cry game, though not just because they changed Dante and Vergil like people loved to whine about when the game first released.\n\nOh, also the platforming absolutely sucks, and the fact that they cram it into every level, even basing special \"challenge arenas\" around it, is terrible.", "timestamp_created": 1649723703, "timestamp_updated": 1649723703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480771064758300781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113671503": {"recommendationid": "113671503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404166236", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 919, "last_played": 1650822610}, "language": "english", "review": "By itself, it's pretty good.

ser sincero con mi cr\u00edtica hacia este juego, y lo voy a hacer como alguien fan\u00e1tico del genero \"Hack 'n' slash\" no como fan de la saga DMC , aclarado esto:\n\nLlevo 16 misiones a la fecha que escribo \u00e9sta critica (teniendo 20 el juego) y siento que ya estoy capacitado para hacer una recomendaci\u00f3n de esto.\n\n Empecemos por lo b\u00e1sico, siendo un Hack and slash el juego cumple a la perfecci\u00f3n con su jugabilidad, siendo sincero es lo mejor que tiene, su fuerte se basa en el gameplay y no en la narrativa (ya voy a eso). El juego nos permite combear de muchis\u00edmas maneras con muchisimas armas y esto lo hace entretenido hasta incluso divertido.\n Yo juego en pc con teclado y mouse y no se siente para nada tosco o mal \"porteado\" por as\u00ed decirlo, se siente fresco y muy din\u00e1mico hasta incluso.\n\n En el apartado narrativo el juego es muuy malo en mi opini\u00f3n, con una historia muy g\u00e9nerica (d e m a s i a d a ) y muy b\u00e1sica, literalmente no profundizan en ning\u00fan desarrollo de ning\u00fan personaje y la trama gira entorno a Dante, todo el mundo odia a dante, los demonios , la gente bajo la influencia de los demonios, en fin, todo se basa en Dante para hacerlo ver como el prota mas canchero y atrevido que se pasa todo por los huevos.\n En conclusi\u00f3n su historia es mala, no se salva con nada, pero al juego lo rescata el gameplay as\u00edque puede que exista un... \"equilibrio\"? a mi parecer si, como  alguien que busca este tipo de juegos lo recomiendo totalmente, si ven\u00eds a buscar una narrativa super profunda o como m\u00ednimo decente, no es tu juego.

This is why I refer to this game as things like \"The Cursed Ninja Version\" and it's a game that falls into the category of \"Not necessarily a bad game, but a bad Devil May Cry game\". Devil May Cry: The Cursed Ninja Edition is perfectly enjoyable in its own league and is by no means a flawless game.\n\nThe combat is very fluid and smooth in the cursed ninja version, each enemy had their own unique and interesting weaknesses until you get introduced to the \"Elemental\" enemy types which can only be killed by using either angelic or demonic weapons you'll acquire through your journey... these enemies would have been better implemented if their elemental affiliation wasn't so strict. On top of that, enemy variety is a bit lacking and a lot of them look pretty samey.\n\nThe platforming? My gosh I honestly love the platforming in Devil May Cry games (except devil may cry 1), and the cursed ninja version actually does platforming sections pretty well outside of the timed sequences. They're neither too complicated nor too easy, and just kindof in this really nice middle ground. It's a fun time killer between combat arenas.\n\nNow the story and the writing is where the cursed ninja version takes a lot of oofs. There's a lot more needless floof and more scenes that feel like someone just wanted to throw in some extra cussing just for the sake of having extra cussing. Nobody needed a cutscene where half the words were the f-bomb, nobody needed a cutscene that basically showcased the bad guy banging his mistress. If the original series didn't need that stuff in order to be good, then you didn't either.\n\nLast thing I gotta note here is basically all the levels take place in limbo. Now limbo's design is frankly pretty cool, but nearly every level takes place [i]in[/i] limbo like it's \"Okay cool I was in limbo and I fought my way out\" then next level is like \"I'm being dragged into limbo... again...\" and it's like that for almost every level which to me feels like a cop-out way of throwing the player into the fight every time.\n\nSo can I recommend it? I mean if the aforementioned negatives don't bother you and you get the complete pack for $10 during a sale then... maybe? It's a tough one. I can't really go either way here. It's fun but it's also the stereotypical crappy reboot/remake of its franchise... I'd easily recommend the 5 mainline games over this in a heartbeat.", "timestamp_created": 1647921307, "timestamp_updated": 1647921528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112621515": {"recommendationid": "112621515", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229993436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1649309334}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my all time favorite games.

If you've ever played a Ninja Theory game you would know their controls are always tight and everything plays perfectly. \n\nThe story is mediocre. But this is a DMC game and the story is pretty bad in most of them. The biggest complaint I see people give this game is that the \"Changed Dante\".  But this isn't one of the main DMC titles and it isn't supposed to be the same Dante. Capcom had Ninja Theory re-imagine the Devil May Cry story. They took aspects from several of the core DMC games and told their own story using the characters and some of the basic plot points. It takes itself a little more seriously than other games in the DMC franchise and is a darker take on some of the themes. I did enjoy the story telling but that isn't why you play a DMC game. These games are all about over the top action and this has it in spades. \n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic and most of the soundtrack was made by Combichrist. So it has that industrial metal sound that permeates the rest of the series, just also sounding more in line with the more serious tone of this game. \n\nIf you're one of the people who refused to play it at launch because \"they made Dante emo\" you missed out on a gem.

Really only worth it if you don't have any of the mainline games to play, and for some reason this one is $5.

The overall color palette is as dry as it's writing, the characters as uninteresting and frustrating as it's enemy design. It's still got a core gameplay loop that's fun for a bit, until you have to keep fighting the same awful enemies over and over.\n\nIf you love the mainline series, this game will piss you off. Skip the cutscenes.\nActually, if you play this game at all, skip the cutscenes.\nThe story is a boring pile of garbage, of desperately trying to differentiate itself from the OG, but it seems to be that one clingy friend who cries every time you don't talk to them for 5 minutes. It tries so hard to be it's own thing, constantly saying \"Fuck the mainline series\", and then pulling a majority of it's ideas from the main series. The story ends up doing a stinger off a ledge into the pitfall of the PS3's generation of \"EDGE OVER EVERYTHING\" as an attempt to have some sort of draw to it. It really just doesn't work. It's poorly written, generic edge. A constant theme through the writing of this game.\n\nSTARRING:\nDante: The unenjoyable, lame, embarrassing protagonist to play. Hates white hair! Got drip tho.\nVergil: The unenjoyable, lame, embarrassing \"IOU\" for where a second main character should be. Got drip tho.\nEdgy Female PS3 Character: Edgy Female PS3 Character.\n\nThe writing in this game is like a 12 year old picked up their first M rated game and thought saying \"FUCK\" was the coolest thing since that one time Shadow the Hedgehog said \"DAMN\" (in his famous PS2 title, \"Shadowman Hedge Trimmer\"). Here's a slice of the absolute peak of writing that you will get in this title:\n\n\"The world is at last your bitch. As am I.\"\nAnd\n\"Fuck you!\"\n\"Fuck you!\"\n\"FUCK YOU!\"\n\nFunny to laugh at, but these (mostly unintentional) funny moments in the writing are as rare as someone actually using a Yellow Orb in this game.\n\nGameplay:\nDmC DeViL mAkE CoOkIe has the typical trappings of the franchise. Weapon switching, air combos, spamming stinger because there's no sprint button, it's all there. Although it feels a bit less polished than mainline, it's still a passable game in terms of your own actions. They've decided to actually put some effort into something, and with that comes genuinely fun ways to string combos with multiple weapons together. Included are Nero's hooking mechanics from 4/5, which is always fun. But this is all bundled in with a shitty upgrade tree that mostly extends moves' DMG, or for longer moves, how long they last. Quite lame.\n\nThe player control / combat mechanics may have some good ideas, but the enemies do not. For some reason, Ninja Theory decided it would be a good idea to make it so that there's enemies that you can only hit with specific weapon types, and if you hit them with any other weapon, (even if unintentional because there's no lock-on mechanic in this game,) you dink. It's massively frustrating. It's a cool idea in concept, the color coded enemy-to-weapon thing, but in gameplay it just becomes an annoyance to dink constantly because you didn't see the blue colored guy through the red filter on the screen that makes every enemy look red regardless if they're color coded or not.\nThey could have fixed this by possibly just making it so that you could only stagger enemies of that color with weapons of the same color, or reduced damage with weapons of other colors.\n\nThe enemies themselves also massively suck. Out of every DMC game, this has to have the highest count of infuriating enemies to fight. Teleporting eneimes, shielding eneimes, unstaggerable eneimes, specific-weakpoint-or-dink enemies, weapon-specific enemies, sometimes multiple combinations in one enemy! What a thrill. The game tries so hard to make you NOT enjoy the actual effort they put into Dante's main moveset here. I genuinely got to a point where, regardless of actually enjoying the combos, I just did not want to complete this game. It's like having your favorite pair of underwear on, but you shit in them 30 minutes ago. I'm happy I'm in them, just in the circumstances of currently wearing them, I'd rather be at home playing DMC 3/5.\n\nThe boss fights are pretty lame, as well. I wouldn't say they're poorly designed. That insinuates they were designed at all. Every one of them is about opening up a weak point, hitting the weak point, the weak point gets hidden, repeat. Generic Video Game boss. The exception to this rule is \"Bob\". Gotta love Bob. His fight itself is no different, however there is a cute little section that pays a slight homage to the OG trilogy, which was neat. Then I got back into the main fight and wanted to castrate myself.\n\nGraphics:\nHonestly, this game looks pretty good. I like the Limbo morphing around the world, there's lots of stuff done in real-time in this game with how the world transforms in the Limbo dimension. The mo-cap is generally impressive for the time, although you will quickly neglect this and laugh at how awful the line delivery and writing is during cutscenes. This game might make me wanna castrate myself, but at least it doesn't make me wanna gouge my eyes out too.\n\nMusic:\nYeah, there's definitely music in this game. Aside from one song, it's just aight. Nothing I'll listen to outside of the game.\n\nAnyway, my Adderall is wearing off.\nGOOD POINTS:\nDante's moveset, visuals.\nNEGATIVE POINTS:\nLiterally everything else.\n\nPeople seem to think this game has gotten too much hate, but I don't even think with time this game is that great. If any of the mainline games didn't exist, if Bayonetta didn't exist, these points would not change. Every area of this game contradicts or fights against itself. DmC is just a game that hates itself. Guess it's pretty relevant for the PS3 edge it's bursting with.\n\nSarcasm aside\nI gave this game a fair shot, but I really don't think it's worth much. I had moments of fun, enjoyed (and was honestly intrigued) by the visuals at points, and the combat is interesting to fuck around with, but I really don't think it's worth it at all. Especially with 4 other solid games in the franchise easily available on steam. Maybe if Ninja Theory got a second shot they could do better? Not gonna happen.\n\nEdit: Finished Vergil DLC. Same issues apply, but in less quantity overall.

played the other games and you haven't played this game, do not waste your time. The combat is just fine and even feels good at times, though I have personal qualms I don't think it inherently makes it worse then main DMC, but there are so many annoying gimmick enemies that it straight ruins the flow of battle cause now you have to sit there and focus this enemy or dodge around it cause he can only be damaged by certain attacks. it gets old fast. The traversal is more unique then main series DMC but it gets really tedious after the first few levels. The boss fights aren't DMC boss fights but your typical wait for an opening then attack, repeat. While some of the bosses are cinematically cool most of them are just a whatever besides Vergil. Vergil is suppose to be reminiscent of DMC 3 vergil it kinda feels like an insult. actually this whole game feels like an insult. The story is uninspired uninteresting thought thats a lot of games these days the real frustrating part is seeing how they straight destroyed my boys Dante and Vergil. In the REAL DMC games Dante is laid back and funny but cares for others. Dante in this game is not funny, just vulgar and rude, also his hair cut sucks so... Vergil in the main games is cold and calculating, the only thing he cares about is power and will do anything to achieve it. Vergil in this game is a whiny pathetic manipulative child. Honestly he reminds me of my little brother when he was 7.\nIf I was to find something nice to say about this game it would be the art direction, i do find that pretty cool\nOverall a rather unpleasant experience outside of Bob Barabass fight (just doing gods work)\ngame is a PLAY DMC5/10 don't reccomend", "timestamp_created": 1645605670, "timestamp_updated": 1645605771, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110705043": {"recommendationid": "110705043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350821031", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 978, "last_played": 1645460705}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story, great graphic, great combos!", "timestamp_created": 1645461497, "timestamp_updated": 1645461497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110698900": {"recommendationid": "110698900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198809144317", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1127, "last_played": 1678046383}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a lot of controversy about this game mostly about the story and the new design of Dante, although the game is good Ninja Theory is a good development team and doesn't deserve the hate for DmC.

If you are an action game fan, this game should do the trick for you.  \nI didn't encounter any glitches in my playtrough only problem could be that there is no lock on you are pretty much playing an outdated game because DmC Definitive Edition is pretty much the perfect version of this game sadly its only available on PS4 and we might never get the Definitive Edition on Steam.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nAlthough it almost completely distorts the narrative background of the original, it does not lose the stylistic vein that distinguishes it. A superb and flexible Combat System, with numerous unmanageable moves and combos accompanied by a biting and always intense soundtrack, which keeps the adrenaline of the frenetic fights high. A Dante who is still immature but who already shows heedlessness of danger and a typical impertinence of the character. Too bad that there is a fluctuating graphic sector to stain the work, which nevertheless maintains the quality of the general picture, without ruining the experience. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1645455258, "timestamp_updated": 1645455258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599624872207641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110678690": {"recommendationid": "110678690", "author": {"steamid": "76561199021389694", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1638629018}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (10/10)", "timestamp_created": 1645421312, "timestamp_updated": 1645421312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110675327": {"recommendationid": "110675327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068448160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1644986773}, "language": "english", "review": "easy control, super fun play style, engaging storyline!", "timestamp_created": 1645415417, "timestamp_updated": 1645415417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110645976": {"recommendationid": "110645976", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111515785", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 616, "last_played": 1646191330}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si", "timestamp_created": 1645378753, "timestamp_updated": 1645378753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110611723": {"recommendationid": "110611723", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085635284", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 900, "last_played": 1700692632}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La oveja negra de la saga Devil May Cry.\nA pesar de que en su momento de salida fue mal recibido por los fans al punto de llamarlo basura solo por no seguir la historia de Dante y Nero, DmC Devil May Cry es sin duda uno de los mejores juegos.\nSu historia, no es su fuerte pero entrega algo que es muy entretenido de ver.\nSigue la historia de un Dante punk vagabundo marginado por la sociedad y su pasado, conociendo a Kat la cual lo lleva a encontrar con su gemelo Vergil y conociendo su pasado, un pasado tragico ademas de saber su origen.\nEl gameplay, es la joya de la corona en DmC: Devil May Cry, un gameplay muy frenetico y entretenido, un hack n'slash bien hecho, ademas de que entrega secciones de plataformeo entre pelea y pelea para que la lucha no se haga monotona.\nLa variedad de armas es buena, teniendo la opcion de armas ligeras (modo angel) y armas pesadas (modo demonio)\nEste juego tuvo mala fama y todo, pero no es malo, cualquier persona que le gusten los juegos de accion rapida deberia probarlo, es buenisimo.\n9/10 - no tiene una version de Devils Never Cry.", "timestamp_created": 1645338636, "timestamp_updated": 1645338636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617888569831848145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110595653": {"recommendationid": "110595653", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993636533", "num_games_owned": 2433, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 568, "last_played": 1645314530}, "language": "english", "review": "Is DMC: Devil May Cry a good Devil May Cry title?

Fans when they complain about Dmc: Devil May Cry they mention how downrigth awfull the story in this one is wich i find funny because the DMC games never had good stories, 3 being the exeption i'm not defending the story on this one there is def some unintentionally funny/cringe dialogue and overall i'm mixed towards it but if you think it's any worse than DMC1's almost non existant story, DMC2's clusterfuck story, DMC4's downrigth awfull story and charaters or DMCV's bad fan faction then i really don't know what to say i just think its hilarious people mention the reboot's story but not the Main games because imo the story is OK not awfull like allot of the DMC games.\n\n\n\u25cf I will admit the charaters are not super good in this one compared to the main line series, Dante is alrigth and does get an ok Charater Arc where he becomes more human and finds something to protect and believe in ( Humanity and Kat ), Same for Kat but everyone else is meh i guess wich kinda sucks.\n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nAnother thing people mention is the simplified gameplay wich again, its funny seeing how Nero exists and is a replacement for Dante but yet again these \"flaws\" only aplly to Dmc Reboot apparently, personally i think the gameplay is tigh, responsive and overall pretty solid there are tons of weapons and tools and allot of the moves from previous games return here with their own spin, so yet again i don't really get the outrage with this one, it's not as if it's horrendous it's actually quite good, not as good as the main series but still good nonetheless.\n\n\n[h1] Level Design [/h1]\nThe Level design is also pretty to look at and has some really cool setpieces and enviroments, i heard people say its linear but honestly i think the level design is much better than 4 and V, 4 is well... a downrigth horrible imcomplete game full of backtracking and V is pretty good i guess but the levels are super linear with nothing interesting going on and they have the same red hellish look later on, so even tho this is linear as well with some platforming and some cool gimmicks later on, at the very least its miles more interesting visually than DMCV and specially 4, i do miss DMC1 and 3\u00b4s level design and enviroments but the series has been moving away from that : (\n\n[h1] Music and OST [/h1]\nMusic is also alrigth better than 4 and V, it doesent match the masterpieces of 1 and 3 but i still enjoyed the music here, at least we dont have the same Tracks for every single level, dont get me wrong i like the music in V but it just gets repetitive after a while.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI could talk about other things but i think ill stop ranting here, all in all this is a very solid game, its problably my third fav dmc game with 3 being first and 2 being V so i think the unjustified hatred from this game is dumb, because its a really solid game not to mention the fact that people seem to forget the only good dmc games are 1,3 and V and even then they have some pretty heavy flaws in allot of areas with 3 being the only great/amazing dmc game, all in all i recomend this game not only because its pretty decent but because its one of the only truly good Dmc games out there.", "timestamp_created": 1645112884, "timestamp_updated": 1645811860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1,

leaderboard.\n\nIf you can get past the misogyny and Bollywood level of ridiculousness that peaks in the first level, then this game is a fun journey.\u00a0 I'm glad I kept going to finish my steam cards, because I wound up finishing the game on the normal (Devil Hunter) difficulty.\u00a0 The story is cheesy, but good enough to hold your interest between missions, which are varied enough to not feel like linearity is a bad thing.\u00a0 And ignore the style scores on your first (only?) playthrough.\n\nIt's a brawler game with combos that seem to focus more on using specific buttons than perfect timing (in contrast to a true hack 'n slash clicker like Diablo).\u00a0 There are some needs for perfect timing for the advanced combos, yet I just didn't use those much and hacked away at the enemies.\u00a0 There's some modest platforming between fights but nothing too awful (stay in angel mode for that second glide).\n\nUpgrades can be reversed, so feel free to experiment.\u00a0 I mostly upgraded the primary abilities and initial devil/angel weapons (even the guns are weak).\u00a0 I realized way too late in the game that you can just use 1, 2, and 3 to toggle between the human/devil/angel modes, rather than holding E or Q.\u00a0 Since some enemies can only be damaged in a specific mode, it's good remembering that orange = devil and blue = angel.\n\nIf you get stuck, you can always go back and replay earlier levels to finish acquiring upgrade resources and items (before trying to push again, with the newer upgrades/items).\u00a0 The game gives you new weapons and abilities through the story, so some early levels are built so that you can only unlock some things by replaying them later.\u00a0 Upgrades persist between sessions, as does the act of having picked up the same upgrade (can't grab the same thing twice).\u00a0 I'm the last guy to play a player-vs-player fighting game because my reflexes suck, and I still made it through the entire game on normal (Demon Hunter) difficulty without needing to double back.\n\nWhen you restart a mission, or checkpoint, you restart with full health.\u00a0 And there's a checkpoint between every arena, which is quite often.\u00a0 So it's actually best to not use Gold orbs or health at all.\u00a0 When the game asks if you want to revive, just choose no and then on the next screen choose \"Continue\".\u00a0 You'll restart the current arena/fight, but come back with full health.\u00a0 Save the gold orbs for a really tough boss fight instead, and money for health bar increases!\u00a0 If you ever 'git gud' then you can replay without dying in the first place.\n\nEvery enemy has one or more weaknesses, some that they tell you about a few missions after they are introduced.\u00a0 Tyrants (the big fat guys), for example, can be dodged when they charge (shift and a direction), then you simply use a grapple (E, in demon mode) from behind them to pull them onto their back like a stuck turtle.\u00a0 That usually gives you enough time to land one or two arbiter slams (E+F) on them and repeat.\u00a0 I wish there were more reliable guides on how to take down each enemy type.\n\nGoing into this I knew I wouldn't commit the time to earn all of the achievements, but ended my run with a 'good enough' 34% (mostly story achievements but definitely a few from just using weapons, before starting Vergil's Downfall).\u00a0 At 9.5 hours for the average player, wait for one of the $7.50 sales.\n\nEdit: Vregil's Downfall was underwhelming, but brought my achievements up to 39% to complete once on easy (Human) without any extra effort.", "timestamp_created": 1645103825, "timestamp_updated": 1645274145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

I've completed DMC 4 SE in Human once and haven't played it again (I plan to, but I'm finishing DmC first)\n\nI've heard about the controversy before and while I agree they changed Dante too much, I feel the current Dante has consistent personality, but that's just my opinion. I enjoy the casual references to the previous games, and while I consider the original Dante is more flavorful with his quotes, I also enjoy the brash and blunt rebooted Dante.\n\nGAMEPLAY ---\nI enjoy the controls VERY MUCH. The designer has definitely put much thought for the control design. I played with a controller and I find it now easy to move around and do Dante stuffs with the button combinations - attacking and platforming. At first, I struggle a bit, but after finishing the game on human, I can now easily switch modes and weapons and do chain of combos - I haven't mastered them yet, though.\n\nPlatforming is my bane on DMC 4, but I really, really enjoy platforming in DmC. The level is cleverly designed. Some hidden areas can only be accessed if you've completed the game before, so if you are a completionist, like me, you'll enjoy replaying earlier level for that sweet 100% completion.\n\nWeapons are diverse and have their own niche. You'll want to learn what each does best in a situation. You can mash buttons to complete a combat (like me), but soon you'll crave more style points and start chaining different weapon combos.\nI enjoy the grapple mechanic, you can even fight in the air forever - bless the devs for that. It's an upgrade from Nero's buster since you can choose to grapple the enemies to you, or you to them. It's more fun to enter the fray and wreak havoc, though.\n\nSTORY ---\nDisclaimer: I have known the ending, so it's not too surprising for me.\nThe story propels you in action, while keeping you guessing about Dante's past. It's a good thing Dante regained most of his power in earlier mission, so the rest of the mission can be focused in action - dealing damage to Mundus. Every bit of the mission revealed a little more about the past and current situation, love it.\n\nWhile for some the motivations of each character, Dante included, seems shallow, for me it's just the right size of chunk. All characters have good voice acting, although in some parts I wish it's more than just swearing (the Succubus is the worst dialogue)\n\nWhile the lore is heaven and earth different than the original franchise, I enjoy the interpretation of the demon world Limbo and all the demons. The ending also gives a hook for the next sequel.\n\nMUSIC ---\nThe music on each level is nail on. Each gives their own atmosphere and paints the correct mood to your head. Unlike the DMC 5 where there's only one track keeping it from 100%: Subhuman - too metal for my liking, I can enjoy 100% of the music in DmC.\n\nOVERALL:\nI'd like to play the sequel and I can't wait. The story is different and I'd like it to be kept as such. Both DMC and DmC is enjoyable, but as of current, I'd keep playing DmC with their excellent control system. I recommend this game to all of you who wants to get into the cool action style game, but afraid it will be too hard.

las de por ejemplo del Devil may cry 4 por ejemplo de pelea con mundus o bob barbas con excelente banda sonora no quiero decir que sean las mejores de la saga pero que no estan para nada mal uno de los puntos negativos que le veo es 1 su duracion en mi opinion es algo corta la verdad y que sus graficos incluso en su tiempo no eran la gran cosa siendo de unreal engine 3 seria injusto compararlo con otros juegos pero habia juegos del 2007 que se veian mejor que dmc conclusion es un buen dmc y juego en general muy divertido y con historia que trata de tomarse enserio pero con comedia y tambien

Y pese a serlo, el estilo y formato presentado por la saga permanece casi igual. Como ya mencion\u00e9 las caracter\u00edsticas de la saga en mi anterior rese\u00f1a sobre Devil May Cry HD Collection, no voy a repetirlas y me centrar\u00e9 en describir este juego en los diferentes aspectos y lo que presenta como factor novedoso; sin embargo, s\u00ed mencionar\u00e9 que sigue siendo un juego con su factor de estilo: a m\u00e1s ataques encadenes, m\u00e1s ataques diferentes uses, etc etc, conseguir\u00e1s un rango mayor (y el locutor que anuncia el rango es simplemente espectacular).\n\n[u]-Primero y principal, es un reboot:[/u] no toma en cuenta la historia ni los sucesos de los anteriores juegos, y nos ofrece una historia que empieza y termina por s\u00ed misma. Esta vez controlamos a un Dante adolescente, con sus toques rebeldes y un dise\u00f1o cambiado. Por ejemplo, este Dante suelta palabras malsonantes como si esto fuera el doblaje de Bleach en castellano, al igual que algunos enemigos. \n\n[u]-En este juego contamos con cuatro tipos de arma diferentes:[/u] por un lado tenemos la espada que siempre acompa\u00f1a a Dante, Rebellion. Continuamos con las armas de fuego, siendo las principales las queridas Ebony e Ivory. Como tercer tipo de arma se nos presentan las armas demon\u00edacas: armas con ataques lentos pero bastante poderosos, y finalmente las armas angelicales, armas que abarcan una mayor distancia en el campo de batalla y m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidas que sus armas contrarias. Y tendremos unas herramientas extra: un gancho demon\u00edaco y un gancho angelical. El gancho demon\u00edaco te permitir\u00e1 sacar elementos del terreno para allanarte el camino o para agarrar enemigos y atraerlos, as\u00ed como quitarle los escudos a ciertos enemigos; por otro lado, el gancho angelical te permitir\u00e1 llegar a sitios alejados y acercarte a los enemigos. Y todo este factor \u00e1ngel/demon\u00edaco se usar\u00e1 pulsando el bot\u00f3n L2 para activar el lado angelical, o R2 para el demon\u00edaco.\n\n[u]-Comentando alguna diferencia[/u] de este juego con sus tres entregas (sin contar DMC 4 y 5 debido a que no los he jugado en el momento de escribir esta rese\u00f1a), debo destacar la tienda, ya que vas ganando puntos de mejora a medida que peleas y completas misiones. Estos puntos se utilizan para desbloquear nuevos ataques para las armas y mejoras de los mismos. Y lo curioso es que el juego nos permite volver sobre nuestros pasos y quitar el punto que acabamos de gastar, permiti\u00e9ndonos ir probando diferentes ataques si alguno no nos convence o si queremos mejorar alg\u00fan otro. Adem\u00e1s, las misiones secretas ahora forman parte del escenario en forma de puertas especiales que deber\u00e1s abrir consiguiendo antes unas llaves que ir\u00e1n repartidas por los escenarios. E incluso tendremos la posibilidad de encontrarnos almas incrustadas en ciertas partes que podremos liberar como otro tipo de coleccionable.\n\n[u]-Me gustar\u00eda hacer especial menci\u00f3n al arte del juego:[/u] Sin entrar en mucho detalle, el cuidado que se ha tenido por este juego ha sido espectacular, y su arte es impresionante. Juegan con todo, te ponen mensajes de corta duraci\u00f3n, los combates contra los jefes est\u00e1n llenos de detalles y est\u00e1n muy cuidados en cuanto a dise\u00f1o y arte. Es un factor del que puedo hablar poco ya que prefiero que lo ve\u00e1is por vosotros mismos y juzgu\u00e9is. Asimismo quiero dedicar una o dos l\u00edneas a la m\u00fasica del juego, la cual es espectacular y te inyecta la adrenalina en vena. Siento que encaja con los combates y es un a\u00f1adido maravilloso.\n\n[b] -En definitiva: [/b] DmC Reboot es un juego realmente bueno. Ten\u00e9is much\u00edsimos modos de dificultad que desbloquear por si quer\u00e9is desafiaros al l\u00edmite de vuestras capacidades, pod\u00e9is hacer combos de muchas formas distintas cambiando de armas en cualquier momento del combate; el Devil Trigger de Dante aqu\u00ed es un modo \"te dejo a los bichos atontados en el aire, venga, a hacer combos\" bastante gracioso, muchos enemigos a los que apalizar, etc. \n\nMe parece un hack'n'slash brutal, que me da una satisfacci\u00f3n parecida a la de Devil May Cry 3, te sientes el amo y nada puede pararte.

En primer lugar, seg\u00fan la altura de un minion (que es de 3.5 pies en promedio) gru tiene 4 minions de alto, lo que significa que tiene un tama\u00f1o divino de 14 pies de alto (4.27 metros). En segundo lugar, si alguno de ustedes recuerda en la primera de mi villano favorito, sabr\u00edan que hay una escena en la que vector secuestra a las 3 chicas y dispara una seri\u00e9 de misiles en busca de calor a gru y los esquiva todos. Seg\u00fan la velocidad de un misil bal\u00edstico promedio (3060 km /h) y el tama\u00f1o del misil seg\u00fan el tama\u00f1o de su tobillo, gru puede percibir y moverse a una velocidad tal que los misiles parecen moverse solo a 15 km /h. Por \u00faltimo, cuando gru golpea mas tarde a un tibur\u00f3n, lo paraliza. Esto significa que probablemente le rompi\u00f3 la columna vertebral. Se requer\u00eda una fuerza de 3000 newtons para fracturar la columna, que es igual al impacto creado por un autom\u00f3vil de 230 kg que se estrella contra una pared a 50 km /h. Gru puede levantar la luna, que tiene una masa de 7.34767309 x 1022 kilogramos (1.61988463 x 1023 libras). Cuando esta en la tierra, lo sostiene con una mano y evita cualquier tipo de interferencia gravitacional. A partir de esto, esta claro que gru puede manipular las part\u00edculas fundamentales del universo, gravitones en este caso. Sin mencionar que construy\u00f3 un mini-cohete completamente funcional con chatarra cuando era ni\u00f1o (ni siquiera un adolescente). Para alcanzar la velocidad de escape de la tierra, su cohete debe haber sido capaz de viajar a mas de 11.2 km /s (25,000 mph), lo que significa que comprimi\u00f3 la tecnolog\u00eda de la NASA en el tama\u00f1o de una silla.El coeficiente intelectual promedio de un cient\u00edfico de cohetes es de aproximadamente 130 o m\u00e1s, y para que Gru construya un cohete del tama\u00f1o de una silla a, digamos, 10 a\u00f1os, debe tener un coeficiente intelectual muy superior a 130.No es irracional decir que podr\u00eda estar en el rango de mas de 200.", "timestamp_created": 1640747573, "timestamp_updated": 1660161492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106784335": {"recommendationid": "106784335", "author": {"steamid": "76561199194386479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1680976937}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buenaaaaaaaaaardoooooooo nasheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", "timestamp_created": 1640736605, "timestamp_updated": 1640736605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 9918, "total_negative": 881, "total_reviews": 10799}, "cursors": {"AoJ4tLjhgf4Cf+SslwM=": "Thu Nov 23 23:29:36 2023", "AoJwycL2i4sDefq1tAQ=": "Thu Nov 23 23:55:45 2023"}}
