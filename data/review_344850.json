Designing and optimizing your factory is a fun experience, and the game does a good job of introducing new mechanics at a steady pace.\n\nHowever, the tycoon side of the game feels a bit basic compared to other games in the genre. While it's certainly serviceable, it lacks the depth and complexity that other tycoon games offer.\n\nOverall, Big Pharma is a fun but short-lived experience.

It scratches that Tycoon-series-type itch.  Any game where you build stuff and try to make money has a chance when it comes to that, but this game adds a lot of depth and challenge into what you have to do to succeed.  You really have only one job, and that's building assembly lines for pharmaceutical products.  But that job can be pretty tricky.  In order to produce a product you have to adjust the concentration levels of base ingredients in order to activate positive effects.  At the same time you have to try to mitigate or remove negative side effects.  Doing so requires a tailor made process line for each and every drug you make, and working out a good process to produce the best product without spending too much money is the puzzle at the heart of this game.  As you unlock more advanced options and begin to create more powerful drugs, it becomes necessary to add other base ingredients which have to be adjusted prior to mixing... it can be a real headache, usually in a good way.  Add to that the need to discover more ingredients, research new technologies, and compete with rival companies... it can get complicated; again, in a good way.\n\nHowever the one negative I have is that the financial aspect of the game is confusing.  Time is measured in days, and each time you see a conveyor move a product down the line, a day has passed.  On the company tab where you track your finances, each drug is shown with the amount of profit each drug produces.  At the same time, your overall profit per day is tracked on a corner counter.  This counter will never match the total of your drugs' profit amounts, for reasons that are not shown.  At times, even though your financial counter shows that you have are making profit and have an overall positive profit margin, your daily counter will drop into the red while you are building a new line that is partially running.  It seems clear that the reason is the overhead costs for running the machinery exceed the current profit for a time, but this is never explicitly shown or made available to you.  I don't have a real affinity for finances, but it's usually simple math, as long as all the numbers are there for you to see. Not having the full financial picture means it is very easy to get into financial ruin early on.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that when working through scenarios, a significant time investment is needed for each one.  (You can save at any point, of course.)\n\nOverall though, this is a pretty good game.

Who doesn\u2019t like drugs?  But what\u2019s better than drugs?  Selling drugs!  To kids!  (No, not really. Don\u2019t sell drugs to anyone, least of all kids.  Unless you work in an actual pharmacy, in which case, please accept my most heartfelt condolences.)\n\n\u2018Big Pharma\u2019 lets you step into the expensive, patent leather shoes of the Martin Shkrelis of the world, where you generate obscene profits by price gouging sick people for the medicine they need so they don\u2019t die.  It could just as easily have been called \u2018Garbage Human Simulator\u2019, to be honest.  If you\u2019re hell-bent on becoming a remorseless pirate but you hate the sea, and aren\u2019t terribly enthused about wrangling a crew of murderous cut-throats who will likely butcher you in your sleep as soon as the grog runs dry, then there\u2019s probably a role for you in the pharmaceutical industry.  (You could, if you\u2019re that way inclined, use your powers for good and actually work on developing drugs that make the world a less awful place in which to live\u2026 *pause for raucous laughter* \u2026yeah, I didn\u2019t think so.  If OxyContin has taught us anything, it\u2019s that it\u2019s all about the money. Ka-ching!)\n\nSo, without further ado, let\u2019s exploit the suffering of others for fun and profit!\n\nGameplay\n\nFirst off, play the tutorials.  All of them.  This game gets fairly complicated fairly quickly, and having a vague idea of what you\u2019re supposed to be doing at any given time is advantageous.  Secondly, while you\u2019re playing through the tutorials, pay attention.  Read stuff.  Comprehend that stuff.  Put that stuff into practice, and make sure it works as intended before you move on.  Borderline criminal pharmaceutical empires are rarely built by people who \u201ckinda\u201d know what they\u2019re doing.  Moving on\u2026\n\nYou start the game with a production facility. It\u2019s quite small, and you\u2019re going to need room to expand in short order, but Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.  In the walls of this facility are input/output ports.  As you might expect, raw ingredients enter the facility via one of these ports, and a finished drug leaves.  All the interesting stuff happens in between.  At its most basic level, Big Pharma has you building conveyor belts which transport raw ingredients along a production chain littered with various machines.  These machines take an ingredient and do something to it, then deposit it back onto the conveyor belt where it travels to the next machine, and so on.  Each raw ingredient has various characteristics which dictate what sort of cure you\u2019re able to derive from it.  Some ingredients can produce multiple cures, some can be chemically upgraded to provide a different cure, or a better, more profitable version of an existing cure \u2014 all of which is done by funnelling ingredients into different machines at different concentrations.\n\nAs GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, and friends can no doubt testify, you can make an awful lot of money very quickly by selling drugs.  Which is just as well, because everything costs money. Expanding your facility costs money.  Building machines and belts costs money. Hiring explorers to discover new ingredients, scientists to research new technology, and executives to oversee manufacturing and marketing; it all costs a stonking great wheelbarrow-load of money.  And it only takes a few terrible decisions to turn a profitable enterprise into an insolvent ruin.  Fortunately, the game lets you slow down or stop the passing of time to give you a few moments to contemplate your next executive decision.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve worked your way through the tutorials, Big Pharma provides a range of scenarios tiered by difficulty.  As a beginner, you might be tasked with making a profit of $1,000,000 in ten years with only one competitor.  At the other end of the spectrum, you start out with $250,000 in debt and must produce four entirely different cures, all of which have a market price of over $500. Oh, and you have a paltry six years in which to do it.  Good luck with that stress-induced ulcer.  If you\u2019d rather just mess about a bit in the factory, then there\u2019s a custom game mode which lets you tweak a variety of parameters to provide a more casual experience.  (Or a more punishing experience if you\u2019re a hopeless masochist with a penchant for failure.)  It\u2019s a bit like Minecraft, except you have access to corrosive chemicals and virulent neurotoxins.\n\nGraphics\n\nBig Pharma\u2019s simple, colourful, cartoony graphical style works really well.  Everything is highly-detailed, vibrant and pleasant to look at.  Given how complicated some of your production chains can get, it would have been easy to have the whole thing become an indecipherable mess where trying to figure out which machine is doing what triggers a migraine.  Not so, here.  The UI is well laid out and easy to navigate, and the little puffs of smoke and flashes of lightning as the machines work their magic are a joy to behold.  The font could perhaps be a tad larger, but that\u2019s a trivial complaint at best.\n\nSound\n\nNothing much of note here.  The music is your plain vanilla-flavoured background beeping and bopping, which is probably what you want when you\u2019re trying to concentrate on the finer points of chemistry and marketing.  I tend to turn the music down in games like this because it becomes more of a distraction than an enhancement, and Big Pharma is no different.  It\u2019s not horrible or anything; it\u2019s just sort of\u2026 there.  Like wallpaper.\n\nSound effects are a standard collection of whirs, clicks, buzzes, and clanks you might expect as ambient noise in any production facility.  It\u2019s all quite effective in giving the impression of a sophisticated drug laboratory hard at work churning out sedatives and anti-depressants for the overworked and unfulfilled masses.\n\nPerformance\n\nI\u2019m running Big Pharma on a 2012 Lenovo Thinkpad with integrated graphics, and while my ancient toaster gets a little on the warm side, I\u2019ve yet to experience any lag, stutter, or critical warp core failures.  It seems to chug along quite happily, even after extended play.  The game screams along effortlessly on my desktop machine, so unless your rig is powered by an arthritic hamster on a rusty wheel, you should have no problems here.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to manufacture  and distribute drugs, but don\u2019t want to be beheaded by Colombian drug cartels and left to rot in the desert, or spend the rest of your natural life in prison (if you don\u2019t get shanked in the showers first), then Big Pharma is probably a viable alternative to ruining your life and suffering an unnecessarily grisly demise.  The game gives you ample opportunity to take a more altruistic route, but you can behave like an amoral, profiteering bucket of human effluvia if you so desire.  Let your conscience be your guide\u2026 and think about all those people who have to drive to Canada just to get some damn insulin.\n\nDespite being both stressful and quite complicated (keeping track of concentration levels, catalyst availability, market saturation, and your steadily depleting funds will give you grey hairs and worry lines), Positech have created a fun, clever game, that is both engaging and well executed.  I give it a solid seven Panadols out of ten.

In Big Pharma, you use machinery to process raw ingredients into medicine to sell for profit. While the concept is simple, there are so many different elements you need to manage to really maximise efficiency and revenue, for example:\n[list]\n[*] Machines all have unique sizes and shapes and you have limited space to build on, so it's a game of Tetris to cram everything in as densely as possible. This gives you lots of choices - do you use lots of cheap machines to keep your processing costs low or use expensive machines that take up a lot less space? You might be able to improve a production chain with a new machine that you just unlocked, but this could mean re-organising the entire floor to get everything squeezed in.\n[*] The ingredients you use come with a variety of different qualities, some of which are dangerous side effects that drag down the quality of your final product. There are a number of ways to manage these effects or remove them completely but you will need to experiment to find the most profitable method.\n[*] You only start with a small number of ingredients and machines. You will need staff to unlock new ones to really make the big bucks, but these staff also demand quite a hefty salary which can hemorrhage your early profits. You may need to take out big risky loans in order to hit tight deadlines. \n[*] You compete against rival companies which can effect you in a number of ways. If you make the same kind of cures as your competitors, your profits will fall as the market becomes more saturated.

Most companies spend more money on advertisements meant to push drugs on consumers that don't need them than on actual R&D.

I enjoyed learning how to play, and how to use the machines to make drugs.  The designers came up with a lot of clever/creative mechanisms for manipulating and combining drugs/effects.\n\nBut once you basically understand how to play and how to use the machines to get the effects you want, often this whole part of the game (placing machines/belts in your factory) just feels like a chore.  And if you're trying to maximize profits, you end up doing a ton of this - tearing down lines, building the same simple lines repeatedly, and copying more complex lines from one place to another.  Occasionally this requires a bit of thinking to fit the line into a different shaped factory room - but often it's just repetitive tedium.  \n\nI did a couple tutorials, then a beginner scenario, then jumped into the advanced ones.\n\nIn my second advanced run, I was pretty close to making the \"master\" goal, but realized that to reach the goal I was going to have to tear down a couple long lines and refactor them to increase production.  There was enough space that I was sure I could do it... and I just didn't want to.  I just didn't want to click all those buttons (and I'm a person who likes Factorio).\n\nThe \"placing machines\" part of the game is the interesting part.. but it gets old fast once you've learned the mechanics.  The overarching game - deciding what to research and which drugs to make - doesn't really have enough going on to be interesting on its own, and you end up making bad decisions in that game just because you're bored of tinkering around with the other part.

I was hesitant because while I enjoyed Production Line for what it was, it definitely had a shelf life because of the static gameplay. In that game, you'd basically research things, add them to your cars, maybe have to add a machine to install them, and adjust your sales price accordingly. Not much depth beyond that point. I feared this game would present the same problem. It does not. \n\nThere's a complexity to this that was exactly what I had hoped Production Line would include, or at least release a DLC at some point to address that issue. In this game, you're kind of doing the same stuff, but in many ways, you're not. You set up your production lines in similar fashion, but it's not a simple process of research, add, sell. Products include an array of issues you need to solve to get them right. You need to consider things like balancing your concentration level to avoid side effects, or you can use machines to eliminate those side effects. You need catalysts to complete upgrades, you'll have to adjust your concentration levels for your upgraded products, there's a machine to package them in larger quantities to make your process more cost efficient. All of these things take up space. Then there's the usual research with upgrades, ingredient discovery with upgrades, sales reps that can give you an edge over the competition, etc. There is just a lot to this, and it will make you plan ahead and adjust as you go. \n\nThe campaign is much better planned out in comparison to Production Line as well. It feels more in depth, competitors feel more involved and will really try to hurt your sales. The whole game just feels much more polished. I suppose that makes sense considering it's been out for several years, but they definitely got it right.

There are new ingredients and machines, but its uninteresting\n - Poor GUI design in some places, also lack of tool tips to explain things\n - Lack of insight (financials and pretty much all other numeric information is very basic) and choices (can't set medicine pricing, no realistic demand, etc - I get that some of this comes with the expansion but for a game in this genre this really should be in the base game and of high priority)\n - Limited 'base building' aspect was a huge downside for me. As a company this big I should be able to build/design my own factories\n - Quite expensive for such a basic experience (I did not pay full price, and I think this game is not worth it at the current price point.

I was surprised the rating is so low on this game but I figured out why - there are lots of 5 hour and under reviews that are negative. I would take these with a grain of salt as the early missions are simplistic and do not utitlize all the machines. That's like saying you mastered Starcraft because you learned how to use the beginning infantry.\n\nBig Pharma is part logic game part puzzle game, very small part business game. If you use logic (ie, estimate the cost) to produce each drug and comapre it against the sale price you will win, assuming you can properly assess if your factory space is the correct shape/big enough to support all the machines you need to use. Then it comes down to fitting all the pieces together so the assembly line works (puzzle). Many times you will be a couple tiles short and you'll spend a lot of time trying to optimize your line so that it works.\n\nThe business sim part is less important because if you play this right the AI stands no chance against you. The AI does not figure out the best drugs so it'll always be behind you in research if you do your calculations carefully. It also does not optimize based on demand so you can just flood the market with their drugs to keep them further behind. Most of the time I just do my own thing and the let the AI do whatever it wants. If it wasn't for patents I would not even notice them.\n\nAnyway, if you want a light logic/puzzle type of game then Big Pharma is amazing. This is the first game in a long time that kept me up late because of \"one more turn.\" Because the results are more mathematical, it doesn't have the same kind of replayability as Sim City or the Tycoon games though. It takes more than 5 hours, but certainly less than 50 to be able to win consistantly. The different scenarious do mix it up a bit, but you will reach the point where you have \"done it all.\" \n\nOverall, very much recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1540780462, "timestamp_updated": 1540780462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675342321395874023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45438152": {"recommendationid": "45438152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050338679", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1705, "last_played": 1664270205}, "language": "english", "review": "took a little to get into to it , and figure out the mechanics , but its SO MUCH FUN once you get into it.

It is also a game that requies a love of engineering and economics, and at times, it veers dangerously close to spreadsheet simulator territory.  Nevertheless, I have put dozens of hours into this game now, and I have enjoyed almost every minute of it -- even the times when my drug development has gotten screwed up. \n\nIf you have played a tycoon game before, then you should understand most of the basics of Big Pharma, but there will be additional concepts to understand as well.  Your job, as the CEO of your company, is to discover ingredients, research improvements, and then build assembly lines that refine and mix ingredients into drugs.  Some of your formulations can be incredibly complicated, especially as you develop more expensive cures.  You also have to develop these cures economically, using as little equipment and space as possible.  And, finally, you have to minimize the negative side effects whenever possible, a tough task at times.  The game requires so much forethought and planning that, at times, it almost acts like a corporate chemical engineeing simulator, which is a good thing for people who love to mix building, problem solving, and economics together.  \n\nBig Pharma does not have a ton of unique content, but it manages to stay fresh by throwing a whopping 35 scenarios at you, each with their own challenges and goals.  As a result, no two playthroughs will ever end up the same (although the early parts of the scenarios frequently play out the same).  Some of the goals that the game requires of you, especially after you get through the first twelve scenarios or so, become exceedingly difficult.  On many occasions, I have constructed what I thought was going to be the perfect assembly line, only to end up one square short of being able to place my final piece of equipment.  The game can be frustrating at these times, and it is definitely not for everyone.\n\nAs I mentioned in the opening sentence, the game's presentation is rather disappointing.  The machines and how they process the equipment looks pretty cool, but there are only a couple of music tracks that repeat themselves, ad nauseum.  The game otherwise looks quite plain and lacking in style.  At the beinning of each scenarior, you choose your avatar from a list of seven characters, but these characters have no personality and there is no perceivable difference in the gameplay between them.  Even a little bit of animation and emoting like what you find in a Sid Meier's Civilization game would have gone a long way to giving the characters some personality.  In addition, the game's marketing campaign suggests that it will provide some dark humor or satire on the questionable business practices of the pharmaceutical industry, but it never touches on this territory.  \n\nThere is a certain audience for whom Big Pharma is going to hit the mark perfectly.  Fortunately, I was one of those people.  If you have a scientific or business background and you would love to play a fun game that puts engineering and business principles to work, then this game gets a strong thumbs up from me.", "timestamp_created": 1514923719, "timestamp_updated": 1514923719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624608218669891357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38939806": {"recommendationid": "38939806", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961264306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 4108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2790, "last_played": 1579581061}, "language": "english", "review": "I have very much enjoyed this game.  It is half logistical puzzle and half management.  Trying to figure out how to make some of the more complex cures with the machines you have and in the space you have can be a challenge.

Watch your millions burn up quickly as you spend it on new research and equipment grinding away at it for months if not years in the game constantly tweaking the line and then one day finally the first drug to cure HIV is sold.  Then you can jack up the price as you are the only one selling it!  It is very rewarding.  And then you have a light bulb moment and realized you can produce it for half the cost with no negative effects.  Time to rebuild the production line! \n\nThe AI is not great, but they can become a real threat undercutting your bottom line always forcing you innovate and develop new tech and higher teer drugsif you want to survive.  \n\nThere are several different disease trees that you work through, the first drugs in the tree treating the simplest of things like soughing a cough, but as you discover more ingredients and develop better tech you can keep running that solution through higher and higher processes all the way up to creating a wonder drug that sells for thousands curing tuberculosis.

You have the ability to change the cost of your product, but a 2% change was enough to take you from high sales to going completely into the red. This wouldn't be such a big deal if the demand wasn't constantly changing. So one month you may have the perfect price and then three months later (even if demand for the drug is constant and no events have happened), you might be completely screwed. It's hard to build new factory lines when you have to spend 3 months watching the trends in order to get the optimal price point just to have it change on you 3 months later. I got to the point where I stopped trying, but then so many of the later campaign games have goals for total revenue over a time frame or a monthly revenue, and you're shoved back into endlessly micromanaging the price of drugs while your competitor is constantly releasing new formulas.\n\n\nThis was just one of MANY things that made this game frustrating at times.

As I write this I have 26.3 hours on record and will eventually put in more.\n\nWhile there are elements of games like Factorio in it in that you manage supply chains and improve production and product quality, it isn't quite so far reaching in scale. I certainly wouldn't call it shallow - I would say it's aware of scope and does a good job in terms of providing you with lots of options that have clear gameplay impact, leaning on certain puzzle elements like how you might go about making an ideal version of a product, or how you discover the next tier of products. Some unlockable traits do feel overpowered compared to others, but there are plenty of viable traits and playstyles and nothing has ever felt mandatory for winning. There are definitely some things you'll end up in the habit of doing early and similarly from game to game once you have experience, so simpler scenarios do end up feeling thin.\n\nYou can, of course, do a number of ethically dubious actions. Nothing's stopping you from continuing to ship an older version of a drug with a side effect - or from putting a premium on the side effect free version. One of the unlockable traits even requires having products recalled, and since you then have an optional benefit you can use in future games, well, that counts too I suppose. You can have sales agents greasing the works to get more patients prescribed to your drugs as well. However you're not going to find an extremely indepth take on the dark side of pharma as the majority of the focus will be the production line.\n\nIt certainly isn't a perfect game. This is one of those games where the sense of time never quite gels right. I feel like in a lot of management games you can normally reach a point where you can say \"my plan for the next x units of game time is y, and the grand plan for z unit of time is such and such\". I can't really tell you what a year or a month feels like in this game and it's absolutely led to me spending money far more quickly than I realized. It comes down to two reasons I think - the first is the large amount of randomization (such as ingredients and their side effects) makes a lot of long term planning impossible anyway until requisite research has been done, and you might have to change your plans if you have competitors. This is a reason I like, so I won't fault it for that. The reason I can fault is that since you spend most of your time in a factory with no humans and competition doesn't really have personality (they're mostly just some product lines and profit margins with a human avatar, really), the game can be somewhat sterile and robotic. Rather than being a pressing matter you have to remember to pay, loans will basically handle themselves (though you can pay them back early) through automatic deductions. Convenient, but it does contribute to the inability to really tell 'when' you are. Something like an annual investor meeting or elections impacting health care profits would have gone a long way to creating a sense of pacing to the game, and while events do exist that will impact drug pricing, they're random and almost never a real concern outside of very specific situations that you wouldn't find yourself in beyond the early game. The only major alleviation for this I found was to add lots of competitors so there would be things to respond to, which leads to the next hurdle the game faces.\n\nThe business side of things honestly feels very weak and I'd be hard pressed to say I ever did more than the most minor tweaks to prices, but on the other hand you can definitely do things like open up a wing that does nothing but create a mass numbers of a cheaper alternative to a competing product to try to push them out of the market. Competition may not have much personality, but it basically feels mandatory since they're one of the only things that can have a major impact on you, especially if you like long games.\n\nThe scale of the game is also sometimes a little off. If your sandbox goals are set too expansive (and you really only have two - bank x amount of cash or ship y amount of this type of drug, and you can do a \"by year x\" setting to add some pressure, and you can set multiple goals up) then even with a lot of things set to maximum it's entirely possible to simply run out of technology to research, ingredients to discover, land to purchase, upgrades to get, and your only option is basically to wait out the time and maybe try to develop some nonsensical super drug like a skin cream for indigestion that also treats cancer and the flu with a non-drowsy formula while waiting for money to accumulate or products to ship. Past a certain point even competition will be meaningless. The game is best experienced with more limits and competitors in place to force you to react.\n\nIt's the sort of game I play in chunks every now and then rather than a game I binge on. While sometimes awkward and definitely best if you fiddle with game settings until you discover your personal goldilocks settings, if you love the idea of optimizing a factory and production lines and stumbling upon combinations and discoveries (like finding out an otherwise unpleasant ingredient has an amazing benefit you could exploit... if you could only extract it properly), this is worth looking into. If you're looking for an indepth economics game, however, this isn't it.\n\nIf I had to give it a number rating (no decimals allowed), 7 out of 10.

It blends elements of business sims, puzzle games, and even a little RTS making for a very unique experience. There are a few problems though:\n\n-Although it has many different scenarios, they all essentially boil down to either \"make money\" or \"make a certain type of drug\"\n-It is NOT worth 25 USD. I got it for around $7.50 during the summer sale and frankly that should be close to the asking price\n-Since there is only one real basic principle in the game (diluting and concentrating) there isn't that much room for strategy making it a little too easy\n-Unlike most games along this line, it doesn't really feel like it has the customization features that most strategy games have. Almost all of the games will feel very similar despite having different opponents/ingredients/layouts.\n\nWith all of the bad, there is a lot of good that comes with it as well:\n\n-The game is not all that taxing on your computer. I'm able to play this on a laptop with no graphics card and I haven't experienced any lag, even with the biggest factories\n-The tutorial does a fantastic job. Granted, it isn't one of those tutorials that really immerses you into the game (there's a lot of reading) but it does teach and it teaches well. I have found no problems understanding what to do and how to do it.\n-The gameplay is very solid as well. Once you get the hang of the basics, it is fun to utilize the puzzle aspect of the game to make a factory that is as compact and efficient as possible\n-The UI works great. It isn't customizable, but I don't care, everything is very simple and it's exactly where I expect it to be.\n\nAll in all, I would reccommend this game to anyone who loves business sims and efficiency. If you are willing to delve into its interesting mechanics, you will be rewarded with a lot of control over your factory and some great challenges when it comes to efficiency.

You expend time analysing the  recent hypertension compound your company's explorers discovered in the desert; using the machines at your disposal you upgrade it to diabetes medication that isn't on the market yet - you make a tidy profit for being the only supplier and you're sure there's some sufferer out there whose health has improved thanks to your work. \n\nThe difficulty level ratchets up as you play: it is never too hard but time restrictions keep you focused on your goals. \n\nMechanically, there is a lot to do to keep you from getting bored: research new technology, send explorers out to gather new compounds, analyse the market for drugs, compare yourself to your competitors (and aim to keep ahead of them), respond to market/consumption changes, and (most importantly) create and develop pharmaceuticals. \n\nThere are also a lot of decisions to make and the \"right choice\" is not always clear. Do you spend capital and reduce profits to remove a negative side-effect from a new medication? The answer to that question changes based on your unique situation. How much will it cost? Is the market competitive or do you have a monopoly? How much less will people pay for their cough medicine if there's a small chance they will get a rash from it? \n\nThe only improvement I would make to this game is adding more variable challenges. This exists somewhat in the Global Events mechanism - random policy changes outside your control which alters in-game values. For example, a new mental health policy might increase demand for antidepressants.

You can't set the price of the drugs you make, each one has an intrisic value that honestly doesn't change much despite various in-game events. Really the only somewhat interesting thing that can happen to force you to react to the market is if another competitor patents a drug you're making so you have to tweak it a bit to get around the patent.\n\nMaking drugs has been oversimplified given that you magically know what you have to do to upgrade each cure to the next level. The only puzzle aspect is setting up your factory, and the only real difficulty there comes from the small building layouts, poor conveyor routing (you can't build stacked conveyors), and strangely shaped machines with inconvenient input and output locations. You can't plan out layouts in advance, you buy the machines/conveyors immediately and if it doesn't work or you made a mistake, then you've wasted money.\n\nThis game isn't particularly difficult and is fun for a few hours, but has no real depth to it. I did the tutorial, did the beginner challenge, jumped straight to the advanced challenge, and then used the sandbox to build the ultimate assembly line to make the ultimate drug. In doing that, I feel like I've seen everything this game has to offer.\n\nI got this as part of a bundle for dirt cheap, and for that price it was worth it, but I'm honestly shocked at the retail price of this game.

You get a number of machines that can change the drug intensity, upgrade it or remove side affects that come along. Each steps of course comes with a price and it's up to you judge if you want a better drug or make more money on it - sometimes both means the same but not always.\n\nThe visual aspect and general user interface are really great. A bit old school but well designed and look.\n\nThe processing line design is pretty fun - I must admit. In general it's a puzzle - place more cheaper machines that takes less space or more costly ones that do the job for three but at higher cost. Either way you have to judge space requirement over probable income loss. Depending on the drug complexity the processing lines can be quite long and interesting and putting them up together is the meat of the game. You need to watch for side effects, adjust proper concentration, mix them together to combine certain effects in order to upgrade them. The whole marketing model is quite complex and opponents do put up a fight. \n\nApart from that you get scientists you can hire in order to discover more complex machines and other enhancements. You also get to hire people to discover other ingredients curing different diseases. They're costly so you need to manage this as well.\n\nThere are some issues though - ones that really spoil a lot of the fun. First of while the theme is interesting it causes the names to be hard to remember. This goes especially for ingredient names and diseases treated - I could not remember them whatsoever and had to constantly check by hovering over or visiting cures screen. Fact that processed drugs at each stage look almost the same - apart from the small distinction in colour does not help at all. The machine names are easier to remember but just a little. Also the fact that once you research Creamer there is no point in shipping pills is also off putting.\n\nBut the worst offence was a combination of trying to optimize the output combined with competition. The game gives you a packaging machine. This enables storing multiple drugs in a single package, thus the packages contain more but are less frequently occupying the conveyor belt. This lets you output multiple drugs into a single slot. The number of slot is limited and you can use them both for input and output - thus makes sense to have 4 inputs and single output - and is doable. However if your opponent gets a patent on one of the drugs you're producing you are screwed. The forbidden drug will stop the export and halt all four lines to a point in which you have to manually delete and replace the conveyor belt in order to get your other lines working. Really annoying and proves that optimizing this area is pointless.\n\nOverall apart from the problems noted the game is pretty good. Has it's flaws but did enjoy it.

El juego est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado de tal manera que ser\u00e1 entretenido a la vez que adictivo, brind\u00e1ndonos una experiencia muy satisfactoria. \n\nBig Pharma  es un juego de simulaci\u00f3n y estrategia, en el cual desempe\u00f1aremos el papel de due\u00f1o y se\u00f1or de nuestra propia farmac\u00e9utica, donde fabricaremos remedios para las diferentes enfermedades.\n\nEl comienzo no ser\u00e1 del todo sencillo porque el tutorial que nos encontramos no es de los mejores que he visto, haciendo un poco pesado en algunos momentos, aunque una vez terminado la cosa se pondr\u00e1 un poco m\u00e1s a nuestro favor.\n\nLas misiones son interesante, encontr\u00e1ndonos a veces en la bancarrota, e incluso con un tiempo determinado recaudar el dinero necesario para salir victorisos, y muchas de las veces a toda costa, sin importar realmente el resultado en el consumidor.\n\nUn consejo es que pens\u00e9is bien la organizaci\u00f3n de las m\u00e1quinas para fabricar los medicamentos porque los espacios son limitados y en muchas ocasiones nos encontraremos con situaciones en las que nos arrepentiremos de c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n o que quisi\u00e9ramos m\u00e1s metros para ampliar la empresa. Si es verdad que podremos reubicarlas, y algo es algo porque si no ser\u00eda un completo caos.\n\nNo solo de fabricar se trata el juego. Antes de fabricar algo nuevo, habr\u00e1 que innovar, desde buscar nuevos ingredientes hasta disponer de m\u00e1quinas punteras que nos sean de utilidad para fabricar esos nuevos medicamentos que necesitamos.\n\nEn ciertas ocasiones nos dar\u00e1 a pensar c\u00f3mo funcionan realmente las farmac\u00e9uticas en la realidad, aunque no nos confirma nada por supuesto, pero a m\u00e1s de uno,  despu\u00e9s de unas cuantas partidas se lo pensar\u00e1 dos veces eso de ir a la farmacia a comprar un medicamente tan simple como un paracetamol. \u00bfY esto porque? Creamos medicamentos que solventen problemas, los mejoraremos a\u00f1adiendo ciertos ingredientes para ser m\u00e1s potentes y dar mejores resultado, pero\u2026 llegan los efectos secundarios. Estas cosas hacen que los consumidores puedan no comprar estos medicamentos por miedo a lo que pueda pasar. Si queremos inflar nuestro bolsillo nos pensaremos si mejorar nuestro producto, o dejarlo como estaba y seguir ganando m\u00e1s pelas, pero claro, a consecuencia de que los m\u00e1s enfermos no consigan curarse.\n\nPara concluir, y para daros un alegr\u00eda final. Podemos confirmaros que el juego esta en castellano, todos los textos, y todas las opciones del juego que est\u00e1n traducidas a nuestro idioma, y es una buena noticia porque si ello ser\u00eda un poco costoso seguir el hilo de todo para los hispano hablantes.\n\nBig Pharma nos ha gustado, es un original simulador con toques arcade de manera que equilibra el entretenimiento con las funciones de empresario due\u00f1o de una farmac\u00e9utica. Mejorable en algunos aspectos como los gr\u00e1ficos, pero le perdonaremos por llegarnos por fin en castellano. \n\nM\u00e1s en: creativefuturegames(doc)com", "timestamp_created": 1489485640, "timestamp_updated": 1489485640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490066230297088623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30437318": {"recommendationid": "30437318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147640386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 2670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1609797065}, "language": "english", "review": "A clear example of how drugs give you plenty of money. \n\n\n\nwink*", "timestamp_created": 1489198062, "timestamp_updated": 1489198062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385084271430969238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30342990": {"recommendationid": "30342990", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960499853", "num_games_owned": 1471, "num_reviews": 262, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1488681004}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego de gesti\u00f3n de lineas de producci\u00f3n ambientado en el mundo de las farmac\u00e9uticas: Obtenemos ingredientes b\u00e1sicos y hemos de ir modificando sus propiedades a base de procesarlos en m\u00e1quinas, mezclarlos con otros, etc. hasta obtener un medicamento con un buen equilibrio entre coste de producci\u00f3n y eficacia de la cura/efectos secundarios.\n\nEl tutorial es largo pero bien llevado y deja todo bastante claro, por lo que aunque el juego puede resultar un poco confuso al principio, enseguida se le pilla el truco.

The game's various levels really do put up a good effort to delay that feeling though and it definitely improves replayability, but to me that didn't feel like a strong enough reason to keep playing. I feel that a game like Factorio would be a better choice for a comparable game. Big Pharma is definitely fun while it lasts, so consider getting it in sale; I'd value it at about 10 bucks.\n\nWas this review useful to you?

Then, a day or so ago, I decided to give it a try after all.\n\nI really wish I'd done so earlier.\n\nOkay, so here's the deal. Big Pharma is part business sim, part process puzzle. It's important that you recognize this duality, because unless you like both, you may not enjoy yourself. Pure business sims like Capitalism of days gone by focus on acquisition of materials, production of product, marketing and sales, but they ignore the mechanics of actually making those products; it's a black box where inputs go in and outputs come out. On the flip side, process puzzles like Space Chem (which I truly enjoy) or Factorio place the emphasis on how you're going to make something and naught else. Big Pharma is what you get when you combine those two. Maybe a little heavy on the process side. In BiPh, you're running a pharmaceutical plant (surprise, right?) and you need to make useful products. You'll be adjusting concentrations to activate and deactivate ingredients' properties, purifying compounds, combining ingredients, and basically performing gymnastics to produce a drug that will, for example, treat angina without having your patients firing diarrhea all over the place or something even worse. \n\nThe nifty bit is that you can be a ruthless pharmaschmuck who doesn't really care about the product so long as it makes money. If you're content to market a painkiller that causes nightmares, swelling, and anal leakage, you can. But you can also go the three extra miles to make a drug that cures Alzheimer's, is fast-acting, and non-drowsy. It's all down to A) how you want to run the business, and B) how creative you can be in getting your production lines to work. You need to feed your inputs into specific machinery in specific orders to do what you want, and that means that you're also playing a path puzzle game. BiPh is three games in one tidy, creative, attractive package.\n\nGraphics are good, plenty good for the purpose, and even include customization options. Play is as flexible as you want to be, as detailed and difficult as you want it to be. Replay value? You bet; you'll learn something new all the time, mostly better ways to do the same thing. Music is enjoyable. And perhaps most importantly - it's fun. \n\nPlus, they were good enough to include a Freebuild mode, so you can experiment to your heart's content. Major plus in my book.\n\nAs for negatives, there are very few, mainly orbiting the sphere of \"not-quite-intuitive.\" There will be times where you set up a complex production line that SHOULD be producing the Wonderdrug Of All Time but is instead turning out what amounts to Kool-Aid. Then you'll find out you had a mixer set backwards and it was combining inputs wrong. And you'll get annoyed and have to purge the line before getting things going again. But some philosophers argue that frustrations are the lessons we learn best. Clearly, these people needed a day job because they had way too much time on their hands. However, as you build up your experience, you'll make these mistakes less and less often, your production lines will become more efficient, and you'll inflict nuclear incontinence on fewer people who take your meds.\n\nThe multi-part tutorial is complete and easy to follow. You can also use it repeatedly to reference parts that seem to have gone wrong for you; I did. There's also a nice wiki community supporting BiPh, and the developer seems like an honestly decent sort, the kind of dev you want to support. And as if all this wasn't enough, BiPh was deliberately designed to be moddable! If there's more you can ask for...you might be bordering on getting greedy.\n\nAt the end of the day (and beginning and middle), this one has my thumbs pointing up. There's a lot of fun to be had here. Just don't make my mistake - play it as soon as you pick it up.

I was so wrong.\n The graphics are on par for a management game. Nothing too special but not bad. Music and sound effects are ok and the gameplay is\u2026well OK too. It\u2019s nothing special and definitely not what I expected, but it\u2019s OK for what it does. However the building part doesn\u2019t matter too much and that\u2019s what killed it for me. It\u2019s a micromanagement decision making game, with a little construction thrown in.\n\n2. Did i finish the game? NO\n\nThe fact that the building portion of the game was so small made me uninstall it after the first mission. I don\u2019t think I will be coming back to this one.\n\n3. Pros/Cons.\n\nPROS:\n- A pretty good management game\n\nCONS:\n- Not a lot of building in it\n\n4. Final thoughts:\n\nNot my style of management game, although a lot of people will enjoy it. \n\n5.

Then it's down to arranging the machines in such a way as to produce the product. Mistakes happen early and often, but you get the hang of it with enough practice. \n\nThe research and development arms of the game give a real sense of progression as you open up new options for cures and expansion.

Basically you are building a lab full of assembly lines that take raw ingredients and converts them into medicine or pills to sell for profit.\n+  Visually the game looks great with a very nice clean charming style. Once you build a bunch of machines it can be very entertaining to just sit back and watch your factory essentially print money.\n+ A lot of strategy and planning is involved while designing your machines. You will often have to move around or completely change a line to develop an even greater product. Every machine has a different entry and exit point, so you really have to keep in mind how much space you have, and try to make things compact.\n+ Surprisingly complex. I found the game to be a tad hard to learn at first, but once you grasp the concept it will feel very rewarding as you learn how to upgrade and mix ingredients to form greater level cures.\n+ A LOAD of content. If you plan on beating the game I'm sure you can spend over 40 hours easily as each level is quite time consuming. (which is not a bad thing)\n\n- The tutorials were very lengthly and a bit tedius to get through as they have you read through a bunch of instructions rather than introducing the mechanics in a more fun way. (A narrator could have helped)\n- There isn't any information that tells you the supply / demand for each type of drug. Therefor, you do not really have any idea what a new drug will sell for.

There is an extreme learning curve here, at least for me. It took me a solid 10 hours of gameplay before I finally figured out how to complete even the 2nd beginner scenario. I will admit that I rage-quit several different times before finally getting the hang of it. Therefore, if you have little to no patience (like me), beware. \n\nThis isn't the best game ever made, but it also isn't the worst. It isn't your typical \"tycoon\" game, as it requires a LOT more thought and strategy. I still wish there was a difficulty slider so wimpy me could make it a bit easier, but I would have to say that I have enjoyed my time playing. I sitll dislike that luck determines what ingredients you start off with, but I suppose this allows for a bit of replayability as no two scenarios are ever quite the same. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game, but only on sale. The standard price seems a bit steep for what this game has to offer.\n\nNOTE: I do not own the DLC, so I can't provide any opinion on that. \n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:\n\nWhat a shame... I really thought I would love this game. I've always been a sucker for tycoon/management games.\n\nAlas, this game is rage-inducingly difficult, and there is no difficulty setting, so you're stuck with what you have. Even more strangely, it seems that each new game is randomized so there is a bit of a luck factor involved. I can't even finish the 2nd \"begiinner\" mission (after three tries) without failing and, therefore, rage-quitting. I wonder how I would do on the advanced missions? :D\n\nTutorial is quite useless and does little to help you complete the scenarios. My company is always bleeding money while the AI companies seemingly instantly turn into millionaires. So glad I got this as part of a bundle, because I probably won't be launching it again...\n\nNot recommended. I would not buy it again if I knew then what I know now.

Then you input drug ingredients from wall sockets and upgrade them along the production line. You can rotate the gadgets, but not mirror them.

Some people said that the base game is a bit easy, but I only played with the DLC. Every factory gadget has a processing cost when stuff moves through it. So you have to ensure your drug is cheap to make by optimizing the amount of gadgets. You can make your drug stronger and boost your sales by getting rid of side-effects or adding positive effects and boosters from other ingredients, but there are many specific logical rules in place which ensure that you will mostly have a hard time doing so.\n\nAfter playing a while I have to say I like this game.

Custom build might be better if you want to practice techniques for challenges. It gives you the ability to learn how to properly research, search for ingredients, deal with money, etc, WITHOUT being restricted.\n\nSo again: Free build if you wanna quickly try out how to combine things or how equipment works.

Sure, some of it is repetitive; when starting a new level, you have to build up your factory and income, but the randomness is a good thing - in different games, different ingredients lead to different cures and side-effects, and you have to combine them in different combinations.

Nothing exposes your inner evil than becoming a pharmaceutical executive. The gameplay is not too complex, mostly based around creating production lines increasing and decreasing concentration or adding new ingredients to reach the higher tier drugs or to add special effects. Building machinery is similar to tetris: rotate the fixed input and output points until the shortest connection between them is possible or they take up the least amount of place.\n\nFew issues:\n- Most maps are badly designed, as a result of the tetris-like elements. Buildings are oddly shaped, full of narrow passages and corridors that make placing fixed sized and shaped machines frustrating or requiring a lot of moving around. I would personally prefer a more Prison Architect style gameplay where I can freely design buildings to suit my needs.\n- Just as real medical research, I assume, production lines involve certain amount of rial and error. Some machines remove some effects, but so far I found no explanation for that. The mixers lack labeling on input, so the first mix is a trial and error in determining what will be the base and what the additive.\n- The upgrade system is uninspiring. Purely decrease the operating cost of a machine by x amount of money. No tech to increase speed, improve supply, or anything more meaningful. A deeper, more diverse research system would be nice.\n- The AI does weird things. I developed Drug A. Cornered the market to 90%. The AI developed Drug B, a less effective version of Drug A. Got the 10%. So far so good. But over time, based on its less effective drug, with a higher price tag and a lower sales rating, it managed to muscle me out of the whole market with no rational explanation.\n- The patent system is ridiculous and broken, just like in real life I guess. I have been selling a drug I developed ahead of the competitors for 10 years. Then the AI slaps a patent on it, and retroactively pulls mine off the market. That would be like me patenting apples and hitting all fruit farmers with a cease and desist letter which there is no recourse for. It is an unfair, broken and gimmicky system that should not be in the game in its current form. Drugs already on the market should not be subject to the system, it should be an option once you developed a new drug.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not regret my purchase. The game is fun albeit simplistic and sometimes a bit rough around the edges. It is still an entertaining management game. With some additional elements a sequel to it could be a really good game.", "timestamp_created": 1474781998, "timestamp_updated": 1474781998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587911427021026611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25684580": {"recommendationid": "25684580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062371493", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6757, "last_played": 1570797348}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun, like lollercoster tycoon. luck to buy sailed price", "timestamp_created": 1474779310, "timestamp_updated": 1474804559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25679707": {"recommendationid": "25679707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141968084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1007, "last_played": 1527789205}, "language": "english", "review": "Have a Pharmacology test tmr\nFound Big Pharma\nUsed the knowledge from lecture to play this game\nsplendidly win\ngot F in test\n\n10/10 would do it again", "timestamp_created": 1474754264, "timestamp_updated": 1474754264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 38, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522886693477630615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25678113": {"recommendationid": "25678113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078211347", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1355, "last_played": 1474970241}, "language": "english", "review": "Kind of confusing to follow at first. but, once you understand, it is an addictive game.", "timestamp_created": 1474748332, "timestamp_updated": 1474748332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467372119426727295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25676446": {"recommendationid": "25676446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006726805", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2270, "last_played": 1568572122}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un gran juego simple de entender y dificil de dominar, sin duda le encantara a todos aquellos que loes gusten los juegos tycon y de administracion.", "timestamp_created": 1474742870, "timestamp_updated": 1474742870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536423861980438232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25671212": {"recommendationid": "25671212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013665979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1475845458}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is like the baby brother of factorio.

Enojoyable and simple UI that is very sleek and well designed\nCons\n1. Game sondtrack isnt varied and it can get annoying listening to the same couple of tunes over and over\n2. The game lacks alot of options and stats that you would really wanna see and would vastly help you get more info about your income and costs, but the new DLC really takes great strides to improve this area so I would highly recommend getting the DLC.\n3. While I personally think the price is acceptable I defiantely feel that for pure amount of content it is slightly above where it shold be listed, 15 or 20 sound more reasonable. (Get it on sale and it will be well worth it.)\n\nIn general the game is awesome and if you're any fan of company simulations or medical sims youll love this game. The team seems so far to be doing a great job, they are consistantly updating the game and using to dlc to add some real needed mechanics that make the game far more enjoyable and give it more depth.

The graphics are clean. The user interface is pretty straight forward. It's entertaining. It has a good tutorial. There are a few metrics of the game that are a bit tricky, but once you figure it all out, you can start pumping out money making products in no time. The only real issue i have with the game is it's a bit repetitive after a while. The only real reason I\u2019m still playing it, mainly to finish off the last achievement I need for a perfect game. \n\nThe grind is always the start of the level. All the challenges with the exception of the full unlock mission, have everything locked up tight. It's a bit annoying to have to go thru the same unlock everything BS each time you start a new level. Other games would let you unlock it, and then allow you to keep it on future missions, not this game.\n\nThe other real issue with this game is the luck generation. A level is never hard or easy based on your skill or the conditions of the level.... The level is hard or easy based on the ingredients it gives you. If you get great ingredients, you can have a great start and plow through the level pretty easily. If you get shit ingredients, it\u2019s just a long drag and struggle and you're better off starting over and hoping for a better starting hand. \n\nThe game's full price is about $30 CDN. I'm notoriously cheap when it comes to buying games, not because I don\u2019t appreciate the cost of development, but because I have about 500 games on my steam account I haven\u2019t touched yet. It makes it harder to buy a new game over playing something I already bought and paid for. \n\nThe moment I saw Big Pharma, i knew i wanted to buy it, but not at full pop. However, it is currently on sale for $10 CDN. Is it worth that, I would say yes. \n\nI figured i got a solid 100 hours of entertainment from this game, so at $0.10 / hour, this game is a great steal at $10. \n\nEven if you tried it and found yourself bored after about 20 hours, it's hard to be entertained in this world for $0.50 / hour. \n\nDo I recommend it?? \nI recommend buying this game when it's on sale.\nI'd give it a solid 7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1474587466, "timestamp_updated": 1474587466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754815876483917236", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25639881": {"recommendationid": "25639881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080892101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1455086037}, "language": "english", "review": "Great concept.

The simple business management aspect suits the game well.\n\nThe Tetris part comes from the unique shape of the machines you place in your factory lines and the limited space in which you have to use. In the early game your available space is small, in the late game your factory lines are complex and long, and in both cases maximizing the use of space for optimal output is important. \n\nThe puzzle part is the meatiest: drug ingredients have components (with negative or positive effects) which can be removed, upgraded, or swapped around using one of your machines. These all have active ranges that vary, and it takes a bit of mental arithmetic to find the sweet spots to create the drug of your choice.\n\nWhen creating drugs, all three parts of the game come into play, making Big Pharma a game with depth and replayability. The campaign missions start you off in an empty factory, which makes gameplay fairly repetitive (though getting randomly generated ingredients and starting ingredients mitigates this somewhat).

It keeps you engaged, when you work a problem out like compacting a production line into the smallest space possible in a cramped factory you legit feel good about it.

Luckily you can save money, look for another ingredient that needs to be processed in a similar manner and with minimal effort crank out another drug. Or instead of selling the machinery at a loss you could re-use machinery different configurations or manufacturing lines to make a completely new process for another ingredient. Another thing, ingredients are randomized. This means you cannot make the same thing the same way. Ever. Each time you load a new level you have to think on the fly, formulate what conentrations you want, and if it's worth processing an ingredient enough to remove side effects.

SpaceChem is a perennial favorite of mine that I burned out on way before the end, for example. Big Pharma shares certain similarities with SpaceChem, but with a layer of corporate management on top of the mind-bending puzzles. It's an interesting combination, and also a very exhausting one.\n\nYou get to be the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, which turns out to be a lot more interior design and number-crunching than the vlogging and buying Wu-Tang albums that I expected. Starting with a small empty room, you import ingredients through hatches in the walls, run them through a gauntlet of machines, and funnel the resulting pills, creams, and tinctures back out for a profit. Each ingredient has positive and negative effects that are activated at different concentrations, so your machines can raise, lower, and rescramble concentrations to make effective medicines.\n\nCramming all the necessary machines and connecting conveyor belts into the space you have is your primary concern. You can research and unlock more efficient machines but you're trading space efficiency for higher running costs, which must be weighed against the profit of the drug. These values in turn fluctuate with the cost of ingredients, the market demand for that cure, and any competitor companies in that market. This is the management layer I spoke of and while you can do well enough ignoring price fluctuations, more difficult scenarios and the Master-level goals require you to retool your operation based on the market, especially once patents come into play and companies start locking each other out of producing specific cures.\n\nThis additional layer of complexity may be unwelcome to those just trying to wrap their brains about their assembly lines. Cures can be upgraded to more valuable remedies by hitting specific concentrations with specific machines. This sometimes requires catalysts mixed in with special machines, which might also require re-arranging your chemical's traits with yet another machine. All of these processes must then be crammed into limited space, and layout mistakes can be costly to undo. An efficient, profitable line is incredibly gratifying to put together, but it can be a difficult road to get there.\n\nYou'll have over three dozen scenarios to choose from, with goals ranging from make X dollars over Y years to deliver Z quantity of a specific drug. Regardless of your goals, the means will be similar, building assembly lines for simple drugs while you research the ingredients and tools to make more complex ones, and refactoring everything when you start to run out of space. New machines, upgrades, and rules may come into play in later scenarios, but never to particularly dramatic effect. It's one of those games where you really have to love the core gameplay loop because it's not going to deviate much from scenario to scenario.\n\nThe presentation is perfect for a puzzle game, with clear, colorful, cartoony shapes and pleasing animations for all your machines. I want to give special recognition to the sound effects, which reach Blizzard-levels of polish for how perfect and gratifying they are to hear. Machines make delightful buzzes and clanks, belts whirr along happily, and even the buttons have rich bleeps and bloops to them. It's an excellent concept assembled and presented as well as anyone could expect, so the only question is how long you'll care to stick with it. There's not a lot of variety to building lines or running your company, but if you want to build Rube Goldbergian conveyors and tax your brain in turning a profit, you'll find no end of content to keep you happy.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

So far I have managed to progress to Intermediate level in the scenarios. From my experience this game is what a sim management should be.  With a bit of twisted humour thrown into the mix seen in classics such as Theme Hospital, Big Pharma is beautifully made and very entertaining with a lot of replayability. \n\nInterface and graphics\nThe main menu looks like a mobile port but don't be fooled! The simplistic buttons and side menus in the main game add to the overall functionality of the game. There are options to change the resolution, sound and graphic quality in the game. The graphics are in the cartoon style. I personally prefer this because cartoon style graphics will age much slower than the more realistically styled games, if at all.\n\nGameplay\nThere are 3 game modes for you to play - Free Play, Custom Game and Scenario. Free Play is the sandbox level where every machine and research branch is already unlocked and you have no money. Custom Game is where you set your own criteria to win the game. All of the goals/criteria in the game are number based and it would be nice to have a little more variety in how you win like being the most or least ethical competitor in game (but this might be in the expansion). Other than that the gameplay is solid. There is a lot of scope for replayability. There are 3 ranks in each game: standard, expert and master. The higher up the rank, either you have to do more within the standard time limit, or you have a shorter amount of time to complete your criteria. It's not just about what the game tells you to do as I find that I set myself personal goals long after I have finished my game criteria on a certain level. \n\nA few funny bugs\nI have experienced some world events that were not logical at certain times. An example of this is the 'mild winter' event that popped up in May. I was also stuck on the 'Keep calm and carry on' scenario for a bit because none of the raw ingredients that were available to be explored in the game had the certain enzyme that I needed to be able to upgrade my drug to an anti-anxiety treatment. I made sure to explore all of the available areas.\n\nMy verdict\nThis is a great game. It gets really addictive so don't pick this game up if you want to be productive.

Well, ok, every game gets repetitive - even life itself does - and Big Pharma is no exception. Still, you always get a rewarding sense of accomplishment when you see your production lines running efficiently, your drugs selling more than your competitors (and for a higher price) and when you get good trial reviews because you're a good man and ran the extra mile to make them patient-friendly. Also, every level has a different objective, and you can get a standard, expert or master \"score\" on each, depending on how fast (usually) you achieved your objective, and that keeps you on your toe every time, avoiding any mistakes to get your \"master\" rank in every level. You do, indeed, start every single level with the same formula (slight variations, but the same routine), but I find the game is still fun after 20+ hours playing it, mainly because achieving the master rank in the toughest levels is a good challenge.\n\n2 - The \"managing aspect\" isn't a big part of the game - Again, I disagree. You absolutely need the money aspect, and it fits the game perfectly in my opinion. You must keep your drugs (and their sales rating, if you have the DLC, which I recommend) profitable, your income on the green, to be able to keep going. You must beat your competitors (and fast) or they'll end up showering you with patents and taking a huge share of the market, diminishing your sales. You gotta be careful with the loans you get so their interest don't end up eating all of of your profits, and also balance how many explorers/scientists you have - and what they are currently working on - to keep enough cash flowing in and your company, again, ahead of the competition. In my opinion, the management aspect works perfectly with the puzzle/logistic facet of Big Pharma. It's a double-fun experience, specially if you're the type of person who enjoys both things.\n\nI think that covers most of the \"thumbs down\" this game has received.\n\n***\n\nAbout the DLC:\n\nIf you liked the base game, you'll like the DLC. It adds some neat new features (check the DLC's steam page for specifics.)\n\n***\n\nOn a serious note / Something special about this game:\n\nThere's a very interesting and particular side to Big Pharma: it opens your eyes for how the REAL \"Big Pharma Industry\" works, or at the very least it makes you think about it.\n\nIn this game, you can leave side-effects on drugs on purpose (and regulate their, as well as the cure's, strenght as you will) to keep demand for some of your other drugs (those that treat such side effects) up high. You can patent your drugs to get a temporary monopoly of a market's share and raise your prices up to the sky. With the DLC, you can run trials on your drugs and deliberately disqualify the bad results to trick the consumers and raise  your sales. You... see where I'm going with this.\n\nAfter playing this game, one must wonder: \"Dude... this can totally be done for real. Maybe real companies do this kind of stuff.\" Then you keep thinking about it and... \"Why wouldn't they? Well... maybe they have principles, and goodness in their heart. Maybe they want to help people.\" But wait... we're talking about some of the (if not THE) richest people in the world, people you never heard about, people whose names no one knows. People who torture lab animals on a daily basis, who tested prototype-drugs on jew prisoners during Hitler's Reich. People who profit from the suffering of the sick and weakened, and make a living extorting the dying. People who steal an old guy's economies dry under false promises of an unlikely cure (**Google \"cancer\" here**).\n\nFinally, you'll find yourself concluding: \"Man... screw politicians, mexican cartels, weapon dealers and african warlords. Big Pharma - that's the real nemesis of mankind.\"\n\nI just read that Johnson & Johnson was just condemned to pay an indemnification of 55 million dolars to a woman because one of their talc powders gave her cancer. The doctors had to remove her ovary, and it was literally lined with talc. And that's a second (at least) for them because, months ago, they had to pay 72 million to another woman for the same reason.\n\nIf this example and reason alone aren't enough for you, Google \"Big Pharma\" or any company's specific name (Johnson & Jhonson, Pfizer, etc.) and read for yourself.\n\nWhat I know is I'm never taking any medicine again unless it's strictly necessary (AKA I'm in heavy, constant pain). If you keep thinking about all this stuff, it's easy to see how far these companies can/could/do go to take your money (like an infinite chain of side-effects and their temporary-with-more-side-effects treatments). Seriously, we are on the \"genetic mapping age\", how hard can it be for trillionaires (the Big Pharma industry generates a trillion dolars per year) to cut off side effects and balance a drug's components if they want to? Damn, even I can do it, according to Big Pharma (the game).\n\n***\n\nConclusion:\n\nBig Pharma is a very nice game. It gives you a sense of reward every time you score a \"master\" on the tough levels and that's the raw thing every game aims for. If you like puzzle/management games, I'd say this one should keep the average guy entertained for 30-40 hours, maybe more (it took me 70 hours just to get \"Master\" on all the levels in \"Advanced\" and beyond). That's good value for your money, and this is the kind of game that you start playing at 6pm, play for one or two hours straight, quit, and realize it's already 11pm.\n\nIf you're concerned about the negative reviews (I always and seriously take them into account myself) maybe you can wait for a sale, but I really don't think you'll regret your purchase at full price, as long as you understand what the game is like (the screenshots alone can give you a fair idea) and feel you are going to enjoy it - the game's execution itself is great, that is not going to disappoint you.\n\nEDIT: btw, I never got a single bug or crash whatsoever.\n\nEDIT 2: ok, now the game has crashed once, after 45 hours or so.\n\nEDIT 3: I just found out that this game was made by ONE dude, alone. That always baffles me (Terraria was also made by a single guy, if I'm not mistaken).

You can say it\u2019s a business simulation puzzle tycoon. You build, research, develop new medicine all the while trying to maximize profits. There is one part of the game that focuses on the production aspect of the medicines, in this part you have to concentrate on researching new medicine/cures and try to improve your medicine overall. The second part of the game is the economics of your company. You basically have to earn profit and try to improve medicine.\n\n[b][u] Graphics: [/u][/b]\n\nThe graphics are simple yet beautiful looking. The colors are very bright and eye-catching. It almost sort of has that cartoon look. There\u2019s not many options in the graphics menu other than resolution adjustment. \n\n[b][u] Sound: [/u][/b]\n\nThe music in the game is okay, you won\u2019t get bored from it but it\u2019s nothing to write home about as well. The announcer voice can sometimes become annoying though. Other than that most of the sounds work as they should and not bad at all.\n\n[b][u] Gameplay:  [/u][/b]\n\nThe majority of the game is based on missions, where you start out with $50000 and you have a task. For example the first mission has you earn a certain amount of revenue in 10 years. Most of the missions are like that and as you keep doing missions the next batch of missions gets harder and harder. There\u2019s a lot of missions and even free mode where you can just play without having to worry about anything. There will be a rival company which also influences your company when they introduce new drugs etc. \n\nThere\u2019s also a puzzle element of fitting your medicine making machinery in a limited space, so figuring that out can be a lot of fun. You can choose from 8 different characters when you start a game. There are perks when you start a new game. E.G a perk where refunding equipment gives you 100% money back instead of regular 50%. You can choose 2 perks, at the beginning there\u2019s only 4 perks unlocked but you can unlock more as you do missions and do the objectives the said perk requires. It\u2019s a very strategic game where everything you do has an effect eventually so you must make your decisions well thought out. Game can be pretty complicated so if you like serious management games, this game is for you.\n\nThe DLC \u201cMarketing and Malpractice\u201d adds a whole bunch of add-ons to the game such as marketing tools where you can adjust your prices of your drugs as per the demand/demand, you basic economics. This basically changes they way the game works with your competitors as you can undercut their prices. You can give \u201cgifts\u201d and other such to doctors to increase sales. The DLC in my opinion makes the game much more interesting and gives it that new perspective of playing. \n\n[b][u] Graphics: 8/10 [/u][/b]\n[b][u] Sound: 7/10 [/u][/b]\n[b][u] Gameplay: 8/10 [/u][/b]\n[b][u] Overall: 8/10 [/u][/b]\n\n[b][u] Conclusion: [/u][/b]\n\nBig Pharma is an excellent time waster and a very good business/tycoon/simulator/puzzle game.

Where similar games get by overloading with content and chaos--more things to build, higher volume, etc, Big Pharma rewards for elegant solutions.  It isn't about how much you produce.  It's about how you produce it.\n\nFor simplicity's sake, I will contrast Big Pharma with Factorio, which I also got a lot of enjoyment from.  Factorio is about managing resources and logistics--incredibly large numbers of exceedingly simple tasks that combine to create hectic situations.  The entire game (Factorio) can be summed up as deciding what you want to make, then ensuring the right buildings are getting the right amounts of all requisite materials in a massive and complicated chain involving dozens of buildings.  All gameplay revolves around that.\n\nBig Pharma is absolutely nothing like that; rather, it is about design and decision making.  Where Factorio gets complicated, Big Pharma is merely complex.  In Big Pharma, you can make whatever sort of cure you like.  Expensive or cheap, whether you earn or lose money is determined by *how* you chose to make the product and whether it was a wise choice to make it at all considering demand, competition, and your current capabilities.  You can make crazy wonder drugs and lose money with a hasty production line a la Factorio, or you can put some thought into it and make millions.  The same applies to the cheap drugs.  Maybe you even allow a minor, negative side effect in the product to ensure economic viability.  It's up to you to determine what the right move is, and when you make that right move, you get genuine satisfaction out of it that games like Factorio are simply incapable of matching.\n\nI am not saying that Big Pharma is better than Factorio.  I got a lot more time out of Factorio than I did from Big Pharma.  But I do believe the time I spent with Big Pharma was more enjoyable and satisfying, which is quite fitting.  Production in Factorio is all about volume, and production in Big Pharma is all about quality and substance.

I'd love to say there was more to the game than that, but sadly there really isn't. All the challenges are basically the same, which makes the game very repetitive and it gets boring very, very fast. SImply not worth the price. You can get mobile games for free that are much more worthwhile and will give you many more hours of entertainment.\n\nI bought this in early access (and got the Steam version for free, but never played it on Steam) and expected a lot more to be added to the game, but was then surprised when the release date was announced, constantly thinking \"that has to be a mistake, it's not remotely done.\" But no, Tim considered it done and it was released. Sorry, Tim, but you made a bad game.\n\nThe good part:\n- Figuring out how to turn ingredients into drugs using as few machines as possible is fun, at first. \n- Trying to create crazy drugs by combining different cures that aren't normally combined can be fun, at first.\n- Watching all the machines work is fun, for a while.\n- You can name all your drugs whatever you want, which is also compeltely pointless because there's no multiplayer so there's no one to laugh at the names you use.\n\nBut then comes all the bad (and the list is only short because there's so little to the game):\n\nYou have AI opponents who for the most part only seem to be there as decoration. They're no real challenge and even with the patents it's not a problem to beat them because you can just make another drug that's slightly different. You never feel cornered or like you have to rush. The only challenge remains beating the timer if you care at all about scoring gold on everything (which in itself doesn't earn you anything whatsoever other than a golden line on the scenario selection screen).\n\nOnce you beat the first scenario you know how to beat the rest of the game. The only thing that changes is how fast you have to make your money and what drugs you can make. Nothing else changes.\n\nTim (the developer) has a background in simple mobile games and it shows in Big Pharma: It lacks depth, it lacks complexity, and everything is over-simplified to the point where you have no control over any of the things that would have made the game remotely interesting. I wasn't the only one who asked for a more complex economy, but Tim felt it wasn't needed. Unfortuntely having no control over the economy means it doesn't really matter what you do because prices fluctuate at random. It also means that half the info screens don't matter because you can't do much at all to affect your economy anyway.\n\nTim's idea that \"scoring gold on a mission can be incredibly motivating\" doesn't fly when the game is so incredibly boring to play and has no real content. You simply have nothing to do, ever, other than plopping down the machines, connecting them with belts, and trying not to lose count of whether you needed two or three machines to get the right concentration.\n\nMeanwhile you scream for more to do and bang your head against the wall to express your frustration for yet another incomplete game that was released with no plans for more content.", "timestamp_created": 1460624481, "timestamp_updated": 1460624481, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574299812316894531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22366848": {"recommendationid": "22366848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010505891", "num_games_owned": 3940, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1168, "last_played": 1477801360}, "language": "english", "review": "Big Pharma is a game that I had no idea existed until it showed up on Something Awful.

You start with a vent on the wall to import raw ingredients, pass it through several processing machines to refine and produce the medicine, then end with a vent on the wall to export the completed product. There are a variety of machines and you'll have to make decisions on how to make your medicine. There are tradeoffs in space, manufacturing speed, profit, and quality of medicine based on which and how many machines you use. Also, there is a research system in place that requires you to invest money to eventually unlock more ingredients, machines, and other bonuses,\n\nCertain things could be better polished/presented:\n[list]\n[*]The tutorial could be better- it's just one long scrollable text box. I would've liked a tutorial that was properly divided into separate windows for each step and with UI focus (like highlighting/pointer arrows, etc.) on what is being talked about. It's not too hard to learn if you've played similar games or have a knack with understanding program UI but the tutorial could use some polishing up.\n[*]At first glance it seemed that there were only 4 columns of challenges but one day I was surprised when my mouse cursor wandered to the right edge of the screen and it scrolled a little. There's no reason to move your mouse all the way to the right (you can hover over the right-most challenges without scrolling the screen)\n[*]Sometimes it's hard to click on a specific thing (like vents to change ingredients or to delete specific tiles of that are partially hidden behind things). It's due to perspective but there has to be some way to better select objects in the back. You have to click on a certain area for vents that you'll have to learn by experience.\n[/list]\n\nThere are a couple UI changes I would have liked:\n[list]\n[*]To have a dedicated area to see current active events. I couldn't find the details anywhere after I dismissed the event box. After a while you can manually check the graphs for the changes but it would still be a nice addition.\n[*]To toggle ingredient icons while zoomed out (normally, all icons disappear). I liked to use the icons to figure out which areas are making which product (which is useful when you want to change production).\n[*]To find the location of your product line by clicking on the product in your company tab\n[*]To display the amount of ingredient currently being used in the upgrade tooltip (like the machine upgrade tooltip). This would let you know at a glance which ingredient you're using a lot (so how much the upgrade would benefit you).\n[*]'Auto pause and focus' is nice but it will sometimes not work if you've currently opened another event window. Your product line (and its revenue) will stop completely while it waits for you to name a product so the product naming window should really always pause and force you to deal with it (Or the product should keep selling under the generic name until you name it).\n[/list]\n\nPersonally, I would've liked a campaign or scenarios with personalities and scripted events to make things interesting. A little story to link things together helps keep my interest when doing multiple playthroughs of the same thing. The sandbox is fun for a while but it's not like The Sims where it's easy to make your own story in the sandbox. I had fun doing a few challenges and then went straight to a custom game with all tier levels unlocked to get the full experience.\n\nWorth a look if you like sandbox tycoon games and refining your strategy through multiple playthroughs.", "timestamp_created": 1459726200, "timestamp_updated": 1459726225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497140645980834961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22192239": {"recommendationid": "22192239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064704602", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 187, "playtime_forever": 1296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 666, "last_played": 1487386034}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1459582128, "timestamp_updated": 1459582128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22169293": {"recommendationid": "22169293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155497412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2447, "last_played": 1464523803}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game hrs of fun", "timestamp_created": 1459466879, "timestamp_updated": 1459466879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22134281": {"recommendationid": "22134281", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973176861", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1458971189}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty much experienced everything it had to offer within an hour or so.

Most of the gameplay is creating drug chains that optimizes drugs (for profit or usefulness) and then to sell them. Which is really a really satisfying puzzle game. All of the machines that create drugs have a different shape and size and in order to fit them all in you either need to plan out what you'll need ahead of time, because moving production lines after they are completed is really difficult, alternatively you can buy smaller more effective machines, however those will crank up the production cost for the drug, directly affecting your bottom line.\n\nThe game is great in that you can create really weird drugs that may or may not actually work, but after all it's all about making money and not drugs right? You will need to decide wheater you value space efficiency vs price, what research should you prioretize. All the while trying to stay ahead of the competition which have just patented your new drug formula rendering the giganormous production line you just created, worthless...\n\nIt's a great little zen game where once in a while you sit back and just wait for your drugs' ratings go up or down, accumulate money etc. Contemplating weather or not it's the right time to expand, what you should expand into, is it worth optimizing that one cure so that its drug rating goes up...\n\nThere's almost always something to do, at least in the beginning and then the game zens out after a while.\n\nOne bad thing about the game however is that when you get to a sort of \"critical mass\" you basically cannot lose, except  for deadlines. There's not really too many challenges after the initial ones, because when you manage to get enough drugs to sell, you will start making tons of money and the game really turns into a fine tuning game. I'm not saying it isn't  fun at that point, but it really doesn't require as much baby sitting.\n\nOn the other hand that might be exactly what you're looking for as you can then sit and maybe catch up on a series, Youtube etc.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice little game, especially if you can get it in a sale, great if you need something to stimulate that gamer part of the brain as you catch up on videos or whatever.

In Big Pharma you do manage a pharmaceutical company but it's more of a puzzle game with management elements. \n\nBig part of the gameplay is placing various machines that increase or decrease concentration of ingredients or mix them up and finally turn them into pills or creams or syringes. All these machines have different input and output locations and often sizes, you also need to add conveyor belts and with limited amount of space and doors through which ingredients can enter and leave your factory creating a new drug becomes, well a puzzle. Besides planning your factory you'll send explorers in search of new ingredients and researchers to invent new types of machines or improve existing ones. \n\nYou can play in free mode or one of many challenges. What is really smart and should be adopted in other games is that the challenges get progressively more complex. And I don't mean that the competition gets tougher or you are hit with arbitrary debuffs. The game actually limits your research tree and ingredient list to only present you with simple choices. Then as you progress you are given more and more options. It's a really nice game that hits that improvement itch, you've created a cure for bad breath and now you can improve it and cure sore throat. Coming up with more and more complex recipes for more advanced cures is extremely satisfying. \n\n[b]Dad rating: Excellent[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Game can be paused at any time, giving you time to attend to the little ones.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I bought this game because it's a business management simulator. Thing is, the business management part is only half of it, if that. The restf is very much a puzzle game, but not one that requires you to go so in depth with your puzzle solving thinking that you end up with a migraine.\n\nWhen playing Big Pharma, you'll notice that most of your time is spent, with the game paused, trying to fit equipment into spaces that make it work well with other equipment, within the constraints of the sometimes awkwardly shaped space provided. Sometimes you'll find yourself thinking \"Geez, they must have made this chain of machines incompatible with this dumb building on purpose\", while at other times you'll think \"Wow, this fits so perfectly here, without wasting any space at all, that I must be doing something right!\" Odds are pretty good that the reality is somewhere in the middle, where there wasn't much thought put into it at all aside from using the shapes of the buildings to throttle the difficulty. You will be annoyed at the lack of space, irritated with the AI for seeming to be able to patent something just as you're ramping up to produce it, but overall, you will get a sense of strange euphoria, seeing your machinations chug along, making you lots of money -- and it is pretty darn easy to make lots of money in this game. That part isn't hard. The difficulty definitely comes from making the pieces fit in a way that accomplishes your goals, effeciently and on timie, without blocking you from making the next line. \n\nThis is a great game to play with the background music turned off and your favorite tunes playing instead. That's not to say that the background music is bad. It's just mediocre, and mostly pointless. \n\nThe graphics look exactly like they should for a game such as this -- good enough. They're not realistic but they're not so cartoony as to be a distraction from the puzzle aspects.\n\nThere is no story or campaign or anything. The closest you get is the \"challenges\" screen, which is the first thing you see when you click \"New Game\", and offers various scenarios with challenges attached. There is a tutorial which is both easy to use and fairly comprehensive, though you'll probably have to Google some of the higher tier equipment to see how they work. The information is not hard to find, though, so that's not really a downside. \n\nOverall, Big Pharma is a pretty good game. The simplicity will draw you in and keep you hooked even well past the point where you're tired of doing the same things over and over again and, really, that's its biggest rub -- redundancy. From the moment you play the first game in the \"Beginner\" column to the moment you put it away, you're doing pretty much the same thing over and over again. Think about it as an assembly line simulation tied in with some simplified business management concepts and you've got a good idea of what Big Pharma is all about.\n\nYou're simply placing machines in a way that will be as efficient as you can make them. Everything else is just details. Is that a bad thing? In this case, I don't think it is. To me, the repitition gave me a sense of comfort, knowing that, at the beginning of every scenario, I had at least some *idea* of what I was doing. The first level drugs are extremely easy to make, and they get you off the ground pretty quickly, though you are forced to get more complicated since you'll oversaturate the market with them if you just make those. It was when the idea of starting fresh became significantly more appealing than continuing to try and get Master Level of accomplishment at a scenario that I realized it was probably time to play something else. However, that was 80 hours in, which is not a bad return for a game that costs $25 when it's not on sale!

What happens is it takes some time to get machines unlocked, etc. while playing in missions, so you find yourself doing essentially the same strategy for every scenario up to the point of fulfilling the mission objectives.  For example, several missions are \"earn xxx profit in xxx time\" - well that's easy enough once you have done it for $1,000,000 you can do it for $10,000,000.  There are missions like \"cure xxx xxx times\" or \"supply xxx drugs\", again, once you do those once, it's fairly easy to repeat.  The AI players are pretty much a non-threat.\n\nI believe there's a good 20 hours of playtime in the game.  After that, it starts to become repetitive.\n\nMy advise:  Buy it on sale.  $15 or under would be OK.\n\nTo the devs:  Game is good but too expensive for what it is - I wish the missions were more varied.

I definitely recommend it on sale to a fan of either genre.  Otherwise, it is more of a niche game than I thought it would be, which makes it tough for me to recommend to the average gamer.  I followed this game since the first dev vlogs came out, then bought it in the beta phase, and for me there was just enough that the game did well that made it worth me supporting it before release.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]:\n+ Supply Chain Management Tycoon: This is something unique that it does very well regarding drug creation/production. If you're not into Sim and Puzzle type games, then think twice before buying the game.\n+ Scenario Variety and Customization: Dozens of scenarios of varying difficulties with the ability to create your own.\n+ AI / Competition: I didn't find competing companies to be unrealistically hard or easy. With 3+ competitors, innovation to different drug types are imperative.\n+ Macro management (other than supply chain): Dev explicitly stated that the game wasn't designed for micro managing a pharmacy company. Big picture management is done well though with plenty of Research & Development opportunities, and it doesn't bog you down with price management or small stuff.\n+ Subtle ethical decisions: Some people wanted to be hit over the head with this, but again, it seemed secondary in the eyes of the dev. The decisions currently come in the form of...Do I leave this side effect or weak cure as is because my profit will be higher? Do I stop production on a drug that is still in demand just to move on to higher level cures with larger profits? Do I \"research\" corporate espionage in order to see my competitors' profit margins, etc?\n\n[b]Cons[/b]:\n-Incentiveize the game play loop: There's 3 completion levels for each scenario indicating how well the player did, but that, scenario uniqueness, or making a specific type of drug (e.g. hair growing male enhancement drug) seems about it for replay motivation.\n-Starting drug RNG (may be fixed): I've read about a number of players restarting scenarios until their initial unlocked drug combo was ideal. This may be more of a player min/maxing issue, and I think a patch meant to address this, but I don't know how well this helped.\n-Micro management (by design): As mentioned above, the game wasn't designed for that, and this may bug some people.

Money is tight, and the AI at times can be brutal competitors either flooding the market for a product or squeezing you out of one. Not to say the game is too difficult, but for those who love business simulations, the early game is your niche.  Late game however, the game gives way to its puzzle aspect as the more pressing of the two. You both lose opportunities to flex your capital might as well as simply run out of space to place your production lines, usually resulting in having to forgo certain markets alltogether just to produce a high tier product. And one that is impossible to optimize at that. Some of the late game markets are quirky too  I feel - The Male Contraception treatments are apparently permanent (in any form, but pill form specifically just boggles my mind). \n\nFor those who love business simulations though, I'd recommend giving the game a go.

The controls are clumsy: you move around with the same right button as you sell; switching between tabs takes so much time, although you do it all the time; I still try to push escape to get to the main view (because it's natural!), but only get to the menu; the default building hotekys are on the numeric keyboard (do you think everyone has it?) and I still haven't found a hotkey for belts.\n\nAt the same time, the gameprocess is overloaded by messages and different areas in which your attention is required, which doesn't let you focus on something in particular, but always distracts you. The analysis of market is not well presented, so it's hard to understand what is the best course of action at the moment. Finally, fitting your equipment in the factory is interesting the first two minutes, but then you are kind of tired playing tetris and are more interested in concentrating on more important stuff, but nope, you cannot.

The game hits you over the head with the options for the custom game. Granted, it'll take a bit of time to understand all the elements the game, and the tutorial could be better at teaching you the game's elements. But once you get an understanding of everything the game has to offer, you'll find surprising depth. The game's strategy design is where it shines: what elements are adjustable and ones that are not are done with purpose and reason in my opinion. Dealing with competitors that actually can affect your gameplay in slight and even more direct ways was fun, and it made me a bit sad that there's no MP element of the game, as I really felt like the game could have truly shined there. When it comes down to it: I felt this game did something that I feel a lot of developers could learn from: start with a great base design, add the options later on, and designed it from the player's angle: and what they'd want. Rather impressed in the long run, and can recommend to strategy gamers out there.\n\n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYuUF9spzM [/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Lots of customization options in terms of gameplay, and in particular with the custom game. Really can change the elements down to the most specific growth rates and research trees that are available. A lot of strategy games can learn from this level of customization.\n[*] I cover strategy games rarely because of the type of player that I am (I'm the builder type, basically consider me the opposite of the zerg play style), but this game was right up my alley in terms of my game style, but other game styles as well. \n[*] Good balance of gameplay elements that don't overly punish you for not using them, but reward you for taking advantage of them. Cost vs effectiveness of the drug does make a difference, especially in the early going, but both strategies can be viable.\n[*] Found that it stood the test of time in terms of variety with the smaller elements. Despite me restarting a lot due to my own personal weaknesses (aka wanting to perfect situations and so repeatedly starting again), I still found myself having fun. \n[*] This may seem weird to say, but some of the elements that you'd expect that aren't there (like setting the price of the drug)\n[*] Actually like the restricted playing fields. Causes you to have your own puzzle mini-game regarding machine placement that works rather well. \n[*] Did I mention there's a good selection of options? There's a good selection of options. \n[*] There's apparently mod support. That's always a plus. \n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Takes a bit of time to get going in terms of understanding. Lots of information to digest, and it could have been passed on to the player easier in the end. Tutorial could have been done better.\n[*] Little rough around some of the edges. In particular with things like the belt controls feel like that there may have been a better implementation. Luckily, it's something that you can easily get adjusted to in time. \n[*] Would have loved to see a MP version of the game, but understand the development costs that would be required in order for that to happen.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

Yes.\nWould I recommend it? Not really, especially not for 23 Euros.\n\nI love the setting, I feel there should be way more disease/medical-related games and I do enjoy the graphics, by which I mean I don't mind the simplicity. I like the making of new drugs, the setting up of belts/arrangements, the tight budget, the slight humour, the ideas like exploration and the reasearch tree.\n\nSo why wouldn't I recommend it? Because it gets boring, and it does so rather quick. The reason for this is, that its repetetive. Gamesessions usually are done in 1-3 Hours depending on difficulty and consist of you researching new techs and producing new medications with increased difficulty in the setup of your conveyer-belts.\n\nThe Problem is that its the same each mission. And the Drugs/Ingredients are completly interchangeable. Unless youre a \"Letsplayer\" you wont care for the name of the made-up Drugs/Ingredients within seconds but they will just be stats like \"increase/decrease concentration by 3\" so thats all you do.\n\nYou find the easiest way to reach that wanted concentration. And theres only (when fully researched) like 3 ways of increasing decreasing, meaning +/- 1 ; +/-3 ; half/double. So thats not hard! In fact nothing is really \"hard\" in this game. Theres no need to make difficult choices, as you will most likely produce every medice you can as far as research and exploration go, since every \"tick\" gives money, theres also no need to think about if you should keep the medicine going - if it ticks in money, keep it, if it loses money, replace it.\n\nThe result is a very easy game and the \"challange\" comes from increasingly hard scenarios. But this doesn't mean anything interesting like \"do this-and-that with 3 rooms\" or so, no, while there are ~5 different types on missions they all play the same, as you just need to make more of the best kind of medicine, cure a number of people, make some money or something along those lines, so they all mean you build up your, lets say \"empire\" and then at some point you win. And weather your task is to make 5-super-medicines or to make X Million $ doesnt matter as you do the very same thing. The Difficulty of the Game (which does go quite high in the late game) only comes from increasingly narrow timelimits, so the medium and hard difficulty is identical, except in one you need to make (lets say, not sure about the real number right now as it doesnt matter) 5 Milion in 10 years and on hard its 10 Million in 5 Years.\n\nSo after 10 hours lets say you will start more than your 10th game (the easy games go by rather fast) and you will do the very same thing the 10th time in a row, still not caring. And since setting up the conveyer belt-systems is the only real aspect, and you do that about once every 5 minutes, you will have done that about 120 times. And then its just routine, theres no fun to be had (there hasn't been in quite a while) and all you do is click your new belt, wait for money to pour in, click your new belt a.s.o.", "timestamp_created": 1448312265, "timestamp_updated": 1448312265, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581843078136444092", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19167518": {"recommendationid": "19167518", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965578815", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1448297642}, "language": "english", "review": "GG", "timestamp_created": 1447983237, "timestamp_updated": 1447983237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19152484": {"recommendationid": "19152484", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967569438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 13926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3640, "last_played": 1580668779}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a fan of simulation strategy games and this add an element of confinement not brought about by the likes of say Sim City.", "timestamp_created": 1447893789, "timestamp_updated": 1447893789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19009025": {"recommendationid": "19009025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030916966", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 7915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5066, "last_played": 1698236436}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly good game.

Unfortunately, the logistics puzzles and business simulation don't really play off of each other well, and the game quickly becomes tedious. \n\nThe two halves of the game don't play well together. The logistics lines are a little bland and mostly come down to twiddling the concentration of a drug up, then down, then up again to evolve its attributes and get them to the right concentration. This might be more fun if you could go whole-hog laying out a complicated production line, but the business side of things ensure that's generally unprofitable. Everything operates at just a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio, so there's no thrill of big, powerful throughput like you get with a massive Factorio setup or a speedy Spacechem reaction. \n\nThe business level isn't that interesting, either. Your profit is dependent on the efficiency and margin of your manufacturing lines. Sometimes competitors will interfere by saturating your drug's market, which reduces your profits. Often, a competitor will beeline patent technology just to force you to replace your best drug every other year. That's just annoying. The business layer is also your chief source of waiting, as you twiddle your thumbs waiting for the next ingredient or technology to unlock.\n\nThe GUI is also a bit of a chore. You'll frequently be flipping back and forth between the \"Ingredients\" and \"Cures\" tabs to try to figure out what steps you need to evolve your drugs, which ingredients provide the desired attributes, and finally what concentration you'll sell it at, and whether competitors are saturating the market.\n\nThere are some clever things. Sometimes you will sell a drug with a bad side-effect profile just because it's not profitable to sell a more refined form of the drug. Or maybe your drug will be too effective and demand will go down, or maybe your one drug's side effects will drive sales for another drug.

Your competition is supposed to be another company or group of companies, however, as long as you're turning a profit it doesn't really matter.  You are given objectives to meet and once you get the hang of it, they're pretty easy.  Your competition doesn't seem to affect much.  There are more punishing game modes (start with debt, etc) but honestly the reward of \"winning\" isn't enough to even contemplate another run through this game.\n\nThe biggest adversary in the game is the whole researching and combining platform.  There are maybe 12 things to research, so this has already become exhausting and a chore.  It just has to be done and there is no thought needed.  I've found myself \"waiting\" far too often.  One of the biggest draws for me for business simulations is the complete micro-managing which ensures you always have something to do, that does not apply to this game.\n\nThere is a puzzle element to this game that I'm not sure it needs.  It's more annoying than anything.  I suppose if you're really into maximizing space you could enjoy it but it's much easier to just buy a few expansion spots and build what you need in an empty space and not worry about it.  I think planning your factory floor would be more enjoyable if the inputs / outputs of your machinery were customizable.  As it stands you have 5 of the same machine on a line all outputting in the same direction and you just get a maze of belts.  It's asthetically unpleasant and tedious.\n\nI don't know how many more times I'll play this game.  Maybe a few run throughs here and there.  I've had much more fun with smaller / cheaper sims like Game Dev Tycoon.\n\nIf / when the workshop comes to this game I think it will be worth a second look.

But it focuses more on production process then profit. It is safe to say Big Pharma is a game about creating an efficient production line to achieve your (scenario) goal. \n\nThe game has a tutorial, but instead of (usual) series of interactions, tutorial itself is actually a guide-like-text in \u201ctutorial scenarios\u201d. If player can follow the text, it is quite helping and explains the details to a certain degree. Still, for the first few games, it is highly expected that the player will revisit these tutorials. It is also worth noting that the game expects the player to have \u201cplanning skills\u201d because it never mentions how a good/efficient layout should be.\n\nIn this game, player is given a set of machines, and a number of ingredients. Every ingredient has one curing effect and one to three bad side effects (There are 4 effect slots on each ingredient). Each effect on an ingredient is active on certain \u201cconcentration range\u201d and is most effective at a certain concentration. This concentration and activation of effects are the elements that create the base of the game. The player is expected to create a production line using the given machines, to activate the positive effect on an ingredient and create a medicine. Of course, bad side effects are present and are to be avoided. Curing effects on the final medicine increase the value and side effects causes it to lose rating resulting in losing value.\n\nIllnesses and cure recipes are known, and when you produce a medicine, more advance version is unlocked, up to level 5 medicines. Although illnesses and cure recipes are known, ingredients are not. For each game, ingredients are randomly generated. Only things consistent among games are that each ingredient having only one curing effect and activation range of effects. From effect combinations to how much those effects change final medicine\u2019s value is random. This increases replayability value. But it is also random for scenarios; therefore it affects the actual difficulty of the scenarios. One time the game may be too challenging and other time, it may be too easy.\n\nAnother randomly generated content is layout for production buildings. In each map, there are several (depending on the size of the map) partitioned buildings. The player is randomly given a partition at the beginning and buys the rest. The buildings and sockets are premade but layout of the buildings is random. Depending on the layout and starting position, the game may be annoying. Annoyance comes from shape of the buildings or the socket positions/count in a partition. Sockets are the points of entry/exit for the ingredients and medicines, on the walls of the buildings. Although there are at least 2 sockets in almost every partition, it can be more. Starting a partition with 4 sockets enables the player to have two production lines, without the need to but new partitions. Also a bad shaped building may prevent you to complete an advance production line required for the higher level medicines.\n\nThere are also exploration, research, patenting and \u201ccompany management\u201d. Research is the common knowledge. Player hires scientists to do research. Research unlocks new machines and some infrastructure projects such as cheaper machine prices or ability of exploring different types of lands. Exploration is the same thing as research but unlocks new ingredients instead. On a normal game, only the most basic machines and only 2 ingredients are available at the start. Rest is unlocked through researching and exploration. That said, researching and exploration are just a tab in the game and not the main focus. Same thing applies for the \u201ccompany management\u201d. Other than patenting process, company management is just an info tab showing player\u2019s medicines, yearly revenue and profit. Also rivals\u2019 basic info can be seen in company management. There is a research that enables to see detailed info about your rivals but it is pretty much useless. Patenting is what the name suggests. Patenting a medicine prevents the others from selling the same medicine for a limited time. The length of time depends on how much player chooses to spend on the patent.\n\nRivals in the game serve two purposes. One of them is to cause saturation because they use the same ingredient as the player and produce (mostly) the same medicine. This saturation increases the cost of ingredients and lowers the demand for a specific cure effectively lowering value of medicines. The other purpose is to patent medicine preventing the player to sell the same medicine. Of course the player has access to patenting after researching it too. This creates a nice \u201cpatent war\u201d situation in the game, but patenting is pretty expensive and mostly not worth it until late game. \n\nAs with all of the production themed games, most of the time in the game will be spend in paused mode. The player will try to make a good choice of ingredient-medicine pair to avoid side effects. After that, he/she will spend an equal time to position each machine in a way that they will occupy the least space. Since it is the nature of the game it is not a bad thing. Still, it is worth noting that machines can only be rotated in 4 directions and belts (connections between the machines) can\u2019t be multi-layered (although they can be crossed and it mostly works well). These limitations may annoy some people, but also some \u201cpuzzle people\u201d may welcome them because it gives the production a puzzle feel.\n\nThe interface is very well designed and the player is never lost in it. It has a futuristic design and goes well with the game. The sound effects of the game are nice and do not bother the player. But the game is a bit quiet. It needs a few more soundtracks.\n\nFinally, a personal note: Everything in the game is sold back at half the original price. Especially at the beginning, you  may struggle with the design and make lots of mistakes. Buying and selling the belts will cause you to lose lots of money. To prevent this, plan and imagine the whole process in your mind, put all the machines first and then put the belts. It is also possible to get the \u201cfree belts\u201d mod from the official site.\n\n[h1][b]Pros:[/b][/h1]\n[b]+ Simplistic:[/b] All menus and tabs are cleverly put together in a clear and simple manner.\n[b]+ Good Formula:[/b] Game elements go well together.\n[b]+ Fluent gameplay:[/b] There is nothing to get in the way during interaction with objects and interface.\n[b]+ Mod Support:[/b] It does not support workshop but has a separate mod support.\n\n[h1][b]Cons:[/b][/h1]\n[b]- Randomization in Campaigns:[/b] This results in the campaigns becoming too easy or too hard.\n[b]- Crammed Buildings:[/b] Sometimes building designs are too narrow or weirdly shaped and they do not allow a good production line.\n[b]- Feels Repetitive:[/b] Although some of the content is randomized, after a while, the game feels repetitive due to its focus on production. This may be a deal breaker for some people.\n\n[h1][b]Verdict:[/b][/h1]\nIf you think this game as a production tycoon game -as I did- it is well made (considering this is developed by a one-man-company). Overcoming the challenge to get rid of the bad side effects and creating a high rating medicine gave me enough satisfaction, so I recommend it. But because it focuses on production, it may be insufficient for some people.\n\n[i][b]P.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not.

Unnecessary Complexity\n If you have played Space Chem before, I believe you won't like it.\n This game is completely brainless. You dont need to think about how to accomplished something.\n In other word, it need more explainating on the story contents.\n You need to figure-out the \"only way\" to complete the task.\n Which is easy to do if the clear margin notes is given.\n This is not true? well, I believe there are already enough evidents on the youtube.\n\n2.) AI does not have a ideal interaction with the player.\n All you have to do is to make the drug.\n But if i am the drug dealer, I hope my enemy could give me some sorts of things.\n Like team-up, spy, or dmg the reputation of the dealer.\n In my opinion, the only thing is interacting with the player is the money. Nothing more or less.\n\n3.) As lots of reviewers mentioned this is not a tycoon style game, I am curisous about what game is it\n Some player said that people need to think deeply to make a great drug. but it is pretty linear, and all people are doing in the \"same way.\" Nothing more or less. In my opinion, Plants vs Zombies is more complex than this game.\n\n4.) This is not a merit that worth $25\n Lethis, Dinner Dish, or Mad Game Tycoon can make you feel entertained evermore.\n Or, Complexity,\n SpaceChem, Project Aura, or Magicka can twist your brain even more.\n\n5.)

The game is REALLY good, if you like repetitive puzzles with some niche changes over the cause of alot of different challenges pre-set by the game. It also has some sort of custom games mode - I have not touched on it so there might even be infinite amount of games you can play.\n\n2. The game itself doesn't try to make you interested in playing more of it. It is a game that you pick up and play and then put down again - it doesn't have a character to it that makes every drug/medicine you make unique in its own flavour. You basically just try to figure out how many positive things you can put on a single thing and sell it.\n\nDo I recommend the game? No. The game has an artificial longevity that is repeated in the same pattern over and over and over again. There simply is nothing 'unique' about each challenge you do since you will still build the same machines in every playthru' even if in different ways and shapes - they are still the same.\nSame thing with the drugs... you need to compete against a competitor's painkillers? Then here's your one ingredience with a side effect - now make it good. Rince and repeat.\n\nThe game has replayability in the fact that all of the side effects and beneficial effects are random to some degree but like I said before, you are still building the same machines over and over again. Nothing happens except your own fuck-ups which some people find intriguing and I do too... in competitive games, not in games that makes me want to think and figure out what to do next.\n\nAnd this game doesn't really do anything to try and challenge you - there are some mechanics like patents which can make you lock out your competitor's drugs for some time and they can do the same to you but, mechanics like those are just infurating when dealing with an AI where as these mechanics have a place in games when you are able to screw over one of your friends; you are able to get a reaction from them.\n\nOverall the game is brilliantly made but doesn't do a whole lot with it. I bought it for 18,39\u20ac where as I think the game's value would be around 9,99\u20ac to 12,99\u20ac - consider it when its on a sale but AVOID IT AT FULL OR NEAR FULL PRICE!", "timestamp_created": 1441640695, "timestamp_updated": 1441640695, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61744922399520874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17927256": {"recommendationid": "17927256", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970617010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 3443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2407, "last_played": 1695404095}, "language": "english", "review": "Indie strategy game about better living through chemestry.

Combining ingredients to get the desired effects, working within the confinements of your factory - there is plenty to think about. It can be very satisfying to tweak a production line to operate more efficiently, or to engineer out one of the pesky side effects. Probably do to my inability to think ahead, I'd have to re engineer my plans to overcome an obstacle I didn't anticipate. Researching better equipment opens up more options to formulate your products.\n\nOn the first advanced scenario, money was much tighter and the game provided a tense challenge. Sometimes competing against the AI feels arbitrary, maybe because they're mostly just messages that pop up. I don't feel like they're going through the same process as me. They are effective though - I would curse them when they patented a cure that was on my production line and they provide for some interesting moments.\n\nMy two main wishes are more fast forward levels and an online leaderboards so I can chase my friends' scores. Another nice touch would be to have a 'random' setting for each parameter when setting up a custom game. Many times games are more enjoyable if the player doesn't know quite what to expect and have to adjust their play once they discover what's going on.\n\nI've read some people's complaints about the amount of content included in Big Parma and I don't get where they're coming from. There are many scenarios, taking hours to complete. Setting up a custom game offers more play for those who want it too.\n\nSo, if you enjoy setting up and tinkering with production lines, my guess is that you'll like Big Pharma.

I'm glad to say that I was wrong.\n\nDon't be fooled by the simple, clean UI---Big Pharma is a surprisingly deep simulator where the logistical puzzle of placing machinery to assemble your drugs is the least of your worries.  For me, the real difficulty of the game was interacting with the drug market, where you must balance drug prices, market saturation & also keep an eye on what your competitors are doing (if they're importing the same ingredient as you, for example, that ingredient may become oversaturated & its price will rise, hurting your bottom line).\n\nYou can flood the market with a side effect-laden drug for some quick cash if you want, but consumers will eventually figure it out & punish you as your cure rating drops & your drug starts losing money.\n\nMy only criticism of the game so far is that it lacks a planning stage where you can lay out your production lines in advance.  I had to repeatedly switch between the Ingredients & Cures tabs to work out how to develop a level 3 cure, and keeping track of the machines that I needed quickly became overwhelming.  In the end, I'd go to the Production tab to place a couple machines, then back to the Ingredients & Cures tabs to figure out what machines to place next.\n\nA planning stage that tells you the concentrations/catalysts of imported ingredients (from the Ingredients tab), how to get to the cure (from the Cures tab) & the concentration/catalyst of the drug as it exits each machine in the planned line would be incredibly useful.  Then click a button to commit the entire thing, and you're done.\n\nAlso, when I'm deciding which machines to upgrade, it'd be very helpful to know how many of that machine I have across all my production lines.  For now, I can scan the lines to get a rough idea, but this is another example of mental gymnastics that the game could eliminate.\n\nBig Pharma is a game that I wouldn't hesitate to pick up on sale.

You run a company that makes drugs, and there are essentially three areas of the company you have to manage. The first is that you need the space and the equipment to make the drugs, which means you will need to spend capital to purchase floor space and then you will need to spend more capital to purchase machines to go on that floor space that are used to make your drugs. (There is a LOT more complexity to this part of the game, but we'll get into that later.) The second area is research, which is pretty much just an unlock tree. You pay an initial flat rate to hire a scientist and then also pay each scientist by the hour. The more scientists you have on payroll, the more quickly you'll rack up research points, but that obviously gets expensive, so you need to balance with your income. Research unlocks new machines, new shipping methods, access to new drug recipes, ability to file patents on your recipes, and more. The third area is exploration, which is a tree similar to the research tree. In this area you pay a flat rate to hire explorers and then also pay them by the hour. You deploy your explorers to search jungles, deserts, oceans, etc for new or rare ingredients. By discovering new ingredients with new properties, you have access to new recipes that can be used to make a variety of new drugs. Explorers also have their own research points which you can spend to reduce the purchase price of ingredients and reduce your cost of materials.\n\nThese are the basics. Know that you will always have rival companies that are manufacturing and selling drugs in competition with you, and if the rival company's drugs are of a better quality than yours, they can eat up your market share (i.e. you will make fewer sales and earn less money due to your competitor stealing your customers). In the early modes and difficulties, competitors are a breeze to deal with. They can be more of a menace in later modes, though, for sure.\n\nOkay, so what is the unique hook? The unique hook lies in purchasing floor space and machines and then assembling production lines. It is a complicated PUZZLE. Bear with me, because this gets a tad complex. Every ingredient you have to work with has four effect slots, and those four slots are filled with effects. The slots can either contain a curative effect, a negative effect, or simply be empty. The easiest ingredients to work with tend to have one curative effect and one negative effect. The more difficult ingredients have one curative effect and three negative effects. In addition to these effect slots, each ingredient also has a CONCENTRATION value that can be anywhere between 1 and 20. The higher the number, the higher the concentration. Each of the effects in the four slots has a random concentration interval assigned to it, and the effect is only ACTIVE if the concentration falls within that interval. For example, if the ingredient has the curative effect SOOTHES COLD that is active between 11-14, and the negative effect CAUSES CONSTIPATION that is active between 5-12, and the default concentration of the ingredient is 12, then THAT means that both effects are active in the ingredient, so you have to put the ingredient through a machine that will change the concentration so that the curative effect is active and the negative effect is not active. So if you change the concentration to 13, it is still within range to soothe colds, but it will no longer cause constipation. Get it? Still with me? It gets even crazier.\n\nOkay, so obviously there are machines that can change the concentration value of an ingredient to alter the effects. But sometimes you have ingredients with three negative effects and it is literally impossible to deactivate all of the negative side effects, so then what do you do? Well, there are also machines that can shake up the order of the effect slots, and machines that can swap effects between two ingredients. So if you're clever, you can swap negative effects out and positive effects in. In some situations, you can even create super drugs that have multiple positive effects! The problem is that it can require a lot more machines to make these crazy drugs, which is not only more expensive to purchase the machines, but each machine also has a per-use cost as well, so it is in your best interest to have as few machines as possible. UGH. DECISIONS.\n\nThere are other ways to deal with negative side effects as well. For example, you eventually learn that not only does every effect have an active range, but every effect also has a \"sweet spot\" number, which is a specific number between 1 and 20 where the effect is 100% effective. So you can research your own drugs to find the sweet spots and improve your drug quality, which is important so that your competitor doesn't steal your buys with better quality drugs. And of course there are some interesting technologies you can unlock that don't really pertain to concentrations or effects but are still highly useful in other ways. There is really A LOT in here to learn and figure out.\n\nOh, and don't forget that you actually have to manually place each machine on the factory floor, rotate it, hook up the conveyor belts yourself, etc. Sometimes you have enough funds to set up a production line for a new drug, but you're out of floor space because you built too many huge production lines and you can't fit the new one in there. (Discontinue a line of drugs to make room for a new one? DECISIONS.) So there is also a spatial puzzle element of using the fewest machines possible, laying the conveyors to actually complete the circuit, arranging your machines and production lines in such a way that it doesn't get in the way of future building and/or allows you to upgrade or expand the current production line later as new ingredients become available.\n\nThere are lots of different difficulties, modes, and objectives to play. There is even a sandbox mode where you can get all machines, all tech, and are given infinite money, so you can experiment with the machines to figure out what all of them do. (Some people may be confused about how the mixer works at first, so having a safe place to test and observe it is helpful. Combining the mixer and shaker is an advanced gameplay strategy that is difficult to understand or use without a bit of practice and experimentation, so sandbox mode helps with that as well.)\n\nMods are available from the dev if you want to change up certain aspects of the game. For example, some people (including me) don't think it makes much sense that by default it is impossible to move conveyor belts without selling them and rebuying them at a loss, so you lose money for just correcting/moving conveyors (which is not the case with machines).

The Advanced Mode's machines, along with the Centrifuge from Intermediate, radically increase the ways in which you can manipulate ingredients. It's also much harder to make and maintain a large profit, especially since competitors play a much greater role in the Advanced Mode. You'll need to start utilizing some hidden optimization tricks involving things like the packer or crossing belts with machines that have a cycle time greater than 1. So while dead-simple machine placement will get you through the Beginner and some of the Intermediate Scenarios, reaching Master in the Advanced Scenarios requires a lot more thought.\n\nThe negative reviews for this game have some merit, but the game doesn't promise anything more than it delivers. What this game does, it does very well: designing and optimizing production lines, anticipating what the market for a drug will bear, deciding what ingredients and machines to research or upgrade, all while balancing a budget that is very tight early and expands greatly over time. It's a beautifully-animated game that presents a relaxed puzzle atmosphere and gives you almost all of the information you'll need up-front.\n\nLet's get some things out of the way, though. Sick people are abstractions, which is honestly what I'd expect from most Pharmaceutical companies. The larger the market for a cure, the greater the relative price and the more of that cure you can produce without tanking the price. The market can increase or decrease as a result of random world events, increase naturally over time for infectious diseases, and decrease as people are cured. A cure that's particularly potent will fetch a much higher price, but you may eventually be left without a viable market for that product.\n\nThe available cures and how they're upgraded are static. The starting concentration of an ingredient has a fairly narrow range based on the range of the Level 1 cure. The number of plots available for purchase, and the sockets within each building layout, are predetermined. On the other hand...The ingredient order is random, side effects are assigned semi-randomly, the building layouts you get are random, and the market for each cure is random within a small range. This can make or break the profitability of several cures, but the Level 1 cure of every starting ingredient is profitable and smart research choices can dig you out of some terrible early setups. Even a terrible cure can fetch a profit, although it can be much lower than you'd get from a perfect cure.\n\nAnyone who says that the Competitors are pointless was playing on one of the easier difficulties. The competition presents a real challenge in Advanced Mode, as you have 3 competitors that all have the same early options that you do. Different AI companies prioritize different things, but they'll usually go for the more profitable cures and cures that can fetch high ratings (ie, no side effects). You have to be smart with your market choices in Advanced because the AI will very quickly oversaturate and tank the price for several cures. Anticipating what your competition will do is a big factor in your success. Patents in particular can really help you or really screw you over in the short-term, although they're fairly easy to work around, but you can do the same thing to the AI. Mucking with the AI's profit margins can really slow them down, giving you a chance to reach (and patent) the very high-level cures before they get a chance to ruin your market.\n\nSometimes you can make just plain bad choices, but usually there's okay options and really great options. There's almost always something you can optimize more if you put thought into it, and if you're shooting for a certain level of revenue or profit you'll be shifting around production lines a lot. I used to hit patches where I'd just need to wait, but now patch 1.01 added a much-needed 5x speed option!\n\nPersonally, I love this game.

It's not a simulation of medical pills and pharma companies, and it certainly is not a game about the overall management of such a company or the simulation of such a thing.\n\nIt makes promises that it can not keep. You will get little strategy, severely abstracted simulation, and very limited management. 'Big Pharma' is not about anything big at all.\n\nInstead, it is a small scale game that is essentially a puzzle about optimising chains of machines to produce a desired output, in a randomised building area of random size, with random ingredients that have random effects. If you like that, then good for you. You will probably enjoy this one, but for the rest of us who are after the other 'features' it proclaims to have..\n\nThe simulation is basic to the point where I wonder if it is a simulation at all. Diseases have a set number of sufferers or a set cycle/increase of sufferers and your management is limited purely to the supply lines, machines, and conveyor belts. Everything else is abstracted to the degree that I wonder why it was even included in the game, and many times adds nothing except a timer you need to wait on before you can continue working your belts.\n\nThe challenge, and main gameplay is more alike a puzzle.\nFit machines in the (random) building you have to have your (random) ingredients produce an optimal effect for maximum profit. Nearly all the gameplay is about optimising your conveyor belts and machines, which will be frustrating to you because the machines come only in one form with 4 facings. You can not make a symmetrical and effective supply line, and conveyors can not go over or under eachother. You get a limited amount of (Randomly placed) input/output areas to connect to, and often you will not have space for just about anything more than a basic machine.\nEmployees never have to walk in, out, or do anything in your building, they are merely an animation that is part of the machine. Research and exploration happens somewhere else. You never see your scientists or explorers except in a menu where you send them out.\n\nIf this game was only purely the production tab, was honest about its size and content and somewhere between 5-10 dollars, then it would be great. But as it currently stands I just can not reccommend it for its price. \nThe conveyor belt optimising puzzling is nice, and I will likely play it a few more times just for that, but that is all there is to the game. There is no 'improving the lives of millions', there is no 'getting rid of disease', there is no real management or simulation of a 'pharmaceutical conglomerate' here. The challenge scenarios are jokes, the rival corporations are jokes, and the whole 'business sim' part that it talks about in the \"About This Game\" part of the store are jokes.\n\nThis is a conveyor belts puzzle with shiny graphics, get it for that if it is ever at a 75% or even 50% sale, but as long as it stays above 10 euro/dollar, I recommend avoiding it.", "timestamp_created": 1441183955, "timestamp_updated": 1441191888, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769159317016601563", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17842955": {"recommendationid": "17842955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082218170", "num_games_owned": 398, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 6493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1284, "last_played": 1642226734}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm greatly enjoying the game so far!

I mean yes it creates a new challenge for you everytime you start a game since you have to adapt your builds to whatever hand you're dealt in the beginning but it just feels kinda tedious if you end up with a bad one and the computer just charges ahead giving you no real posibility to catch up.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1441153413, "timestamp_updated": 1441153413, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636263906955718994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17838025": {"recommendationid": "17838025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058251120", "num_games_owned": 899, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1921, "last_played": 1520360392}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is both a puzzle solver and a management tycoon game.

Granted, I am a very slow gamer when it comes to these type of games but still, even if you are a very quick puzzle solver it is going to take some time. In my opinion, the price of this game should have been $15 because then a lot more peope would have bought the game on day 1 instead of waiting until it goes on a sale.\n\nProcessing an ingredient through various types of machines to produce a drug, and while doing so managing the space you are given by placing machines as efficiently as possible is the main mechanic of this game. At the begining of a game you start by producing low level and fairly simple to produce drugs but as game progresses, you will have access to more complex machines and ingredients so you can start making higher level and more complex drugs by using those machines. Missions you can choose from get gradually difficult. You accomplish a mission by reaching the set goal of that particular mission. But if doing missions are not your thing you can also play the game in free build or custom game modes.\n\nOverall, I am enjoying the game so far. If you are into puzzle/management games then this game is for you. Big Pharma also supports modding so it means there will always be some type of content you can add to the game.

The UI and graphics all fit well into this process.\n\nThumbs up for this one, one of the better management/puzzle games released recently!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1441071644, "timestamp_updated": 1441071644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 156, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833851397037506104", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17820586": {"recommendationid": "17820586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133438391", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1441064411}, "language": "english", "review": "Is a slow puzzle game.

Luckily, that's not the case.\n\n   There's far enough depth to raise the game well over the \"casual\" category. At the same time, its elements are completely transparent, so it doesn't overwhelm you with complexity. It could rather overwhelm you with opportunities. If you enjoy putting your brain to some work, this is a game a doctor would prescribe.\n\n Shortly, it perfectly touches the same strings that was touched by good old tycoons you are fond of, adds a surprisingly relevant puzzle element, and flavors the mix with good city sim's spirit of careful planning & continuous improvement. For details, look below.\n\nPART 1. MAKING DRUGS\n   Your goal is to create medicines and make money of them. A complex, profitable medicine usually consists of several components. Making such medicine usually takes many steps: starting an initial mix from a single ingredient and processing the mix through the chain of machinery, changing its concentration and adding other components (in specific order and specific concentrations). Each ingredient has some positive and negative effects. Effects are not just simple \"+\" or \"-\": during different processing, each effect could become stronger or weaker, or changed to another, or be removed at all. A mix of several ingredients, as you can guess, is even more complex and could end as many various intricate compounds.\n   \n   So, making your products is not a straightforward task: there are many methods to make different pills for the very same illness, with various effectivity and side effects. Every production step costs money, so your new creations are usually a compromise between love for humanity and love for money. Plus, when you carefully planned all processing steps and finished your future production line design, you need to fit it into your precious factory space (which is sometimes a puzzle itself). \n\n   Plus, you start with a limited set of ingredients and the most primitive machines, so your first drugs are cheap and will not provide for too long. To advance into new delicious markets, you need to jump quickly into expensive research, which cripples your feeble cash flow. And when each of yourr products finally comes to market, there's another story to tell....\n\nPART 2. MAKING MONEY \n   You can estimate the market size and common price level of drugs for specific ilnesses. So, you can estimate your profits and risks of entering chosen markets, and pick out the best opportunity. You carefully look for needed ingredients and improve your technologies to make the product with minimal cost. Better quality can get you a hefty price bonus. But your product is not evaluated instantly. Only real applications show how good your creation turned out to be. So, only after time, statistics shows how effective the drug is, and how many side effects it caused. The price can fall dramatically if the medicine performs poorly, or causes far too many unpleasant experiences. Wrong formula? Your problem. Does demand for raw materials drive their prices up? Your problem. And don't forget you're not alone here. If your competitors saturate the same market with their products, and prices go down, guess what? You got it. Your problem.\n\n   What's better: to reach after the tastiest pie with a risk that, in a year, every company will also be biting it? Or to look for stable but safe haven in a sector no one is looking at? To rush into selling an untested formula on industrial scale to make some quick money? Or to test all effects in detail and get the best product and ideal production line that will feed you for years? To flood the competitor's market with cheap alternatives to cut its profits (cause I can, baby)?  Or to use the same precious factory space for a new experimental drug? Your choice, and... yeah, your problem.\n\n    \"5 hours of gameplay\" reviewers usually stop at, or even before, this point. People with more patience realize, unexpectedly, that Easy scenarios pack is a well-hidden tutorial extension, and that single \"competitor\" actually was a yawning guide in disguise.\n\nPART 3. MAKING ENEMIES\n   When you move to second scenarios pack, dusty gnomes inside your PC are finally convinced that you got used to the rules, and things start to get serious. \n   \n   The whole new dimension of opportunities: research tree is exploded twice. Equipment which no one has shown you before. New level of formulas you can't even imagine creating without a pen and a paper. Vast number of ways to go. Tremendous amount of things to look into.\n   \n   The whole new level of warfare: margins are thinner. Side effects' combinations are more sophisticated and widespread. Rivals that, you know, look smart, have different characters and can painfully stab you (and each other) in the back. Wow, now I can patent drugs! What, now THEY can patent drugs?!\n   \n   All news are a news from a battlefront. Every day is an exhausting race for future riches and fierce dogfight for scarce resources of today. So, do you enjoy to put your brain to some work? Say again? Sorry, wasn't listening. It's all about stress. Got problems with my Prozac production. The composition is a joke.

Unfortunately, the format of the tutorial feels pretty lazy to me and it suffers for that. Namely, it's rendered almost as an in-game manual. The game really needed an overlay-style tutorial rather than \"OK, now click this widget, whose location on screen we will now describe in words instead of just pointing at it.\" But that's seriously the only criticism of this game I've got and it's easily fixable if the developers wanted to put some time in on it. It's also an issue that you'll quickly forget about once you start getting the hang of things.\n\nSo basically, your job is to make drugs. Drugs need to cure things. Ideally with as few side-effects as possible. But critically, you need your drugs to be profitable. Everything you do to remove side-effects or analyze the ideal mixture and concentrations for your drug ingredients introduces processing costs, which lowers your profitability. Meanwhile your competitors are making drugs that may target the same conditions. If their drug has fewer side-effects, demand for your drug will drop, and with it, the price you can charge for it. Suddenly you have to go back and do all the work you maybe skipped in the interests of profits because your terrible drug was properly recognized in the market as terrible. Unless of course, you patent your drug. Competition sucks. Nobody wants competition.\n\nYou also have some interesting processing challenges around parallelizing the right parts of your pipeline while working within spacing and arrangement constraints. Actually, that's pretty much the core of the game. It's probably one-third budget management and two-thirds arrangement puzzle game that heavily informs the budget management aspect (bad arrangements are unprofitable).\n\nI'll be playing this one for quite awhile.\n\nHonestly, I could also see this game as being quite workable in a multiplayer format and I think multiplayer might be pretty fun.

I don't usually get much into tycoon type games, though I have fond memories of Theme Hospital from a few years back, and I guess Rollercoaster Tycoon, so my experience isn't great to compare this to others in the genre.   That being said, I find this game a great deal of fun.\n\nThere are two core elements to the game;  a Logistical puzzle, and, a decent strategic/business simulator.  I'll cover these separately.\n\nThe first part is what you mostly see in the pretty screenshots - you need to construct assembly lines that transform raw biological substances (insect parts, plants, etc) into finished pharmaceuticals.   There are a good number of different medicines you can manufacture and each one has vastly different requirements.  You need to purchase a variety of machines to transform the product as it moves along the belt from the 'in window' to the exit.   Some machines strengthen effects and some dilute them.  Other machines are used to combine two ingredients, to analyze a finished drug, to modify or rearrange effects, and to package the final product.  All of these machines have different 'in' and 'out' slots that will need to be matched up via conveyor belts in the correct order.   At first this can be a little daunting and frustrating, especially when you attempt to 'upgrade' a drug to a more powerful version, and some trial and error is required.   That said, it's great fun once you learn the basics, and quite rewarding when you smooth everything out.\n\nThe second part of the game is the business sim.  This is probably standard fare for these types of games, but again I'm not experienced enough to provide a good comparison.  In order to succeed you'll need to carefully manage your expenses - buildings and expansions, machines, drug ingredients, research, and exploration all require money, and while you can take out loans, this will quickly sink you if you don't have steady cashflow coming in.   There are competitors who are trying to make a profit as well, and deciding which drugs will provide the best returns can be a challenge.  You must invest time and money into research in order to unlock better machines and make your existing ones more efficient.  You also must send explorers out to discover new substances that can be transformed or combined into new types of drugs.  Random events can have impact on supply and demand as well, so it pays to keep an eye on news popups.\n\nThere is a good tutorial, which introduces you to game concepts as you play so you don't get overwhelmed.  After that, a series of 'missions' of advancing difficulties keeps the game fresh.   I can't speak to the replayability of the game as I'm nowhere near completing the core missions yet, but I believe there Is a sandbox mode once you've mastered all the basics.  The missions themselves can take from 15 minutes to a couple hours, depending on the difficulty and how focused you are.\n\nBig Pharma's art style can be described as cartoony and colorful.  It really reminded me of a less silly version of theme hospital, but aside from the graphics (and upbeat music) there aren't may other similarities between these two games.  One nice feature is the ability to 'paint' your factory - with various primary hues and patterns.  This could be useful to customize different product lines or processes on each line, or just pretty things up to your own tastes.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who enjoys casual business sims and puzzles.  Big Pharma succeeds well at both, and I found it well worth the price of 24.99, though I was fortunate enough to get it on sale.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1440947466, "timestamp_updated": 1440947466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 236, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918703556060791016", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17795031": {"recommendationid": "17795031", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965720584", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2789, "last_played": 1457986402}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll say this is one mind bending game.\n\nCons first:  \nFirst the interface does need a touch up.  The GUI needs work to help navigate from cure start to cure finish along the lines of what you need to do.  At the moment you constantly have to switch between tabs in the GUI to determine the proper course of action to produce your product, fortunately you can pause the game.  It is a bit tedious to do so and I would like to see something more streamlined that allows for easier production of your cure.\n\nSecond, No multiplayer.  You do play against an AI.  The AI's production of similar products  will effect cure pricing and both you and the AI can issue patents to have sole ownership of a cure.  There are world events that dictate supply and demand so it would be great to have multiplayer for the same reasons.  Unfortunately in a multiplayer scenario there would have to be two requirements:  A: Make it turn based to get around the GUI issue, or B: streamline the GUI for faster recognition of steps.\n\nThat's it for cons that I see.\n\nPros:\n\nGame runs very well.  The GUI does look great.  You really feel like a factory floor manager.\nNice graphics.  Everything moves flawlessly around your factory floor going from starting point to A>B>C>D>E sell (Sometimes more steps, sometimes less).\nThe game has an awesome puzzle base to it.  Not only must you solve on how to make your cures effective while mitigating side effects but you must also work out factory logistics to make your factory run efficiently.  Getting things to run efficiently is the harder part in my opinion, since you can pause the game to research your cure development steps.  \nModable, no need to say more.\n\nAll in all I really enjoy it.  It has the right amout of difficulty to frustrate the hell out of you and make you want to come back over and over to try to solve that pesky logistical problem so you can make as much money as possible.  Believe me I have quit several times in my short play time to give my mind the time to solve the problems while not actually sitting and playing.

It holds the isometric view of classic games like Rollercoaster Tycoon while being graphically sleek. As with its tycoon-style roots, it also contains puzzle elements as the equipment you must use act as puzzle pieces that you must fit together in a fixed amount of space.\n\n[h1]So what makes this game appealing?[/h1]\n\nFirstly, it's a management simulation game. If you're as big a fan as Rollercoaster Tycoon as I am, chances are you'll enjoy this game just on the style of the game alone.\n\nAs for how the levels are set up, there are several categories of scenarios each with their own set missions. These categories range from Beginner to Advanced difficulties, along with Quick Play and Crippling Debt categories, the last of which severely handicaps you if you're looking for a challenge!\n\nWhen it comes to dropping into a scenario, the building space and ingredients you have at your disposal are completely randomized. This means you can start the game with a nice area to start building in, or perhaps a not so nice area. It also means that you can have ingredients that induce negative side effects or not. But no fear! You can buy more space with the money you have and discover more ingredients through exploring different biomes for new raw materials to make cures to illnesses with so overcoming a rough start is entirely doable.\n\nExploring for new ingredients is a must as well as researching new methods to manipulate the drugs to turn them into cures. The ingredient system works very well in my opinion. Sometimes you just have to change the concentration of the ingredient to make higher level cures but sometimes you also need to mix it just right with catalysts to make the drug a higher selling product which adds more layers of depth to production.\n\nWith all that, there are also competitors that influence the drug market in their own unique way that isn't the same each time you play. Competitors may release the same drug as you have, saturating the market with supply which brings the price of the drug down a little. So release patents to stop them and hope they don't do the same to you!\n\nThis game, while simple at its core, offers a great managing experience and varying levels of challenge even within each mission through three different win-states. The win-states are like a \"Bronze, Silver, Gold\" medal type system which rewards both casual and hectic play.\n\n[h1]What may users not like about the game?[/h1]\n\nIf you\u2019re like me that wants to try to perfect everything and max out the space you\u2019re given? There's ALWAYS something that requires your attention, requiring you to be ready to do a whole list of things until you end up closing out of the game or pause it to take the dog for a walk. There's no real time to take a step back and admire what you create or take a breather. Even on the beginner levels there are always ways to enhance production, make new production lines, enhance ingredient discovery or research, etc. However, you can choose to take the game slow if you want; there\u2019s nothing stopping you but the goals you set for yourself when you drop in!\n\nAlso just a note, this is one of those games that you need to play the tutorial to really get a good foundation on how to play.\n\nIf you're still indecisive, I've made a small video series of me playing the game trying to reach master level on the game. I jump right into it and explain how everything works and I believe you'll know if it's a game for you within a few minutes of skimming through gameplay.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEx3_SSiCgc\n\nAside from that, have fun making drugs that give people headaches while simultaneously cure migraines!", "timestamp_created": 1440782255, "timestamp_updated": 1440819845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492582827806472778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17756706": {"recommendationid": "17756706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097773850", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 474, "last_played": 1550974523}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a pleasant surprise.

Sure the random nature might mean that the available ingrediants are awesome in one game and suck in the next...but since everybody in the game plays with the same pool of ingrediants, the challenge is to make the most of what is available. \n\nThis is also a part puzzle game as you try to figure out how to cram your more and more complex production lines into a limited space. It can be extremely satisfying to have nearly every square inch of an area filled to the brim with drug machinery humming with their various drug modifying operations. \n\nThe tech tree is laid out in a logical but still strategic manner. Researching techs takes scientists and keeping scientists employed is expensive, so deciding which techs to go for in which order is important. Given the variable ingrediants each game, you aren't going to always want the same path down the tech tree each game. Not to mention you have to weight the options of leaving your scientists idle, which generates research points that are used to upgrade your equipment (making it cheaper to operate) or use them to research new techs, giving you access to brand new equipment or other discounts. \n\nIf you are a fan of business tycoon games at all, this game is for you.

Getting these to work in a fluid manner (maximising profits) is quite challenging and requires a lot of trial and error so i highly recommend after the tutorial loading up the mode which has all the research and drugs unlocked so that you can play around and learn how to create a fluid setup of the machinery and adapt to the different building structures (there are only a few so even though its completely random you will get familiar with each one eventually).\n\nI did read alot of reviews before purchasing this game and a few mentioned the randomness of the drugs you recieve at the start of the game and size of the building being annoying/limiting the ability to play the game. However i dont think this is as much of an issue, the game seems fairly balanced and gives you plenty of time to complete scenarios regardless of the spawn. I can see the spawns being an issue if you are an achievment hunter who wants to complete all the levels on master (the time limit is much much less), however this can be worked around if you just restart the mission a few times so in my opinion the randomness is not a big deal for those who read those reviews and got worried that the game is broken.\n\nI also especially like the addition of a \"global economy\" aspect in relation to the competing companies whereby you need to ensure that the drugs you make are better than theirs by fine tuning them or you will not sell as many units loosing you money or manufacture ones that the ai have not considered thereby creating your own monopoly of the drug (can also be done by patents).\n\nAlso a must have are the mods for this game, only ones i have found so far are the ones supplied by the actual Big Pharma website, they are very useful (example free conveyor belts).\n\nOverall, great game, very challenging and i can see many hours of my life being eaten by it.", "timestamp_created": 1440755644, "timestamp_updated": 1440776348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689469516277313232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17749517": {"recommendationid": "17749517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216991268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 536, "last_played": 1616702435}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh wow - this game is amazing!

You can also set what research you (and all competitors) start with and even what research is disabled in the game (so say you don't want anybody to be able to make patents you can disable patents).\n\nThen you get into settings like map size, event frequency, loan interest rates, plot cost, research speed, scientist saleries, scientiest hire cost, explorer saleries and hire costs, analyzing speed, patent speed, patent cost, cure market size, cure profit margins, starting money, starting loan, ingredient prices, process costs, build costs, research point accrual speed, ingredient point accrual speed, cure rate, infection rate... and all of these things don't have just like 5 settings, they are all sliders that have many many settings even if its not good at informing that well (for example plot cost you could set to where it says low and the first land may cost $500, but then you set it again in low but slightly in a different slider cost and now it costs $480 or $620 for the first one.\n\nBetween the randomly generated buildings, the randomly generated ingredients, the number of custom challenges with 3 ratings that are fairly challenging to get the best rank on, and the sheer customability of custom games, you will find that this game is very replayable even doing the same challenge or even same custom game settings because even with the exact same custom settings the buildings and ingredients are randomly generated each time which also means what the competitors make which effects your profit margins also changes each time.

I had a sneaky suspician that this was going to be a good game (from what I'd researched prior to its launch), but I was surprised to find that it was much better than I had expected.\n\nSee the TL;DR read section at bottom if you want just the quick notes.\n\nI'm trying to keep the in-depth review as brief as possible, but it's very difficult...there's so much to say about this game.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\n[b]1. GAMEPLAY[/b]\n\nYou start, grow, and manage a pharmaceutical company. You control every aspect of it such as production lines, research and development, budget (purchases, importing ingredients, payroll, cost of production), meeting market demand, etc. This is a pharmaceutical tycoon game and it gives you plenty of options and features to run the business as you please or win a scenario as you please. \n\nDesigning the production floor is like a puzzle...but I really hate using that word. It's not a puzzle game. You have to make use of the space you are given (which is a lot so far for me) and plan workflow, but it's much more than that. There are options upon options to consider  The game can be very complex at times, but it also allows the player to keep things simple if they so choose.\n\nThere are 8 Scenarios with 5 missions each. Some missions are specific, some are rather broad.  There's also a custom game feature and a free build option. Together, they allow the player to really play as they want. You can develop highly sophisticated medications or you can deal with simple production lines. It's entirely up to you!\n\n\n[b]2. THE GAME IS POLISHED![/b]\n\nUnlike many indie games, particularly with early access but not exclusive to them, this game is extremely...I mean extremely polished. Everything was very well thought out and organized. Key features were included yet nothing seems to exist that doesn't need to be. ALL the necessary fundamentals you'd expect are here (rare for many games today unfortunately), but many are done exceptionally well and are thus, quite noteworthy. \n\nExamples...\n\n[olist]\n[*]One of the best tutorials I've ever seen in a game - it comes in the form of sections and are repeatable (for those of us who sometimes take a hiatus from a game then return later but forget some of the key controls/mechanics). There are also more in-depth tutorial videos by the dev for those who prefer some serious explanation as to what is going on (most probably won't need it though). The tutorial not only gives you the basics and walks you through the steps (allowing you to learn by doing vs reading a wall-o-text in game), it gives you game strategies such as using dual pill printing and options for varying concentration effects). A lot of thought went into the tutorial here.\n[*]Speed controls - should be standard in every game of this sort...but unfortunately many aren't including it. Pause, play, or speed up time here.\n[*]Ease of controls - you can hold down key to drag belts and it will auto path and connect where you want. Middle mouse copies an existing machine for further placement, double click allows you to move an existing machine, right click sells a machine.\n[*]Convenient linking from one page or pop up to a RELEVANT page or place in the game (such as a an alert for new ingredient having a link to take you to the Ingredients page for convenience if you so choose)\n[*]Animations are very well done and relevant to what is happening (fun to watch)\n[*]Aesthetic customizer - change colors of belts and floors, you can customize your buildings the way you want. \n[*]Contemporary design - very well done design with the gui and game assets. Details like in-game notices are done very well too (sliding from the side at top of page vs simply popping up in the middle of the page or displaying on the right hand side which is what most games seem to do).\n[/olist]\n\nLastly, one of the biggest parts of polish which was noticed...was the lack of any bugs!  I am despearately trying to find some. I know some have to exist. But I so far, have failed to discover any. The game runs smooth and there are no bugs that break immersion or stop gameplay.\n\nThe dev did what most other devs do not do today it seems...he focused on QUALITY. He put a substantial amount of time into the game PRIOR to released. He focused on giving customers a QUALITY project to enjoy by making sure the details were there but also that the game works as it is supposed to. He demonstrated that he actually cares about his own game, his own work.\n\nNovel idea huh? Give the players a quality product they expect to have?\n\n[b]3. DEV ACTIVITY[/b]\n\nFirst of all, this is the work of only 1 developer. He, like most devs used outside sources for assets (graphics, sounds, effects, voice), but 1 guy is the brain behind this game. Very few games can be pulled off successfully by a single dev and this one was.\n\nHe also is very active in his communication with customers (his own forum, social media, and here at the Steam forums). \n\n\n[h1]THE BAD[/h1]\n\nI am still struggling to find something. I honestly am. I've not experienced anything negative about this game yet.\n\nThe only thing I can see wanting to change, is a part in the last tutorial which discusses maximum strength analysis and how to implement it to upgrade a medicine's rating. To me, that's a bit fuzzy. I tried to understand what was being described and how to pull it off, but didn't understand it. That could just be me though. Regardless, it does not prevent the mission from being completed. It just means the user, or me anyway, needs to ask for clarification on the forum.\n\n[h1]SUMMARY / TL;DR[/h1]\n\nHigh quality game, extremely polished, plenty of options and features, a lot of variation, NO BUGS (so far). This game will probably become one of the standards of quality that gamers will compare other games to (like many compare other ea games to Prison Architect or Kerbel).\n\nIn a sea of poorly designed games from devs who don't seem to either care about their products or have the knowledge to make them great...and with the current gaming community's frustration level at an all-time high due to the abundance of bad games and ripoffs coming out on Steam...let this game refresh your faith and trust in the industry as it is proof that high quality games CAN be delivered and some devs DO care about their project and their customers.\n\nIf you enjoy tycoon style games, do yourself a much deserved favor and GET THIS GAME NOW!

The game is more or less about completing scenario's with tiers of set goals and two months ago I made a rather long post on /r/bigpharmagame that explained why it's not done very good well overall.\n\nThe short version is basically everything you need is random. The amount of space you start to build in is random, the drug effects you start with are random, the effects on those drugs are random, the order you unlock new drugs is random, the products your competitors will make are random. The only non-random things are how much money you start with and your overall goal for the scenario. Which leads to many many MANY unwinnable situations, e.g; It's possible to play a scenario were you have to produce certain medicines within a certain time period and random chance will put the drug you need so far down the research list that there's no possible way to even get to it let alone produce anything with it before the time expires.\n\nTo put it into something that most people would understand; pretend your playing StarCraft 2 but the amount of SCV's you started with was random, so was the amount of vespene geysers, mineral patches and how much was in them.  With me so far? So YOU might start with 2 SCV's, 4 vespene geysers and 3 mineral patches, while your opponent starts with 10 SCV's, 2 vespene geysers and 20 mineral patches. Now ontop of that also make all the unit costs and research a random number as well. Do you see why this is bad now?\n\nIt's basically a requirement to restart a scenario over and over again til you get the space and favorable drugs you need if you plan on getting anything but the bronze completion. Even if you get a favorable start, you still might need to end up restarting anyway because you may have had 2 of the drugs you needed for the 3 pills you had to produce but sadly #3 is the very last one your explorers can find.\n\nOverall it's what killed the game for me. If there was set drugs with set effects with set starting positions on the board then I wouldn't have had nearly any of the complaints I did. But overall you spend more time restarting then actually playing the game unless your content to bust your ass for bronze the whole way through, riding the waves of luck.\n", "timestamp_created": 1440696917, "timestamp_updated": 1440696917, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 473, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718572139739990234", "comment_count": 52, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17740658": {"recommendationid": "17740658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006914503", "num_games_owned": 1347, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1452694007}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little game - played it a lot in Alpha.

I'm happy to see it's now on Steam!\n\nBig Pharma is a very unique game. It's best described as a tycoon/management game, mixed with a logistics puzzler or \"product chain\" puzzler, such as SpaceChem, Infinifactory, or Factorio. Your goal is to create and sell cures ranging from cough suppressants to cancer medicine. The creation process is done through a network of machines and conveyor belts that tinker and transform the potency of raw ingredients into the desired cures (often combating undesired side effects).\n\nOften just figuring out how to make a good product is an excellent puzzle in itself, but it's made even more challenging by the ability to perfect the potency of a drug, mix multiple beneficial effects, and remove unwanted side effects. On top of that is a whole financial layer, including an ever-changing market of supply (how much raw ingredients cost) and demand (how badly a cure is needed), further complicated by the competition of rival companies who can drive up ingredient costs, compete for similar cures, and even try to patent certain drugs to prevent others from selling them temporarily. All this is mixed with a large research tree and an interesting procedurally generated list of unlockable ingredients that need to be researched and experimented with in order to advance your company.\n\nSound complex? It is! This game is not a casual experience. As a management game, it strives to be more similar to older \"Tycoon\" games of the 90's and early 2000's, where succeeding financially is a genuine challenge and there's very little hand-holding when it comes to how to get there. At the same time, the game is definitely in the same vein of puzzle games like the aforementioned SpaceChem; a production puzzle game with no single \"right\" answers, but millions of wrong ones. Arranging the differently shaped machines and placing conveyor belts is as tricky as trying to figure out the correct combination to make the desired product. But, like the best  of both of those genres, as hard as they are, Big Pharma is actually very easy to learn once you wrap your head around its new ideas, and the payoff is countless ultra-satisfying \"I'm a freakin' genius!\" moments. The most important thing to note? The tutorial is NOT optional for a new player, and since it's a bit of a wall of text, I imagine that might put some people off.\n\nIn terms of aesthetic, I absolutely adore the game. The music is absolutely perfect for the subject matter, the UI is one of the cleanest and most functional I've ever seen, and like most good factory-themed games, seeing your products  move down conveyor belts and through wacky machines en mass is an absolute delight.\n\nMy only worry with the game at the time of writing is that it might have released just slightly too early. For the most part it's fully functional, but there are still a few bugs here and there, and it felt like the balance of things like competitor productivity and patents were still trying to be worked out when the game was released. So far, I've found nothing remotely game-breaking and it's definitely more functional than many things released on Steam, but I'm sure it still could use a few patches (there's also whispers of modding support that might expand the game in the future).\n\nOverall, Big Pharma is definitely my kind of game. I'd say it's a must-buy for anyone who likes production puzzlers like SpaceChem or Infinifactory, and a good buy for those who have fond memories of old Tycoon games (with a thematic boost to anyone who loved the game Theme Hospital).
