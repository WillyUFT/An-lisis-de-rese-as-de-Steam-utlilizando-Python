When a dude sticks banana to a wall and calls it a high art. And then, there are also hundreds of aesthetes and refined intellectuals nearby, who examine this 'art' via their monocles, just to make categorical proclamation: YES! True art! Unprecedented! Brave! Innovative!\n\nAnd of course, there are common people as well. Thousands of common bystanders, who have no idea what's going on here. But since everyone around calls it an art, they are either too shy or too scared to admit that they do not see anything brilliant here. What if the game is too intellectual and they are simply not wise enough to understand this work of art?\n\nBut I'm totally shameless bastard. If I do not see or do not understand something - I'll admit it right away. People in their positive reviews may troll or hide behind abstruse and philosophical statements as much as they want. But if you put off your rainbow glasses, you will see that this 'game' is absolutely hollow inside.\n\nI can already see how these refined connoisseurs are trying to poke their golden canes into my face, claiming that it is more than a mere game - it's an [b] Experience! [/b] Senseless wandering in the same empty corridors dozens of times, just to trigger another ending - that's your experience.\n\nOh man, what an absolutely fascinating endings await you. For example, you casually walk into the room and just get locked. That's an ending. Very deep, right? How about this one: you decide to go down to parking lot, then - Bam! Black screen, you are dead and random woman stands at your body. Very thought provoking, don't you think so? Other endings are just as great.\n\nI unlocked 6-9 endings I guess. I can't say for sure because it is hard to identify if it really was an ending or not. For example, in one case you get locked in a room and get some spiteful comment from the narrator. In another case - you get locked, but nothing happens. Was it bug? Feature? Level 9000 post meta irony? - no idea. And honestly, no desire to wander in these corridors again. Have you ever encountered bugs in any other game? Got soft locked or stuck in a texture/wall/closed room? Turns out it should be considered as something deep, philosophical or thought provoking.\n\nAlso, there is no reasonable way to discover these endings - all you have to do, just wander around making random choices, until you trigger another narrator's commentary. Oh, sorry, did I say choices? All you choose here in most cases, just what door to enter. \n\nYou choose the door on the right, move forward, walk around - bad ending. You choose door on the right, then come back and choose the one on the left - 'wife' ending. You go down to parking lot - you are dead. You go upstairs to the 'boss' - you are on the way to 'right' ending. Then, out of blue, the game gives you an option to choose escape/suicide ending (just like in Portal)... Why here? Why now? What's so special about this bunch of 'choices'? - No idea.\n\nWon't deny, initially it seemed rather intriguing. Sometimes even funny. But everything became dull or even annoying very soon. As if you are listening some not very funny stand up comic. From time to time you get a good joke here and there, but most of the time you put forced smile on your face, just out of politeness.\n\nNarrator's voice is so overconfident and so patronizing, while the game has nothing that could justify such bravado. No coherent story, no interesting characters, no gameplay, no puzzles... The game boasts via achievements how 'they disabled jumping', but it seems like they also disabled any possible interactivity here. Source engine, but nothing to interact with. \n\nConclusion. Stanley Parable has some good ideas. In certain endings/sketches you can really feel how these ideas could grow into something bigger or even in separate game. Unfortunately these ideas just remained as ideas without any meaningful development. If you will evaluate the game for what it actually is, instead of what you were told it is - you will see that it is just few hours of boring walking-talking and few lulz.", "timestamp_created": 1700696747, "timestamp_updated": 1700696747, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540751278400421143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151162750": {"recommendationid": "151162750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028264916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1554660306}, "language": "english", "review": "Weird surreal brilliance.", "timestamp_created": 1700687405, "timestamp_updated": 1700687405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151112479": {"recommendationid": "151112479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118877451", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1700677141}, "language": "english", "review": "i like the game its fun", "timestamp_created": 1700677222, "timestamp_updated": 1700677222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151046630": {"recommendationid": "151046630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198443770232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 180, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1700666200}, "language": "english", "review": "Philosophy in the form of a video game.

asked about a singular video-game that truly and best encapsulates the essence of what makes video-games as a whole a truly unique type of art, it would be Stanley Parable. Many games, both future and past, claim that they are the most \"original\" or \"unique\" or \"never-seen-before\" but none have been able to deliver on it in the way this masterpiece has. Welcome to Stanley Parable, an unassuming, seemingly boringly normal game that, after a closer look, is experience like no other, for you can never be sure, how much you are playing it and how much it is playing you. Only one way to find out.\n\n[h1] [i] \u201cBut they didn't understand that the game was never meant to be funny, it was meant to have a point. It was meant to speak to the human condition. 'But where are the jokes? Where are the jokes?' they bemoaned. They screamed, they gnashed their teeth and said 'entertain us'. It wasn't enough, they had to leave their pathetic little thumbs down review. But then 'He's talking too much' they said 'First, he didn't entertain us and now he won't shut up!' It's the inconsistency, it's the lack of accountability! It's the unwillingness to examine with an uncompromising heart the words that they are speaking into the world. As though there were no consequences for a lack of cohesion in one's assessment of others!\u201d [/i] [/h1]\n\nStanley Parable is game that impossible to begin to describe. Closest to it is to imagine Valve's Portal, set in an office environment, minus the portal gun and with GladOS replaced by a confused story-teller shaping the story based on your inputs and one who genuinely means well but one who messes up frequently. I love how this is, in essence, a D&D office adventure with the most confused (yet also the most intriguing) DM you can imagine. It's just something else, honestly.\n\nThe main aspect that made Stanley Parable the legend it is today is, without a doubt, its sheer amount of choices and branching paths. You can at any point decide to go off narrator's script and the game (and in that vein, him) will adapt - for better or for worse. Pair that with brilliantly written monologue captivatingly narrated by the talented Kevan Brighting and what you get is a game that you WILL want to restart over and over and over, just to see how you can break it or break narrator's spirit but scr*wing up every single one of his requests. For the end is never the end...\n\nIf there was ever a video-game I think I could recommend to absolutely anyone, Stanley Parable would be it. You can know comprehend it's both intended and unintended genius until you try it out for yourself.\n\n[h1] [b] [u] Positives & Negatives [/u] [/b] [/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[th][b] [i] Positives [/i] [/b][/th]\n\t[th][b] [i] Negatives [/i] [/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]+ Pioneer of one of the most interesting concepts in gaming history[/td]\n\t[td]- I genuinely have nothing - the game accomplishes EXACTLY what it's developers set out to do without a hitch[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]+ The seemingly limitless number of choices altering the whole story to smaller or larger extent[/td]\n\t[td][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]+ Simply, yet efficient art-style and graphics \u2013 ordinary yet elegant[/td]\n\t[td][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]+ The narrator\u2019s voice actor does a truly spiffing job \u2013 honestly, I could listen to the guy reading a bloody dictionary and enjoy it[/td]\n\t[td][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]+ The brilliance of the writing is not lost on anyone who has given this game a try[/td]\n\t[td][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1700215054, "timestamp_updated": 1700215054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150257481": {"recommendationid": "150257481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054483263", "num_games_owned": 4557, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 1519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1475, "playtime_at_review": 1519, "last_played": 1700025898}, "language": "english", "review": "I 100% the achievements for this game.

I truly recommend this game because this is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee #427. Employee #427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee #427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy. And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Stanley; Something he would never quite forget. He had been at his desk for nearly an hour when he had realized not one single order had arrived on the monitor for him to follow. No one had shown up to give him instructions, call a meeting, or even say 'hi'. Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.

Honestly, even though I've now gone through all of the endings (yes, including the super tedious baby game) I still find myself wanting to play it again. I think the simplicity of it really appeals to me. I walk the same path over and over, but i still stop to let the narrator finish narrating. Now, as for whether I do that for the sake of not breaking the ambiance or if I do it because I like the voice, that's a question for another day. \n\nI would 100% recommend this to my friends if I wasn't already the only one in my friend group who hasn't played it yet... so I guess all that I can do now is recommend it to you! If you enjoy listening to a middle-aged man getting frustrated at you for not following directions, this is the game for you! Inversely, if you enjoy following the instructions of a middle-aged man, this game could also fit your standards!\n\n(This is my first ever review, please don't bash me too hard lmao)", "timestamp_created": 1695121299, "timestamp_updated": 1695121299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146554224": {"recommendationid": "146554224", "author": {"steamid": "76561199491066490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1378, "last_played": 1686093720}, "language": "english", "review": "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE STANLEY PARABLE.\n\nI was excited to play this game when I found out my dad owned it. I had watched an hour and 11 minutes of Markipliers full game-play of The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe, then some of his older game-play videos of this original version. I fell in love immediately.\n\nI remember sometime in the past, hearing my father mention getting the \"Go Outside\" achievement on The Stanley Parable. I had no clue what it was at the time, but the memory resurfaced very recently (as in like, 3 or 4 days ago recently) when I put two and two together. Wow, I actually use my braincells? Unfathomable. Moving along, this game is absolutely wonderful.\n\nFirst off, the concept is just absolutely incredible. I know there are many parable games, but I'd personally say The Stanley Parable takes it to a whole other LEVEL with how just- AWESOME it is! And the amount of endings? That's true just... artwork! Not to mention Kevan's absolutely wonderful voice acting of the Narrator? How does The Stanley Parable have absolutely everything I've ever wanted... in one game alone?\n\nAlso, god I can't even express the love I have for the more serious endings. The Zending? Made me cry. Like, genuine, not kidding, made me cry. That's how you can tell its a good game, you know? An ending of a parable game getting you so worked up you cry, hah.\n\nI love the relationship between the Narrator and Stanley. It's almost like a friendly rivalry in a sense, if you put it into words, except you really can't. Another thing, that's how you know it's good writing, when there's something you aren't even able to describe, ya know what I mean? \nI've barely mentioned The Stanley Parable ; Ultra Deluxe Edition this whole review, but that does make sense, as you know, I am currently reviewing specifically The Stanley Parable. \n\nBut, The Stanley Parable ; Ultra Deluxe? Absolutely awesome. The amount of more endings it introduced with the bucket is awesome, even if in my own opinion some of the re-writings of classic endings (I say this like I played it in 2013) were kind of shitty, it is overall awesome to get so much more content. SPEAKING OF CONTENT the whole new content with the Narrator was hilarious- but I'm straying from the review of The Stanley Parable if I go in depth, because then it would really be a review of The Stanley Parable ; Ultra Deluxe, which I don't even own, so I'll stop myself there.\n\nEven though I did stop myself describing The Stanley Parable ; Ultra Deluxe in detail, does not mean that is the end of it's section in this review. It was a wonderful re-release; actually I'd say one of the best in video game history (but I'm extremely bias because it is the way I found The Stanley Parable, and not to mention it is also my favorite re-release in video game history), so I'll leave it at just saying it, truly, didn't disappoint.\n\nI don't know how to end this review- so I suppose I'll end it here as of now. I've only played 20 hours of the game as of now, but I'm sure that I'll have many more soon. I hope you enjoyed reading this, cause I enjoyed writing this! I'll probably update this minorly (or majorly, it depends) in the future, but I don't think my opinion will change of this game at all.\n\nI love The Stanley Parable.

I am mostly annoyed that I didn't get the Ultra Deluxe edition. I will get it today and review that in ten years' time, I guess.

That's bizarre.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much to the kind people who gave my review an award. I just got an email from Steam notifying me about them. As an added bonus, it's Monday morning, and of course I forgot to play this on Tuesday three weeks ago.

mash-up of all the hilarious moments from Family Guy. It's a mind-bending adventure that takes you on a wild ride through an office building, just like that time Peter became a private investigator in \"Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story.\"\n\nAs you play through The Stanley Parable, you'll feel like you're living in Quahog, with all the quirky characters and absurd situations. It's like that time Peter and the gang found a talking tree in the woods and had to save it from being cut down in \"Road to the Multiverse.\" You never know what's coming next, and that's what makes it so frickin' hilarious.\n\nThe game is full of choices, just like when Peter had to decide between a boat and a mystery box in \"I'm Peter, Hear Me Roar.\" Each decision you make leads you down a different path, and just like in that episode, you never know if you made the right choice until it's too late. It's like living out a Family Guy episode in real time!\n\nOne of the best parts of The Stanley Parable is the narrator. He's like Stewie, always narrating and commenting on your every move. It's like when Stewie narrated Brian's life in \"Brian Griffin's House of Payne.\" The narrator in The Stanley Parable guides you through the game, but just like Stewie, he can also mess with you and lead you into hilarious and unexpected situations.\n\nThe humor in The Stanley Parable is off-the-charts, just like when Peter had that epic fight with the giant chicken. It's a rollercoaster of laughs, like when Peter joined the rodeo and became a bull rider in \"Save the Clam.\" The game constantly breaks the fourth wall and challenges your expectations, just like Family Guy always does.\n\nIn conclusion, The Stanley Parable is a frickin' awesome adventure that will keep you laughing and guessing at every turn. It's like having your own Family Guy episode that you get to play and control. So grab your Pawtucket Patriot Ale and get ready for a wild ride that'll have you saying, \"Freakin' sweet!\"", "timestamp_created": 1686970913, "timestamp_updated": 1686970913, "voted_up": true,

With its clever writing, branching paths, and meta-commentary on player agency, this game pushes the boundaries of the medium, leaving players questioning their choices and the nature of their own free will.\n\nAt its core, The Stanley Parable is an exploration of choice and control. Players assume the role of Stanley, an office worker who finds himself in a seemingly ordinary office environment. As Stanley, you are guided by a witty and omnipresent narrator, whose every word serves to influence and manipulate your actions. The brilliance of the game lies in the multitude of choices presented to the player, each with unpredictable consequences and narratives that twist and turn in unexpected ways.\n\nThe writing in The Stanley Parable is exceptional. The narrator's voice, delivered with impeccable timing and tone, adds a layer of dark humor and intrigue to the experience. The game's dialogue is filled with existential musings, philosophical ponderings, and self-aware commentary that constantly challenges the player's perception of their role and the nature of the game itself. It is a narrative tour de force that rewards multiple playthroughs, as each path offers unique insights and revelations.\n\nThe game's visual design is minimalistic yet effective. The stark office environments, with their repetitive corridors and monotonous color schemes, serve as a backdrop to the mind-bending narrative. The attention to detail in each scene, coupled with the occasional surreal moments, adds to the atmosphere of mystery and disorientation.\n\nThe Stanley Parable thrives on its branching paths and multiple endings. Each decision you make branches the story in new and unexpected directions, leading to a wide variety of outcomes. The game deliberately plays with your expectations, subverting traditional storytelling conventions and defying the constraints of linear narratives. It invites experimentation, curiosity, and exploration, as you attempt to uncover the various hidden endings and secrets that lie within the game's intricate web of choices.\n\nOne potential downside for some players is the lack of traditional gameplay elements. The Stanley Parable focuses more on interactive storytelling and exploration rather than action or puzzle-solving. It is an experience that prioritizes narrative and player agency over traditional game mechanics. However, for those who appreciate thought-provoking experiences and unconventional storytelling, this approach becomes one of the game's greatest strengths.\n\nIn conclusion, The Stanley Parable is an exceptional game that challenges the very notion of player agency and narrative design. Its clever writing, branching paths, and meta-commentary on choice and control create a truly unique and immersive experience. The game's thought-provoking nature lingers long after you've finished playing, sparking discussions and introspection. If you're seeking a game that defies conventions and offers an intellectual journey, The Stanley Parable is an absolute must-play. Prepare to question everything you thought you knew about video game storytelling.", "timestamp_created": 1686681005, "timestamp_updated": 1686681005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

As a Switch owner of Ultra Deluxe, consider this a semi-short review/description of both versions this time around.\n\nTo describe it in a few, easy-to-remember sentences, The Stanley Parable is a first-person exploration game. Well\u2013actually, far more of an experience than a game, being a blend of humor and self-awareness with an equal amount of dread, heart, and emotionality. Like most games in its nature, TSP has many moments left to interpretation. Very, VERY little is \u2018explained\u2019 per say, and that is one of its best traits; everyone will come out of the same ending differently. Especially so with Ultra Deluxe\u2019s new content, which creates an even bigger blend between, let\u2019s say, \u2018treats and trauma\u2019 in a way I love dearly.\nLet\u2019s not even forget to mention the incredible Kevan Brighting as The Narrator, who I very much know is the highlight for many players. For good reason.\n\nSo, how shall you and a close mutual play this game? In my opinion, play it by yourself on the console of your choosing\u2013with you in complete silence\u2013and when you\u2019re done, show it to a friend who also hasn\u2019t played it (If you liked it, of course). Let the The Stanley Parable guide you, then let yourself become the guide.\n\nThe Stanley Parable (And Ultra Deluxe all the more) is a passion project, and I will forever see it as such. Everyone involved is incredibly talented, and I wish everyone the best.\nFrom the ashes of depravity rises the phoenix of quality.", "timestamp_created": 1682628813, "timestamp_updated": 1682628813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514824807643890381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137385233": {"recommendationid": "137385233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101276047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1693335737}, "language": "english", "review": "I did go outside afterwards", "timestamp_created": 1682623873, "timestamp_updated": 1682623896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535761892795562744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137380174": {"recommendationid": "137380174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138146080", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 2424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2424, "last_played": 1640897735}, "language": "english", "review": "How can one voice actor be so captivating and enhance such a simple game so much?

The game's narrative structure is non-linear and unpredictable, allowing players to explore various branching paths and endings based on their decisions and actions.\n\nOne of the standout features of the game is its clever use of narration and voice acting, which guides and comments on the player's choices and movements throughout the game. The narrator's voice is smooth, calming, and sometimes unsettling, adding an extra layer of depth and intrigue to the game's overall atmosphere.\n\nAnother strength of \"The Stanley Parable\" is its ability to challenge players' expectations and assumptions. The game constantly subverts and plays with traditional game mechanics and storytelling conventions, leading to some unexpected and hilarious moments.

The game carries themes such as choice in video games, the relationship between a game creator and player, and predestination/fate.\n\nIn the game, the player guides a silent protagonist named Stanley alongside narration by British actor Kevan Brighting. As the story progresses, the player is confronted with diverging pathways. The player may contradict the narrator's directions, which if disobeyed will then be incorporated into the story. Depending on the choices made, the player will encounter different endings before the game resets to the beginning.\n\nThe Stanley Parable was originally released on 31 July 2011, as a free modification for Half-Life 2 by Wreden. Together with Pugh, Wreden later released a stand-alone remake using the Source engine under the Galactic Cafe studio name. The remake recreated many of the original mod's choices while adding new areas and story pathways, as well as overhauling the game's graphics entirely. It was announced and approved via Steam Greenlight in 2012, and was released on 17 October 2013, for Microsoft Windows. Later updates to the game added support for macOS on 19 December 2013, and for Linux on 9 September 2015.

mental health.\n\tThe great thing about this game specifically is the narrator. He constantly speaks to you, or in the context of the game, \u201cstanley\u201d, and guides you along the way. His clear mental instability will make you feel better about your own life. Though there may be some emotional and quite frankly goofy and silly parts along the way, the second you close your computer those problems don\u2019t exist anymore. The stanley parable is like a sadness sponge. It makes you a little bit sadder, then stops and takes some of the pre existing unhappiness with it when you stop playing.\nAlthough it is a bit of an emotional roller coaster (as i previously mentioned), the narrator can still be a nice person. He is silly and quite frankly goofy at times. I think if he had a body or any physical form for that matter, the first thing he would do would be a very silly dance to the adventure line music. He is very nice. Well, sometimes. Other times he explodes you. But only if you deserve it.\nOnly if you deserve it.\n2: It has something for everyone.\nDo you like horror games? The whole game is eerie and uncomfortable at times, constantly making you wonder when the narrator will just snap and brutally murder you. He can. And has. Even the loading screen, reading \u201cthe end is never\u201d over and over again is unsettling.\nDo you like sweet calming games that bring you joy? As I have mentioned previously, the narrator brings joy and silliness. He is a very chipper fellow, who wants to share his story with you. Do not make him sad if you want him to stay silly. Warning: He will not stay silly when sad. He will get angry.\nLike scythe, (the perfect book) it wonderfully mixes every genre. Aside from romance. Actually, there are enough narrator simps that I\u2019d say it qualifies. The game has an ending for everyone. There are multiple endings, based on how you play. Pro tip- you have to get a little off track to get the fun endings! You have to be adventurous and also somewhat silly to correctly play.\nYou can play with friends. If they\u2019re in your house or on call with you, of course, because stanley is the only player. The narrator makes the game worth playing, because of the sheer volume of goofiness he adds to the plot. Which he created. It is truly a game worth playing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1676080335, "timestamp_updated": 1676080335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132569138": {"recommendationid": "132569138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034255569", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1676072247}, "language": "english", "review": "kind of a classic\n\n\n\nhonestly, i feel like i should really like this but for some reason it just doesn't strike a chord with me. sure, it gets a few chuckles, and it certainly smart game design and everything. you should definitely play it.\nbut other games, such as dr. langeskov or how fish is made, are in a similar niche and more enjoyable to me.", "timestamp_created": 1676072432, "timestamp_updated": 1676072432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132547355": {"recommendationid": "132547355", "author": {"steamid": "76561199213307608", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1673270319}, "language": "english", "review": "well, Time to wait 5 years.

I started, finished, and saw all of the game endings over 7 hours today.  Replayability is minimal once you've beaten it, so I probably won't play this one again.

At the time, it provoked many unique feelings through its separate paths. It was a unique, ground-breaking experience at time of launch, even as a Half Life mod, now polished as a stand-alone game with extra content - not to mention the \"sequel\".

After an introduction to the world and a quick walk through some office spaces, the narrator states \"When Stanley came to a set of two open doors, he entered the door on his left.\" However, you the player have just entered the room and both doors are open. This room is the start of your path of choices of following the story or diverting from it.

intended to offend anybody. I'm just putting out my view so people like me would understand what's going on and would not try this humiliation (of course in our perception). Because for me that was, so be wary of the number of good reviews for this game. Although we are the statistical minority in the gaming community I should warn my kind because ohh... this was harsh.\n\nI personally see this game as an insult to people who've never before seen the extent humans could admire the breaking of the 4-eth wall. When it's done well - a lot of people really enjoy it for some strange reason. Like they are looking for not a world to immerse in but have a need for a world that would demonstrate attention to them and thus they would recognize the world as a real one. Unfortunately, in the world of gamers, a disability to empathize with fantasy to the extent of almost real-life experience is a common thing. I guess you could explain it through the socialization most of them had. A lot of people who dislike the outside and have a lot of time to play the games could be less empathetic than those who behave otherwise. Or maybe they wish to live another way but are afraid/physically incapable. So they will often perceive suffering as a normal part of life, for themselves and for others. Of course, no experience is necessary in cases of psychopathy and sociopathy, but those are exceptions in the population at present. No wonder, the game that laughs at your attempts and the wish to get the true ending encouriging you to do it at the same time but gives the satisfaction of the 4-eth wall breaking is \"very positive\" for most here.\n\nNo, thanks, I have vr games for the wall breaking where I need to and on demand. The Stanley Parable is a beautiful piece of manifestation of meaninglessness. The key is that a good story could be more immersive than a real one. And the true magic and potential of computer games are in the number of tools to make the story even more vibrant. A nice sound that matches the visual style, scriptwriters who are passionate to bring a new living experience for you, which allows you to grow as a human being, to fill your heart. This is the way I see story-rich games and this is a laugh at those who like stories regardless of the numbers of their dimensions.", "timestamp_created": 1668901673, "timestamp_updated": 1668901673, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486256718635559082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125779866": {"recommendationid": "125779866", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970496685", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1669327536}, "language": "english", "review": "Download the demo 1st, or you may feel like you wasted your $$ as I did.

Being an overall annoyance, I obviously immediately did not do what I was told, leading to some fun, and also rather sinister outcomes for Stanley.

The gameplay is simple, with you, some dude in an office, wandering about trying to figure out the situation he's been put in. You're followed by a narrator, who of course comments on everything you do.\n\nThe narrator is the means through which the 'point' of the game is established, that being the themes of choices in video games and even fate if you will. However, setting aside the fact that the narrator is unfunny and annoying, the themes that the game focuses on are nothing revolutionary. Even when the player controls Stanley (the protagonist) to do something that goes against the narrator's instructions, the player will find that the narrator still has relevant voicelines. This is meant to raise the question of whether the player really had a choice at all, relating to the themes mentioned earlier. \n\nHowever, I think that this theme falls flat in the game. Because of course you have a choice in games. For example, you can either go through the left door or the right door, even if there is some other force (like an annoying narrator) telling you to pick one over the other. However, although you can choose which door to go through, you cannot really pick the game ending you get, unless the game mechanic is very straightforward (i.e. 'good' choices = good ending, 'bad' choices = bad ending). The whole \"what if you actually can't choose in vidya geam\" thing the game tries to pull is stupid because obviously games plan for a player's choices, because it's in the fucking code. At the end of the day, you have to choose something, because that's how games work. In the Stanley Parable, you can choose your actions, just not the ending, because you're not a dev and obviously can't change the fucking game itself. I have a grand total of 66 minutes in this game, enough to get 2 different endings, but it took me about 5 minutes to figure out what the game was trying to do. I thought it was boring and pointless. Other games, and even other forms of media such as books or movies, have handled the idea of 'freedom of choice' in much more interesting and engaging ways than this game.\n\nThis of course ties in to the gameplay itself. I think the game is boring, and although I might be biased because I much prefer fast paced games with good combat, I fail to see how anyone could enjoy what is effectively a walking simulator with some guy commenting on your boring, dumb walking. The game is pretty much an interactive audiobook, except the book in question is some boring work you had to read in the 6th grade, dumb enough for even a 12 year old to understand. The game provides no new insight on the concept of freedom of choice, and certainly does not try to go beyond a surface-level analysis of the theme in question, much like a 12 year old writing an analytical essay on The Great Gatsby might do. Therefore, the game is uninteresting. This is not to say i do not enjoy dialogue heavy games. Although it may be a strange comparison, since rdr2 and Stanley are two very different games trying to achieve very different things, when sitting on my horse as Arthur for many minutes at a time listening to him and the other characters speak i never felt bored or uninterested, because the dialogue was actually engaging. In the Stanley parable however, all you have is the narrator talking at you for hours, which is great if you're having trouble falling asleep at night because it is just like one long class lecture. You could argue that rdr2 is different because there are more than two characters, but it is absolutely possible to write a single character monologuing and making their monologue actually interesting and engaging, which is something that the Stanley parable failed to do. \n\nOverall, i do not understand the praise that this game gets, and i certainly do not understand the people who say that it is revolutionary or thought-provoking. Maybe if i was a middle schooler i would think that way, but unfortunately, the passage of time is unstoppable. And again, the gameplay is pretty much just a walking simulator, and the smug narrator only adds insult to injury (although the voice acting is pretty good I'll give it that). At the end of the day though, the game is clearly not for me, and I'm sure that for others, they may consider this to be the best game of all time, somehow. That said, I would still strongly recommend people to please go play a game that actually has interesting dialogue and manages to explore it's different themes in provoking and engaging ways instead.", "timestamp_created": 1662840689, "timestamp_updated": 1662840689, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481919199228286743", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122002710": {"recommendationid": "122002710", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999880221", "num_games_owned": 776, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1662780200}, "language": "english", "review": "I waited five years for the achievement and I am waiting to see how the game is going to tell me I am a tool for it.", "timestamp_created": 1662766829, "timestamp_updated": 1662766829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121995869": {"recommendationid": "121995869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121212937", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1662754951}, "language": "english", "review": "Positive review.", "timestamp_created": 1662755019, "timestamp_updated": 1662755019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121963321": {"recommendationid": "121963321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032487124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1667858878}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a delight.

This involves a sort of subtle exploration of the power dynamics between the creator and consumer of interactive art. The Stanley Parable is a walking simulator where the character's decision to follow or ignore the narrator's directions determines which of the many possible endings occur. Galactic Cafe does not seem to lay out a single authoritative claim on any of these matters and instead lets the player form their own thoughts on the matter after seeing the complex discussion laid out across the many endings. The art and music is simple, almost minimalist, but it is well suited to telling the branching story and carrying its messages. \n\nThe Stanley Parable isn't just an art project though: it also seeks to entertain the audience through its absurd comedy. It's always funny to see how the narrator reacts when Stanley causes mischief by not doing what he is told to do. The sarcastic dialogue, surreal situations, and satirical observations add a dry, subtle humor to everything that manages to continually surprise you. I would heavily recommend The Stanley Parable to anyone interested in the philosophy of narrative design or creative approaches to comedy in video games. \n\nAlso, the Broom Closet is ending is my favorite.

Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was employee number 427. Employee number 427\u2019s job was simple: he sat at his desk in room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what employee 427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul \nrending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And \nStanley was happy... And then one day, something very peculiar happened, something that would forever change Stanley, something he would never quite forget.

As Stanley walked through a narrow hallway he came to a room with 2 doors and he decided to take the door on his left. Stanley went through the conference room but nobody was there either.

The gold in this game comes from the humor, and when it's funny, god-damn the game is funny. Almost every time the game made me laugh, I nearly had to put the controller down and hold my head in my hands. I couldn't even get the air out fast enough most of the time. But those moments are experienced once, and then probably not again, considering the layout of the game. And even if they were experienced again, well, jokes get stale the more you tell them.\n\nAs for the to-do list, following the Narrator or not following the Narrator, or purposefully contradicting the Narrator all amount to the same thing: you find an ending, and the game is restarted. Although you can \"beat\" the game, there is no winning. Hopefully in the last iteration you found some of that comedy gold, but in many of the paths you can take, you probably won't. Also there's a bajillion different endings to the game, and some of the endings require other endings to be completed first, and to find all the endings, you have to read the wiki as much as you would for a souls game or Elden Ring. So yeah, 70% to-do list.\n\nThe humor in this game, when you find it, is absolutely incredible, but to be honest, finding all the endings yourself is not going to happen unless you have way too much time on your hands, and reading the wiki takes the fun out of it. I haven't played the Ultra-Deluxe yet, but probably won't touch it for a few months until my lack of enthusiasm for this game fades.

I think i got a bad order... i got 0 payoff except for the [spoiler]museum[/spoiler] ending.\n\nThe one lone fact that this is a very boring game and is that the most fun you can have was walking in the [spoiler] museum where they showed stuff from development that never made that cut.[/spoiler]\n\nThis game is interesting and new experience for about an hour. Very interesting in fact because its novel one for me but then it falls off a damn cliff due to being the same thing over and over and over and over and over which starts to grate on your mind something fierce. Its loads and loads of wait time and repetitive walking until you may attempt a slight variation again at the end. Nothing ever changes in the journey. Its all at the end and often it doesnt really change anything except what you would expect if that makes sense?\n\nInstead of an engaging experience you are filled with boredom knowing you have to wait through all the same stuff over and over and over and over and do the same stuff repetitively in hopes of maybe getting to a spot when you might get a new outcome if you slightly attempt something. Which is a horrific experience to me.\n\nI wish the narration wouldnt start (or better yet have an indication) if it was something you had already heard once and already remember. What you enjoyed the first time, found ok the 2nd and 3rd time but at the 4th time and beyond started to actively hate what the game was doing. This really taints the experience.\n\nTaking your time and exploring and looking around is not rewarded in any way from what I could tell and that is what I love about games. You can hardly interact with anything nor have an effect on anything except by slowly walking there. You press a button at an intersection and get one ending. Do the same shit again then get the second ending. You just suffer mental anguish in between every single attempt because there is nothing new happening in between. Just suffering.\n", "timestamp_created": 1657168357, "timestamp_updated": 1657168357, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.404349833726882935", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118365699": {"recommendationid": "118365699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111678291", "num_games_owned": 2224, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1657166832}, "language": "english", "review": "Stanley kept pushing buttons", "timestamp_created": 1657167228, "timestamp_updated": 1657167228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485915511846542358", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118364153": {"recommendationid": "118364153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084401249", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1647658131}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is more than a walking simulator, it is a comedy.

So, what is The Stanley Parable, you might be asking? Well, it's a game about choice, simple as that. However, while you might associate \"choice\" gameplay with games like Life is Strange, or with visual novels, this isn't like that.\n\nNo, The Stanley Parable is a first person game, and one of the earliest walking simulators. I've been a fan of this game (or is it a franchise now?) since its original mod release, and it's been great seeing it evolve over the years. The story is rather simple, or complex, depending on your choices. The game basically tells the story of Stanley, or Employee 427, who worked in an office. One day, he discovers that all his coworkers have disappeared, and thus decides to explore the office building in search of answers. As he moves through the office, he reaches the game's core: the two doors. A simple concept, choosing left or right, that this game manages to explore in incredible depth.\n\nAll throughout the game, there's a secondary character, the Narrator. As his name implies, he's the one narrating the story, and thus, guiding Stanley's (and the player's) actions. However, going back to the two doors mentioned above, the player can choose to ignore the Narrator and figuratively wrestle with him for control of the story, the more you progress through the game, the more options that begin to show up, leading to a great deal of replayability as you try to get all the different endings. All this accompanied by the Narrator's hilarious dialogue.\n\nThe writing is superb, and I can't state this with enough emphasis; while the only speaking character is the Narrator, as mentioned above, almost all his dialogue is hilarious, though there are some somber moments here and there. Visually speaking, it looks pretty good. The office's design has been updated from its mod release, and some new areas, related to new endings, have been added. Gameplay wise, it's very simple: you walk and interact with certain objects; as it is a very heavily story-driven game, there's not much else to do, no fancy shooting or parkour sections, but they aren't needed. Finally, the soundtrack, while minimalistic, serves its purpose well.\n\nAll in all, I can say I definitely recommend this game. Saying too much about it would spoil it, which is why I won't extend this review more than I have to.", "timestamp_created": 1656886343, "timestamp_updated": 1656887078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118150752": {"recommendationid": "118150752", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966535344", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 407, "last_played": 1624783058}, "language": "english", "review": "The Stanley Parable is a mirror.

Con un control simple de avanzar y un bot\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n nos ponemos en la piel de Stanley, un trabajador que debe seguir unas directrices en todo momento.\n\nPor otro lado tenemos la figura del Narrador que nos va diciendo por d\u00f3nde debemos ir, que puerta atravesar o que c\u00f3digo ingresar. Pero la magia de todo esto es la s\u00e1tira al trabajo. \u00bfDe verdad quieres seguir las directrices o rebelarte contra el sistema?\n\nY es ah\u00ed donde viene una experiencia basada en toma de decisiones. Pero no a la decisiones en la que vemos un texto y nos acostumbran a elegir. Son decisiones narrativas que dependen de lo que hagamos. Pasar por una puerta o volver por donde hemos venido. Y entonces eso conlleva a MUCHOS finales, finales buenos, malos y regulares. Al final el narrador acaba siendo gracioso (voces en ingl\u00e9s y texto en espa\u00f1ol). Y la run que hagas tiene un principio (siempre desde el punto de inicio de la oficina) y un final que has decidido.\n\nNo puedo m\u00e1s que recomendarlo mil veces, no s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 no lo hab\u00eda \"jugado\" antes. Da igual si eres gamer, como si no, debes jugar stanley parable al menos una vez en la vida. En cuanto a la duraci\u00f3n, el \"final\" como tal se puede sacar en 4 minutos.\n\nDe ti depende echarle las horas que quieras para descubrir todo lo que puedes hacer, que finales pueden deparar a Stanley y cu\u00e1ntos secretos contiene el lugar de trabajo del mismo. Vale el precio que sea, una joya de esas que no se te olvidan cuando el videojuego juega contigo.\n\nDescubre todos los misterios alrededor del trabajo de Stanley y prueba a rechazar el sistema guiado, porque, \u00bfQu\u00e9 mejor que llevar la contraria a todos y tomar tus propias decisiones, Stanley?.

The other comments led me to believe there was something amazing about this game. But in the end it's so basic, what a missed opportunity, it could have been so much more! It's very hard to explain why I didn't like this game without spoiling it. So I'll use a metaphor to express my frustration (keep in mind it will still spoil you a little):\n\n[spoiler]Imagine you enter a maze and you're excited to figure out this huge puzzle! But as soon as you enter you see that there is a straight path leading you all the way to... The exit. Sure there are other paths branching left and right from this straight line, but you can actually see the exit right there in front of you, so what's the point in wandering? You can litterally just walk less than 5 minutes and finish the game (and THAT is not a metaphor, there is an achievement for ending the Stanley parable in less than 4 minutes 20 seconds!). But back to our metaphor: so you walk straight and finish the game, leaving you with ony the slightest feeling of achievement (after all, you reached the end) but still thinking \"wait, that's it?!\". On top of that a sign at the end of the maze tells you \"congratulations on beating the maze, but now try and discover who built this maze? and why? and how?\"... Oh and suddenly you understand! That's the easy ending! There has got to be a hidden ending explaining everything and it's going to blow your mind! So you start the maze again but this time you go through aaaaall the other branching paths, thinking you will discover clues, or pieces of the story.\n\nBut to your surprise, all the other paths are dead ends! They lead nowhere and give you zero extra infos. Frustrated, you give up and look at a walkthrough, only to realize that... You have already encountered all the dead ends, and the walkthrough call those dead ends : \"alternative endings\". But they really are not alternative endings, they are dead ends, it's a big difference! So there is nothing to discover about this maze? The only interesting story was the straight path that takes less than 5 minutes?!\n\nWant to know something even worse? Through the branching paths you will come acrosse 2 or 3 actual puzzles, and you will work on them over and over until the walkthrough tells you that... Nope! There is no answer actually! No matter what you do, you were bound to fail and reach another dead end...\n\nWhy didn't the devs put clues here and there as to what's going on, so we could reach a meaningful ending? It would not have been so hard, and it still would have left space for weird and confusing dead ends![/spoiler]\n\nAnd it's really too bad, because the original idea was really fun. It made me all excited and I had fun \"investigating\", but if nothing is meaningful, well that's just lazy work I think. Hell, I could come up with an entire \"story line\" (it's not really a story line but you get my point) in a couple hours!

And this version has secrets that the demo shares, unlike the Ultra Deluxe edition which doesn't have a dev console option and thus it's forever lacking a certain ending and most of the secrets. Ultra Deluxe does add some new ones and a new element that modifies the normal endings though so that's fun. Not to mention that Uktra Deluxe makes a reference to a joke that originates in the demo. I mean the normal game does too but UD takes it further. A blind playthrough is best at first, then do some research to find the other endings. There's approximately 19 endings in this.

This game has a lot of meta commentary - as standard for the Stanley Parable series. Most noticeably, the demo makes a big deal out of how it [i]fails[/i] to show you what the Stanley Parable is all about. And I think in all of that commentary, it perfectly showcases the Stanley Parable. Sitting in the waiting room, waiting for your number as the Narrator comments on it, or pressing the 8 button while the Narrator yells at you about how this is NOT the Stanley Parable - it tells the player, \"do anything. We'll be ready for you.\"\n\nI don't know if I have a whole lot else to say, outside of just one thing: this is, in my opinion, the best demo ever. Give it an award or something.\n\nBut of course, that's just the demo. Let's talk about...\n\n[h1] The Stanley Parable (2013) [/h1]\n\nGame of the millennium. What else can I say? \n\nThe Stanley Parable is a ridiculously engaging game that I have no clue what genre to put it under - the best I can do is [i]\"sandbox narrative.\"[/i] The game has some many endings, so many details all over the place, so much care and effort put into every single inch of this game. Not a single piece feels out of place, everything makes sense, everything feels [i]fantastic[/i]. Except the baby game. I have yet to actually do that ending myself, for obvious reasons.\n\nThe Stanley Parable is a game that sets you in a world, and tells you, \"Go ahead. Write a story.\" One of the endings comments on the nature of the Stanley Parable, and games in general - the idea that every ending has been written, and so no matter what you're walking a path someone else set for you. And yet, the Stanley Parable never feels like that, never feels like you're being dragged along somebody else's story. This game is [i]yours.[/i]. You determine where to go, what to do. You're the one forging a new path, discovering new endings around every corner.\n\nThe Stanley Parable is a masterful mixture of comedy and literally anything else. The game is probably most well-known for its wonderful sense of humor, but the Stanley Parable has plenty of more serious moments. And it knows exactly what its supposed to be at any moment. Something amusing might flow smoothly into something soothing and calming, followed up by sorrow and tragedy. And every emotion is just... conveyed [i]so well.[/i] I love every moment of it - every joke, every insult, every single thing that happens. I could make a joke about the Broom Closet Ending being my favorite, but honestly... [i]every[/i] ending is my favorite. Every single one. They're all just fantastic.\n\nThe Stanley Parable is a work of art that holds a special place in my heart. A game that shows what games can be. A game that shows what life can be. A game that shows what the Stanley Parable is. It's beautiful.\n\nThe Stanley Parable is easily a 12/10, at minimum. That's with a lot of restraint - if I let myself say whatever I wanted to, it'd be a 1000000/10. \n\nThe Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe came out a month or two ago, and I played through it all. I won't be reviewing it yet, though - I'll review it in ten years, once I've got the achievement \"Super Go Outside.\"\n\nGalactic Cafe / Crows Crows Crows, thank you for making such wonderful masterpieces.", "timestamp_created": 1654819825, "timestamp_updated": 1654819825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116731685": {"recommendationid": "116731685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872613708", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1666425550}, "language": "english", "review": "8,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1654797155, "timestamp_updated": 1654797155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116690149": {"recommendationid": "116690149", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991358039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 868, "last_played": 1690464900}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I mean, its Stanley, so why not?", "timestamp_created": 1654716178, "timestamp_updated": 1654716178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116686489": {"recommendationid": "116686489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190421015", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 341, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1651437695}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]8/10[/h1] Meta-narrative game about players, devs and narrators.

The narrator always has a story in mind, therefore he narrates the entire time. There are multiple endings, so many to the point where it's actually still worth getting all of them. The achievements are an interesting concept, I haven't seen many games being this interesting in such storytelling as well.\n\nOverall, The Stanley Parable is a must-have for any steam library.

This was a big deal for stories in games when it first came out, and it's still an incredibly enjoyable experience. After I beat the Ultra Deluxe Edition, I realized that I hadn't written a review for this, so here we are.\n\nPROS:\n+An easy enough premise to get started, written in such a way that regardless of how you play games, all it takes is (at max) two playthroughs to get what the game's about.\n+A fantastic meta-commentary on video games as story-telling devices, well worth playing for anyone who likes stories in games.\n+Kevan Brighting is a fantastic actor portraying The Narrator, a character who's still well-developed despite always being off-screen.\n+A wide branch of endings with incredibly variety of getting to them and outcomes.\n+The only game I've played (that I'm aware of) outside of Modern Warfare 2 with a proper museum providing interesting behind-the-scenes information and tidbits to enjoy.\n+This game has an honest-to-God demo to see if you like it or not before you buy!\n+The most comfortable broom closet in any game I've played.\n+This is incredibly difficult to write about without getting into spoilers.\n+Solid music and graphics.\n+Regularly goes on sale for a reasonable price.\n+Pleasantly-surprising cameos from other classic games!\n\nCONS\n-Some of the endings are ridiculous to get.\n-Having beaten the Ultra Deluxe edition, I feel like that one's more valuable. This is still good if you're on a budget, but that one has literally everything in here and more.\n-I mean, the humor isn't for everyone, but I thought it was funny.\n-Likewise with the Narrator.

entertaining game, in its way. Pretty short. I don't care for the fact that I had to look up a wiki to see if I'd seen everything, so some kind of in-game way to see if you've hit all the options would be nice. (I've seen other branching choice games have things like that.) Now that the Ultra Deluxe Edition is out, I'm not sure there's much point getting this one. I'd already purchased this version and hadn't yet played it by the time the new one came out, so I finally got around to it.

And if you are a completionist who just wants to see All Of The Things(tm) then you ought to play the free demo anyway, as it is a legitimate standalone mini-me amuse boosh of the main game(s) with no overlapping content at all: it's own short story.\n\nQ: Wait, aren't you the guy who didn't like \"The Beginner's Guide\" by the same game maker?\nA: That is true, I did find TBG to be a disappointing immersive experience relative to this franchise and I stand by that assessment. But that is primarily down to TSP (and the demo) setting the bar of expectation as high as it does. The Ultra Delux expansion does a fine job living up to this expectation for me though.\n\nThink of it this way: The Beginner's Guide wouldn't honestly lose all that much impact if it were made into a film instead.

This is the main reason why I asked for a refund.\nIf you didn't figure it out by now, I am a Muslim and English is not my first language. However, I will still try my best to explain why I don't recommend the game. Or in fact, why I hate it\n\nBefore I knew this, I played a bit of the game, so shall we start?\n\nOne of the endings really send a great message of how you could waste your time playing video games, it is viewed by the narrator describing how pathetic \"Stanley\" is, pushing buttons... Wasting his time on this worthless tasks..\nDuring this sequence, you are shown buttons on a screen and you must press it if you wish for the narrator to continue his monologue...\n\nWhat really clicks in this sequence is this line from the narrator:\n\"But Stanley chose it\" (paraphrasing)\n\nYou know, it is quite obvious that the game is sending a message, you are wasting your time playing video games, and for what?\n\nBut this message falls flat when the game itself is a paid product and I really don't think the creator really means those words, the ending does not have any meanings when you are expected to still play the game, you know, I will say it:\nI did not play the full ending, when I got to the part which I just quoted I think I restarted the game and was really thinking of refunding it right then and there, but ultimately I decided to still wait and see\n\nFYI: I knew the original and played it long ago, but that ending didn't hit with me the same at the time as I wasn't really going to question the use of my time. However, now that I am older, ( and consumed a lot of anti-gaming material hahaha) that clicked with me... Cannot say the same for the \"jokes\"\n\nHow do people find the \"broom closet ending\" funny is beyond me.\nHow did I find the \"confusion ending\" funny is really ... I don't know what to say\n\nthe humor of this game is childish, \"oh, we don't have a store, let's make our own one with this trusty trusty adventure line! Oh no! The adventure line blah blah\" is this whole section stolen from a script of a cheesy children cartoon or what?\n\n\"Oh, go right, no no it was left, well I am positive it was right here let me review the script\" (again, paraphrasing)\n", "timestamp_created": 1651274698, "timestamp_updated": 1651274698, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score":

Ok first of all: I believe I played and/or watched every single ending of this game, but I can assure you that I wouldn't bet on that. I wouldn't be surprised if there's an ultra-secret-ending that I missed cause thats just how Stanley Parable works. Now moving on to the actual game: Play It. Thats it, I can't remark enough how much you have to play this game if you love the world of videogames. This sh*t is a brainfu**er. I mean it ok? I can't talk about this game cause it have so much to talk about and at the same time it doesn't have anything to talk about.\nOk but it isn't perfect thats for sure. The graphics are old and the controls are just 5 keys (walk and interact). Now, are those bad things? Debatible, the graphics are old but they aren't Rogue kind of old. They are maybe a bit modern than the Portal/Half-Life graphics so I believe it have something I will call \"The Old Valve Charm\". And about the controls, you dont need anything else to enjoy this game so don't complain.\nNow, I know that all I said was really ambiguous but you HAVE to believe me when I tell you that I can't talk about this game. Being a bit more concrete about the game: I would compare it to the Zelda BoTW experience, meaning that every person will have a different experience playing it. The game have a great mechanic of changing little stuff with every restart, and it remembers your last plays and endings, kinda like Undertale. The difference of Undertale and BoTW with The Stanley Parable is that the last one doesn't have battles, a big cast or anything like that. It's just You, Stanley and The Narrator, and that is enough. The Stanley Parable Experience is unique and great and if you can you should probably play it. It's not expensive (neither in money nor system requirements).

In that sense, his life isn't much different to that of a video game player, making you the perfect candidate to be him (and/or not be him, as the Steam description claims). One day, Stanley realises he's stopped receiving orders. For a brief moment, the forces controlling his every move have disappeared. What will Stanley do next?\n\nItching to find out is the story's Narrator, whose luxurious purring voice steps in to try and tell you which buttons to press now. He holds the key to Stanley's freedom; all you have to do is play out the story as he narrates it. I hope it's an open secret by now, though, that playing along is mostly optional, and silently discouraged. Spend too long admiring scenery and the Narrator will grumblingly assure you that there's nothing to see. Disobey any narration and you start down the road of any of 19 different branching paths, as the Narrator reacts to your behaviour by dramatically reshaping the story. He can play any part, from cold-hearted antagonist to well-intentioned supporter. He may even criticise the player directly (The Stanley Parable isn't interested in gaming trivia like inventory systems, the ability to jump, or the fourth wall). This is because, the way I see it, the Narrator is a game developer, and each interaction in the game has something to say about the cat-herding activity of game design, and possibly more deeply about culture, storytelling and personal agency in general. Where many developers would convey this through the medium of pretentious navel-gazing, here it's all couched in so much quality humour and spectacle that the game is simply entertaining on whatever level you want to engage with it.\n\nThis is easily one of the funniest games in my Steam library. I am essentially a captive audience for anything this team creates in the future. So much game humour leans on unoriginal references and puns, so it's very refreshing for a team to spin such consistently great comedy from its own premise. On rare occasions, the humorous presentation can work against the game a bit. Some more abrupt endings struck me as unpolished content on the developers' part more than jokes. For these to be the only jokes that don't land in the entire game is nevertheless a stunning achievement. The same comic voice can be found in Crows Crows Crows' newsletter, social media and hilariously meta promotional videos for the game, and will probably live on as straight forward quotes with no added comedic value in YouTube comment sections forever.\n\nUnlike the rather controlling Narrator, the actual game's actual developers know that, as frustrating as it may be, the correct response to natural human curiosity is not to stifle it, but to indulge it. The explicit binary choices presented to you are the bulk of the interactivity but some of the best content is gated off to only the most determined players. When you think you've found every ending and Easter egg, you probably haven't, so be sure to look up the rest online at some point because they are not to be missed. That said, I don't think players should aim to see all the endings in one go and be done with it. This mindset commodifies the endings and makes them harder to appreciate - plus by the end of my time with it, 19 branches actually felt like a rather small number. It's best to savour this game; perhaps take the advice of its notorious \"Go Outside\" achievement and put off playing half the game for five years (which, it turns out, is not long enough to forget most of the events and experience the game like new).\n\nThe Stanley Parable retains some of the frugal spirit of the original 2011 mod for Half-Life 2, but thankfully uses brand new assets, stamping a unique visual identity onto the concept and turning that barren office into a gaming icon. The vacant setting softens the ground so that you're intrigued when you notice something out of place, or bowled over when something really surprising happens. Satirical corporate nonsense and extra dialogue scattered all over are very tempting to find and read, though you risk wrecking the pacing for yourself. The voice acting is addictive to listen to and I was happy to pay that price to fully hear every line I came across. The original soundtrack is flawless, despite the game sort of pretending to be low-budget.\n\nI've described everything very vaguely in this review to avoid spoiling anything major. I have to admit that its style is bound to put some people off, but give it a go for one playthrough and you'll know if it's for you. I say this forensically self-aware meta-game is REQUIRED READING for anyone remotedly interested in interactive storytelling and an easy recommendation even if you just want a toy to make you laugh. Games have played with similar ideas before and since, but none hit all the notes like The Stanley Parable.", "timestamp_created": 1651187209, "timestamp_updated": 1651187209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114636083": {"recommendationid": "114636083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158369590", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1577999073}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic for the ages.", "timestamp_created": 1651185300, "timestamp_updated": 1651185300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114635728": {"recommendationid": "114635728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198453605375", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1591569467}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than my job", "timestamp_created": 1651184659, "timestamp_updated": 1660599979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114634098": {"recommendationid": "114634098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000235049", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1651182462}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the original way before Ultra Deluxe, if you do not own this version already, buy Ultra Deluxe instead.

But do yourself a favor and buy the Ultra Deluxe version instead [/h1]\n\nStanley Parable when it came out sparked a big discussion on what constitutes a game. Technically there isn't really a loss state. You start the game and can do whatever you want, hell you could probably finish the game within 1 minutes if you tried for it. So what makes this fun, to me its the fact that you can reach an ending within 1 minute. The game really tests the boundaries of what you can do in a 3D game with barely any complicated mechanics at all. Behind the scenes a lot of stuff is going on, but the player has to work for it to find those secrets. That effort and choice to me is what makes me confidently say that this is a great game. After about 1 and a half hours I personally got bored of pushing those boundaries to find secrets, but I think that small amount of time was packed with a lot of content. And seeing other peoples play times it is very clear this game can be a lot longer if you want it to. To me even nowadays this is a fantastic game worth experiencing, at least I would say that if it wasn't for the newly released Ultra Deluxe version.\n\nMy first impressions from the Ultra Deluxe version is that its just this game but with more content, and some old content changed. The Stanley parable is all about exploring your own creativity and seeing what you can do, more content just results in a much more varied and open game. As a result it becomes hard to recommend the original. Its still a great game but I heavily recommend you buy the Ultra Deluxe version.\n\nMy only other complaint is the lack of Elden ring References.
