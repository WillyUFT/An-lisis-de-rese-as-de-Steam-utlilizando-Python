This was the game series that started the Zombie Game craze that captivated fans and challenged game developers. You assume the role of either Chris Redfield former USAF, or Jill Valentine a former Delta Force operator. Both members of the \"Special Tactics And Rescue Service\" (STARS) Alpha Team. After answering the distress call from their comrades of Bravo Team, they encounter hellish zombie dogs that forced a handful of the surviving team to the Spencer Mansion. This is where the nightmare unfolds, and the threat of Bio-Terrorism was born along with creatures from a biohazard leak. Tank controls made it's home here, which separated the hardcore from the casual. Item and resource management are the main keys of survival. Each of the two playable characters have their individual strengths and weaknesses. Memorising map layout to help back tracking and efficient traversing of the terrifying domain. Skillful dispatch of the many monstrosities aid ammo conservation, thus improving odds of making it out in one piece. Enter the Residence, and vanquish this Evil!

My impression of both versions is that they differ, but both are commendable.\n\nInitially intended as a GameCube exclusive, the 2002 remake later expanded to other platforms like the PS2. Remarkably, despite its 2002 origin, the game has aged gracefully. Even after two decades, it manages to keep up with contemporary graphic demands, securing its position as one of the best survival horror games. The controls pose no issues for me, but the occasional abrupt change in control due to map-switching can be a minor hiccup for speed runners. Aside from that, I have no complaints about the game and experience.\n\nRegarding the story, I didn't expect much, as the focus is on introducing and exploring the origins of the RE outbreak. Emphasis is placed on game-play, replay value, suspense, and inventory management.\n\nDifferences between the original and the remake (if my memory serves me well):\n\nOriginal Version:\n[i]The original game features larger maps with more zones and rooms to explore. Some rooms from the original were omitted in the remake, such as the hidden room behind the glass of the greenhouse area. In the original, players had to mix various chemicals to eliminate a plant (not Plant 42). Navigating the original RE can be challenging, with the outdated map system. What I particularly enjoyed about the original was the abundance of diaries to collect and read, a feature somewhat lacking in the 2002 version.[/i]\n\n[b]However, the strengths of the remake includes:[/b]\n\n1. An improved and intricate map system.\n2. Stunning graphics.\n3. Numerous selective options.\n4. Multiple endings.\n5. A more in-depth exploration of the Spencer family and their discoveries.\n6. Partner assistance.\n7. Self-defense support.\n8. Diverse enemies, including crimsons and bees.\n9. A range of available bosses, such as the Elder Crimson and Lisa.\n\nIn conclusion, my Resident Evil game play provided a satisfying blend of nostalgia and enjoyment.

The requirement to use a consumable resource for saving progress is honestly genius and forces you to save only when it is absolutely necessary. The game actively encourages you NOT to use ammo; killing a zombie takes like 20 pistol bullets and they respawn even stronger and faster.\n\nTo get rid of 1 zombie you need to first kill it (ammo gone) and burn it (find fuel and lighter). This makes backtracking, which there is a lot of, excruciatingly painful but forces you to carefully plan routes and burn zombies in certain areas, while saving your lighter fuel in others. You also have to git gud at evading enemies. Finding new items also means backtracking to a safe room and depositing items into the chest as you've basically no inventory space. The puzzles are solid even if a lot of the time it's basically \"slot the square crank into the square hole\" type stuff.\n\nNone of this is helped by the fixed camera angles and abrupt transitions when going from one part of a room to another.

Here's an extensive review detailing why this game remains a must-play:\n\nHistorical Significance:\n\"Resident Evil HD\" brings players back to the roots of the survival horror genre. It preserves the original game's groundbreaking elements while updating it for modern audiences. The game is a piece of video game history, showcasing how the genre began and how far it has come.\n\nGraphics and Atmosphere:\nThe remaster significantly overhauls the graphics of the original 1996 game, with updated textures, models, and lighting effects that enhance the eerie atmosphere of the mansion. The fixed camera angles, a signature element of the original, add to the tension, often hiding dangers just out of sight. These angles, combined with the detailed environments and improved visuals, create a sense of dread and anticipation that few games can match.\n\nSound Design:\nThe sound design in \"Resident Evil HD\" is exceptional. Every creaking floorboard, distant moan, and ambient noise contributes to an immersive horror experience. The game's soundtrack is iconic, with haunting melodies that linger with players long after they've turned off the console.\n\nGameplay Mechanics:\nWhile retaining the deliberate, tank-like controls of the original, the remaster offers an alternative control scheme that can make the experience more accessible to newcomers. The game's pacing is deliberate, forcing players to consider each action carefully, from managing limited resources to deciding when to fight or flee. Puzzle-solving remains a core aspect of the game, requiring players to pay close attention to their surroundings and think critically.\n\nStorytelling:\nThe narrative of \"Resident Evil HD\" is classic horror. As members of the elite S.T.A.R.S. team, players unravel the mysteries of the ominous Spencer Mansion and the secrets it holds. The story is filled with twists, betrayals, and the kind of campy dialogue that has become endearing to fans over the years.\n\nCharacter Choice:\nPlayers can choose between two characters, Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, each with unique storylines and challenges. This choice adds to the game's replay value, as each character's experience differs in inventory space, available weapons, and support from other characters.\n\nSurvival Elements:\nThe game's inventory management and save system (using a limited number of typewriter ribbons) are integral to the survival experience. Players must constantly make decisions about what items to carry and when to save, which adds to the game's tension and difficulty.\n\nReplayability:\n\"Resident Evil HD\" has high replay value due to its multiple endings, hidden items, and unlockable modes. It rewards thorough exploration and mastery of its mechanics with new challenges and content, encouraging players to revisit the mansion again and again.\n\nImpact on the Genre:\nThe remaster not only stands as a testament to the original game's impact but also influences the modern survival horror games that followed. Playing \"Resident Evil HD\" is not just about experiencing a great game; it's about understanding the evolution of the genre.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Resident Evil HD Remaster\" is an essential play for both fans of the series and those who appreciate the horror genre. It skillfully balances nostalgia with modern enhancements, making it a definitive version of a classic game. Whether you're in it for the scares, the story, or the history, \"Resident Evil HD\" delivers an experience that has stood the test of time and remains as compelling today as it was at its inception.", "timestamp_created": 1699460449, "timestamp_updated": 1699460449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149764833": {"recommendationid": "149764833", "author": {"steamid": "76561199218616981", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 190, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1700549681}, "language": "english", "review": "How can i not recommend the first ever RE game Jill you almost where a Jill sandwitch", "timestamp_created": 1699460075, "timestamp_updated": 1699460075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711086392402648926", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149764226": {"recommendationid": "149764226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198845978605", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 541, "last_played": 1700361785}, "language": "english", "review": "can't believe I didn't get into this game sooner", "timestamp_created": 1699459213, "timestamp_updated": 1699459213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149762891": {"recommendationid": "149762891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130540989", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1693, "last_played": 1699457354}, "language": "english", "review": "You really can't just walk straight through waterfall huh?", "timestamp_created": 1699457431, "timestamp_updated": 1699457431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149741678": {"recommendationid": "149741678", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199213542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1666, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1700284199}, "language": "english", "review": "A thunderclap made me shit myself", "timestamp_created": 1699417734, "timestamp_updated": 1699417734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149735026": {"recommendationid": "149735026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872369176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1765, "last_played": 1644067991}, "language": "english", "review": "Some advice for new players: \n\nPlay as Chris first or no balls.\n\nNo you don't need the lockpick, no you don't need the puzzle skips, no you don't need the grenade launcher, no you don't need Barry, no you don't need the two extra inventory slots, no you don't need the handgun immediately, and no you definitely don't need to look at Jill (remember, she's just a platonic friend). \n\nYou don't need any of that - all of that is a distraction.

This game was fun, but more than it was fun it was spooky. So spooky, that I couldn\u2019t play for more than 2 hours per session without needing to take in between as I\u2019d be exhausted from the tension created from its eerie sound design that is determined to get me in cold sweat with the percussions and screeches it utilizes in scaring me . \n\nIt is incredibly visually distinct. The use of a limited color palette is fantastic in portraying Spencer\u2019s Mansion as this grand yet haunting area where you\u2019ll never know what could be at the other end of the corridor. This game doesn\u2019t have jumpscares but it really does feel like anything can pop up at any time. Considering this is a remake, I liked that they kept the door transitions despite not needing to as that added pause transition between rooms create this sense of dread as you enter a new room. \n\nNarratively, Resident Evil 1 is a lot less goofier than what I expected after playing Resident Evil 4 as the urgency of finding a way out of the terrifying mansion is a lot more felt compared to strolling and taking your time in saving the president\u2019s daughter. However, the choices some of these characters make truly baffle me as it all falls into the same cliches I\u2019ve seen over and over in horror movies. \u201cLet\u2019s split up\u201d and \u201cyou go on ahead\u201d will be common in tilting me as I just find it so convoluted that they\u2019d want to be on their own despite being in near death scenarios multiple times. The worst part is when a certain betrayal happens but the victim never ends up asking why and what\u2019s happening. Otherwise, the story was still pretty gripping up to the end where they use a grenade launcher to kill the big bad. The characters aren\u2019t really much to speak about since Jill is really just a stand-in for the player and I can\u2019t say a lot about their personalities or character traits besides me finding Jill hot, but that's okay.\n\nDo I like the gameplay? Yes, but only to a certain extent. The fixed camera angles don\u2019t bother me as I thought it would as I quickly got used to them and learnt to appreciate how the chosen framing can actually help a lot in setting up the creepy atmosphere. Having scarce resources also added to the overall horror experience and considering how simple it is to aim at zombies and also being unnecessary a lot of the time, things were relatively easy. Despite that, it was still overall incredibly enjoyable in solving the puzzles while navigating through the corridors of the mansion and running away from zombies. I did have a major issue with the very start though with how little it guides you in some of the mechanics like combining and examining items you get, but that's just probably old games am I right? \n\nOverall, Resident Evil (2002) was another great experience as part of my horror binge and is so far the most I have been scared of with a video game. Beyond some hiccups in the early parts, I thoroughly had a smooth playthrough of constantly getting exhausted from the tension and needing breaks every 2 hours or so. 8/10, the spooks are for real.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698931484, "timestamp_updated": 1698931484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149367536": {"recommendationid": "149367536", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971569035", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 355, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1699036266}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect porting from the PS3 porting of the GameCube version.", "timestamp_created": 1698926118, "timestamp_updated": 1699033940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149363039": {"recommendationid": "149363039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424415347", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1698918784}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bacano tradicional", "timestamp_created": 1698918942, "timestamp_updated": 1698918942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149355465": {"recommendationid": "149355465", "author": {"steamid": "76561199524736085", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1699385808}, "language": "english", "review": "love it fr fr\n", "timestamp_created": 1698906988, "timestamp_updated": 1698906988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149353012": {"recommendationid": "149353012", "author": {"steamid": "76561199011488723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 208, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1700545620}, "language": "spanish", "review": "pinche juego hermoso  10/10", "timestamp_created": 1698901791, "timestamp_updated": 1698901791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149348623": {"recommendationid": "149348623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037755081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1698890642}, "language": "english", "review": "Time has not been a friend to this game.

with this game six hours before it actually ended lmao. \n\nthis was a lot more puzzle and a lot less horror than i expected. like.. multiple times after looking at a door opening and closing because i got lost AGAIN in the maze that is this dumb house when i didn't even know what i was supposed to do with a puzzle item i just .. questioned my life. like i just wanted to shoot some zombies why do i have to care about this dumb jewely box? \n\nvery much a product of its time with the weird fixed camera angles making me run in circles forever if i don't focus and jill having to be saved by a big manly man 90% of the cutscenes for no good reason. she straight up doesn't even have a weapon equipped in some of them which would've been useful to help out instead of sit on the floor wide eyed like a kindergardener. (a weapon she had in fact equipped, mind you. when it changed back to gameplay i went into my inventory and accidentally unequipped my gun because i thought i forgor and that's why it didn't show it in the cutscene so that was fun and not confusing)\n\nmaybe the next resident evil game will be easier to digest now that i know what to expect (even though i still hope for just.. a little less puzzles. please. or maybe just make them make sense. like who on earth went through all this effort to set these up and why does no one comment on the ridiculous amount of it? they all act as if they can just waltz right into any room they want without having to spend three hours thinking about the meaning of life first)\n\nfor now, i'm sick of solving puzzles tho and will take a break. \n\nif you like solving puzzles, get this game. also wesker is hotter than i expected based on his model in dbd so that's a plus also\n\n(i'm mainly reccomending this game as a piece of history btw, rather than on its own terms. i'm not sure i would reccomend anyone to go through this if they're not interested in where it all began/how things have changed. it is interesting to look back on imo)",

[/h1]\n\nResident Evil, originally released in 1996 and remade in 2002, is an iconic survival horror title. Its recent PC release marks the return of director Shinji Mikami to the genre he helped shape. This isn't just a piece of gaming history; it's a brilliantly designed and claustrophobic masterpiece.\n\nI must admit, I initially expected a more realistic zombie-infested survival experience - barricading windows, collecting supplies, and dealing with infections. But that's not the path Resident Evil takes. Instead, it offers a mansion filled with abstract puzzles and campy dialogue, which at first left me somewhat disappointed. I was looking for a deep survival experience and psychological thrills, not an intricate item hunt wrapped in a Sci-Fi Channel storyline.\n\nThe moment a Resident Evil game delves into its extensive backstory, it risks losing me. I've never been particularly invested in the series' narrative, so it's the actual gameplay, scares, and set pieces that pull me back in. Fortunately, Resident Evil Remake delivers in these areas.\n\nThe main plot is relatively tight and engaging, drawing inspiration from mad scientist B-movie narratives and comic book conspiracies. The subplots, including the one added in the 2002 remake, provide intense moments of terror. But what really shines is the game's design.\n\nWhile it might not be the complex simulation I expected as a teenager, Resident Evil's layout is nothing short of a masterpiece. The mansion and its surroundings form the foundation, its intricate map transitioning from black to red to green as you progress. The entire location remains claustrophobic, even as you explore its darkest corners. There's a sense of purpose in almost every scene, with even seemingly empty hallways offering some challenge.\n\nManagement is the name of the game, whether it's handling combat, rationing ammo and healing items, or planning a route from a safe room to a problem. Resident Evil is a slow-burning experience, always offering a thread to follow or a puzzle to solve. Applying the right pressure \u2013 finding the correct item or using it in the right place \u2013 allows the mansion to unfold and unravel before you.\n\nHowever, not everything is perfect. The lack of direction can be frustrating, leaving you stuck or unsure of your next step. The game's first couple of hours can be particularly bewildering as multiple paths open up and then lead to dead-ends.\n\nEven the boss fights, while requiring different strategies, essentially operate on the same principle as the puzzles. They're about bringing the right equipment to the fight, more about calculations than reflexes.\n\nThe beauty of Resident Evil is in its resource management. You'll constantly weigh the risk of going down a certain corridor, contemplating if it's worth the ammunition needed to deal with lurking zombies. As you progress, healing items become scarcer, and ammunition runs low. The save system and limited inventory space may seem irritating at first, but they're core to the design, encouraging players to plan ahead.\n\nAs for the story, it's as cheesy as ever, though thankfully without the labyrinthine mythology of the later games. It's enjoyable in the way that Roger Corman's Poe adaptations are, offering moments of fear amid the campiness. The standout is the Lisa Trevor subplot, which debuted in the Gamecube remake. It's genuinely unsettling, making it all the more shocking in contrast to the rest of the narrative.\n\nIn terms of visuals, Resident Evil Remake is impressive, although some textures look dated. The increased resolution doesn't completely remove the game's VHS-like quality, and that's a good thing. It looks beautiful but maintains its original gritty atmosphere.\n\nWhile the remaster lacks some extras, I wish there was more information about the game's design and development. Nevertheless, playing Resident Evil Remake has been a revelation. It may not be as bold as it was when it first launched, but I've come to appreciate its intricate design. What might have initially disappointed me has become a delightful and intriguing experience.\n\nThis release is a chance to revisit a classic, meet Lisa Trevor, and for those who've never played Resident Evil, it's the perfect time. It's a piece of gaming history that has shaped the survival horror genre. When a game is crafted this meticulously, the shortcomings of imitations become glaringly obvious.", "timestamp_created": 1697183997, "timestamp_updated": 1697184024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661322414875030518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148115298": {"recommendationid": "148115298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238354398", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1100, "last_played": 1697564510}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright so first off, this port sucks. when you full screen the game it crashes if you have v-sync on (which is turned on by default), And this game likes to tear screens, so either way somethings stinky.

The fixed camera is suppose to add to the feeling of horror because you imagination fills in the blanks better than any graphics ever could... but this fails for me because I always know I'm looking in the \"right\" direction as I can't be looking anywhere else... with a moving camera (as in RE2 for example) hearing noises and trying to look in 360 degrees at once adds a great deal to the terror for me.\n\nThe one thing that I think is essential to know before you buy the game is that it is very sensitive to your controller. If either of the joysticks on your controller drift, don't fully re-center, or won't reach maximum extent - this game will punish you like you can not believe.  Even though you don't have control of the camera with the right joystick it is used to \"flip 180 degrees\"... if it drifts you will flip in circles... if the movement joystick has issues the difference between running and walking can be brutal - in some cases it is fatal to run and in almost every other case it is fatal to walk.

This version is the HD version of the 2002 remaster and the gameplay is phenomenal. You are trapped inside a zombie filled mansion, but combat is difficult because of the claustrophobic setting and a tight inventory system that makes you question if you should really pick every item you find. Amazingly, the remaster goes the extra mile to bring new areas to some levels that improve on the original game.\nThis gameplay cycle scales really well as the game story develops. It's all about the reason of a zombie outbreak, and how main characters Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine explore the mansion, each with their own story and small gameplay tweaks. The remake tries to maintain some of the campy charm of the game its based on, to my personal delight.\nResident Evil is visually breathtaking, it was for its 2002 release and it is today with this HD remaster, using the old technique of pre-rendering its graphics to use with fixed camera angles. The result is used to enhance the game performance with improvements such as real-time reflections and a remarkable use of light sources. \nThe soundtrack is very well suited for this horror game, and can even be listened on its own, but some songs in this HD version are sped up. It is still a perfect rendition of the original soundtrack. The sound design is great, since there always are scary background sounds to keep you on your toes. Monsters can be distinguished by their cries and moans, which is really cool. \nOnce you beat the game, based on your performance you will unlock new gameplay modes with even harder rules, new costumes for the main characters to wear and new weapons, encouraging you to finish the game faster each time.

Incredibly detailed visuals, astounding soundtrack, corny, yet well-delivered dialogue, near perfect gameplay and substantial replayability define it. Capcom set the bar so high, that no other game remake might ever top this work. It makes the original wholly superfluous, outside of pure nostalgia or curiosity. REmake is one of the best games ever made and it's king in its series for these reasons.\n\nThis port has some flaws to note. The resolution of many textures is sub par and shows that Capcom fought against their own art design when upscaling it for the HD era. The OST was sped up, but there's a mod for that as well. The faces and models were retouched, and look different from the GC ones, some more drastically than others. In general however, it's nothing that cannot be fixed with some mods. There are also some optional toggles, like original aspect ratio and modern controls, which break the game by the way, allowing one to dance around enemies freely. I must admit that I enjoy tank controls and this game was meant to be played with them, which contrary to popular belief, are not counterintuitive at all. After a couple of minutes, you'll adjust to them.\n\nResident Evil was, without exaggeration, a masterpiece, and while the HD version is not without caveats, it's the best way to experience REmake next to the original disc and hardware, if you can stomach such low resolutions.", "timestamp_created": 1696453167, "timestamp_updated": 1696453588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147622177": {"recommendationid": "147622177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427436196", "num_games_owned": 632, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 1179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1179, "last_played": 1670470337}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best survival horror games ever made.

So after about 18 years of putting it off, I decided to finally give it a go after completing all of the other mainline games.\n\nThe remake is great, definitely the definitive way to play this game although there are some problems but there's a lot of fun to have here.\n\nFirstly, the setting and sound design is great. In this Resident Evil, a Zombie feels like a genuine threat that you need to decide whether it's worth skipping round him or taking care of him. I think that's what makes this game enjoyable, it really is true survival horror, you need to decide when to use your bullets and when to know to save them.\n\nThe puzzles are good if not a bit convoluted at times, it might seem obvious when you've figured it out but there will be times when you've got absolutely 0 idea and will take a little peak online just to nudge you in the right direction. Although what I will say is that when you figure out a puzzle on your own, it feels amazing.\n\nCombat is okay, it's a little rough and a bit tank controlly, but it is what it is, I'd say this is just a product of time and age.\n\nCamera angles, they do take a bit of getting used to, but it's really not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, in fact I quite enjoyed it when I -wasn't- in combat. In combat it's a nightmare, but running around from place to place, it really makes the game feel movie like. I didn't mind it as much as I see other people complaining about it.\n\nStory and dialogue is a bit cheesy, but the files are where the game shines. The spoken dialogue feels quite robotic but when you're reading through the jarring files of the whole scenario, it makes the world feel more alive. I always like it when the game feels bigger than the protagonist, that there was something going on during your mission and way before it. To me, the story's are the ones where you're just a smaller role in a bigger world who can make -some- difference but not completely resolving the problem.\n\nOverall, Resident Evil 1 for me is a solid 6/10, it's enjoyable and possibly replayable on harder difficulties where the puzzles are apparently more difficult; camera angles are a bit of a nuisance at times and inventory management can feel like a chore.

Desde su debut en 1996, la serie Resident Evil ha evolucionado y se ha diversificado en m\u00faltiples juegos, pel\u00edculas y otros medios, dejando una marca perdurable en la cultura pop y el g\u00e9nero de horror.\n\nEl juego original de Resident Evil, lanzado en 1996, sent\u00f3 las bases para lo que se convertir\u00eda en un g\u00e9nero por s\u00ed mismo: el survival horror. La atm\u00f3sfera opresiva, los rompecabezas ingeniosos y los sustos bien dise\u00f1ados hicieron que Resident Evil fuera una experiencia aterradora y adictiva. La elecci\u00f3n de personajes jugables, cada uno con sus propias habilidades y tramas, agreg\u00f3 una capa adicional de profundidad y rejugabilidad al juego.\n\nLa narrativa de Resident Evil ha evolucionado a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, desde el brote del virus T en la mansi\u00f3n de las monta\u00f1as Arklay hasta la conspiraci\u00f3n global que involucra a Umbrella Corporation y otros actores poderosos. La historia se ha extendido a trav\u00e9s de m\u00faltiples entregas, spin-offs y pel\u00edculas, lo que ha permitido una exploraci\u00f3n en profundidad del mundo infectado por el virus.\n\nLa franquicia Resident Evil ha demostrado ser capaz de adaptarse y cambiar con el tiempo. Mientras que los primeros juegos se centraron en la acci\u00f3n de supervivencia y el horror psicol\u00f3gico, las entregas posteriores han abrazado un enfoque m\u00e1s orientado a la acci\u00f3n, lo que ha atra\u00eddo a un p\u00fablico m\u00e1s amplio sin perder la esencia del terror.\n\nLos personajes ic\u00f3nicos de Resident Evil, como Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine y Albert Wesker, se han convertido en figuras legendarias en el mundo de los videojuegos. Sus historias personales, luchas y relaciones complejas han sido un motor importante para la narrativa de la serie.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de enemigos, desde los zombis originales hasta las horribles criaturas de pesadilla como los Regeneradores, ha sido una parte integral del atractivo de Resident Evil. Los juegos han mantenido una sensaci\u00f3n constante de peligro, incluso cuando los jugadores han estado armados hasta los dientes.", "timestamp_created": 1695495279, "timestamp_updated": 1695495279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146877232": {"recommendationid": "146877232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005085192", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1699737060}, "language": "english", "review": "Welcome to Survival Horror!", "timestamp_created": 1695492687, "timestamp_updated": 1695492687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146871605": {"recommendationid": "146871605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115949883", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1787, "last_played": 1692071756}, "language": "english", "review": "It truly was a Jill Sandwich", "timestamp_created": 1695487785, "timestamp_updated": 1695487785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146833614": {"recommendationid": "146833614", "author": {"steamid": "76561199446198691", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1040, "last_played": 1695027062}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1695446292, "timestamp_updated": 1695446292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146832415": {"recommendationid": "146832415", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991952210", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 778, "last_played": 1696189746}, "language": "english", "review": "Love Resident Evil Games", "timestamp_created": 1695444604, "timestamp_updated": 1695444604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146823174": {"recommendationid": "146823174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380732514", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1270, "last_played": 1695426693}, "language": "english", "review": "30% gameplay, 70% door animations", "timestamp_created": 1695432311, "timestamp_updated": 1695432311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515151500701904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146810734": {"recommendationid": "146810734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114072688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 493, "last_played": 1695247755}, "language": "english", "review": "Resident Evil HD Remaster is a lovingly crafted resurrection of the classic that kickstarted the survival horror genre. This remaster is more than just a fresh coat of paint; it's a testament to the enduring brilliance of the original Resident Evil. On the positive side, the game's visual overhaul is nothing short of stunning, breathing new life into the iconic Spencer Mansion and its ghastly inhabitants. The meticulous attention to detail elevates the eerie atmosphere, making every shadow and creaking floorboard feel genuinely foreboding. The gameplay retains the tension and resource management that made the original a masterpiece, creating a sense of vulnerability that is often missing in modern horror games. The iconic puzzles and memorable encounters remain as captivating as ever, and the revamped control options make it accessible to both classic fans and newcomers.\n\nHowever, Resident Evil HD Remaster isn't without its minor drawbacks. The fixed camera angles, while essential to the game's original design, can sometimes lead to awkward perspectives that hinder navigation. The voice acting, though charmingly nostalgic, may come across as campy to contemporary ears. Some players might find the backtracking and puzzle-solving a tad frustrating, but these elements are fundamental to the survival horror experience.\n\nIn summary, Resident Evil HD Remaster on Steam is a hauntingly beautiful return to the roots of survival horror. Its visual enhancements, faithful gameplay, and unwavering commitment to dread-inducing atmosphere make it a must-play for fans of the genre. While it may have some quirks related to camera angles and voice acting, these are minor blemishes on an otherwise flawless reimagining of a horror classic. Whether you're reliving the nightmare or stepping into the Spencer Mansion for the first time, this remaster is a spine-tingling journey into the heart of fear, and it stands as a shining example of what survival horror should be.", "timestamp_created": 1695417598, "timestamp_updated": 1695417598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146810007": {"recommendationid": "146810007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198964967352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1679778876}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good", "timestamp_created": 1695416881, "timestamp_updated": 1695416881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146804319": {"recommendationid": "146804319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353842355", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1695579192}, "language": "english", "review": "don't bother fighting, not even the bosses, don't bother saving - its limited anyways, don't bother taking it slow - you'll never finish it, don't bother memorising where rooms - you'll never use them again, don't care about the characters - the game doesn't either, don't try to seek deeper meaning - there is none.\n\ngarbage fetch quest", "timestamp_created": 1695411693, "timestamp_updated": 1695514346, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146798652": {"recommendationid": "146798652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819809717", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1695664861}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy the way the game is one big puzzle.

This game really ups the \"Survival Horror\" aspect it so gloriously created back in 1996. It's dark & finely refined extra attention to detail is mind blowing. Anyone not familiar with the 1st, 2nd or 3rd Resident Evil games (referring to the original from the 90's, not the remastered versions) will have a hard time adjusting to how this game doesn't hold your hand, once you're playing you are on your own. The added usage of defensive weapons, more pros & cons on which character you decide to play as and having to either decapitate or incinerate Zombies if you decide to drop a few, are great additions to the game.\n\nExploration, health & ammo management and a bit of patience are a must for this game, there's a lot of backtracking throughout the Mansion & for some that will get tedious. Thankfully, a majority of the game's puzzles don't take long to figure out & are a lot more straight forward compared to the original game's puzzles, there has been a few puzzles & things to do added that I've never seen before which kept me wondering & frustrated (why exploration is key), but after you get that \"Eureka\" moment you'll laugh at your mistakes or breath a sigh of relief in satisfaction. There is a lot of replay-ability. \n\nMy only complaint is I found the control layout if using just the keyboard & mouse is pretty difficult to work with & I'm sure many will find it a lot easier using a control pad when playing this game, it makes character movement (Alternative or in it's Original setting), Aiming & Shooting a lot more smoother & just easier to manage when your thumbs are doing all the work & you can just focus on what's happening in game.\n\nWould I recommend this? Damn right. Like the remastered Resident Evil 2 & 3 which followed this is an example or how to revisit previous projects & remake them right. No bugs, glitches or performance issues.

The execution is so chock-full of immersion-breaking paper cuts that I was left feeling pity for the vast wasted potential of the core mechanisms. I probably would've given it a 5/10 and a thumbs-down if I weren't cautiously optimistic about playing the sequels.\n\n[b]Positives[/b]:\n[list]\n    [*] Perhaps controversial, but: the camera angle and the character movement. I've taken for granted when games offer players plenty of freedom for camera control, and I've never thought about the ramifications of the camera angles being fixed. For me, this is the biggest factor behind the horror atmosphere and the game's unique charm to me.\n    [*] As someone more familiar with FPS than survival horror that requires inventory management, I love the sense of scarcity of the ammunition. The combat also feels surprisingly engaging.\n    [*] Related to the previous point, the placement of enemies and the map design work extremely well in conjunction to incentivize me to make strategic fight-or-flight decisions during each enemy encounter.\n[/list]\n[b]Negatives[/b]:\n[list]\n    [*] The storytelling and the characters are so forgettable and uninspiring. When I started, I was eagerly interacting with everything in the surroundings because I wanted to take in all the lore of this sinister mansion. I soon realized how bland the writing is and started avoiding unnecessary interactions to spare myself all the cringe. If you need an example, here's one I wish I could forget: when you interact with the shelf in the west side storage room, the game says something along the lines of, [spoiler] \"The shelf is full of pills you've never seen. Many of them have changed colors.\" [/spoiler] Yeah, that's how bad the writing is.\n    [*] The game sorely lacks respect for the players' time. Don't get me wrong, backtracking can be very rewarding if done right, but the way it works here frequently made me want to pull my hair out because I constantly found myself doing uneventful fetch quests or juggling items between my inventory and the item boxes, all while watching the unskippable animation of doors sloooooowly opening for the 300th time. No, Capcom, those don't impress or scare anyone anymore in 2015. (Thankfully, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=378357950] door-skipping mods [/url] are a thing.)\n    [*] Related to the previous point, I found it incredibly frustrating that I frequently could not identify on the map which room I should backtrack to. The way the rooms on maps are color coded to show the exploration progress does help, but not nearly enough for me. I would rather replace this feature with room labels on the maps (or some other variants, e.g. limited number of markers players that place on the map), so that at least I can more easily locate a room when I need to backtrack to it.\n    [*] The puzzles are a mixed bag.

I have always been vaguely interested in the series, I was a massive Silent Hill fan as a kid, and even more recently Dead By Daylight's crossovers have further piqued my interest. It was faltered a little bit when a few of my friends seemed to be pretty sour on the game,[url=https://www.twitch.tv/jacob_rewind] but after watching another friend live stream the game,[/url] I thought it looked pretty cool and decided I finally needed to give it a shot. I owed it to myself as a horror fan, and more importantly, I had to complete it before my friend did for lacklustre bragging rights. \n\nAfter about a week of playing nonstop, I've seen about everything the game has to offer. My takeaway? It's tricky. I really like a lot of what the game sets out to do. It has a lot of that awkward charm I love from early horror games, and the tone, while not really scary, captures that sense of mystery and dread that they were going for pretty well. However, just as it carries a lot of the strengths from the genesis of 3D horror gaming, it also has some of that archaic puzzle design the genre suffered from too. I never needed to resort to a guide, but there were a few frustrating moments where I was stuck wandering around like an idiot or fumbling with the really terrible inventory system. The first playthrough of this game, especially to someone less familiar with this sort of thing, will be a struggle. Along with the previously mentioned issues, enemies are very unconventional. Rather than killing them, they're intended to be narrowly avoided and memorised, until the second half where all threats are kind of a joke with the weaponry you can get your hands on. I feel like was I not aware of that before hand, a very easy game would've been a nightmare of constant deaths, \"what kind of zombie game DOESN'T make you kill the zombies, right?\"\n\nOverall, I love the groundwork established here. Judging from the series' massive success, I think its safe to say that this formula will be drastically improved moving forwards, but as of right now, I respect this more as a starting point for something great, rather than a great game itself. Its a bit rough to get into, and hasn't aged the best. Had I grown up with the series, I think I'd have a lot more praise for it, but just getting into it in 2023, the nostalgia isn't there to cover up the plethora of flaws, and it just leaves me feeling lukewarm about it in the end. That being said, I'm very excited to see how the series evolves moving forwards. 6.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1694401354, "timestamp_updated": 1694401354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557971000671386719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146095403": {"recommendationid": "146095403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286066511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 2716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2716, "last_played": 1694105419}, "language": "spanish", "review": "pues el primero de la franquicia con mejores gr\u00e1ficos y m\u00e1s historia. si ya el cl\u00e1sico era bueno, este al tener un poco m\u00e1s de lore pues es mejor xd as\u00ed que s\u00ed,obvio que lo recomiendo.", "timestamp_created": 1694401228, "timestamp_updated": 1694401246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146093609": {"recommendationid": "146093609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260399212", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1168, "last_played": 1694552639}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is definitely old and outdated , but once you get used to its systems(saving, combat and camera) its a very fun and atmospheric story game with a ton of charm.

La experiencia es muy diferente, es como pasarte 2 juegos diferentes (Salvando las claras distancias claramente), la campa\u00f1a de Chris es mas dificil pero DE COJ... Y no es malo porque a Diferencia del 0 la dificultad aqui esta llevada muy bien y nunca me senti atacado (hablo de querer pas\u00e1rmelo r\u00e1pido) cuando jugue con Chris me lo pase como un ni\u00f1o aparte otro detalle sumamente importante, dependiendo de como juegues tendras recompensas, desventajas y cambios en la historia pero el juego no es como un juego rol donde te dicen: Que haces? Le salvas o no? Nada de eso, tus acciones son las que cuentan nada te gu\u00eda mas all\u00e1 de lo justo y necesario.\n\n[b]* Puzzles: [/b] Son bastantes intuitivos aqu\u00ed a diferencia de el 0 (Que es cronol\u00f3gicamente predecesor pero realmente es sucesor hablando en tiempo de desarrollo) los puzzles tienen sus trucos, est\u00e1n bien hechos pero no son agobiantes mas bien son interesantes.\n\n[b]* Apartado Artistico: [/b] El juego para ser viejito se ve super bien, digo viejito porque es un remaster y se sobreentiende que le pasaron una manita a las texturas, al audio y lo pulieron mas, te saca unos sustos terribles gracias a su camara tipo tanque y el sonido envolvente, tiembla 5 noches con Alfredo.\n\n[b]* Jugabilidad: [/b] Aqui tenemos los cofres infinitos que hacen amena la experiencia solo guardas tus cositas ahi y si encuentras otra habitaci\u00f3n segura pues todas las cosas aparecer\u00e1n en ese cofre y viceversa, ayuda mucho a la jugabilidad te hace sentir libre y te permite planear tus rutas de manera mas amena, aparte de que la localizaci\u00f3n de los baules son GOD.\n\n[h1] Contras [/h1]\n\nAntes de todo, tengo que hacerle sus puntos negativos por cosas obvias pero ame este juego.\n\n[b]* Camara tipo tanque: [/b] Seguimos con la camara malandra, aun asi en este juego le hicieron arreglos para que sea mas amena pero a veces es tedioso y hay puzzles que literal los vas a fallar porque la camara te hizo el chiste del MILENIO, pero no es tan grave ya que le hicieron unas mejoras para que sea mas disfrutable, aun asi no la termino de digerir.\n\n[b]* Lore: [/b] El juego todo bien, pero cuando vamos a hablar de los siguientes Residents los personajes involucrados en el primero muestran inconsistencias, a que me refiero? Bueno que este juego al tener 2 campa\u00f1as apartes (No funciona como el 2 ya que el 2 si hace que la historia de los 2 sea consistente) pues se hacen referencias en otro juegos de que tal personaje hizo tal cosa, pero en su campa\u00f1a no lo hizo, pero en la otra campa\u00f1a si, pero te mencionan un dato de la otra campa\u00f1a y te quedas asi: 0_0.\n\n[b]* Errores de traducci\u00f3n: [/b] Este es un error que depende como lo veas es grave, hay que entender que el juego es del 2002 y en esos tiempos agradece que estuviera en espa\u00f1ol, pero en ocasiones hay errores de traducci\u00f3n que hacen que te pierdas he incluso hay un puzzle donde te quedas bien loco porque esta traducido mal, gracias a Dios el juego es tan intuitivo que a veces te pasas los puzzles sin las pistas que da el personaje, pero cuando tienes que hacerlo con las pistas del personaje, tendr\u00e1s que tener tu comprensi\u00f3n lectora al 2000%\n\n[h1] Conclusi\u00f3n [/h1]\n\nEste juego realmente lo ame terriblemente tenia mucho tiempo que no jugaba un juego que me hacia sentir as\u00ed, su duraci\u00f3n es lo justo para no hacerse cansino pero tampoco tan corto para dejarte un mal sabor de boca, la c\u00e1mara tipo tanque en este juego sufri\u00f3 unas mejoras terriblemente buenas que hacen que las personas que odiaban esta c\u00e1mara tampoco la amen pero la digieran mas f\u00e1cil, lo RECOMIENDO 100%\n\nNT: Creo que haber jugado el 0 primero me esta haciendo sobre valorar este juego, espero equivocarme", "timestamp_created": 1693149221, "timestamp_updated": 1693149221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145132773": {"recommendationid": "145132773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131701996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1927, "last_played": 1693100595}, "language": "english", "review": "Even after so many years my favourite Resident Evil game <3", "timestamp_created": 1693144766, "timestamp_updated": 1693144766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145109157": {"recommendationid": "145109157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074651353", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1006, "last_played": 1695455453}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say that's not been said so many times before...iconic start to an amazing series!

shows its age, RE1make is still a solid game to this day.\n\nIts a good survival horror, they used the fixed camera angles smartly by hiding threats outside of view, making you have to be wary of danger, be prepared for ambushes, cause the monsters arent always making noise.\n\nEvery shot counts, just like old RE, ammo isnt abundant, so you gotta play smart by choosing your battles, and which is better to just run away.\n\nInventory is severely limited as well, with Chris only being able to carry 6 items at a time and Jill being 8, and trust me, you really feel those 2 extra slots has Jill, so you also gotta be smart about what you choose to pick up stuff and when, since you cant get rid of it without the item boxes, this was painful has Chris before i knew better. \n\nWhile mostly not a problem, the fixed camera angles can be annoying at times, mainly when you need to move quickly, since the camera can change abruptly, which changes the direction of your movement, and if you cant adept quickly, you might end up running in circles.\n\nWhat really will get repetitive and annoying quickly is the doors, yeah, every time you go through a door or climb a ladder, you gotta sit through a fairly long animation for it, every SINGLE TIME, while theres a  mod to fix this, i feel the HD remaster of the game made over a decade after the original should have fixed it on its own.\n\nAfter finishing the game with both characters you will unlock some extra modes, one being a considerably harder version of the game, and the other being Invisible enemies, yes its exactly what it says, good luck, you will also unlock an extra enemy called \"One dangerous zombie\" and you better take that name seriously, cause otherwise, you will die.\n\nThe story is... meh, i wasnt really invested on it, granted the backstory of one of the creatures was pretty disturbing and interesting, but in general, the plot was pretty boring, and at times seriously nonsensical, specially in Jill's scenario. \n\nOverall, its a good old game, it has good horror ambiance, puzzles are simple and aged well, but you do gotta expect that old vibe, so it might feel somewhat clunky, similar to the tank controls of RE4. \n\nI give it a 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1692928317, "timestamp_updated": 1692928317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

This classic title is now really impossible to miss.\n\nWatch a snippet of gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwSu8BjilMw\n\nIn 1996, Resident Evil was one of the first survival horror games and has set the standard for other games as well.\nConsider, for example, the Silent Hill series, which had many similarities with the series.\nIn any case, it has established a genre and in the end Resident Evil managed to reinvent itself every time, although this was not always successful, but that aside.\nAnyone who has played this game in the past will agree that Resident Evil has put a big stamp on the survival horror genre.\nWith the arrival of this HD Remastered version, the old gameplay mechanics have been given a new look and you can fully enjoy the game in HD.\n\nEverything is pretty much the same as before, the camera angles, the movement options, and even the shooting has not changed, because you have 3 options: Shoot up and down and rotate a bit.\nYou hear a zombie shooting through its head, but aim upwards and if the zombie is far away, you only make sure that you riddle the ceiling. So a zombie must come closer.\nEven the loading screens when you open a door are also present.\nthis remaster is packed with extras. At the start you can choose between the classic costume or the costume from RE: Revelations for both characters. You can also unlock new costumes. However, there are still some secrets in the game.\nIf you beat the game within 5 hours, in addition to an Achievement, you would also receive a weapon with infinite ammunition ammunition. If you complete the game within 3 hours, you will get an even stronger weapon, also with infinite ammunition\n\nIs Resident Evil 1 scary? Yes, he sure is.

When you want a game to give you the same feeling that the original did, but with up-to-date quality of life improvements, new and more impressive graphics, and better sound quality... you rarely get all of those things together.  Most of the time you get improved graphical fidelity, and everything else is either 'meh' or just bad.  Thankfully, Resident Evil HD Remaster is not one of those games.  This is a game where everything was done exactly as it should have been.  It's better, and it feels just like the original game does.  Never before has a walk down memory lane felt so good, while the nostalgia was the icing on the cake, and not the rickety supports holding the entire structure up.\n\n\nMore:\n\nThis is how a Resident Evil game should be remade... or remastered... or whatever.  When you want to revisit a game, but you want that touch of 'newness' so that you feel like you're experiencing it for the first time, you should look to games like this.  Games like Resident Evil HD Remaster should be the bar by which games redone are measured.  It's good... no... it's great.  I couldn't have asked for more.\n\nThe pre-rendered backgrounds are one of the staples of the Resident Evil series.  Well... they are if you grew up when I did, and you actually remember Resident Evil as it was in the past.  It felt like watching a scary movie just as much as it felt like you were playing a game.  Better yet, it felt like you were playing a character in a scary movie.  I guess you had to be there to really get the idea that I'm trying to convey, or perhaps you had to have played the games since then.  \n\nWhen I played the Resident Evil 2 Remake, I did not feel like I was playing a Resident Evil game.  I did not give the game a good review, for various reasons, but I can totally see why people love the game.  It's not lost on me that the game can be viewed by some people as being amazing.  I get it.  I didn't like it that much, but more importantly... it did not capture the feeling of what a Resident Evil game is... at least not the way that I'm trying to convey it.  It was scary... yes.  It was gloomy... yes.  But that's not all Resident Evil is.  That's a surface level understanding of why Resident Evil was popular and why it basically laid the foundation for a specific type of survival horror game.\n\nI don't remember disliking anything in this game.  I played through the game with both characters, and it was exactly what I expected it to be.  There were some new additions that weren't in the original... but it still felt like the original.  I wish that Resident Evil 2 Remake was made in the same style as this game.\n\nUsually I touch on all the aspects of a game in a review.  I try to talk about the graphics, the sound design, the controls etc.  I'm just going to say that in this game, everything is great or good.  It is exactly what it needed to be.  It does the Resident Evil name proud.", "timestamp_created": 1692657666, "timestamp_updated": 1692657666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Beautiful graphics, no game-crashing bugs, and everything is just as horrific and nightmare inducing as I remember!

However, for Achievement Hunters, this game is also a goodie! Completely 100%able, no cheevo-breaking bugs... altho you will have quite a slog to get them all!\n\n**ACHIEVEMENTS**\n\nOk, let me start out by saying... the achievement runs are going to SUCK. Like REALLY REALLY SUUUUCK!!!\n\nThey ARE doable, but you're going to have to beat the game at least 4 times (on successive cleared saves, each loading from the last one's save file, just to be safe)... at least one of which will need to happen in less than 3 hours.\n\nThe games (at least in my plays) are going to be Normal, Hard, Real Survivor, and Invisible.  Play as each character twice, one play through each for rescuing everybody, one each for rescuing nobody. Jill is, IMO, better to save for Real Survivor mode, bc more personal inventory.\n\nThis is going to be annoying and very difficult! My four playthroughs took a total of about 20.1 hours, recorded time. Steam says I played 30.1 total hours all total, so yeah...\n\nTHIS IS A DOABLE 100% ACHIEVEMENTS GAME!

This title perfectly captures the essence of survival horror, blending atmospheric tension with challenging gameplay in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\n\nThe mansion setting is meticulously designed, creating an atmosphere of suspense and unease that's hard to match. Every creaking floorboard and distant moan of a zombie adds to the sense of impending doom, making exploration a heart-pounding adventure in itself. The pre-rendered backgrounds, despite their age, still manage to convey a hauntingly immersive experience that draws you deeper into the mysteries of the mansion.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics, while they might feel somewhat dated to newcomers, are integral to the game's charm. The limited inventory space and resource management add an extra layer of tension, forcing you to think strategically about every decision. Puzzles are both intriguing and satisfyingly challenging, making you feel accomplished as you piece together the clues and unlock new areas.\n\nThe character development and storyline are engaging, with a cast of memorable and diverse personalities, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The dynamic between the characters adds an extra layer of depth to the overall experience, making you feel invested in their journey.\n\nResident Evil 1 is a testament to the fact that great game design and storytelling can stand the test of time.

Capcoms decision to modernize this 1996 masterpiece with improved graphics and gameplay refinements has resulted in an experience that satisfies the veterans while captivating a new generation of players. \n\nThe updated visuals breathes new life into the environment while preserving the sense of isolation and dread that defined the series, whether its the fixed camera angles that add tension by hiding dangers or the music that suddenly cuts out and gets capitalised on with a jumpscare, there is always a feeling of dread and isolation.The lighting effects create shadows and the intricate architecture of the spencer mansion shines with clarity. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics remain true to the classic \"tank controls\" style which can be both nostalgic and polarizing for players accustomed to more fluid modern controls. While this choice maintains the original's authenticity, it might difficult for newcomers of the series to adjust to it, but it was definitely the right call from capcom.\n\nThe heart of Resident Evil lies in its exploration and puzzle-solving elements, something capcom seems to forget with every new release (cough cough re village). The mansion is filled with puzzles and secrets that really require you to pay attention to what you've seen.  While some puzzles remain as enigmatic as ever, others might feel a touch dated in design, potentially frustrating those who prefer more intuitive challenges. \n\nThe survival aspect of the game, represented by the limited resources and strategic item management, remains a cornerstone of the experience. The scarcity of ammo and health items forces players to make calculated decisions. Should I waste 4 bullets killing this zombie or risk having to come back here and get bitten needing to use a health item? This element of gameplay is what genuine survival horror is about, creating tension.\n\nWhether you're a series veteran or a newcomer seeking to explore its origins, Resident Evil HD Remaster offers an opportunity to relive or discover the origins of survival horror in all its gloomy glory.\n\nTL;DR: Get it Play it : )", "timestamp_created": 1691454145, "timestamp_updated": 1691454160,

There's also notes and letters that give clues and lore into the ongoings of the mansion which are fun to read. The characters are likeable, while their voice acting might be a bit dated its still pretty entertaining. \nThe Setting of the mansion is just so iconic and is filled with tones of areas to explore and survive through. I don't think there was a single area in the mansion i didn't enjoy. \nVisually, its impressive to look at. Performance was solid throughout my playtime and i didn't encounter any bugs or glitches. Even though this game was remastered for the gamecube, it still looks really nice and holds up. Art Direction is on point with every environment or enemy feeling as terrifying as the last. \nSound and Audio are also just great with the the soundtrack being so iconic especially with the save room music and the audio is pretty good when it comes to enemies or weapons or even just environmental stuff such as puzzles being solved. \nIn terms of Gameplay, it was really ahead of its time. I actually really like the movement and how well it accompanies the camera angles adding more tension. Puzzles are satisfying to solve as usual in the RE series. Enemies are well varied and are all a good challenge to go against.

There are workarounds via editing an ini file which are pretty easy to find if you google it.  All in all, if you want a nostalgia trip, or if you want to experience the first game for the first time, this is a solid experience.\n\nIf you'd like to see a video showcasing some of the gameplay, you can find the first episode of my playthrough here:\nhttps://youtu.be/E6_FavxUdp4\n\nHere is a link to my full playlist (uploading of episodes may still be in progress but there are more than a few there already):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfCTcyJ57ToHVId0zys_ecOl9GqtCUdBh", "timestamp_created": 1690217180, "timestamp_updated": 1690217180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636237263679504395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142698525": {"recommendationid": "142698525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309186940", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1774, "last_played": 1695205175}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]77/100 \uff5e Great[/b][/h1]\n\nMaybe it's because I am a fan of Resident Evil series, but it was a quite fun and nostalgic experience for me. The oldschool style of the game is so much nice that you can enjoy the sweet taste of old games from both the puzzles and the general lines of the game. The lore and story are kept quite simple, like a typical 90's game, as the game is probably not expected to develop that much in the future. I highly recommend you to play the game with Chris, if you want to get the pleasure of old games again. But if you don't want to tire yourself with inventory management, just go with Jill.\n\nFirst of all, I must say that the fixed camera in the game is sometimes bad and annoying, and sometimes it can reflect the atmosphere in a good way. You die directly due to a mistake you made due to carelessness in the game and you start from the last checkpoint. Actually sometimes I think this is a good thing because you usually can't die that way in new generation games, but almost every scenario that can kill you in real life also kills you in this game, like using a gunpowder gun or just running while keeping a chemical bottle in your inventory blows you up. It's hard to see that before dying once, but I like these small details.\n\nYour checkpoints are limited in the game. Only in rooms with typewriters, you can save the game if you have an ink in your inventory. Because of that it's so risky to save the game too often. And I think the real fun of the game is based on decision making. When you play with Chris you have 6 slots. And throughout the game, inventory and saving the game becomes your main enemy.\n\nOld-style puzzles, small inventory, limited saves and checkpoints, getting rid of all kinds of monsters gives you a very sweet experience. I think it is very nice that the game forces you in this way because it is almost impossible to find a game like this nowadays.  What I said may be a disadvantage of the game according to some, but I think it's a very good thing, in my opinion at least. Because games nowadays don't restrict players in this way anymore. More precisely, they are afraid of making the gameplay so challenging, so they put difficult bosses to make the game harder. Because they are afraid that the players will get bored with the game when they die and start over. Now everyone has a library of hundreds of games and when they are bored, they can easily switch to another game. But when Resident Evil first came out, everyone had very few game and they had to finish the games they had in the end by trying over and over again. Once you complete it, you would feel very good. This game gives that old completion pleasure to the player. \n\nOf course, there are cons of the game, such as boss battles are not more difficult than any normal zombies, or the fixed camera is sometimes so annoying... There is also a bug that the character starts to spin for no reason when you focus on somewhere. But I think the reasons I mentioned above compensated for them for me a little.", "timestamp_created": 1690199332, "timestamp_updated": 1690745442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571833014488220215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142697908": {"recommendationid": "142697908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003015325", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1700, "last_played": 1693487372}, "language": "english", "review": "The fixed camera angles and tank controls may be a little hard to get used to, but they've aged very well.

[/h1]\n\nAh, Resident Evil, the OG... Who doesn't know this game? Who doesn't meme with its voice acting all the freaking time?\n\nFor all the things it does right, Resident Evil HD remaster does a few things completely wrong. Let's delve into them, one at a time.\n\nIn this remaster, you take on the role of either Chris or Jill, the two most famous STARS soldiers who were sent to investigate a crashsite, only to be forced to take refuge in none other than the famous Spencer Mansion... Now if you haven't been living under a gaming rock, you'd know what Frakenstein-like experiments go on there, and if you didn't know, you're about to find out.\n\nThe game keeps its survival horror formula from the PS1 era, although this time around it introduces an alternate way to play the game. The voice lines have been improved (although not much, they are still cringeworthy). Other things to note are the smooth transitions from room to room... and I gotta say I had quite a blast running through the mansion, ONLY THE FIRST TIME THOUGH. The game requires you to play with a guide open, or else you'd get lost in this palace full of zombies / braindead people (like Richard).\n\nI stated that I had fun the FIRST TIME, because the inner achievement hunter in me really wanted to do a \"no-saving, only knife\" playthrough... but the thing is, after you beat the game ONCE, the game forces a punish-mechanic. Let me elaborate, one of your STARS friends who died then turned into a zombie. In the first playthrough, you could kill him no problems, you take his rocket launcher, you murder his mutilated white a*s and you move on... On your second playthrough, this guy chases you around and he's fully strapped with grenades, so if you dare hit him, you die... Imagine having been sitting down for two hours and I'm almost to the final boss, then this turd of a zombie comes out of nowhere and I jumpscare, shoot and die... and have to restart my run ALL OVER AGAIN. It's like, it's not enough that you now memorized ALL the zombie locations in the entire game, you'll have to play into this randomness... Couple that with the Invisible Enemy mode? Yup, it's a nightmare... You'd probably argue that I could lower the difficulty level; I tried... This relentless bastardo is still there, anywhere and everywhere... Gaaaah\n\nAnyways, the game gets [b]8/10 [/b], and it loses TWO WHOLE POINTS because of Agent Forrest...

If you're like me and unsure if you can handle it, I can assure you that the horror elements of this game are really no big deal. There was never a time in the game I was \"scared\", more just unsettled. The game isn't a screamer and most of the scary elements come from the environment and atmosphere.

I am not at all saying that this is a bad game, obviously the vast majority of folks enjoy it based on reviews; but Steam is asking if I recommend this game, and the answer to that is definitely no. I find it hard to fathom that I would be completely alone in my reasons for not liking this, so I offer this review as more of a caveat than trying to outright say you shouldn't buy it (TL;DR at bottom).\n\nFirst, I totally understand what an important game this is. The action horror genre is alive and well today, and this 27 year old game is an enormous reason for that. There's not a lot of games that have ever spawned an entire gaming category, let alone a series of movies, comics, and probably other media as well. Despite all this, I hadn't actually played any of the games. RE7 and Village look really good and I'm gonna get around to playing them, but I'm the kind of player that likes to play through entire series. So, I figured that the one that started it all is worth taking a look at.\n\nThis, of course, is not that game exactly. It's a remake. My best guess is that the parts that were re-done are done quite well. It looks nice, that's for sure. Not modern graphics exactly, but not 1996 graphics either. The control scheme/core mechanics of the game are though, and that made this totally unplayable for me. I have 3 specific major gripes which add up to being a total deal-breaker, and they're things I imagine would be major turn-offs for some others wanting to jump into this series here as well. They are the following:\n\n[b]1: Limited Saves.[/b] Saving is tied to a consumable item that you come across in the mansion. Since bag space is extremely limited, it's enormously cumbersome that your ability to save the damn game takes up a chunk of it. These items are only usable in specific locations as well. I get that saving this way is a design choice and a mechanic that some probably enjoy about this game. Elements of it persist on through the series, but it's not something I like at all in a game like this. It's something I do like in some games too; it feels great to finally get to that next bonfire and feel safe for a second. In this game though, I found it extremely frustrating that chunks of time and progress were just totally lost because I couldn't get back to the typewriter after having to backtrack because I couldn't pick up something else I needed because of that f!(#^ng ink ribbon in my inventory.\n\n[b]2: Fixed Cameras.[/b] Again, this is a design choice and one that works sometimes. It makes total sense in a game like this that devs want you to see it from the angles they choose. It adds tension and atmosphere and surprise and is something that's actually done well in that respect, but I found having to navigate this way extremely frustrating as well. If you keep holding the button through a camera transition you'll keep moving in the same direction. As soon as you make any kind of adjustment after the transition, you'll begin to move relative to the new camera position. Even in the calmest of moments, I found myself accidentally turning the wrong direction over and over again, even some times when I knew the transition was coming. Having this issue when attempting to run for my life was something I found completely untenable.\n\n[b]3: Combat.[/b] I found the aiming system totally unwieldy. The fact that you can't move while aiming alone feels totally wrong to me. Once your gun is up you can only turn left and right (camera relative, of course) at enemies that may be moving around you or even off-screen. There's very little in the way of feedback as to if your shots are even hitting the target sometimes, plus ammo is of course very limited. Add in the fact that you can only get hit 3 times before you die (and you better hope you used one of your precious save items recently if you do!) and it makes combat a terrifying experience for all the wrong reasons.\n\nThere's probably some very strong arguments for why these things shouldn't be deal-breakers. There's some workarounds for some of them too, probably. I only tried one of the control options and I'm sure I could have improved at both the combat and navigation if I played more (truthfully though, I figured that with the trouble I was having with early enemies that I couldn't possibly be able to get through any fights with any real complexity later). I got to this point where I [i]had[/i] to get by this one cerberus dog. I had full health and enough ammo to kill it, but it just kept getting me over and over and it just felt like whether or not I could kill it was more of a crap shoot than anything resembling skill. It took 5 attempts before I finally managed to get it down, and I managed to die before I could get to a save point so none of it mattered anyway. It was at this point that while Steam will say I played for 2.3 hours, I had only actually made like 25 minutes of game progress and had 0 minutes of fun in the process.\n\nLet me reiterate that all this is wholly a personal matter for me. The things I've described are all things I can get over in some games but really made trying to play this impossible. I like playing retro games and especially love the nostalgia blast of playing one from my youth. This game does not scratch that particular itch for me though, and as such I had no desire to slog through some archaic design as I have with some other games. If you happen to be somebody like me though and want to finally give Resident Evil a try starting at the beginning, heed my warning and skip this one. Do what I did: watch a story synopsis for this one and move on to the RE2 remake, it's superb. I've gotten considerably more than twice as much time into that one now, have loved every minute, and can still feel like I did my due diligence to the series.\n\nSo in conclusion I suppose: the odds are, if you're gonna buy this game you probably will like it. Even in the frustration I was experiencing, the elements of what made this series persist are clearly there. They were buried under what I personally found to be some unplayable systems that anyone looking to replay a game they once loved (or possibly anyone simply with more patience than me) could probably get over. This concludes my warning, thanks for sticking with me this long.\n\nTL;DR: A masterpiece from 1996 that spawned an entire genre, but unfortunately still plays like a game from 1996.

The story-line is quite a bit better than Resident Evil 0 and keeps its nostalgic sense of story telling in a classical horror video game genre view. I particularly enjoyed that there were multiple endings as well, depending on certain choices the player makes in this game. The atmosphere, sound and music overall is fantastic in giving the player a feeling of always being wary about the next step, what could be around the corner or in the next area.

The game was able to capture the true element of survival horror with its breathtaking set pieces and thrilling  boss fights that got my blood pumping. The games puzzles where without a doubt the best in the franchise there was not a single labyrinth that i found facile or dull. Another thing i really liked was that there was no clear objective and the game did not tell you where to go.

The game follows the members of a special forces team who are trapped in a mansion infested with zombies and other horrific creatures. The player must explore the mansion, solve puzzles, find weapons and ammo, and fight for their survival.\n\nThe game was originally released in 1996 for the PlayStation, but it was later ported to the PC in 1997. The PC version features the uncensored American version of the game, which has more gore and violence than the Japanese version. The PC version also has improved graphics and sound, but it suffers from some compatibility issues with modern computers.\n\nIn 2015, Capcom released a remastered HD version of the game for various platforms, including PC. The remastered version has enhanced visuals, audio, and controls, as well as new modes and features. The remastered version is widely praised as one of the best remakes of a classic game ever made.\n\nResident Evil is a must-play game for fans of horror and survival games. It has a gripping story, atmospheric environments, memorable characters, and tense gameplay. It is also a challenging game that requires strategy and resource management. The game has multiple endings and scenarios depending on the player\u2019s choices and actions.\n\nI would rate Resident Evil 1 on PC as 4.5 out of 5 stars. It is a masterpiece of horror gaming that still holds up well today. However, I would recommend playing the remastered HD version over the original PC version, as it offers a smoother and more immersive experience. You can buy the remastered HD version on Steam for $4.99 until July 13.\n\nPros:\n\nA faithful and enhanced remake of a classic game that preserves the original gameplay and atmosphere\n\nA stunning and realistic visual upgrade that makes the game look like a modern title\n\nA crisp and clear sound design that enhances the horror and immersion\n\nA new control scheme that allows the player to move in the direction they want to go\n\nA new widescreen mode that expands the field of view and adjusts the camera accordingly\n\nA new mode called Wesker Mode that lets the player play as the famous villain of all games Albert Wesker\n\nCons:\n\nThe game still has some of the flaws and limitations of the original game, such as limited save points and inventory space\n\nThe game still has some cheesy voice acting and dialogue that may detract from the immersion\n\nThe game may be too difficult or frustrating for some players who are not used to the survival horror genre", "timestamp_created": 1688372670, "timestamp_updated": 1688372670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141189121": {"recommendationid": "141189121", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247260901", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 473, "last_played": 1688358764}, "language": "english", "review": "IT'S A 6TH GEN CLASSIC AND GEM AS WELL!", "timestamp_created": 1688358917, "timestamp_updated": 1688358917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141173524": {"recommendationid": "141173524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028033982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 344, "last_played": 1568491959}, "language": "english", "review": "Most remakes tend to miss the mark completely, or just change a game entirely for the sake of changing it.

I couldn\u2019t tell you anything about Chris or any of the other characters, except Rebeca is a medic that plays the piano. There is basically no reason to care about any of the characters, and it doesn\u2019t feel like any of them have more than a thin veil of backstory.\n\nThe voice acting is basically a joke. It would be better to use a text to speech program for the game dialog. There may be more expression to the dialog that way. Or I guess just make it all text. Either way I just felt the dialog was cringe.\n\nThe graphics are mid. It is a remaster, but there is no 4k display option. Honestly the remaster could use a remaster.

But how they remade this game was so damn amazing, New Rooms to explore, The addition of Crimson Heads making every single zombie you drop having the chance to get back up unless you burn their corpses with the very limited amount of Kerosene that you can find, making almost every room and hallway tighten your sphincter harder than sitting on an ice cold toilet seat, and not to mention the changes of where they put enemies being some of the scarier moments, walking through that infamous hallway where two dogs leap through the windows, only this time, one just shatters a little bit, it's only later something will finally come out to attack you. Adding so much to a game made in 1996, which could be beaten in just a few hours now adding at least 6-8 hours on a first play-through possibly more if you suck balls at puzzles and fighting/dodging enemies. This series has become so close to my heart that I even am going back to replay every single Resident Evil game I can get my hands on just because it's awesome, not every game is a smash hit, and some of them even are bad, at least two of them are almost unplayable (*COUGH* Umbrella Corps, *COUGH* RE-sistance) but even with all that. It's always exciting to see what is around the corner with CAPCOM and the future of Resident Evil.", "timestamp_created": 1687821012, "timestamp_updated": 1687821129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140750813": {"recommendationid": "140750813", "author": {"steamid": "76561199114231732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1368, "last_played": 1688509090}, "language": "english", "review": "good\n", "timestamp_created": 1687808138, "timestamp_updated": 1687808138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140746967": {"recommendationid": "140746967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327090302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1687969783}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game, Very scary\n", "timestamp_created": 1687803557, "timestamp_updated": 1687803557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140733793": {"recommendationid": "140733793", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013930039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1687804321}, "language": "english", "review": "i shitted my pants", "timestamp_created": 1687786909, "timestamp_updated": 1687786909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140725463": {"recommendationid": "140725463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020581720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 876, "last_played": 1686278914}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite door opening simulator", "timestamp_created": 1687773891, "timestamp_updated": 1687773891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140718983": {"recommendationid": "140718983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353711432", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2023, "last_played": 1692517978}, "language": "english", "review": "This game fucks, okay?", "timestamp_created": 1687760622, "timestamp_updated": 1687760622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140656068": {"recommendationid": "140656068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198878382149", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 7562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7561, "last_played": 1689244338}, "language": "english", "review": "A thoroughly enjoyable experience. The fixed camera angles help enhance the horror, though at the detriment of character movement if you're playing with the alternate controls (the default setting). Supposedly, this isn't an issue when playing with the original controls (toggle-able in the settings), but I spent my entire playtime using the alternate controls and turned out just fine, so it's just a matter of getting used to it.\n\nA few things to note when playing this game:\n\n1. The initial difficulty selection menu consists of the choices \"mountain climbing\", \"hiking\", & \"walking\". This is equivalent to Normal, Easy, and Very Easy respectively. Hard, Real Survival and Invisible Enemy modes are unlocked later.\n\n2. The choice between playing as Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine is an important one as they both play differently. In general, Chris is slightly more difficult to play compared to Jill, so most people recommend playing as her for a first playthrough. That being said, my first playthrough was Chris on Easy and it was fine.\n\n3. For achievements that require multiple playthroughs (\"We're in This Together\", \"Starsenal\", \"Passion for Fashion\"), I believe that you need to complete them in the same save slot. When saving, remember to Overwrite as Cleared Data.\n\n4. After completing the game with both Chris & Jill on Normal difficulty or higher in a single save slot, One Dangerous Zombie mode is unlocked. This change is permanent and irreversible on that save slot unless you delete the save itself, so plan repeated playthroughs properly if you do not wish to experience this mode every single other time you do so.\n\nLastly, whenever you enter a different room, an unskippable cutscene of the door opening plays. I was fine with it since it helps me compose myself, especially when trying for the speedrun achievements, but some might find it annoying, so just a heads-up to those who care.", "timestamp_created": 1687672437, "timestamp_updated": 1687672437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729959666728973389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140649621": {"recommendationid": "140649621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048033994", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1289, "last_played": 1683149751}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1687660826, "timestamp_updated": 1687660826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492957741022109985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140643105": {"recommendationid": "140643105", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111364893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2013, "last_played": 1687471034}, "language": "english", "review": "I've liked video games for as long as I can remember.

It shows that prerendered graphics can absolutely work for modern games.\n\nBackground: The first REmake from 2002 was my introduction to the Resident Evil franchise. I logged a whole butt-ton of hours into the Gamecube version back in the day. Did a quick run after I bought this to see if I still got it, got sub 3 hours first try. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nNon-spoiler tips for anyone new to these games: \n[list]\n[*]Even though the camera switching may be jarring, don't let that intimidate you. If using a controller, the tank controls on the D-pad are your friend, as odd as that sounds. Hold forward on your d-pad and don't let go until you need to turn or you reach your destination. \n\n[*]Running past enemies *is* an option.  It took me a bit to get used to not killing every enemy in sight, but it's a crucial skill for survival horror (and Soulsborne games, but that's not what this review is for). Experiment with your controls and.\n\n[*]Read any files you come across. You'll get hints, answers, and some chilling lore that wasn't in the 1998 RE for PSX/Saturn.\n[/list]\nMy only complaint is a nitpick related to nostalgia more than how good this game is. [spoiler] I don't like that they patched out the infinite grenade round glitch. That glitch saved me when I was new and was great for casual runs with no unlocked weapons. [/spoiler]\n\nAll in all- It's a great remake of possibly the most influential game in the survival horror genre, given a fresh coat of paint to show it's still got it. It stays faithful to the game it was based on, while expanding on it in a meaningful way. If you want a Certified Classic\u2122, look no further. It stands tall among the greats of its era.\n\n[And if you feel like it when you're done with this, check out the original 1998 version. It's awful in so many wonderful ways and great where it counts. A casual eminder that jank can be a feature.

The characters are easily overwhelmed by anythings to come up in their way. The weapons are really useless and they'll never stop any of the enemies to come up to you and grab you. Not even the gun. Shoot 11 times a zombie to kill him (having to stop and move back because they don't stop coming) is quite annoying. You tell me \"that's the fun of the game\", but it's all trained military and police characters that can't hit a head at 1 meter distance. Ridiculous.\nThe fixed camera doesn't work too well with the new movement, which moves the character in the direction you press your stick, but on the camera change, the direction moves the character back instead of forward, it's really annoying in some points. The old style \"tank\" movement system is waaay too slow, you can't really play that way.\nThe character's storage is so minimal that you can easily get stuck, I had to restart the game because I picked up some shells and couldn't pick up an item to carry on. That's really bad design (having to restart a game because the character won't drop an item? really?), also unrealistic.\nBut back to what made me quit, is the stiffness of the characters and how defenceless they are. I got killed in the balcony after calling the dog, absolutely destroyed me, no chance of anything even having a gun and lots of bullets. \nI don't know if I'll be coming back to it, it's really boring and stupid. \nOn the positive side, the camera angles is an aspect that I always liked of the first RE, they feel very cinematic, and this remastered version looks pretty cool after all these years.\nIt's a very flawed game in terms of mechanics, it's unnecessarily frustrating and gives the player very little option to defend against the enemies. \nWas cheap enough to keep it in my library instead of refunding it, but I'm not too sure I want to play it anyway..", "timestamp_created": 1686434741, "timestamp_updated": 1686434741, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433070838451385498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139858731": {"recommendationid": "139858731", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228907905", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1698450362}, "language": "english", "review": "Spooky\n", "timestamp_created": 1686434693, "timestamp_updated": 1686434693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139856394": {"recommendationid": "139856394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173357586", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2689, "last_played": 1686431911}, "language": "english", "review": "Play Time -  10:54:43\nIf you want to spend your fucking life on this game then be my guest..\nWas it worth it...? haha... hahah... hahahahhahahahahah...", "timestamp_created": 1686431348, "timestamp_updated": 1686431348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139843755": {"recommendationid": "139843755", "author": {"steamid": "76561199167504979", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1686230519}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah It's Good.", "timestamp_created": 1686414268, "timestamp_updated": 1686414268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139828730": {"recommendationid": "139828730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185752791", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1686441413}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tremendo el residente del mal 1 en hd", "timestamp_created": 1686393775, "timestamp_updated": 1686393775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139820860": {"recommendationid": "139820860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039769171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 873, "last_played": 1685407784}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay game. Gunplay sucks. It's basically an escape room with zombies. If you didn't play this way back when, then it's probably not going to be fun.

Genuinely do not understand how people love this game as much as they do because it's not as fun as the remakes, 4 or even 5. Nostalgia glasses apparently have a strong prescription for RE fans. However, it is worth experiencing. I hope they remake it in RE Engine. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say survival horror doesn't have to be defined by tank controls and fixed cameras with awkward controls to be good or \"scary\". Horror doesn't come from cumbersome control or limited view. It's all in the sound design.

After finishing it I instantly bought 1,2,3. So I turn on this part 1 remaster, really good intro, nice atmosphere and cinematographics etc, but this camera and those terrible controls, super fucking clunky combat make this impossible to play for me, seriously. The saving system is an absolute joke, before you learn to navigate the character you will just die and you gotta replay the same shit over and over again. Maybe if someone had played it like 25 years ago and shit, they could enjoy it due to the sentiment and stuff. For me it's a hard pass, ima have to just watch the story on youtube and proceed to part 2. Fucking shame but it feels worse to methan tomb raider 1 and 2 controls, whoever played them will understand my physical pain....\n\n\nEDIT: So I gave this game like additonal ~2hours, I'm not giving up, and I have some additional comments. This game is mechanically so bad that if it was food, it would be tuna pineapple pizza...\n\nEDIT2: So I beat this fucking piece of shit with the dude, and tried to run it on hard wit hthe chick HAHAHAHAH. Epic joke this game. Since you cannot dodge the zombies cause they just randomly hit u even when they are not looking at u (tried to run the same shit like 15 times), and they are just bullet sponges. I gave up at 16th attempt when the zombie didn't even fall to the ground after getting 8 bullets with a handun. I mean really? You start with 15 bullets and u cannot even kill 2 zombies with that, while you getting hit ONCE is insta danger. Twice without healing is insta death. Absolutely ridiculous BS.

It wasn't until I finished the original RE and went back to reply this one that I finally found my enjoyment. The first hour of REmake is overwhelming and not fun - it takes ages to find the first item box, and before then you've already been to several rooms, seen several puzzles, and had to leave behind several items. After that it gets better, so if you're at this point thinking if you should rely on a walkthrough, I'd say give it some more time. And when it gets good, it gets really good; the flow of exploration easily tops the original, and ranks among the best in the series. It also looks like a million bucks, especially on smaller screens (on a bigger one you might notice flaws in the AI-upscaled backgrounds). It's a great atmospheric romp through a fun B-movie setting with a bunch of flat but attractive characters, with some nice puzzles and stressful combat situations.

It's a game that improves on the original on most things, yet it surprisingly does away with some things that were really cool on the original.\n\nThe visuals and the iconic Spencer mansion layout received quite the overhaul, so returning vets from the PSX version had a lot of new surprises to face. The acting was much more improved over the campy, B movie style of the original (I don't really know whether to consider this an improvement or not, since the goofy voicework and corny script of the original were indeed half the fun!) The soundtrack was a remixed version of the original game and not the one used on the third version released (Resident Evil Director's Cut: Dual Shock Edition), I would have preffered Capcom had used both soundtracks and gave the chance to choose which one you would preffer on any given playthrough..., too bad.\n\nContent wise, the game featured a new and intriguing side plot to the original game's storyline in the form of one of the new bosses you face: Lisa Trevor. Aside from that, as well as some rather surprising changes regarding Richard Aiken, the game's story doesn't really deviate much from the original. However, I do have to point the fact that the game's story now encourages a set route and order to do things, unlike the original where if you wanted to mix things up and go to places you hadn't gone earlier in previous playthroughs, you would discover additional cutscenes that changed slightly the game's story. However, new mechanics are available such as the defensive items which can save you in a pinch!\n\nAll in all, the game's pros are more numerous than its cons and I love to play this often along with the original. Just do not expect an easy challenge, for that is what defined the original survival horror genre back in the day!", "timestamp_created": 1685850353, "timestamp_updated": 1685850353, "voted_up": true,

And now, it's back in all its HD-remastered glory! Get ready to revisit the Spencer Mansion, where the undead roams, puzzles abound, and the ink ribbons are as scarce as a decent haircut during a quarantine. This game is like a fine wine\u2014it stands the test of time, leaving you equal parts terrified and tickled.\nFirst things first, let's talk about those crispy HD graphics. Gone are the days of pixelated zombies that looked more like angry Tetris blocks. Now, you can behold the zombies in all their decomposing glory, with every festering wound and hungry groan lovingly rendered in high definition. It's like a terrifying art gallery where you get to shoot the exhibits. Who said the violence can't be beautiful?\nBut fear not, fellow zombie slayers, for this remake remains faithful to the classic Resident Evil experience. The tank controls are back, reminding us of the joyous struggle of maneuvering our characters like drunken ballerinas. You'll find yourself running face-first into walls, attempting a simple 180-degree turn, and accidentally firing your shotgun at the wall while a zombie chews on your neck. Ah, good times!\nOf course, we must remember the iconic dialogue. The voice acting in Resident Evil HD Remake is a true masterclass in unintentional comedy. Each line is delivered with such dramatic flair that it's hard to keep a straight face. Who can forget the iconic \"You were almost a Jill sandwich\" line? It's a gourmet feast of cringe that keeps on giving.\nNow, let's talk puzzles. Oh, those glorious, brain-teasing puzzles that will make you question your own sanity. Resident Evil HD Remake brings back the joy of finding obscure keys, deciphering cryptic symbols, and rearranging statues like you're trying to win a demented game of interior design. Remember, when in doubt, examine everything, combine everything, and pray that you don't run out of ink ribbons right before a boss fight.\nOne of the joys of this game is the sense of dread it instills. Every door you open, every shadow you glimpse, and every distant groan sends a shiver down your spine. The atmosphere is thick with tension, and the jump scares are as effective as ever. You'll find yourself nervously inching forward, holding your breath, and then promptly screaming like a banshee when a zombie bursts through the window. It's cardio and a gaming experience all in one!\nResident Evil HD Remake is a testament to the fact that a game can stand the test of time. It captures the essence of the original while adding a fresh coat of HD paint. Whether you're a long-time fan reliving the terror or a newcomer experiencing the game for the first time, there's something undeniably special about the survival horror masterpiece that is Resident Evil.\nSo, grab your herbs, load your trusty shotgun, and prepare to embark on a journey through the Spencer Mansion that will leave you both frightened and entertained. Resident Evil HD Remake proves that even in the world of zombies and cheesy dialogue, there's a timeless charm that continues to captivate gamers of all generations.

Trust me just stick with it until you get used to the controls. It's rare I play a game 2x in a row even if it's short like this but this game made it worth it. Second play through is a blast because you know where everything is and you can basically speed run it it's also slightly different from a story prospective if you choose a different character or make different choices within the campaign. It has that classic resident evil gameplay that's just so satisfying. It's more about path finding and puzzle solving than shooting everything in sight or at least you are heavily encourage not to due to limited resources. Resource management is extremely important as well as limited with only 6 slots with Chris and 8 with Jill you are constantly encouraged to use your brain in these types of survival horror games everything is a choice. The story is simple but good the voice acting is bad but I think that's intentional due to the original having bad voice acting to be authentic. The graphics are phenomenal for it's age pre rendered backgrounds just hold up incredibly well to me because they could push much higher fidelity with it than actual 3d models at the time. The locked camera angles really add to the atmosphere of the game as well as the tension. I really don't get the hate when it comes to locked cameras I think it's extremely under rated people just need to give games more of a chance outside of the usual behind the shoulder or first person view it works incredibly well to increase the presentation.  This is currently the best way to play this game because it has actual full analog support it plays great with a controller and good on the keyboard.

The game is not terrible but it also hasn't aged very well in various aspects. Let me go through the core aspects of the game and what I see as positives and negatives.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nThe game overall in this HD version still looks pretty good. The backgrounds are well drawn and the lightning flashing in the background gives it a pretty good atmosphere. The character models are also still pretty good. Still sometimes you also find some pretty low resolution background where it will be difficult to identify things. The CGI video sequences are okay in terms of quality.\n\n[u] Sound Design [/u]\nThe sound design is pretty good. You can hear your own steps on the different undergrounds pretty well as well as recognize enemies based on their sounds which is pretty important due to the fixed camera positions. The music also provides a decent atmosphere and the game also knows when to tone down the music to build up anticipation. The voice actors are doing an okay job. It's better than the original but still overall just mediocre.\n\n[u] Map Design [/u]\nThe basic layout in many aspects is similar compared to the original but adds some new areas and modifies some existing ones. The remake has changed some of the older puzzles and introduced new ones. The remake is overall a bit bigger than the original I'd say and the new areas are well implemented into the overall design. Nothing feels out of place.\n\n[u] Enemy Design [/u]\nWe have the classical enemies from the original and some new ones as well. In addition they've added some new mini bosses. The enemy design overall is fair. It's intended to provide a challenge while at times you have to consider whether fighting is the correct choice or running the better alternative.\n\n[u] Story and Characters [/u]\nThe story and characters outside some minor tweaks have mostly stay the same compared to the original. It's a campy and goofy story about a zombie plague outbreak with some conspiracy in the background. They added some new information to build a connection to Resident Evil 2 and added some background story on the new minor bosses. It's servicable but shouldn't be taken to serious. This unfortunately affects the horror factor of the game in a negative way as you cannot really take any of it serious.\n\n[u] Gameplay [/u]\nHere comes the big issue for me as the gameplay of Resident Evil 1 has aged poorly in various aspects. Compared to the original it is now possible to use knifes and grenades to push enemies away from you and possibly land a one hit kill. In addition zombie corpses will not just disappear but if the head is still intact they will just drop to the ground and may re-awaken later. You can burn the corpses though to block that. It may be a good option in areas where you have to walk through several times. This is necessary as during your first playthrough players will be backtracking constantly and EXTENSIVELY. If you do not know where everything is located and where items have to be used you will walk/run around a LOT. Over 60% of the game is basically just running through areas of the mansion where you may to do something you couldn't do ealier or getting items into the storage room for later use as well as then taking items later again. This will be necessary as Chris for example has only 6 item slots in his inventory. If you carry a weapon + ammo you already lose 2 slots. If you add another more powerful weapon then half of the slots are already gone. Now add maybe a health recovery item and it leaves only two slots. Often you have to carry a key that leaves one slot to pick up new items. This is just poor design and a restriction to artificially stretch out the game length. Inventory management and memorizing the map layout become essential parts of the game. You really have to keep the inventory load to a minimum to ensure you can get as many relevant items as possible from your target locations.\n\nThe constant running around with backtracking where not much actually happens also causes the RE to become boring after a while. After the initial excitement and basic layout exploration the game basically comes down to:\n1. Lighten inventory in storage room\n2. Go to next room you haven't explored\n3. Pick up relevant items\n4. If inventory is not full go to next room you can open and pick up items\n5. Return to storage room to lighten inventory\n6. Repeat\n\nOnce you find riddles and specific key locations you will then take relevant items with you to unlock the next mystery but then it basically returns to the principle from before. Something that really annoyed me was while I was playing with the controller the stick by default always made my character run. At some point I had to pick up an item that would kill my character randomly if I started to run. So I purposely had to completely change the way I controlled the character as the standard controls would kill my character. I have no idea why anyone thought this was a good idea...\n\nAnyway the combat controls are pretty straight forward. You go into a room and look at the door again. You hold the aim key and see if your character turns around to focus on a target. If he does an enemy is there and you can decide on whether to shoot at him or not. you can point guns up or downwards but outside of potenially knocking an enemy to the ground or blasting its head immediately when they are close it doesn't do much. The game aims at the enemies automatically and there is no skill involved there. So pretty basic combat.\n\nThe game got me a few times on jump scares (zombie behind a corner for example) but outside of that it's not really scary to be honest. Maybe I've just numbed down to much in the last few years to horror but for me the experience overall was mild.\n\nFinally I think it's fine to buy the game when it's on sale but I wouldn't buy it at a price higher than 10\u20ac.", "timestamp_created": 1683829653, "timestamp_updated": 1683829653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464753597974777222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138130807": {"recommendationid": "138130807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870395007", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1601, "last_played": 1699894443}, "language": "english", "review": "Even twenty plus years later, a very worthy remake. \n\nNever played the original, and this is my first time playing this remake (my first RE was the RE3, then RE2 over a decade ago), but it still holds up.

However there are a couple of notes that may challenge some:\n-The default controls are not recommended, and research into better controller layouts (not re-bindable) is needed.\n-Camera angles are fixed and the movement between 'shots' is a bit jarring at first but you get used to it\n-Some resources are limited, including the ability to save - which has a learning curve on how to manage your resources\n-A couple of puzzles are pretty confusing to solve - There was only 1 I encountered that I struggled with, the rest could be solved with trial-and-error\n-The game doesn't make it clear about discardable items (keys), and it's consequences for not selecting 'yes' by not allowing you to ever get rid of it.\n\nOverall this is one of the best games I've played and will remember it.",

Did a 14 part let's play series on it for my YouTube channel and had a lot of fun.\n\nThe whole universe its creating is dope, and it is interesting to see where the franchise started. The introduction of these weird hybrid creatures, colossal bosses, hell hounds and sprinting zombies was epic, and the whole map where the game takes place is amazing where you have to go back and forth between old and new places to reveal new places in these old place.\n\nThe game also looks gorgeous! Other than the weird disconnected of the characters from their background, the environments look stellar, and the lighting in them even better.\n\nAnd I really loved the feature of finding out how the game mechanics work just by playing the game, picking up books and documents, but also trial and error (bear in mind this cause some frustration on my end as well though).\n\nBut MY. FUCKING. GOD! This game frustrated me beyond measure!\n\nThe fixed camera angles, in theory, is cool. And it makes for some cinematic game-play at every turn. But fucking NO! Never fucking again. They introduced the worst gaming experience for me to date. I would sometimes spend a solid five attempts in some areas where the camera angles would change three times in a second, leaving me to have my character spinning in circles on the spot as I couldn't comprehend which button to press to just go forward. As well as this, the amount of time I died or became hurt to enemies because of these fucked fixed camera angles simply because I was rushing and didn't have time to think about every keystroke I was pressing to just run in one single direction was astounding.\n\nThe doors... fuck... the doors. I understand that this was more than likely a way to keep computers or consoles back in the day from burning up in flames from having to load a whole map. But when remastered/remade you'd expect gaming devices back then to be able to handle loading a map of this size? No? If not, then in 2023, how have the devs not done a simple re-release to remove this fucking stupid ass feature of waiting too go through doors. Ya'll know how hard it is to commentate while literally a door is opening and closing on screen?!\n\nThe puzzles nearly had my brain exploding in my head. Am I the only one that struggled with them?! Am I just THAT dumb?! I respect that almost every one of them are different and require a unique perspective of out the box thinking to solve them and this is more similar to puzzles you'd face in a real life scenario. But no. I play games to get away from real life. I need a coherent line of puzzles that aren't all out of the box and don't sometimes rely on outside components of the puzzle room and other times components inside the room and other times require you to pull objects apart or combine other components that don't even seem like they'd combine even if Jesus tried to combine them. Fuck. \n\nThe enemies are cool, the boss battles were actually pretty easy. But the amount of times I was astounded by being killed with an INSTANT KILL when I was full health was astounding.

After the release of the Resident Evil 2 remake I was interested in comparing and contrasting it to it's original PS1 version from 1998. I ended up loving the fixed camera and the door animations didn't bother me as much as I expected. \n\nThat was a few years ago; cut to present day and I decided to try out the remake of the very first Resident Evil game. While most modern gamers\u2122 may be trepidatious to try out a game like REHD Remaster, I had heard over and over from old school fans how this is the definitive classic RE game. So I went in with high expectations, fully embracing the fixed camera (that I had grown to adore) and hesitantly accepting the punishingly long door animations. \n\n[h1] THE GOOD [/h1]\n\n[b] STORY/CHARACTERS [/b]\nGoing in I had no expectations for this game's story beyond knowing the basic plot. However I quickly fell in love with the different characters the game had to offer. The game perfectly balances having the player feel lonely as they explore the mansion while simultaneously having recurring appearances from the cast. As the game goes on you run into the different characters, and while each interaction is short, it's expertly written to endear you to each character enough to that you genuinely care to see their story through and achieve the \"best ending\".\n\n[b] REPLAYABILITY [/b]\nDuring my hunt for 100% of achievements, I probably went through the entire game from start to finish about 6 or 7 times. Each playthrough was radically different than the previous one, due to the game masterfully increasing the challenge with each run. Modes like \"Complete the game with only your knife\" or \"Invisible enemy mode\" are gimmicky and seemingly present an unfair challenge, however the moment to moment gameplay during these modes is fun throughout, and never is there a challenge or fight that is truly insurmountable.\n\n The most satisfying mode by far is \"Real Survival\" which presents a challenge so hard I didn't dare even try it till my final playthrough. In this mode the game is set to the hardest difficulty, item boxes are disconnected (this is a huge change from the regular difficulties & modes) and auto aim is turned off. Completing this mode was truly hellish, however the satisfaction felt from seeing the credits at the end made the 37 hours~ I had put into the game to get up to that moment made it all worth it. \n\n[b] GAMEPLAY [/b]\nThe fixed camera in this game is masterfully placed, making you feel like you're watching a film throughout. There are 1 or 2 angles that most players (including myself) struggle to orient themselves around, however for the most part the angles are great. \n\nThere isn't much variety in the weaponry, however the weapons that are available feel very satisfying to use. Especially the grenade launcher which is hilariously overpowered for a game like this. \n\nBoss fights are all great. \n\nThe puzzles are all satisfying and challenging, though sometimes they can be a bit slow. \n\n[h1] THE BAD [/h1]\n\n- Door animations are too long (can be fixed with mods)\n- Some cutscenes are very low quality due to not being remade\n- Some puzzles/boss fights have unskippable cutscenes \n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nREHD Remaster is a great and satisfying game with plenty of variety to offer anyone who's willing to give it a chance.

Through all the years this franchise existed the developers tried new formats. But this game is closer to the PS1 retro era. Except for the controls. You can use a more convenient control scheme. This makes game easier to dive into for newcomers.\n\nNowadays, there are remakes of parts 2-4 with modern 3rd person camera so you may not like being unable to control the camera and properly aim. This is ok. As for me, I like that style. The camera takes spectacular angles picked by the developers themselves to present you a certain scene in the best way possible. Combined with the absence of the interface while controlling the character and thorougly drawn static lighting on the levels, that brings to the atmosphere and gives you a cinematic feeling, like you're really watching a good horror movie. Even though this camera was used just because of pre-rendered backgrounds, it made the game better and unique.\n\nAnd yeah, this game is really scary. Not only because of some jumscares. I advise you to play it blind and figure it out totally on your own. That's the most proper way to play it. The first playthrough will be the most thrilling. You never know what events will be triggered by your actions. You never know if the next room will have enemies or not. And your ability to save is restricted. This makes you feel uncomfortable and paranoid. You have to manage your resources and take risks. That's why the developers called this game a survival horror. I believe games should give you emotions. Resident Evil I definitely delivers you strong ones.\n\nThe puzzles here are harder than in the subsequent games of the series. They test your memory, intuition and logic. And yeah, you have to be really observant and attentive to solve some of them. You need to search in every nook and cranny and read some important notes to figure out what to do.\n\nI noticed that people who like Dark Souls play Resident Evil games as well. These series have a couple of things in common. Strong enemies that you have to avoid, even stronger bosses, metroidvania style of level design with searching for keys, backtracking and opening shortcuts. I could say that Dark Souls is just Resident Evil with swords and armor. But the most important feature these two share is the feeling of great accomplishment, whether it comes from taking down a strong enemy, figuring out a complicated puzzle or questline or discovering a powerful weapon in a hidden location. The main trait of that aprroach to game desgin is uniqueness of each such event. You see, every dungeon in TES or Diablo, every outpost in Far Cry or Assassin's Creed, every quest in World of Warcraft is not much different from another one. These games are repetitive. With each accomplishment, they don't give the feeling that you really reached or achieved something. Your every action is just a tiny drop in the ocean. They don't have enough value to make impress you with what you just did. Whereas in DS and RE, each action is meaningful, you feel each one of them affecting your laythrough a lot.\n\nOf course this game is not perfect. There are some frustrating moments. For example, the camera is good for the horror, but not for the combat. Sometimes you won't even clearly see the enemy you're shooting at. Thank the character automaticallu turns to the enemy. But it doesn't work good if there are several enemies attacking you.\n\nSome puzzles are hard to solve because you didn't find a clue because you didn't notice somewhere on the level just because it didn't stand out much and blended into the backgorund. Also there is a moment when you have to remember a note you've read a 1/3 of the overall game time ago to proceed to a new area. Some items and notes are hard to take or read for the same reason. Some of them are hard to reach because of the controls and hitboxes even if you know their locations and stand right in front of them.\n\nYour inventory is small and there is no way to extend it. This leads to a lot of backtracking, especially when you play the game for the first time and don't know what stuff you need to take to pass certain area and what stuff you will find there. Chris has even less backpack slots than Jill so put him away for a second playthrough.\n\nFor the conclusion, I would like to state that this game deserves a playthrough, and even more than a single one. But only if you don't mind its format.

It has an excellent atmosphere, satisfying game play, and great exploration.  You play as either Jill or Chris and experience their night in the Spencer Mansion.  Each character's journey is masterfully designed with many story and game play changes.  The Spencer Mansion is one of the best locations ever developed in a video game.  It is not only scary, but well designed with plenty of doors and areas that unlock as you play.  Its level design encourages not only exploration, but memorization of enemies locations and room layouts .  This is also the first game in the story, and doesn't have the issue of being unbelievable like future games.  The characters introduced are iconic and very likable. \nThe issues a player may face with this game are small, but present.  The tank controls may push some people away because they function very differently from modern control schemes.  Also, as this game is over twenty years old, you will notice some places where it shows its age.  Some of the backgrounds can look a little blurry, especially in the aqua ring and a few of the cutscenes are compressed.  These issues are minor though, and the game has aged very well.\nOverall, this game deserves its place as a classic.  It is the gold standard, not only for survival horror but horror in general.\nTLDR  An all time great game with excellent atmosphere, gameplay and characters.  Some may take issues with controls or backgrounds, but these are minor and shouldn't stop you from play this excellent game.", "timestamp_created": 1683229273, "timestamp_updated": 1683229273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137793920": {"recommendationid": "137793920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324325267", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1237, "last_played": 1683226741}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVED IT!!!! i was kinda anxious with the camera angles first but after getting used to it, this game was absolutely so much fun <3333 gonna do chris' route later!!!", "timestamp_created": 1683228371, "timestamp_updated": 1683228371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137790726": {"recommendationid": "137790726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149757451", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1682953165}, "language": "english", "review": "They have escaped into the mansion, where they thought it was safe.\nYet...", "timestamp_created": 1683224132, "timestamp_updated": 1683224132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137790101": {"recommendationid": "137790101", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013853220", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 700, "last_played": 1683033864}, "language": "english", "review": "The residents were indeed evil. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1683223335, "timestamp_updated": 1683223335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137764641": {"recommendationid": "137764641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836140615", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1686794987}, "language": "english", "review": "can confidently say this is definitely a Resident Evil game", "timestamp_created": 1683178138, "timestamp_updated": 1683178138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137761977": {"recommendationid": "137761977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025289550", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2746, "last_played": 1683685696}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played a lot of survival horror games, and this one is by far the best. \n\nMany people seem to say that nostalgia is why this game is so well-regarded; however I can say I played it for the first time in 2023 and I'm still seriously impressed with how great it is. I don't find any mechanics or controls to be outdated, maybe the lack of automatic box sorting is the one exception. The optional tank controls will feel strange at first if you're not used to them, however it only takes a few minutes to adjust, and I do recommend them. They work much better with the fixed camera angles.\n\nThe initial difficulty levels as presented are \n\n1. Normal (mountain)\n2. Easy (hike)\n3. Very Easy (walk)\n\nI'd recommend sticking with normal, although easy isn't a bad choice either as this game is more challenging than modern games. I'd avoid very easy as this will trivialize the experience. I also recommend choosing Jill Valentine as your character for the first run - she has a larger inventory and a lock pick. Chris Redfield can take more damage and has a lighter, but Jill's benefits are much stronger.\n\nI'd rank this as tied for best entry in the series along with RE4 remake. This is the best of the survival horror RE games, RE4R is the best of the action entries.\n\nI hope that Capcom will consider making some more survival horror entries in the mainline series, they're truly something special.", "timestamp_created": 1683171414, "timestamp_updated": 1683171414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137760264": {"recommendationid": "137760264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168194652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 935, "last_played": 1663517208}, "language": "english", "review": "this is probably my favorite resident evil. resident evil 4 may have been what breathed new life into survival horror, but resident evil 1 is what defined it in the first place. \n\nthe spencer mansion in the arklay mountains has to be one of my favorite locations for any piece of horror media at this point. it is brimming with attention to detail, and features such a moody and oppressive atmosphere. this is in no due part to the unfathomly excellent level design. the mansion itself is like a puzzle to solve. it is beautifully interconnected but slightly obtuse on purpose, as to let the player feel like they are solving the puzzle. \n\nthe gameplay loop is so amazing because of how much the game takes away from you. you barely get any inventory space in this game, nor do you have any idea when you are going to need any item. therefore, good item management is a gameplay element itself when going through the mansion. you have to make decisions on whether you will need to sacrifice space for ammo for a key item, or maybe you take the bigger shotgun instead of some healing items. ultimately, the game breeds player ingenuity out of restricting you. \n\nthis game , i think is scary or at the very least...,, its stressful (the fun kind). there are a few clear reasons for this that all connect. first one, is that enemies take forever to die. couple this with the fact that you barely receive ammo, this makes every enemy a threat on the simple premise that you might not want to use ammo on that enemy since you might need it later (mayybe for a boss, for example). secondly, you back track A LOT. which means if yyou dont kill those enemies, you will be running from them forever. this makes it kind of tense to go around the mansion. you might be forced to backtrack to an area full of enemies multiple times, but you cant afford to waste precious ammo. lastlyy, you do not get unlimited save. saving is also someting you need to think about which is insanely scary. as a whole, you could technically sum up the game as a puzzle exploration game where the puzzle is item management.\n\nthe story is absurdly campy and cheesy, due to the time period it released in. like the voice acting is so silly and funny i love it. jill valentine is also soooooo good , like jill, girlllll why are you there. whyy does everyone always wanna split up around you SSKSKSKS SKSKSK .\n\nALSO THOSE VISUALS!!!

this review, anyone who defends fixed cameras is lying to themselves, held back by nostalgia or weird. No one actually likes them anymore and that doesn't make them a coward it makes them normal. Wait for a remake just because of how fucking stupid fixed cameras are. \n\nI genuinely like the game, I 100% completed it, I played it multiple times. I love the characters, the plot and the atmosphere but I can't recommend it just because of how horribly I feel the gameplay has aged. The controls are horrible, the cameras are infuriating with how bad they are, and completely ruining a lot of the amazing atmosphere and horror elements, I would seriously advise waiting for ANOTHER remake unless you're already a big fan of the franchise, or liked fixed cameras SOMEHOW. I would recommend it in every other way, it's just that I fully feel that the cameras and controls make a lot of that not even feel worth it. It also completely removes one of my favorite things about Resident Evil, which was how you have to learn your own gameplay style, the AI and your weapons, in here the only thing it feels like you learn is how to deal with the awful controls and cameras, which are borderline impossible on keyboard and mouse and still extremely hard on controller, you don't have to learn jackshit of the gameplay you just have to learn how to not immediately quit because the cameras AGAIN fucked you over and caused you to have to restart. With how horribly they collide with the awful tank controls? Just wait for a remake. 9/10 game in every other way, 2/10 controls.\n\nNot to mention the fact that I had to practically force myself to finish it, I wanted to see where it all began, the whole story, and I wanted to 100% them all. You could say I did a lot of it to myself, sure but most people WOULDN'T DO THAT, most people who are casually into the series, and want to see what it's all about won't really suffer through these awful controls just for that. NOR would I recommend them too, I seriously hope a remake comes out so more people can actually see the great story this game has but I honestly respect and would do the same if I wasn't a big fan of the series. Anyone who says this does NOT need a remake is delusional, if you're a casual fan just wait, don't have your impression of this game ruined just to get it over with, just wait for a remake.

Often there's things you won't understand the significance of, or just won't have the key for, and you're meant to chain the puzzles together into a series of gameplay strings taking you on winding paths across the mansion and its grounds. The puzzles have some interesting logic to them sometimes, and the new horrors crawling through the area make you treat the map like a secondary puzzle, asking if you can safely make it between two places in these winding halls without expending your ever more limited supply of ammunition. While my first run on (what turned out to be) easy difficulty had me never outright run out of ammunition, I did come alarmingly close.\n\nA side note on the difficulty selection, I did appreciate that it just asked how you like your games in terms of difficulty and focus on narrative or gameplay, similarly to how some games call their easiest difficulty a \"story mode\". It presented me with three options, I chose the middle one and the game accepted with no remark. No shame in choosing that way to play, just how you want to experience a game that's held up incredibly well (as long as you don't mind tank controls, but even then there's an option to use a different control scheme). Add into that a graphical upgrade that helps the atmosphere far more than any visual on the Gamecube could, and you have a remarkable piece of history brought forward for modern gamers to experience.

The level design of the mansion is brilliant and the residency/aqua ring is by far my favourite area. The puzzles as a whole are really good and the game did end up scaring me a few times. \nI played on the normal difficulty and the amount of resources and saves the game gave you felt perfect. (i also so far have only beat the game using Jill) \nThe game has a really interesting story and i loved the designs of the enemies especially lisa and plant 42 \nThe hunters were really fun to but this was because the magnum was an awesome weapon. \nThis is a personal thing but i absolutely love the look of old 3d games. The games graphics in my opinion are amazing  \ni love the fact that there is a very limited amount of saves. It makes each one feel precious and you have to have a little debate with yourself about if you want to use an ink ribbon or save it for later \n\nThe weapons feel good \nespecially the magnum \n\n\nThere are a few issues though \nthe movement feels really clunky and because of the way cameras work often times you are shooting at enemies you do not even see\nThis can be frustrating because as a result of you not knowing where enemies are, you can take some really cheap hits plus multiple times the cameras would change as i was running already and it would fuck up my movement which again resulted in hits that didn't feel fair.\nI didn't like using kerosine to light dead zombies bodies. Often times i found myself trying to but the game just wouldnt allow me (although this could be me doing something wrong) \nI really did not like that laboratory section of the game. I thought the puzzles were good but the fuel carrying puzzle was terrible and Wesker being a villain was really really obvious.\n\nI had a big issue with the characters. Often times things happen for plot convenience and characters sort of disappear and re appear sometimes *cough cough* Barry \n\nthe final boss fight was cool but the whole fight is a bit underwhelming \nyou sort of just shoot it until it falls over or at the very end your friend comes to save you \n\n\nAlso the performance of this game is terrible \nconstantly the game would drop to 30 fps and play really really slowly\nthis on top of the game crashing sometimes when i tabbed out was really really frustrating. \n\noverall even though this game isnt amazing \nits very very good and in my opinion still stands up today as a solid horror game \nmy opinion on it however is that i utterly love it and think its amazing \n\ni would 100% recommend \n", "timestamp_created": 1682901209, "timestamp_updated": 1682901209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137578214": {"recommendationid": "137578214", "author": {"steamid": "76561199487571452", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 587, "last_played": 1683830806}, "language": "english", "review": "spooky", "timestamp_created": 1682888980, "timestamp_updated": 1682888980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137574606": {"recommendationid": "137574606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182224837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1689460507}, "language": "english", "review": "iconic game\n", "timestamp_created": 1682885079, "timestamp_updated": 1682885079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137570497": {"recommendationid": "137570497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206721948", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 395, "last_played": 1682784392}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Good, (only if you like this kind of game)", "timestamp_created": 1682880764, "timestamp_updated": 1682880764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137568838": {"recommendationid": "137568838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087565003", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 880, "last_played": 1682827944}, "language": "english", "review": "While it took me a little while to get the hang of the controls and the way they worked, once I (mostly) got it sorted, it was well worth the time and effort I put into it.

Many of the puzzles are hard at first but upon solving it are like: \"God how did not see that?\"\n\nOverall, I rate this game 9/10 it has spooks, cheesy (but good) acting, and gorgeous environments.

La historia empieza en 1998, cerca de Raccoon City donde un equipo de S.T.A.R.S deber\u00e1 investigar la desaparici\u00f3n de otro equipo ocurrido en las monta\u00f1as Arklay. Hay Tensi\u00f3n, terror y suspenso!!\n- En el juego podemos ir con Chris Redfield o Jill Valentine. Lo \u00fanico que var\u00eda son las habilidades de los personajes y algunas escenas y encuentros.\n- Respecto a las habilidades, por ejemplo: Jill tiene m\u00e1s espacio en el inventario y puede abrir algunas cerraduras sin necesidad de buscar llaves como Chris, mientras que Chris tiene m\u00e1s resistencia y el cuchillo que lleva es mucho mejor.\n- Aparecen los cl\u00e1sicos zombies, perros mutados, los molestos hunters y m\u00e1s! Si a los zombies no les reventamos la cabeza o no los quemamos una vez que est\u00e9n en el piso, m\u00e1s tarde se levantar\u00e1n y se convertir\u00e1n en unos zombies mas letales! :D\n- No podemos poner un objeto en el piso como ocurr\u00eda en el Resident Evil Zero, en vez de eso, las cosas ahora las podemos guardar en ba\u00fales que encontraremos por los escenarios. Estos ba\u00fales comparten el contenido que guardemos.\n- Tiene gr\u00e1ficos mejorados y hay un buen detalle en los escenarios y efectos de luz y sombras. El sonido es impecable y algunos sonidos son escalofriantes.\n- El guardado es a trav\u00e9s de m\u00e1quinas de escribir y si jugamos en la dificultad hardcore si o si vamos a depender de las cintas de tinta para poder guardar el progreso.\n- Chris y Jill pueden equiparse con otras skins de trajes. Algunos se desbloquean pasando el juego una o incluso dos veces en una determinada dificultad.\n- Se puede desbloquear una pistola especial si pasamos el juego en menos de cinco horas o el lanzacohetes infinito si lo pasamos antes de las tres horas!\n- Al terminar el juego podemos jugar el modo supervivencia donde los ba\u00fales ya no comparten cosas.\n- Dependiendo de las decisiones que tomemos habr\u00e1 diferentes finales.\n- Tiene jefes \u00fanicos.\n\n[h1]Lo peor:[/h1] \n\n- Porque Chris tiene menos espacio en el inventario que Jill? Es muy chico el inventario que tiene y a veces se hace inc\u00f3modo tener que dejar cosas por otras.

First playthrough was a genuinely scary experience while simultaneously being really captivating and enjoyable. Second time round, I knew what to expect so the fear factor was reduced, but it was just as, if not more, fun. Amazing environments, spooky music, and an all round great time. \nAfter playing as Jill, I thought a playthrough as Chris would be harder due to not getting the lockpick, extra inventory space and grenade launcher, but to be honest I found playing as Chris to be just as good and not particularly any harder with planning and inventory management. That said, I think I would probably recommend playing as Jill for a first time run. While Chris takes more hits to die and he is better at shooting, I think things like the lockpick make the early game a lot easier to settle into, with the late game being more or less the same in terms of gameplay for both characters.\nI absolutely adore this game and I'd really recommend it, whether coming into it as a Resident Evil fan, or as someone new to the series. Sure things like the camera angles take getting used to and can cause some pains (especially in certain puzzles), but none of the game's difficulties or shortcomings come anywhere close to making the game not worth playing or being un-enjoyable. \n: )", "timestamp_created": 1682381301, "timestamp_updated": 1682381301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137247835": {"recommendationid": "137247835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133454602", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1079, "last_played": 1653959001}, "language": "english", "review": "real", "timestamp_created": 1682374768, "timestamp_updated": 1682374768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137247216": {"recommendationid": "137247216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150905041", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1682372219}, "language": "english", "review": "I can see the appeal of this game, but the controls are very janky, long door-opening animations and confusing forced perspectives make this game a chore to play especially since I don't have the nostalgia of the original.

"language": "english", "review": "[h1] Resident Evil teaches that cinematic doesn't mean uninteractive  [/h1]\n\nIn the current zeitgeist of the videogame artform, the current standards call for a certain kind of game design. Filling your game with scenes, linear segments and a certain feel that the interaction was an afterthought. Games are trying to become movies and in such process, they simply forget what made videogames so special: interaction.\n\n[b]I'm not implying that such games shouldn't exist, or that such games are inherently bad[/b] \u2014 I'm a Metal Gear Solid fan, for fuck's sake. But I also do think that there's a model where they apply such elements without putting any thought on how to properly make the experience justifiable as a game. \"Cinematic\" became a really marketable adjective, but I don't think any of these recent cutscene focused games are the prime example of this quality just because they have a lot of dialogues and film-like photography. If I'm honest, [b] the most \"cinematic\" game I have ever played is the one you are looking for opinions right now: Resident Evil Remake. [/b]\n\nDue to the fact this title doesn't force you to watch Hollywood inspired scenes, some people might question my statement. And these people should maybe take some time to watch more films, especially Sam Raimi, Alfred Hitchcock or George Romero's films. [b]Resident Evil Remake is the master of gamifying the experience of watching a horror thriller film through the clever usage of a philosophy the title coined: the so called \"survival horror\" experience.[/b] Akin to the classic Evil Dead, you are forced to explore an uncharted, lethal environment full of uncertainity. You have limited inventory slots, limited resources and the enemies you are facing are quite relentless. This game will show you how people in the 2000s viewed zombies: flesh dolls that hunt you regardless of how many shots you fired at them; it takes a lot of resources to effectively deal with them.\n\nIf you take the wrong choices, you might probably need to restart the game rather early... because even the saving system requires you to use a limited item. It never gets frustrating because the only part of the game [b]you are given full player agency and freedom to experiment is the early segments[/b] (it gets linear and less likely for you to screw up in the last levels). Still, you are always exploring, room after room, with a gun in your hand and a lot of fear of what will appear next. This game hides surprises and plays around with making you familiar with ambients to subvert this notion later, while presenting challenges in unexpected ways. Resident Evil isn't as disturbing as Silent Hill or Fatal Frame, but it's constantly a despair fest, where you are always picking resources and planning your inventory so you can travel through corridors without falling into the mansion's deadly traps. It's the apex of the classic \"haunted mansion\" trope, even if it avoids supernatural explanations.\n\nThis is the first part of the \"survival horror\" experience, and it's where you might feel frustrated and overwhelmed. However, do not give up! The second part is where you find some kind of overpowering resource, which you can abuse to dominate the game and show those zombies what you are made of. Do you remember when Ash found the shotgun in Evil Dead? You'll feel just like him when you find RE1's shotgun. You will become an overpowered action hero that is throughly able to deal with the threats that oppressed you for so long; that is, until the game throws at you new enemies, traps and puzzles. It's a constant dance of being underpowered and overpowered and it's addicting. [b]It's a masterclass on building tension, giving you consistent pay-offs and surprising you like a classic horror film.[/b]\n\nOne might ask himself about the replay value, due to the fact most of the surprises won't have the same effect if you know the mansion. [b]Resident Evil answers this by rewarding players who know the layout with unlockables, new game modes and the fact you have two campaigns.[/b] While you are exploring the same basic environment, choosing between Chris and Jill alters a lot of the resources, gameplay elements and choices you are forced into. Playing at least two times to witness different situations and twists is totally worth it \u2014 Chris being the [b]pure ludonarrative path[/b], where you are given [b]total agency of how you explore the mansion, and the game is tougher[/b]; Jill being the more [b]\"linear\"[/b] path, where you have [b]more resources and you don't need the same amount of backtracking and inventory management[/b], thus making the exploration a bit more of a traditional videogame since you won't need to clear your path or worry about coming back all that much.\n\nAnd as a remake, it plays around a lot with the idea of [b]surprising the hardcore fan who has played the originals, changing a lot of the surprises and mixing a bit of the mansion's layout.[/b] New mechanics are added and they make the game even harder than it originally was. They also fix a lot of the issues the first game had, such as the underwhelming cave segment, the awful shark \"bossfight\" while adding a bit more of narrative to spice things up. I'll just say a name: [b]Lisa Trevor[/b], and you'll know what I mean when you get there. It also improves a bit on the controls, allowing you to use the analogue stick and giving you an option if you are not a fan of tank controls.\n\nI'm more of a Chris fan because of how it plays out more akin to \"living\" a horror film, but both campaigns still feature the same core experience to some degree. Got around this one because I really wanted to try 4's remake, which means I rushed through the original PS1 Resident Evil and then decided to rush through this one too. But I couldn't just rush this, because [b]Resident Evil Remake is a true masterpiece and I feel very compelled to play this until there's no more content to be found.[/b] I already have 50 hours, and this game lasts like, 15~20 hours in your first run. [b] Your run can be optimized up to 2 hours or something if you do play it a lot, and it's just joyful. If you enjoy game design and haven't played this, I don't know what you are doing. This is a purchasable evidence that you can take movie elements and translate into a truly interactive and immersive game. Play it right now![/b]\n\n[h1] 10/10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1682261179, "timestamp_updated": 1682425341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795934498310089111", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137174569": {"recommendationid": "137174569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198978015601", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2006, "last_played": 1683062599}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic but Gold, game yang bakal jadi legenda bagi Franchise Resident Evil, meskipun controlnya dengan fix camera yang sedikit susah, tapi disitu feel buat namatin ini game jadi lebih menantang, good job Capcom", "timestamp_created": 1682259090, "timestamp_updated": 1683382328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137122164": {"recommendationid": "137122164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198892929602", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 758, "last_played": 1685722667}, "language": "english", "review": "funkus", "timestamp_created": 1682182261, "timestamp_updated": 1682182261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137102478": {"recommendationid": "137102478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045652932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 556, "last_played": 1682157413}, "language": "english", "review": "holy this didn't age well, just wait for the remake unless you're a boomer", "timestamp_created": 1682158249, "timestamp_updated": 1682158249, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.352039903402328491", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137091970": {"recommendationid": "137091970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122508045", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1682663957}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1682140218, "timestamp_updated": 1682140218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137080582": {"recommendationid": "137080582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315068156", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1204, "last_played": 1690020475}, "language": "english", "review": "W game", "timestamp_created": 1682120318, "timestamp_updated": 1682120318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561863243579864502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137079809": {"recommendationid": "137079809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136915954", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 731, "last_played": 1683425987}, "language": "english", "review": "Since this game launched on the Gamecube back in 2002, we have received a lot of RE games.

The design and graphics for this game, especially for the time it was released (in 2002) is extremely impressive. The atmosphere, the creatures, the characters, the story, the music, the places to explore, and the other elements give a true insight of what a Resident Evil game should be. \n\nThrough my gameplay, I had lots of fun playing this, and I enjoyed the story a lot. I think the best part about this game wasn't just the horror. but the VAST exploration and unique creatures and monsters you encounter.  This game at times would go from being extremely eerie, distorting, and unnerving, to mystical, comforting, and humble. Exploring the whole premises of the mansion was truly fun and engaging. The only downfall of this game I could say, is some of the control aspects. It can be a little janky at times and many of the controls just seem very old like antiques, but it's easy to get used to and deal with. It took me like 20 minutes to get used to and then I just forgot about all of that. STILL GREAT.\n\nIf there's something I also haven't really talked about it's the SCARES. This game at times was horrifying. When it came to the Crimson Head Zombies, the sharks, Lisa Trevor, and DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE GIANT SNAKE, I found it scary as hell. Lucky I had a gun in my hand or I actually would've shat myself.\n\nLast but not least, the characters and the story. I really liked the main characters and their future stories and games, but the voice acting and character development was a little lackluster and silly at times. Like I mean SILLY ASF. The story mixed with the development of the characters is solid by itself, and really helped build all of the other games in the future, but DAMN I can't keep mentioning how goofy a lot of the story aspects were. Well, I can't blame the story and characters for being like that, especially the fact that the game was originally released in Japan by CAPCOM in the early 2000s, with the type of action in some of these CAPCOM games being extremely serious and intense and just a little silly in general.  Other than that, the story and characters were still solid and I really enjoyed it but...this game would've been soooooo much different if it were remade in 2023.\n\nOther than that, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to try the Resident Evil series for the first time.

I still do recommend it regardless. It's fun, exciting, interesting, at times quite tense, and it looks fantastic, but it's extremely slow at times as you slog back and forth across areas trying to unlock doors and find items The first half is particularly slow. This is further impeded by doors that can only be opened from one direction for no particular reason. Another thing that forces you to constantly run back and forth, in this case to your saferooms, is the very limited inventory. A key takes up just as much space as a shotgun,the only thing that stacks are bullets, and I played as Chris, who can only carry six things at a time. I found the inventory management absolutely maddening. Perhaps the worst part of the game is the damn camera; every time you round a corner or approach a wall or other side of a room, the camera angle changes, and the direction you are facing with it. I had to check my map hundreds of times to figure out which way I was facing (and since you have to open your map to use the compass, the compass is pretty useless) and was constantly running the wrong way because the direction I was facing changed and suddenly I was running sideways instead of forwards. Lastly, some of the doors and places to put items are damn hard to see because they're essentially part of a matte-painting background, and if you're standing just slightly to the left or right, you can press F until the cows come home and you're not getting through that door or finding that slot to put that item. \n\nOverall I'd give this game a 6.5 out of ten.", "timestamp_created": 1681450739,

The game feels and plays like a god awful call of duty zombies easter egg puzzle. Not being able to drop items like resident evil 0 is painful. There should be an option to disable door animations. Why couldn't there be a simple objectives list? The inventory management is the worst enemy in the game. I'm not even going to go into the combat. I'd rather rip out my own fingernails with pliers one by one than play the game again as Chris. I highly recommend skipping this game and just watching a 5 minute video explaining the plot because that's how long it would to take to complete the game if it didn't have all these tedious tasks and backtracking for the sake of extending playtime.\n\nEdit:\nSo I went back and finished the game, the time was nothing impressive. Since then I've also played RE2 Remake and RE3 Remake, I enjoyed both of them so much more than 0 and 1. I have a wayyyyy better understanding now of how to play a resident evil game, so I highly recommend starting with RE2 Remake then RE3 Remake to understand the game's mechanics and core gameplay features before trying 0 or 1 otherwise you'll probably end up feeling like wanting to write a review similar to mine above.

This is as close as I have come to playing the \"Original\" style of Resident Evil Games, since what I've seen online is that this is almost a 1 to 1 remake with some minor changes here and there.\n\nFixed camera is a part of this franchise's history some people don't like, but I think it worked here. There were moments for sure where controlling my character felt a little frustrating because the camera would either keep switching to a location I wasn't trying to go or downright not show where an enemy was. I got used to it eventually but man did it feel like the camera was against me multiple times. This isn't a bad thing actually in my eyes as it was funny most of the time, its just a part of the franchise's history that I think every fan should try at least once.\n\nItem management on the other hand sucked, I did my first run as Jill and only had 8 slots of inventory compared to Chris' 6 slots. And let me tell you two extra slots didn't mean the game was easier to get through as the backtracking in this felt atrocious sometimes, but nothing I couldn't manage. Again like fixed camera I think this is something every fan of this franchise should try once. Also, I played this game without the mod that removes the door opening scenes and it honestly wasn't too bad once I got used to it. \n\nSo I guess my biggest point to takeaway with this game is that you should try it out at least once, and everything just takes some getting used to!", "timestamp_created": 1680977115, "timestamp_updated": 1680977115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136360617": {"recommendationid": "136360617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365302565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1680745496}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the best, with HD remaster.

I would have loved to have seen an RE2 and RE3 remake along the same lines as RE1 HD because the first three original RE games (1, 2, and 3: Nemesis) were a huge part of my childhood.  \n\nThis game is probably the hardest of the classic RE games as it takes more time to complete the puzzles, locate key items, acquire resources to defeat enemies, and so on compared to other modern RE games.

in 2023 its crazy that people figured any of this out in the 90s before walkthroughs existed it gets so convoluted. There's a lot that has aged pretty poorly, namely the laughably small inventory and the tedium of managing it while picking up every item because your resources are limited, but your pockets are even moreso. Dialogue is bad enough to be funny in numerous cases (I played through Jill's campaign) which was fun but frustrating because I would have liked to see how well the story could have been told if it went better. Graphically and gameplay wise the game holds up well as two of this game's major strengths, it looks great and feels good to move and shoot (not at the same time.) Worth noting that I did experience several crashes throughout my 10ish hours of playing, usually when tabbing between applications so do be warned. Was my experience with thus game fun? Sometimes for sure but there got to be a lot of tedium and/or confusion between those moments so while I didn't fall in love with Resident Evil I will give it a Recommended out of appreciation for its impact on gaming and horror overall.", "timestamp_created": 1679818920, "timestamp_updated": 1679818920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135458372": {"recommendationid": "135458372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863454372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 551, "last_played": 1680338811}, "language": "english", "review": "jill valentine  mmmmm", "timestamp_created": 1679818337, "timestamp_updated": 1679818337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135453318": {"recommendationid": "135453318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095598563", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1679447276}, "language": "english", "review": "after enjoyiong all the other resident evils  i thought id return to the series roots but finds out there's not much to see here. writing women chracters to be damsels in distress (actually the whole series has this problem but this one in partciular has that issue more glaring) is just lazy, and frankly misogynistic. i know i know this is a remake of an old time game but with remakes you can certainly change things like better writing. the camera angles also gave me whiplash so im just gonna skip this one. if youre like me and enjoy the new resident evil 8 just skip this one", "timestamp_created": 1679812089, "timestamp_updated": 1679812089, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.390756011009216309", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135442891": {"recommendationid": "135442891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124348049", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1181, "last_played": 1588643084}, "language": "english", "review": "Great port of the GameCube Remake.

I couldn't get behind the fixed camera and the limited ammo bothered me when the shooting is kind of RNG based. I was lost and confused a lot even when I would check like every room and still find nothing to progress. So it was hard in the beginning, however I pushed through. I admit I had to use a walkthrough, but i feel like I started to enjoy the game when i used one. The best parts of this game is the atmosphere, the audio and characters. The mansion is so haunting and spooky and that mixed with the audio makes quite a spooky experience. The characters are all cool I love Jills design and her character along with wesker and barry (chris and rebecca as well , but they aren't in jills story as much). Overall by the end of the game I feel like i did enjoy the game and even felt the urge to playthrough again as chris. So while it was hard to get through i enjoyed it still.

Well I had little choice, but don't get me wrong either, the GameCube Original is a PHENOMENAL GAME, I love it, I even did Invisible Mode on Hard as a Let's Play.  Resident Evil 1 Remake is a masterpiece that really should be played by everyone, it's one of these games that you almost never get tired of on repeated playthroughs, it's very seldom these days.\n\nBut oh well, my goal here isn't really to go in-depth with the base game itself for now, and I want you to understand that any Version stemming from the GameCube will do, HOWEVER my point with this Review is I'm comparing between the GC Version and this HD Remaster, as this HD Version is SUPPOSED to be a further improved version of the GameCube Original, and while HD is pretty faithful to GC, almost like a Port, well by evidence of my score, I would rather recommend you the GC one, if you can get it that is.\n\nThe changes and even additions for HD are what I actually take issue with.  It really doesn't add much to the Original, aside from Leaderboards that I believe don't even work due to hackers, and there is 1 new Costume for both Chris and Jill, they get their attire from RE5, but I think they were very lazily included in RE1; Chris isn't meant to be as old and experienced-looking as he does in RE5, and while I get Costumes are supposed to be a bit silly at times, I feel the RE5 skins miss the mark, they do not really follow the aesthetic of the Original's, and Chris is pretty much getting a SECOND military outft.  I still appreciate though that I can choose a Costume before starting a New Game, rather than going to the Closet every playthrough.\n\nThe backgrounds have been re-rendered or upscaled and, for the most part, they do have more details for larger resolutions than if you would put GC on an Emulator, plus there isn't the slight loading lag between each screens (not rooms, screens in a single room), so HD actually saves time on the loading times.  However, this is where hell breaks loose, the backgrounds were never made wider from what they originally were to fit the new 16:9 Aspect Ratio, they are sliced at the top and bottom edges of the screen to fit horizontally, and to make sure the S.T.A.R.S. don't disappear at the top or bottom, the camera can moves up or down to follow them, but this is [b]freaking awful[/b], I tried it for a while and it's just making me sick, and you're still missing crucial information offscreen wherever you go.  So, word of advice, play on 4:3 (which isn't even the Default), because then you'll see everything and the screens stay still, you're not going to get vertigo with that.\n\nI also hinted at upscaling, which yeah, some backgrounds don't look that great, for example the Knights Room looks pixely in certain parts, and they even removed smaller details like a bug that was in GC, on a tree as you're about to enter the Lab, so I gotta wonder if even more details were lost in the HD transition.\n\nOther aesthetic changes and this is where the changes hurt me the most; some of the musics on GC were altered in HD, like Rush of Horror and Concrete Bound, which were my favorites.  I... really don't like these new versions, they're not bad, but they were much better on GC IMO, felt more moody, and there is no way to revert these changes.  I do not understand why they did it.\n\nThen, the addition of \"Modernized\" Controls (Alternate), as people seem to loathe the Original's Tank Controls, which for sure they need some getting used to, but they're perfectly fine for the most part, the Resident Evil Series tend to be at its best when the characters are very restricted in their movement, and if anything it has always stayed CONSISTENT.\n\nWhen you use the Alternate Controls, the characters no longer have to turn sideways to then move forward, they simply Run towards wherever you aim the Control Stick at, and that makes navigation go \"slightly\" faster.  However, Alternate really breaks the game, it's very easy now to bait enemies to attack you and run past them when they miss, it really trivializes a lot of the base game and goes against the roots of the series, but eh I can't hide that it was somewhat fun to psyche out the enemies so often, but I still take issue that it breaks what made the OG special in its own way.\n\nWhere shit hits the fan again is when the screens change, because remember the characters move towards where you're moving the Stick, meaning that if a screen is orientated to the East, then the movement is no longer true as the next screen shifts towards the North.  The band-aid to this issue is that, as long as you keep the Stick in place when screens change, the character will keep going in that direction, so it doesn't always happen where you end up accidentally going back to the previous screen, for the most part you're able to reorient yourself.  However, notice my wording, because yes, there are still problems that arise from this system regardless; I would go down an hallway, and as I'm about to make the turn, I want to go left, but then the screen changes, meaning that I'm going left from the new screen's perspective, MEANING I'm going back to the previous screen!  And this happens REGULARLY, so much so that you'll often have no clue WTH Chris or Jill are doing, you'll end up doing circles as you fight with the Controls and this might allow a cheap shot from enemies.  Even in spite of said band-aid, this can get maddening.\n\nLastly, my other problem with Alternate is that there is no dedicated Run Button; of course you may Walk by tilting the Control Stick only slightly, and there is \"almost\" no reasons to walk (aside from maybe stealth?), so what is it then?  Well again notice I highlighted \"almost\", in the Original, if you mash the Run button when you're going up or down stairs, you actually climb them MUCH faster, and you may not think about it, but there are A LOT of stairs.  Well, you may finally realize that doing it with the Control Stick is impossible, and the Dead Zone for Walking is so small anyway you wouldn't be able to Walk in normal context.  There is also a part where you need to move an item to its destination purely by walking, meaning once again that fine-tuning movement on Alternate would be unwise.\n\nThe Original Controls never encounter these Modern problems, and so, I must say that, even if you activate Alternate, you can still play with the OG Controls at any time when using the D-Pad, and THAT has a dedicated Run Button.  So say Chris and Jill start having seizures due to screen changes, you can play with both Alternate and Original Controls at all times, depending on the situation.  The problem here isn't that I need to change my Options, but rather I would've preferred to Walk with the Control Stick as is, then use the Run Button to run.  Maybe you don't like holding a button all the time just to do something so trivially simple as Running, but... I just want my goddamn Run Button, it's awkward going from Control Stick to D-Pad just for when I go up or down stairs as I need to stop for a second.\n\nStill though, if you want to avoid any and all problems I've encountered using Alternate Controls, you can simply use the Original instead, meaning you'd be always on Tank Controls, but everything will stay consistent.\n\nSo afterall, I have many issues with this HD Remaster, which is kind of a shame because the 60fps and some of the Higher-Res Backgrounds would almost make it worth it, but there are some parts of the upscaling that look ugly, some of the musics are worse now, and then there are the many problems of the Alternate Controls.  The HD Remaster isn't worth it when put against the GameCube Version, so if you can get GC, just get GC (not sure about Wii).  However, in this day and age, it may be hard for you to get your hands on the GameCube Version, let alone the hardware, so you can still enjoy Resident Evil 1 Remake thanks to this HD Remaster, it's just not going to be my Version of choice.", "timestamp_created": 1679398123, "timestamp_updated": 1679611976, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503877937793731689", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135081745": {"recommendationid": "135081745", "author": {"steamid": "76561199119910499", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1694385128}, "language": "english", "review": "jill tts", "timestamp_created": 1679383302, "timestamp_updated": 1679383302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135081351": {"recommendationid": "135081351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967041676", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1679379803}, "language": "english", "review": "I knew I was coming into this with Fixed Camera Angles, but that wasn't the worst thing; the Door Animations, and lacking tutorial make this hard to jump in fresh; but then again this is a \"Visual\" Remaster the mechanics of the game are still the same mechanics of a game from 1996.

The static camera angles in this game can be very disorienting but I got used to it after a bit. With the very limited item space -- 8 for one character and only 6 for the other -- it feels like this game is trolling you at times. \n\nThe map/level design in this game is very captivating. With all of the shortcuts and pathways, it's almost like a metroidvania. Also I think some parts/puzzles in this game are very obtuse.

After encountering monsters in the mountains and having their pilot take off without them, they seek refuge in a mansion in order to survive.\n\nBoth Chris and Jill have a unique scenario with different encounters and gameplay differences, choosing when to use certain resources like ammo and healing items is a major part of the survival horror gameplay, sometimes running past a zombie or cerberus is a better decision than using ammo so that you can save it later when you face a more dangerous encounter. While exploring the Spencer Mansion, you will also have to solve numerous puzzles which is another major part of the gameplay in Resident Evil.\n\nSome newcomers may be put off from the fixed camera angles and tank controls, but I heavily urge for those who feel that way to give them a chance as they're a unique way to control the gameplay and help showcase the beautiful hand crafted environments (just make sure to use the original controls and aspect ratio as the updated ones feel very loose and change how you were meant to control the game, plus the upscaled backgrounds can feel too stretched out at times making them look worse).\n\nOverall this is a fantastic entry in the series that provides a good challenge and has plenty of replayability just like other entries in the series and similar games in the genre.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

It should be noted that if you are planning on playing these games, you should definitely start with this one. \n\nAnyway, this was my first time playing a game with a fixed camera angle like this, and at first it was significantly annoying. Once you get used to it, I feel like it is better for immersion. The story is great and like any other Resident Evil, you will need multiple playthroughs to complete everything. You can play as Chris or Jill, who have slightly altered storylines. There are multiple endings and possible outcomes depending on what you do during the playthrough.\n\nI have never played the original version of this game but everyone seems to think that it honors the original game with updated graphics. Some of the cut scenes in this game are rendered in very low quality but outside of that the graphics are great. \n\nSeeing as the Resident Evil games typically go on sale, this would be a great pick up. However, I think this game is fully worth the price. Fantastic game that will keep your hands full in the beginning if never played before, and will be very rewarding in the end. \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1677445082, "timestamp_updated": 1677445154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816098988056182861", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133690080": {"recommendationid": "133690080", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121768145", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_at_review": 1710, "last_played": 1700526323}, "language": "english", "review": "\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \uff3f\uff3f\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\u4e8c\u3064", "timestamp_created": 1677440032, "timestamp_updated": 1677440032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498592168092727661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133681242": {"recommendationid": "133681242", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101550108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1170, "last_played": 1697940048}, "language": "english", "review": "Where is Barry?", "timestamp_created": 1677432058, "timestamp_updated": 1677432058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133658042": {"recommendationid": "133658042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036711693", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2986, "last_played": 1677411072}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite possibly the best example of a remake ever.

Your only weapon is a handgun. The only people left to fight are your fellow survivors and the relentless, bloodthirsty hordes. The desperate need to survive is all that keeps you going, even if you\u2019re terrified of your own shadow.\n\nThese are the facts. Not the fun of surviving on a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested Earth, of course. The rest is window dressing. This is pure survival horror, a genre defined by the necessity to pay off some nameless, frustrating threat with your heart, mind, and soul. The genre calls on you to prepare for conflict, endure pain, and endure fear \u2013 in order to live a life worth living.\n\nSurvival horror is defined by the main character being bullied, put in a position where they have to survive on their own. The relentless AI and difficulty of beating a level make the mechanic of surviving seem simple, even boring. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just more challenging than most people want it to be.\n\nSo it goes with the Resident Evil remake, which is a game that tries to create a slow burn of terror, following you from room to room as you rescue other people from hordes of enemies. It tries to make the player feel uncomfortable, and to make the action-focused combat satisfying, but you don\u2019t feel threatened or heroic or feared or like an exceptional combatant.

It is practically the game that defined the Survival Horror franchise and still holds up beautifully. I am aware of the re-playability of this game and it looks great, but I that may be a future me adventure.\n\nThe Good:\nI love the pre-rendered backgrounds, for me it just looks so much better and gets high praise for me.\nSFX are amazing and really adds greatly to the game world. Combat was fun for the age and felt rewarding to dispose of zombies properly. Puzzles are great and I enjoyed them. Honestly can't say too much, It is a staple of it's time. I adore this game.\n\nThe Bad:\nNot much to say besides minor things, got the mod this time to skip door animations, should be a given in the menu. \n\nThe Ugly: \nIn my reviews, the ugly is what I disliked the most, and what I disliked most was how forced it felt to have the main character alone. You meet a friendly and they die a minute later or when one it suppose to stay alive they decide to split up 2 seconds later. Just happened way to much that I never expected any help from anyone. I know it can add to the horror that you are all by yourself but it is just the logic of sticking together? It just happened way too much.\n\nConclusion:\nIt is the game that defined survival horror. I will give it so much credit for a game genre I love so much. 10/10 for me.

Besides zombies, there's a great variety of other enemies/bosses. Tons of cinematic moments to experience with the cut scenes as well unique to your playthrough with the fixed camera perspective (surveillance camera viewpoint). One complaint I would have for the game is that I found moving through multiple camera angles can be awkward sometimes. Tons of replayability given different routes with Chris and Jill , amazing cinematic moments, and hard to navigate Spencer Mansion.\n\nDefinitely a game worth purchasing , its from 2002 but looks amazing and plays well.

The game kept crashing on my PC and none of the fixes listed on here in the forums or guides worked for me. If you play this game and read this first I recommend playing the game in windowed mode.

There were a few different games to choose from, but one cover stood out: a haunting image of a ghoul peering over its shoulder at you, that struck me with fear and curiosity. We popped the CD in, turned off the lights, and with my cousins spectating all around me, I dared to venture into the Spencer Mansion for the first time, and discovering the horrors within. It was that moment I became a Resident Evil fan.\n\nBeing 8 years old, and not having access to the internet or any strategy guide, I didn't get far. The mansion was [i]massive[/i] and honestly it took me minutes to muster up the courage to see what was on the other side of every door I found myself in front of. I don't think I got much further than discovering the back gate to the courtyard before it was time to go home.\n\nCut to Christmas, quite a few years later: I get a Gamecube, and the Resident Evil remake that had just released on it. I was [i]ecstatic.[/i] Finally I was going to return to the Spencer Mansion, and it was going to be even scarier. And holy hell, was it scarier. I owned that game for years, and even then, I still couldn't get further than the courtyard. The crimson head mechanic alone gave me so much anxiety and terror that playing the game was an exercise in self-abuse. I've made many attempts--even on the easiest mode! But I still. Could not. Beat it.\n\nNow, these games are classics. If you're on the fence of trying this game out, whether it be the fixed-camera, or the puzzles, or the anxiety: I urge you to play and beat this game at least once. Explore the world within: read the documents. Unravel the mystery of [i]what the hell happened here.[/i] And reach the satisfying ending.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1675828407, "timestamp_updated": 1675828407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717051386833190918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132403840": {"recommendationid": "132403840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371047832", "num_games_owned": 1379, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 3164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3164, "last_played": 1675827308}, "language": "english", "review": "Good !\n\n/!\\ Resident Evil is Deck Verified.

Given this bias, I'm nevertheless struggling to come up with areas the remake doesn't straight up improve on. My main complaints would be that the OST is a little weaker in the remake and there's a few rooms, particularly in the guardhouse that are creepier in the original. Even so, when compared to the amount of new content and mechanics added to the game, and how much more realistic it looks, I have to admit its better.\n\nThat being said, for those who have never played either, I would still recommend playing the 1996 release first.

It definitely sticks out more than most horror games and I can understand why people have so much love for it. But this game is not for me. The first resident evil game that I played was Resident Evil 7 and I absolutely love that game. After RE7 I played all of them except for this one and I dont really know why I chose to play this after I played every other. This game ended up being one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. The fixed camera, the alternative controls mixed with the camera angles make it one of the most confusing games control, the inventory system, the backtracking, the gun play, the game giving you no sense of direction of what to do, half of the puzzles making zero sense. All of this piled on top of one video game just made it a chore to complete. Although this review has been mainly just a dump of negative shit towards this game, i did like some things about it. The atmosphere: I really like how this game had depth with each room being distinct and the mansion being a fun place to explore. The silly goofy voice acting: This game is funny, especially when it comes to the voice acting. Some of the more serious moments in this game made me genuinely laugh because the voice acting is so terrible. The satisfaction that you get from completing a puzzle: self explanatory but it truly is satisfying. Anyways, those are about the only things i enjoyed about this game. I will definitely buy a remake if they make it though.

Both the REmake, and RE0, received HD remasters and were ported to modern systems 1/19/2015 and 1/19/2016. There are QoL updates, but for the most part, they're the exact same games from 02', making them 20 years old at this point, nearing 21 years. I just replayed it to confirm that I still enjoy it. The alternate controls make it possible to strafe and will be more familiar with modern/new players, but don't make the mistake of using the keyboard like I did. Use a controller as the game was created for it analog sticks. \n\nThis era of RE is much slower pace, more puzzles and backtracking, and just thorough exploration of the Spencer mansion. References of characters, like Ada, are made, and it's nice to notice these small details and thinking, \"oh, right, Ada from RE2 with Leon and RE4.\" The same thing is true for WIlliam Burkin and the G-Virus and other notable characters, even a slight reference to an arm wrestling competition from a poster and the winner becoming the Police Chief, who you see in RE2. The game is definitely more focused on terror and feeling uncomfortable, rather than repetitive jump scares. It's immersive and almost suffocating playing it for the first time, in the dark, with the music cranked up. It appealed to veterans who played the original. The infamous \"dog jumps through the window\" scene happens, but in a different way. When you think it's going to happen, and the camera angle in a certain hallway is practically telling you it will, something hits the window and the glass cracks, but no dogs jump through. This sort of appreciation isn't possible for new players, but it still provides a lot of tension, as many camera angles make it feel like you're being watched or something will jump through the windows. This will often turn out to be the case at some point in the game. Right before fighting Yawn the giant snake, it looks like something is watching you through the window. When you backtrack, it shows that he shattered and made his way through that very same window. The attention to detail in this game still amazes me, and even though it is 2 decades old, I had a lot of fun. I really hope it receives another remake, one comparable to RE2R, to really feel the game in a modern take on the RE engine. \n\nIf you like to work your brain a bit, explore and immerse yourself in a dark mansion, take in the story, and even have a lot of replayability, buy this game.

Otherwise, just skip to the actual review part.\n\nEver since I watched the first Resident Evil film staring Milla Jovovich, in my good old teen days, I realised three things. One, I had a mad crush on the celebrity ([i]don't worry, I got out of it[/i]). Two, zombie movies and games are kick-ass. Three, I really needed more Resident Evil in my life.\n\nWhen I learnt that there was a Resident Evil game, I was stoked and couldn't wait to actually get hold of one of the titles. To my disappointment, it wasn't available on PC, I wasn't going to own a PS at the time, and none of my friends actually owned a copy, not to mention... no Alice as the main character.\n\nMy first actual entry to the game was Resident Evil 4 and although it wasn't nearly what I expected and it featured way less horror and zombies, it was actually a great game and I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the game and learning that the films are actually not even close to what the originals on PS were set out to be, so of course I started doing some digging and realised how much I've been missing out. After the release of the RE3 film, things just mostly went downhill in quality for me and overall the films just mostly suck and are completely over the top getting worse with each entry after RE2. The worse the films got, the more interesting the games became, but the problem remained that I didn't have a console to play on. Fortunately, the remaster came to Steam and it would take until now for me to actually play the game and I have to say that my mind has been blown by how much I actually missed out on over the years.\n\n[b]Now we can actually start with the review![/b]\n\nAre you in the mood for gaming as they were in the good old days ([i]or maybe you need to just experience it for the first time[/i]? A time when games didn't tell you jack shit other than throw you into the deep end and expect you to figure things out for yourself. Where there was no such thing as press F to salute, or sudden hints when the game realises that you're taking too long to solve a puzzle. Well, Resident Evil HD is definitely the game you're looking for!\n\nAlthough I never experienced the original, I can tell that they've stayed true to the time period it was created. You're literally thrown into this mansion where you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Not a single hint about which character you should start with for beginners ([i]Jill is the answer[/i]), not that knifes are basically completely useless throughout the game and especially not telling you where you should go or how to solve puzzles or trap rooms. It's brutal, but goodness me is it some of the most engaging and fun experiences I've had with a game in years! \n\nThe funny part is, the game is actually easy to play and very straightforward. The camera angles might take some getting used to, but it's mostly as simple as aim in direction and shoot. It'll hit the target... maybe not where you want it to, but it'll hit the target. Repeat until collapse and enemy is done... or is it? Having a tough time finding your way? Are there too many locked doors? Have you truly explored all the nooks and crannies? Have you examined your items? These simple features are what makes this game golden in my view. The developers trusted that the players would be able to figure things out for themselves without giving them too many flashy screen hints, or some voice hints or whatever modern games do nowadays, even if it meant hours of running in circles, the player would eventually figure it out. Now I have to admit, I \"mostly\" did the game by myself. I never used a walkthrough on any of the puzzles, but when wanting to save time, it helps knowing which items you should carry, because your inventory is pretty small, but I swear almost everything else was my own work. Not that I'll judge casual players for using walkthroughs during hard times, because some of the puzzles, or at least navigating the map at times requires a pointer or two, but again as mentioned, the game doesn't really give that much and your memory plays a big role in progression.\n\nThe graphics is nothing impressive in modern standards, but it's definitely an awesome art style that had me pausing a few times just to see the view of a room. It has a somewhat realistic feel to it and it's very eerie at times being in this mansion with zombies that at times jump at you from corners you couldn't see because of the camera angle. You can definitely tell the game is dated, but I think it's one of those masterpieces that will continue the test of time.\n\nIf you play as Jill, you'll experience her cutscenes with her partner, giving you the best story experience of the game, while Chris is meant for the more veteran players with less story cutscenes ([i]if at all since I only did the first zombie with Chris[/i]. In both cases, you'll learn more about the game by collecting files and reading notes explaining the origins of the zombies, what happened in the mansion, why your team got sent there in the first place and probably how all the events spilled over into RE2.\n\nThere aren't many negatives for me with this game, especially keeping in mind that it's a remaster of a very old game, but if I had to criticise, I'd say that the inventory at times even with Jill felt too small and Chris has two slots less. On normal, I picked up way more ammo than I ever needed and honestly, I mostly conserved because I expected something that'll force me to use most of my ammo, but that never happened. I'm sure on harder difficulties it gets worse. Finally, the voice acting is pretty bad :D but honestly that's just trying to find fault, I don't really care about that all too much. Probably the most annoying feature is when every room or area you enter, it always has to play a slow scene of you opening the door, or climbing the ladder, or taking the elevator up and down. I'm sure there were reasons back then, but it's frustrating when backtracking.\n\nI'm happy that I finally got to play the first entry and I'm now ready to continue to RE2, a game I've been looking forward to playing since release but left it off because I wanted to get through the whole franchise. No doubt I'll reinstall this game in the future and attempt to gain the rest of the achievements.

I was always aware of the series, but I couldn\u2019t go as far as to name a character or describe the games past shooting zombies. While my personal opinions on each entry generally align with the average fan, the franchise\u2019s roots hold the strongest grip on me. The original 1996 release is widely recognized as the pioneer of the survivor horror genre. Spawning hundreds of sequels, spinoffs, and adaptations, RE1 itself was remade in 2002 as REmake and that\u2019s the version that was ported to Steam. Discussing the game is rather difficult as I simultaneously think this game is both one of the best and worst I\u2019ve ever played.\n\nDespite starting its own genre, REmake plays most similarly to a traditional point-and-click adventure game. The primary focus is on exploring the map and using the items you find to solve various puzzles. Even the enemies can be simplified as a form of puzzle interaction as effectively eliminating them resorts to spending the right resource or seeing them as just an obstacle to dodge. Sounds simple enough, but this game is a nightmare to play, and I don\u2019t just say this because it\u2019s scary. REmake has some of the worst design choices you will ever see. There are well over a hundred items and your inventory is confined to a mere 8 or 6 slots depending on which character you play. The maximum carrying capacity might as well be lower since you're going to have to play with 1 or 2 empty slots so you can even pick stuff up. This issue is exacerbated when you realize key items aren\u2019t exempt from this rule. You will have no idea what you should bring unless you have a guide or have played the game before. An especially egregious example happens minutes after starting the game. You\u2019ll find a blue gem from shoving a statue off a cliff and if you carry it with you until you need it, it\u2019ll be in your inventory for half the game. Other items you wouldn\u2019t expect to take up inventory space still do. Few items beside ammo are stackable, and if you want to bring more ammo than your magazine can fit it\u2019ll cost you an item slot. Even something like SAVING requires an item. And every resource in the game is finite, meaning not only can you screw yourself up to the point where you\u2019re out of bullets, but you might also have to start a save file from scratch simply from wasting your saves. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2904216363\nExploration is the other key component of REmake\u2019s gameplay, and players are going to be incentivized to look around more when the environments look amazing. For what was natively a GameCube release, the Spencer Mansion looks absolutely stunning, and I find how they achieved this to be really interesting. The backgrounds are pre-rendered static images which lets the game look gorgeous while taking only an ounce of performance from the actual hardware. Think of how cutscenes look way better than the actual gameplay for games from the early to late 2000s. The art direction is phenomenal and the mansion you find yourself trapped in for the entire game felt like a real place because of it. Navigating areas and scrounging for resources never felt like a chore because every frame was a painting. Even the loading transitions were somewhat more immersive than what you\u2019d see back in the day. It\u2019s just a little cutscene of a door opening to cover up the load time. However these genius artistic decisions have had irreversible damage on the actual gameplay. Since the environment is static, the camera angles are fixed. Fighting a zombie in one room could have you repositioning through several camera changes, which makes seeing the enemy much more difficult. Larger rooms with zombies to fight are frustratingly hard when the camera is not in your control. And those cute lil\u2019 door cutscenes I mentioned earlier? They\u2019re completely unnecessary with modern hardware and aren\u2019t skippable without the use of mods.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2904216520\nUsually, these problems would be written off as bad game design and make for an awful experience, but in REmake\u2019s case it actually somehow improves the experience in a completely different way. While the game is pretty clunky, that also makes it infinitely scarier. I think my favorite problem is with the ink ribbons. I find that a lot of horror games lose their scare factor when I can trial and error my way through a tough encounter by loading from a quicksave. When you die too much in a horror game, you lose immersion. And despite the mechanics actively working against you at times, it\u2019s not really that difficult. This is something I feel like the later games don\u2019t replicate as they\u2019re either significantly harder or completely lack the feature. My death counter was only just about to leave the single digits and only one of those involving a plant would I call unfair. Dying in REmake was genuinely scary to me because there were actual consequences to it. And the enemies being oftentimes obscured by the camera worked towards the spook factor as well. There are several moments like when you enter a bathroom where the sound design alerts you to an upcoming threat that I don\u2019t think could be found with a free camera. Combat in horror games generally has to be clunky or else I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll fear combating the numerous enemies. The camera is the factor that makes fighting harder, and in a weird way, I enjoyed that. That aforementioned horror REmake captures so perfectly was only achievable because of its faults. And a quick note about those aforementioned problems although I rarely like mentioning it in reviews, modding is a solution. Especially for skipping the door animations.\n\nAs for some final notes on the soundtrack and story. Horror games usually don\u2019t have songs I\u2019d listen to outside of the game, but REmake is a notable exception. The save room theme is the biggest highlight. It\u2019s an incredibly soothing track with some distant howling playing in the background, a perfect representation of temporary safety. Guardhouse 1 and Neptune Tank are some other personal favorites that aren\u2019t focused on the fear factor alone. That\u2019s not to say the rest of OST isn\u2019t fitting for quaking in your boots. One song has a nearly inaudible moan that most people won\u2019t even actively pick up on. As for the story, don\u2019t expect REmake\u2019s writing to be the selling point for you. Like plenty of other older games, it\u2019s there but it\u2019s not really fleshed out. Spoilers I guess, but I doubt anyone doesn\u2019t at least know about the series\u2019 big bad. I really like that the zombies are man-made. RE\u2019s zombie viruses have possibly my favorite lore and origins for undead infections. I find the idea of researchers creating zombies more in the realm of realism than them just appearing or any supernatural explanation which would be much less interesting. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRQI9GlGjsE\nResident Evil Remake, despite its numerous and very glaring flaws, is something I would change next to nothing about. It\u2019s a game that I think everyone should at least try playing at least once. You don\u2019t have to beat it, but at least give it a shot. This game is one of the scariest I\u2019ve played and I highly recommend it because of that. [b]I\u2019m giving the game a 7/10, but do not let that score trick you. While I have played dozens, if not hundreds, of better mechanically put-together games, none of them are going to stick in my head as long as REmake undoubtedly will.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1674973104, "timestamp_updated": 1674973104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633002519607543945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131776207": {"recommendationid": "131776207", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039350461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1669578490}, "language": "english", "review": "waiting for the remake remake remaster before i finish this game", "timestamp_created": 1674966991, "timestamp_updated": 1674966991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131773478": {"recommendationid": "131773478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172726231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2863, "last_played": 1675193417}, "language": "english", "review": " This game is brilliant.

Resident Evil (on Steam and Gamecube) is a Remake of the 1996 PlayStation game Resident Evil, the first installment in the Resident Evil video game series. The story takes place in 1998 near the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City where a series of bizarre murders have taken place. The player takes on the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, S.T.A.R.S. agents sent in by the city to investigate the murders.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]About[/th]\n        [th]Description[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udcbeGraphics[/td]\n        [td]Resident Evil Remake is a huge upgrade from the original. With a darker and scarier atmosphere, you will feel dread in every room with the haunting presence of a scary and haunting past the Spencer Mansion holds. With every hallway and room keeping you on edge, the map design is something truly special and I would go far and say near perfection. Some issues do occur such as some blurry textures that feel more rushed than others, but luckily there is a HD texture project you can install to improve them, but not too worry since most of the areas look really sharp and stunning. Not to mention the incredible lighting this game delivers. A true masterpiece in terms of a Remake in the graphics department. Just look up the original and compare it the remake, it\u2019s insane![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfaeGameplay[/td]\n        [td]This is what Survival Horror is all about! The inventory management is so good here. Having to plan every trip you take is well balanced. The safe room is your, well, safe haven. Being able to store items is a great feature Resident Evil has brought to the table. The storage box even transfers all items to every safe room so no need to go to the old storage box (except for \u201cReal Survival\u201d Game Mode), an amazing idea that has aged so well even for today. Both Jill and Chris have their own pro\u2019s and con\u2019s that makes them both feel unique from each other, even their story lines are different in some ways which is really cool to see here. Taking down zombies and other terrifying enemies will put you through one crazy experience not many games capture well today. The gunplay is simple, but works well here. The movement can be kinda tricky, but you adapt pretty quickly. Beating the game will grant you unlockables, such as weapons, costumes, and new game modes. The game is unforgiving and the only way to save is through ink ribbons, which you only have a set amount in the game so save wisely. Also there are no checkpoints so if you haven\u2019t saved in a while, prepare to make that long journey again! Honestly there is so much to talk about here in terms of gameplay, but I can promise you that this is peak survival horror from my experience (Resident Evil and Silent Hill respectively).[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udcdcStory[/td]\n        [td]The story is basic, simple, but actually really good. It\u2019s a fun story that makes it so easy to understand and follow without getting lost. This is probably my favorite RE story since it\u2019s the first that created the franchise, and it makes sense and can be somewhat believable. Reading all the files in the game really puts you in the experience and they are just so extremely fascinating to read and trying to imagine their situation they went through. Top tier storytelling in the files I must say! I won\u2019t spoil the story, but it\u2019s pretty predictable, but still a blast to play through.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd5bPlaytime[/td]\n        [td]With a healthy amount of unlocks and gamemodes, the replayability is high here. My first game took around 10 hours (that\u2019s including checking every area and file). The game modes even bring more playtime which can change the game drastically, making it harder and a different experience. Each character has a different story as well (to a certain degree). Also you can install a randomizer mod that can really make the game feel challenging and can provide a unique playthrough, with each run being different and possible harder than the last (links will be below).[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfa7Sound[/td]\n        [td]The sound design is perfect. All from the ambiance outside, hearing the crows and bugs in the night adds a calm, but eerie feeling. The zombie noises in each hallway, adding dread and fear to the experience. The sound track and safe room is absolutely incredible. The voice acting is better than the original, but still feels awkward in some areas.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\u2757Bugs\u2757[/td]\n        [td]There is one music score that is sped up for some reason. Not sure if it\u2019s a bug, but if you heard the original than the remaster it\u2019s noticeable. It\u2019s not a huge deal if you haven\u2019t played the original. There is a patch for this luckily which will be linked below. The game can crash if you ALT+TAB too many times as well.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd05Performance[/td]\n        [td]The game runs smoothly on my system.

A gem of a game![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd17Conclusion[/td]\n        [td]Resident Evil is a rare game to find not just on Steam, but in general. This was Resident Evil at its peak. I wish the RE2 and RE3 remakes followed this route but we still have the RE 1 Remake which is a gold staple of how you do a remake properly. This game made me enjoy Resident Evil as a whole and to this day, is still one of the best horror games to date. What can I say? It\u2019s a gem of a game we all should play at least once in our life.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/304240/Resident_Evil/\n\n[b]Links to help you in Resident Evil:[/b]\n[olist]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379911053] 100% Achievement Guide [/url]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2757461826] Ultimate RE1 Mod List [/url]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=384086269] Resident Evil - Chris and Jills Walkthrough [/url]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379520659] Maps & Items Guide [/url]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382320830] Ultimate Guide [/url]\n[/olist]\n\n[b]Specs for Review:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]GPU: ASUS GeForce GTX 1070 8GB ROG Strix\n[*]CPU: Intel Core i5-6600K 3.9 GHz\n[*]RAM: Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4 3200MHz\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1674697067, "timestamp_updated": 1684218732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 11701, "total_negative": 909, "total_reviews": 12610}, "cursors": {"AoJ4n6nu9YUDe7Pu9QM=": "Thu Nov 23 23:27:36 2023", "AoJ4mf610YsDeOnlugQ=": "Thu Nov 23 23:54:48 2023"}}
