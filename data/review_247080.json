In other rhythm games whatever you do doesn't need planning or thought but memorization and repetition. Sure, the gratification you get from completing more conventional rhythm games can be good, but in this game as you were the one in control the whole time and not a mapmaker, you feel so satisfied by the end of a run (or unsatisfied if you need to git gud).\n\nThe music is simply superb for all characters, both the themes of each level and boss fit their places very well. You can listen to any part of the songs almost (Aria...) indefinitely. Some remixes do make it hard to feel the rhythm at times but you can select a different remix or the og themes to combat that or simply get better ears. \n\nThe game controls are great and easy to learn aside from a few combos maybe, but you can set those to their own keys if you want to.\n\nThe enemies can feel repetitive within each level as there aren't many of them, but their myriad of interactions with the map, other enemies and the traps will make up for that for sure. So many times I was amazed at seeing an interaction I simply did not think possible. Boss and miniboss variety is also a bit of an issue I feel, but I understand it's tough to design unique bosses for a game like this, and it's really not the main part of the game aside from the end bosses. You're mostly playing to clear the floors and beat the end boss. \n\nThere are plenty of items and modifiers within the game that you really have to think about. Would you like to see where all the enemies are in the floor? Well you can, but they will return the favor. Would you like extra strength at the cost of being able to discern the enemies well? These choices come up every run and you have to choose well to win.\n\nThe characters have fascinating playstyles that can be tough to get accustomed to or plain tough. What I can guarantee is that they are all fun in their own ways. You want to learn the movements of the enemies better and plan more? There's the Bard for you. A simple run? Cadence will do great. You want to torture yourself? You have pleeeeenty of options.\n\nOverall, this is one of my favorite games ever and I can't see many aspects of it I dislike/find lacking.

They were professional and kind too! This made my day.\nI'll be undoing the downvote on this upon posting this update. \n\nThank you so much Maddie!\n\nI won't deny my own skill issues at this game but there was just something about the losses themselves that felt way worse than they should have been. The endboss luck on summons is at its most egregious coinciding Dorian only having 4 hearts as opposed to training's 6 which is where I thought it was most frustrating as I feel the lack of acency there where skill doesn't seem to mean everything.\n\nI do appreciate the game's components though and plays nicely. If anyone's reading this modified review and pondering if they should get it remember you are signing up for a VERY difficult game and there's a sizable learning curve where the individual levels will grill you until you \"git gud\" so to speak. Good luck and happy necrodancing!\n\n------------------\ninitial review:\nI really want to love this game, but with each death, no matter how prepped I was on level 4/all levels, it just left me feeling rotten and cheated each time something went wrong. \n\nI was trying to think about what was going wrong, but I realize that the RNG is supremely dependent even for a roguelike, This is especially the case with the end boss on both bomb tiles and summons fighting the titular necrodancer. Worse still in phase 2, you can have moments where his first three summons are three red dragons followed by two ogres, on top of all gray skeletons with shields. When he map controls a half portion of the map on mid with freezing and explosions, all of this will option-select Dorian into the grave, who is woefully underkitted compared to Cadence.\n\nI want to love it for the soundtrack and chess motifs, but the less agency I felt I had in this game and my inability to separate skill issue from RNG, I can only give this recommend to people who absolutely enjoys rhythm games as while, and are willing to hold myriad L's from circumstances out of their control.", "timestamp_created": 1696681400, "timestamp_updated": 1697316410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1697142524, "developer_response": "Hi there!

After that, you have an absolute freedom and expressive creativity.\nEven almost a decade after its release, the game continues bringing new quality of life updates, and the DLC should have been given a lot more attention. The game has a ton of accessibility and customizability functions. However, the achievements are real, tough achievements, that just a regular person like me can't dream to achieve without spending several more hundreds of hours in the game!\nThis might not be a \"rhythm game\", but it fulfulls other needs very easily, such as that roguelike and discovery and strategy paying off feeling, alongside the need for zen focus and music.\n\nHighly recommend this game, even at full price, if you're willing to put at least about 50 hours on it to learn it properly!\n\nEdit: highly looking forward for Rift of the Necrodancer!", "timestamp_created": 1696128892, "timestamp_updated": 1696128926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658917605876922607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147397029": {"recommendationid": "147397029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219574193", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 1325, "last_played": 1699907849}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first saw the game years ago, I was immediately sold.

arthritis, i find it difficult to find accessible games that i can play, but the level of accessibility in crypt of the necrodancer is amazing! the amount of settings you can adjust and customise and the fact that the skill barrier is determined by actual skill in the game is so wonderful! i've been able to beat difficult characters i never thought i would be able to\n\nspeaking of characters, the dlc in cotnd is what i always use as an example of good dlc! actual downloadable content that adds onto the game with the original still playable without it! and the fact that synchrony was added after 5 years after amplified with regular updates and incredible support shows that the devs put time and effort into this game and the community supports it!\n\nthe story is short but sweet, but definitely worth it as the difficulty in getting the cutscenes by using specific characters increases, making it all the more worthwhile to reach the ending. the creativity in the range of characters (both in design and in gameplay functionality) makes it very hard to get bored, not to mention the wide range of modes!\n\nas it's a rhythm game, the music seems essential to perfect and make sure it's good. crypt of the necrodancer takes this and goes beyond. the amount of soundtracks (along with mod support for adding more!) and the actual tracks themselves are unbelievably good, seriously i've been listening for several years straight how am i not sick of this\n\ni could rant about this game for hours, i am literally obsessed with it and recommend it to everyone. thank you to the devs for making this game and maintaining it so well, thank you also for nocturna and aria and suzu my gay ass is obsessed with them. rift hype!!\n\n(and i did wait until 690 hours to review

The game's difficulty curve can feel unreasonably steep, especially when transitioning between characters like Aria, whose punishing gameplay lacks the advantages of other characters. This can make progression feel more like a chore than a satisfying challenge.\n\nMoreover, the game's presentation of information is lacking. Players are left to decipher the effects of items, shrines, and enemies through trial and error, often resulting in frustrating and unnecessary deaths. This lack of clarity can hinder the learning process and discourage further exploration.\n\nCombat is also problematic. The need to memorize enemy attack patterns and execute precise moves can feel like homework, stifling the organic and enjoyable aspects of combat. This issue, combined with the lack of intuitive response to enemy actions, can lead to repetitive and tedious engagements, undermining the potential for engaging gameplay.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer's challenging difficulty spikes, lack of clear information, and often tedious combat mechanics can overshadow its innovative concept, making it a less appealing choice for players seeking a balanced and enjoyable roguelike experience.

I recommend this game to certain people, but not everyone.\n\nFirst of all, the game is great, the music is awesome, the minor story there is -fine- it has a little bit of everything in the right balance.\n\nI recommend this game to the casual player, who would like to play a little bit of this game, maybe complete the game on the first and second main characters.  But that's all.  The rest of this review is for any completionists or anyone who cares about their overall game completion percentage.\n\nNearly half of the achievements require you to run a character from Zone 1 - 4 (to 5 if you have Amplified, which you might as well if you're going for 100%), and then there's a few that requires you to do a single run EVERY character in All Zones.  Die with any character and you have to go back to Cadence.  Okay, fairly difficult you might think, but there are some really challenging characters, one of which being the 3rd and last main protagonist that requires PERFECT PLAY with the basic weapon only.  I've not completed one with them yet and by my estimate it would be about 20 minutes with just her.\nAye but that's not the least of the challenge.  There is a modifier called Low%, which instantly kills your character if you pick up any items, or activate any shrines. So give or take more time has to be added to that counter for that one character...\nAnd guess what?  There are achievements tied to running All Characters mode on Low%...  That's really the nail in the coffin for me.\n\nI wouldn't be writing this review if their achievement design wasn't this way.  Maybe just the one character on Low%, but every character?  It's an awful experience.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, you'll no doubt hear the line that you can avoid getting hit altogether if you learn the enemies' patterns and react accordingly, but when you're stuck going down a hallway with an wizard skeleton's projectile and an orc with that you couldn't see with your low vision radius, running side-by-side to your eventual demise... you'll know that's bs.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tl;dr is play it casually for the story, but if you're going for the achievements, know that you're going to have a bad time.", "timestamp_created": 1689677906, "timestamp_updated": 1689678025, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142318574": {"recommendationid": "142318574", "author": {"steamid": "76561199151338279", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1698609540}, "language": "english", "review": "this game will decrease your iq points if you play it with friends", "timestamp_created": 1689670806, "timestamp_updated": 1689670806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543859660625457764", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142292656": {"recommendationid": "142292656", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095784752", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1349, "last_played": 1690587830}, "language": "english", "review": "I like rhythm games but they are often trash.\nThis one isn't, this one is good.", "timestamp_created": 1689629552, "timestamp_updated": 1689629552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142031501": {"recommendationid": "142031501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096590656", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 451, "last_played": 1689394470}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, much enjpyment", "timestamp_created": 1689302538, "timestamp_updated": 1689302538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141865739": {"recommendationid": "141865739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156946200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1689944396}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool concept and amazing music, but I think the gameplay is pretty bad.

Everglades\nI'd one drink, but no more\n\nI was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight\nGazing up at the stars\nNot aware of a presence so near to me\nWatching my every move\n\nFeeling scared and I fell to my knees\nAs something rushed me from the trees\nTook me to an unholy place\nAnd that is where I fell from grace\n\nThen they summoned me over to join in with them\nTo the dance of the dead\nInto the circle of fire, I followed them\nInto the middle I was led\n\nAs if time had stopped still\nI was numb with fear, but still\nI wanted to go\nAnd the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me\nAs I walked onto the coals\n\nAnd I felt I was in a trance\nAnd my spirit was lifted from me\nAnd if only someone had the chance\nTo witness what happened to me\n\nAnd I danced, and I pranced\nAnd I sang with them\nAll had death in their eyes\nLifeless figures\nThey were undead, all of them\nThey had ascended from hell\n\nAs I danced with the dead\nMy free spirit was laughing\nAnd howling down at me\nBelow my undead body\nJust danced the circle of dead\n\nUntil the time came to reunite us both\nMy spirit came back down to me\nI didn't know if I was alive or dead\nAs the others all joined in with me\n\nBy luck then a skirmish started\nAnd took the attention away from me\nWhen they took their gaze from me\nWas the moment that I fled\n\nI ran like hell, faster than the wind\nBut behind I did not glance\nOne thing that I did not dare\nWas to look just straight ahead\n\nWhen you know that your time has come around\nYou know you'll be prepared for it\nSay your last goodbyes to everyone\nHave a drink and say a prayer for it\n\nWhen you're lying in your sleep\nWhen you're lying in your bed\nAnd you wake from your dreams\nTo go dancing with the dead\n\nWhen you're lying in your sleep\nWhen you're lying in your bed\nAnd you wake from your dreams\nTo go dancing with the dead\n\nTo this day I guess I'll never know\nJust why they let me go\nBut I'll never go dancing no

It is balanced, fun and has a unique learning curve to it.\n\nIt goes from casual to ridiculously challenging depending on what character and mode you play in, each character plays differently from another, for example a character who plays at double speed or a character who is unable to pick gold or else it kills you, every enemy drops gold and it becomes an obstacle course. \n\nThe game is not easy with its fast paced and strategic gameplay as well its difficulty being steep. However you can practice against any enemy, boss and start off at later areas with buffs to practice. There are no drawbacks to using assist modes.\n\nThere is more to the game after you complete the game with Cadence, Melody and Aria, since there are other characters to play as and achievements to complete.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is packed, there are three remixes of the soundtrack ranging from chiptune to metal, two which play for specific characters and one that is selectable in the menu. The rhythm of the songs are comfortable to follow along.\n\n[b]FURTHER INFO:[/b] Some characters play better with the AMPLIFIED DLC installed and there is online co-op available from the SYNCHRONY DLC. SYNCHRONY also comes with mod support, which works in multiplayer too.

Think of Patapons, a game that's about army management, yet it has that charm thanks to the mechanic of having to give commands by playing out specific rhythms.\n\nIn the same vein, Necrodancer is your standard roguelike, but with the element of having to perform all actions to the rhythm, and thanks to the game's design, humour and balancing, it has that charm you can't find elsewhere. But at the same time, it stays immensely challenging; having to solve logic puzzles while having very little time to react turn-to-turn makes the gameplay extremely fast paced and strategic.\n\nAt its core, the game is not supposed to be easy. Not in the slightest. But it is well aware of that, and it grants the player the power to improve at their own leisure. You can't even play all zones mode from the very start, you first have to beat the individual zones, and you are given very generous bonuses doing so to make sure you aren't overwhelmed. The game also introduces training modes and even ability to start runs with items a la assist mode.\n\nTo beat the game you just have to beat all 4 zones individually with the three story characters: Cadence, Melody and Aria. While the first 2 are pretty straightforward to deal with after enough experience, Aria is the true final test of the game, requiring you to essentially master it. I won't spoil what the characters do nor what the story is, as I found it very intruiging to learn by myself.\n\nAfter you beat these characters, you've essentially beaten the game. You've seen the story and you conquered one of the hardest characters in the game. But from the achievement and content perspective, you still have a lot to do. And climbing that mountain of feats is a never ending cliff that just keeps getting steeper and steeper. Let me explain:\n\nIn total, including the story characters, there are 9 characters, each with their own quirks that make them play out much more differently from one another. For instance, Eli doesn't have a weapon but an infinite supply of bombs which he can throw at enemies, Dorian moves two spaces at once, Dove has to play the game pacifist style. Majority of the characters are fun on their own, but some other ones pose a huge challenge, testing your skills in different areas.\n\nAside from Aria, other challenging characters are Monk and Bolt. Monk has vow of poverty, which means picking up any gold will kill him instantly. Since every enemy drops gold, this turns the character into a huge test when it comes to kiting and managing the minefield that will inevitably emerge when clearing rooms. Bolt is probably the craziest character, and has to play the game at double speed. This makes the character extremely fast paced and requires a significantly more strategic approach, as reacting to situations at such speed is simply not humanly possible, and that's when you know how to keep the tempo - which is extremely daunting in itself. On this character, the slowest song is already faster than the fastest song on any different character, which goes to show how insane it gets.\n\nAdditionally, the game has an 'all characters run' which requires you to beat all zones mode with all 9 characters in a row. If you die once, you have to start the streak from zero, and items dont transfer between runs. This run requires absolute mastery over each character, and thus the game itself. But completing it will unlock the 10th character, not included in all chars run, which is so absurd not even the lead designer could beat the game with it - he gave up after completing the first zone. That character is Coda.\n\nCoda is probably the most ridiculous challenge to exist in any game, and as someone who does enjoy challenging themselves and achieved a few feats in various genres, this character trumps everything I've ever done in terms of absurdity and tenacity required for completion. Like every other character, to unlock the respective achievement, you need to clear all zones mode with Coda. But now, let me say what the character actually is: it's a combination of Aria, Monk and Bolt, combined into one character. Full list of mechanics is:\n\n- you can only use the default dagger as a weapon\n- you are stuck at half a heart, meaning any hit will kill you instantly\n- missing any beat will kill you\n- all enemies drop gold, and picking up gold kills you instantly\n- game plays at double speed\n\nEven on paper this sounds absolutely ridiculous. The combination of double speed and missing beats killing you is already insane enough, and combine it with other downsides. This character requires insane amount of commitment, requiring you to essentially learn the game inside out and truly perfect all the skills required to even have a CHANCE at clearing the character. The whole run takes around 10 minutes, but commitment on the character alone requires well over 200 hours if you're up to the challenge, and that's after all the skill buildup you had to go through to unlock the character in this place.\n\nIs it absurd? Yes. But is it impossible? Probably not.\n\nBut so is everything in life until you've done it enough. When I first unlocked coda I thought I would play it as a joke at most, but as I kept putting time in I saw real improvement, and now so much time has passed I am finally standing up to the task and am on my way to clear the character. At times it feels impossible, ridiculous, something I would never do, something others have done probably because they aren't human, but as I keep going I know I will eventually stand triumphant and conquer this ridiculous challenge.\n\nBut back on track: The game in itself is awesome. It's plain fun, soundtrack is awesome and, as I mentioned, it's an absurdly difficult climb that only the most dedicated people will conquer. Regardless if you're here to have a nice casual experience or truly stress test your human abilities, this game is a no brainer. If it even slightly tickles you fancy, buy it.\n\nTLDR:\nFor casuals, it's probably one of the most well balanced and fun roguelike experiences out there to experience.\nFor completionists, you better make this game your second life and consume your soul; otherwise forget completing it.\n\nBuy it.", "timestamp_created": 1677346326, "timestamp_updated": 1677346326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715460896492004395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133542088": {"recommendationid": "133542088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828962158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1692982081}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't imagine hopping around can be this much fun!", "timestamp_created": 1677289802, "timestamp_updated": 1679860756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133534790": {"recommendationid": "133534790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029433435", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1695416544}, "language": "english", "review": "incredibly polished rhythm game with fun gameplay, good roguelike elements and catchy music.

Both genres are made best with a perfect balance of skill and luck, which this title does an excellent job of providing. Another common trait of a good roguelite is still being fun even if you almost never win, and yes, this game does a great job of that too. Win or lose, every run is all but guaranteed to entertain.\n\nEven those with no sense of rhythm won't be disappointed; there is a custom mode called 'no beat mode' which allows the player to go at their own pace, as well as a character which can do this regardless of the gamemode which is unlocked by default.\n\nSpeaking of characters, there's a lot of them. Each one provides a definitively unique experience from the others. To name a few character quirks, we have:\n-Moves twice as far, can take damage to move normally (Dorian)\n-Gets free items from shops, but dies when picking up gold (Monk)\n-Cannot damage enemies directly, but has infinite bombs and can run into bombs to kick them at things (Eli)\n-Kills in 1 hit, but dies if he fails to kill anything for too long (Tempo, requires the Amplified DLC)\nThere's many more than this to boot.\n\nThe game is also surprisingly story-rich, following three generations of women in a family of musicians trying to break a curse set upon them by an evil bard and a magical lute. The lore of the game doesn't run terribly deep, but it's enough to hold your engagement and see it through to the end.\n\nThere's really nothing about Crypt of the NecroDancer to dislike, since if you have a problem with anything in the game, the game itself provides you a way to get rid of it.

you're making progress, you have permanent upgrades and it's entertaining to do runs this way though this ends quickly; you will only use your diamond currency after just to buy new items so they are added up into your next runs in the shops, this doesn't do it for me since most of the items are the very same items just a little different, it gets boring fast.\nWith this going on, you will soon forget to go to the lobby because it doesn't feel rewarding to go there anymore, you've already upgraded most of what you could upgrade, the rest are mostly the same items as the ones you already have.\nThe way you're playing this game is by learning monster's pathing, you move, they move, you stimulate, they follow; if you understand their pathing you know how to beat them, this is interesting and pretty unique but it can be problematic if you ask me, if the dungeons are random be sure it will not go so smoothly each and every single moment, what that does it's that it makes it feel RNG, let's say you spawn against a dragon, depending on its color it will differ in its movement and some of them need space for you to kill them, if you don't have enough space and they spawn near you, you will struggle, what happens is that you can end up dying for stupid reasons when you shouldn't have.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that if you get spawned in a place where you don't have where to move and you're surrounded by monsters, you can't do much about it, this is too irregular for me.\nThe replay value sits on the challenges created by the character you're playing to do the zones, with each character you will have a distinct experience in gameplay, some harder than others, this is fine but I still need to feel that I'm making real progress so I keep on going, not play for the sake of playing, getting achievements when I'm not having the most fun in the world, this with the fact that it can be full of RNG at times makes it tough to continue playing.\nAs long as this is your thing, you will relish this endure.\nThe game is unusual with the mechanics which I respect, the music is fantastic and some characters got their special tracks, mostly remixing the originals so that gets a plus by me.\nAll and all, a decent game.\n\n7/ 10.", "timestamp_created": 1671735599, "timestamp_updated": 1671735599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

I'm NOT going to remove anything, simply because PART of why I'm giving this a positive review, is BECAUSE of how amazing the developers were in helping me solve my issues with me previously negative review.)\n\n(THAT being said... I DO thoroughly enjoy this game. And to people who say it's \"Too hard\"... just do what I do, play Bard, put whatever music you WANT to listen to on, and get the hammer asap and win :V)\n\n(The Bard basically makes it so it's more like a turn based game, which makes it a lot more calm and fun in my opinion. But at the same time you still get to have all the flashy colors and strategic gameplay that the game normally requires, BUT you can do it at your own pace)\n\n(I love this game because it has such a variety of playstyles, and it's SIMPLE. It's a simple premise that just executes perfectly.... iiiif... you overlook the technical difficulties of ALL kinds this game sometimes has... buuuut...\n\nAGAIN the developers are really helpful and they do their best to make their game work the way they intended.... and then I break it with a hammer... (seriously I can not stress how amazing the Hammer from the Amplified DLC is just the funnest thing ever.))\n\n(Everything below this line was my old review including updates)\n\nAll the updates for this game have completely made it unplayable.\n\nI used to LOVE this game, it was a very chill game to play while listening to music.\n\nBut because of all the updates I can't assign my controls to the way I used to have them.\n\nThere needs to be LEGACY options for people who have had the game before, and then just completely lost playability because of the new additions.\n\nThe updates don't mean anything if the game won't actually let me play it anymore.\n\n(UPDATE)\n\nI MUST give credit where credit is due. I respect Vortex Buffer for their timely response to my complaint.\n\nI will be attempting to use the suggestions given, AND if I can get the game back up and running again, I WILL be changing the review from a negative to a positive.\n\nBecause I DID like the game... over 150 hours on record playing it.\n\nAND because they responded and are at the very least TRYING to help me fix the problem, I think THAT just shows that they're a good company.\n\nSo EVEN IF I'm never able to play Crypt of the Necrodancer again, they DO at least deserve the kudos.\n\nThank you for at least hearing my complaint. And offering solutions.\n(And yes I play with a Controller but I really don't like the Steam overlay when it comes to trying to get keybinds to work, because then that ends up being janky for my other games. :T)\n\n(UPDATE 2)\n\nOk so I got it to do the legacy thing ONCE... but then subsequent tries it wouldn't work, and trying to set the thing on steam it doesn't have a drop down menu for me, it wants me to type something and I'm not sure exactly what it wants me to type.\n\n(Also for some reason I can't get the Up + Down combo to work... which sucks considering that usually ends up being how my character can use food items.)\n\n(UHmmm update... 2.5?)\n\nNVM, I'm an idiot... welllll... it's not responding to my left/right triggers and bumpers.... buuuut it's at LEAST playable again now.\n\nAs promised I'll change the review to a positive one... though I wish it wouldn't have changed. At least NOT without buying the DLC if that makes sense?\n\nI bought Amplified, and to me that was all it needed... I completely understand that other players might want more, buuut...\n\nI mean... \"Hammer = Best weapon...\" sooo...\n\nI would just say that changing the base game based on the DLC updates is the frustrating part.\n\nBut thank you again, you were a really REALLY big help and I can now at least ENJOY one of my favorite time killers again ^^", "timestamp_created": 1671710608, "timestamp_updated": 1671810012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468164771795272827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1671716637, "developer_response": "Hi! Thank you for the feedback.\n\nIf you're playing on keyboard: In newer versions, multi-key combos (such as UP+LEFT) are handled slightly differently by default. Instead of being locked to combinations of your movement keys, they are now fully customizable. For example, if you move using WASD and prefer to use \"W+A\" to activate an item, you can use the \"Reassign controls\" menu to bind \"Use item\" to W+A by pressing and holding both the 'W' and 'A' keys in the rebinding prompt. Repeat this for the other multi-key combos, and you'll have the same control scheme from previous versions back. You can also use the second and third columns to assign multiple keys/combinations to the same action.\n\nIf you're playing on controller: In version 3.0.0, we've added Steam Input integration to support a greater variety of controller types. If you've played on a controller before that version, you might need to update to the new controller bindings. See here for a guide on how to set up Steam Input and fix this issue: https://steamcommunity.com/app/247080/discussions/2/4794664409783927460/\n\nFinally, if you just want to go back to the Legacy version of the game, this is definitely possible! When launching the game, Steam will prompt you to choose between \"Play Crypt of the NecroDancer\", \"Legacy launch in windowed mode\" and \"Legacy launch in fullscreen mode\". If you do not see these options, right click on Crypt of the NecroDancer's entry in your Steam library, click \"Properties\", and click on the \"Launch options\" dropdown. Select one of the \"Legacy\" options there, and you'll have version 2.59 (AMPLIFIED) or 1.29 (base game) back."}, "128988946": {"recommendationid": "128988946", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990762902", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1629361863}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to like this game, unfortunately it's way too hard for me to have fun :/\n\nIt has very good mechanics, but it's very challenging and there is no progression feeling when you constantly die", "timestamp_created": 1671659691, "timestamp_updated": 1671659691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496950805187225342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128983863": {"recommendationid": "128983863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077333137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4237, "last_played": 1697660703}, "language": "english", "review": "Impressive.

dificultad del mismo reside exclusivamente en la habilidad del jugador m\u00e1s que en su adaptaci\u00f3n o familiaridad en el uso de teclado o mando.\n\nEl sistema roguelike permite una gran personalizaci\u00f3n de la build de un personaje, haciendo la partida entre varios jugadores totalmente distintas gracias a la utilidad conjunta de los NPC's de compra y eliminaci\u00f3n de objetos y habilidades.\n\nAl emplear \u00fanicamente las 4 teclas mencionadas, puede jugarse con s\u00f3lo una mano, mientras con la otra tamborileas al ritmo del Heartbeat la mesa, ya que la personalidad del juego reside en este sistema de movimientos regidos por un comp\u00e1s que marca cada una de las acciones disponibles para el jugador (desplazamiento, ataque, casteo del hechizo, bombas, excavar y lanzamiento del arma).\n\nNo solamente contamos con el gran repertorio de armas y habilidades, tambi\u00e9n hay un amplio abanico de personajes con distintas razones para explorar las catacumbas: algunos que aportar\u00e1n a un Lore simple pero conciso; y otros que simplemente supondr\u00e1n un reto curioso a batir en el juego.\n\nY para retos, la secci\u00f3n de los diarios. Cada 24 h un jugador puede aceptar un reto diario que resetea sus mejoras para competir en un mapa exactamente igual para todos los jugadores del reto, de forma que en un ranking final se ver\u00e1n reflejadas las run de cada uno en igualdad de condiciones.\n\nSin duda, un producto hecho para qui\u00e9n le guste la m\u00fasica y los retos.\nY si te gusta, hay sorpresita con Zelda en un crossover para Switch.\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1670385639, "timestamp_updated": 1670385639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540069699287414551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128081353": {"recommendationid": "128081353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232276100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1538, "last_played": 1697375677}, "language": "english", "review": "fucking difficult. you'll sink hours going \"cmon one more run\"", "timestamp_created": 1670385079, "timestamp_updated": 1670385079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128037701": {"recommendationid": "128037701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132001036", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1700739065}, "language": "english", "review": "Rogue-like + Rhythm game = a new kind of fun", "timestamp_created": 1670331872, "timestamp_updated": 1670331872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128017382": {"recommendationid": "128017382", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039325029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1685417467}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1670301353, "timestamp_updated": 1670301353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128009983": {"recommendationid": "128009983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872796550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 14064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "playtime_at_review": 3249, "last_played": 1700281514}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

But it feels incredibly rewarding when you get into a groove and can dodge every enemy attack while weaving in for a few strikes.\n\nThis game only uses four buttons, being 4 directional inputs. This control scheme lends itself very well to the rhythm gimmick as it reduces the amount of options you have to worry about in a game that demands a constant stream of inputs from the player. Also as a fun side effect, if you have a DDR dance pad controller sitting around you can play with that!\n\nThe base soundtrack is very good to the point where I put it on sometimes when I'm listening to music, but if you ever get tired of playing to the same tracks, you can put in your own music (on the PC version only) and have an entirely different experience.

I struggled to break through a few walls in NecroDancer, the first of which was getting a feel for the game at all. The very first Zone is an exercise in adaptation - a trial by fire for a new player. But with time I started to get in the groove and the experience grew more enjoyable and more interesting with every new floor.\nAnd with each new floor and each new Zone come new enemies, new obstacles, new bosses, new challenges. By constantly shaking up both style and substance, Crypt of the NecroDancer stays fresh and fun hour after hour.\n\nThe other tough wall I hit was in Zone 4, where I found myself growing weary of repeated fights against the Zone boss, and of repeated treks through the Zone to reach it. But finally breaking through was incredibly rewarding, and few other games have given me the same satisfaction as reaching the end of the Crypt and seeing the credits roll.\nAll of this is made possible by the pounding, rhythmic, dance floor ambiance of Danny Baranowsky, who never misses a beat. His pedigree is well established in the indie scene, but he does not DJ here alone. A number of alternate pieces from collaborators and friends round out this must own original soundtrack.\n\n2022's Synchrony update brought the ability to play NecroDancer in larger numbers than ever, and the multiplayer mode is a blast that has proven very popular for couch co-op.\n\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is the perfect rhythm dungeon crawler, now more than ever.", "timestamp_created": 1669539607, "timestamp_updated": 1669539642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127174244": {"recommendationid": "127174244", "author": {"steamid": "76561199295558074", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1671701984}, "language": "english", "review": "Just got this game on a large discount, but I'd still recommend it otherwise.

When you want a change of pace, the large set of characters and game modes to select from introduce new mechanics that change the gameplay in interesting ways. If you want to aim for a goal besides simply surviving, you can attempt to optimize runs for speed or score.\n\nNone of this even touches on the level editor, which can be a lot of fun in its own right. Creating levels for friends is a simple process, so you can share your work with others. It also makes testing and practicing specific niche scenarios much easier.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n(And now with the addition of online multiplayer, even more highly recommended.

I mean, yes, it is; that's what it set out to do, and managed to zone in on exactly what was fun about the idea with surgical precision. Mix that with some really rocking soundtrack and lots of highly diverse content... is it any wonder this game blew up like it did?\n\nOkay, okay. Those are some strong words that don't really say anything, you probably think. I'll try to explain, but the best way to summarise is this: not only you need to move and attack in a very specific rhythm, you also need to be on the lookout for your enemies and predict what they'll do, so you can exploit holes in their patterns. And having to do both at the same time makes your brain work at like 400% efficiency; And that insane level of engagement is this sweet syrup that is the very base of what makes Necrodancer so freaking fun.\n\n[h1]Highly diverse content[/h1]\nLet's talk about weapons. By default, you've got the dagger - it can deal 1 damage to an adjacent enemy. Typical, if you're familiar with the classic roguelike design. But then you get the spear; it can hit an enemy that's one field away from you, or right next to you. Or a longsword? It can hit them both in one swing. Or my personal fav, a rapier: it can hit an adjacent enemy, but if you attack an enemy that's one space away, you will lunge towards them and deal double damage. Risky, but rewarding.\n\nThere's a lot more weapons, and many are much more exotic and difficult to use; the point I'm making is that your options will vary greatly depending on what gear you have. Keep in mind, this is all in addition to having to move to the rhythm, and the enemies still do the same patterns! Getting the picture yet?\n\n[h1]They lead, you follow[/h1]\nI could tell you more about different kinds of gear (there's a lot), but let's talk about enemies instead. The base game (without DLC) is split into 4 zones. Each of them has mostly unique enemies, and they don't just scale up in damage/health; all of them have different patterns and mechanics. At first the patterns are easy and there are no secondary effects, and most enemies move slower than you. But then armoured enemies show up, requiring you to either bypass of break through their shields (not always possible). Then you get enemies that phase through walls. Then you get enemies which run away when you face them, and close in on you when you turn your back to them. Then you get enemies that will parry all your attacks and counterattack, forcing you to do a counter-counter. And so on. That's just a small sample, by the way.\n\nTo add yet another shelf to this trove of content, let me mention... the characters. Yeah, there are many unlockable characters, and almost all of them have some kind of quirk that completely switches up the gameplay. There's a guy who can only use bombs, but they're infinite and he can kick them. There's a guy that dies when picking up gold. There's a chick that can't attack at all, but she can confuse enemies. They're usually harder to play than Cadence, the main heroine. Two of those characters warrant a mention: Melody and Aria.\n\n[h1]Dancing queens, feat. DJ DannyB[/h1]\nSee, if you want to beat the story of the game, you have to first win as Cadence, which unlocks Melody - and she in turn unlocks Aria on victory. Melody is generally similar to Cadence, except her health is a little lower and she's got a unique weapon which can't be switched out. Aria on the other hand is a completely different story. She dies in one hit, can only use the dagger, and dies if you miss a beat. It's a gigantic difficulty spike; I don't know how I managed to beat Aria's episode, I just know it took me forever and I couldn't replicate that feat since. Still, beating her is only required to see the ending, but it doesn't really change anything - you still have access to everything else.\n\nAll three heroines have their own unique mixes of the soundtrack - and there's a lot of additional mixes, so you can switch things around quite often. Every stage has its own track, and they slowly increase in BPM the further you get. That probably goes without saying, but the music is full of bangers; It's composed by Danny Baranowsky - you zoomers probably don't know who that is, but he was the composer for early indie darlings: Super Meat Boy and original Binding of Isaac. Quality ensured!\n\n[h1]Party until dawn[/h1]\nI've been doing daily challenges for years now, it's part of my evening routine. After all this time, if I had to complain about something... it's that certain builds are just clearly superior to others, so most of my runs end up looking exactly the same towards the end. I deal with this with some self-imposed rules, f.ex. first weapon I pick up is my weapon for the entire run. Or I use only exotic weapons which are hard to use. It's not a necessity, though; the game's still fun, even after all those years.\n\nAs a closing statement, I'd like to point towards a certain other game by this developer: Cadence of Hyrule. It's a Zelda game with Necrodancer twist. Let me rephrase that: Nintendo, who's famously super defensive of their IP, granted a Zelda license to an indie studio. If that's not a reliable mark of quality then I don't know what is. Coincidentally, I believe Necrodancer to be much better of the two; so what are you waiting for? Get down on that dance floor! Even for a full price, this game will always be worth it.

I find myself coming back to it from time to time, just to rock to the killer soundtracks and try my hand at the characters I suck at.\n\nI never even beat it until the latest DLC dropped and I made a new go of finishing an All Zones Run... Eventually, I made it happen. And made it happen with several more characters shortly afterwards.\n\nIf you haven't peeped this game yet, you're missing out, without a doubt. Roguelite progression, tons of characters, lots of unique weapons and equipment to differentiate each run, and the big seller: the unbeatable soundtrack. Each remix pack is great in its own way, and I've yet to find one I don't like, though some I prefer above all others.\n\nRoguelite rhythm and epic beats.

Disregarding the rhythm aspect of the game, the controls are tight and the game does a relatively good job of explaining its mechanics(with exceptions of course). Unlike a lot of other rogue-likes, doing well in CotND requires more skill and game sense rather than luck and RNG. Those aspects are still there, of course- it wouldn't be a rogue-like without them- but rarely did I find myself dying to something that was completely out of my control. Usually(and I would like the emphasize my use of the word USUALLY) when I died I would think \"ah shit I should have done [BLANK]\" instead of \"there was nothing I could do, that was BS\" which I think is telling of how well designed the game is. Additionally, run attempts tend to fall in just the right spot for me where they dont last too long-such as Hades and its over 30 minute run attempts- nor too short- such as Speluky's insignificant run attempts. Most runs lasted anywhere between 10-20 minutes, making them significant enough in scope to be engaging but short enough to add to the game's \"pick up and play\" quality. \n\nContent-wise, while not as much as other rogue-likes such as 'The Binding of Isaac' or the previously mentioned Hades, there's still a ton of additional modes, characters, and unlockables to make it more than worth the price. Plus, the Recent addition of online multiplayer alone is enough for a lot of people to make the game's longevity last essentially forever. \n\nAlthough, despite how much I love this game it does have its fair share of problems, the biggest and most talked about being the characters. Most of the characters are fine and serve their purpose- modifying existing mechanics to change the way you play the game- but some of the characters overstretch a bit too far into the realm of bullshit to be fun (a lot of this may not make a whole lot of sense if you haven't played the game yet so apologies in advance). \n\nAs someone who loves a challenge, I love playing as Aria, but playing as her being a requirement to beat the game is very unfair to those who dont have the time or patience for such a challenge. Coda works as a challenge character since shes completely optional, but locking the game's ending behind such a demanding challenge just feels cheap. I feel like the point where Aria overextends into bullshit mechanically, however, is with the requirement of only using the dagger. Not only is this just really unnecessary, but it also completely eliminates one of my favorite aspects of the game, the weapon variety.\n\nThe Monk is definitely one of the most uninteresting characters in the game, but despite that manages to feel extremely unfair. One slight mishap or mistake and your entire run is dead(without the potion that Aria gets that lets you make at least one mistake before death). Dove is also incredible unfair. Remember earlier how I was talking about how I rarely felt it was the game's fault for me loosing? Dove is the exception. Unless you have the foresight of a god it is very easy to get trapped in a corner or within a group of enemies with no way to get out. When that happens it doesn't matter how good your equipment is or even if you have a potion or not, your run is dead.\n\n\nAll-in-all CotND is a fantastic game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a different take on the all-too-common indie rogue-like. Even if some of the optional content is a little BS, Its got tight game play, solid design, and a ton of replay  value. \n\nAlthough if you have a switch probably just play Cadence of Hyrule its pretty much the same thing but more beginner friendly", "timestamp_created": 1662435063, "timestamp_updated": 1662435063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121800511": {"recommendationid": "121800511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049309790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 451, "last_played": 1674702981}, "language": "english", "review": "Frustrating to start but soon you begin to figure it out.

I have only a couple of complaints: the boss fights are very lame once you learn them except for [spoiler]Death Metal, who stays exciting every time because the extremely fast pace of the song (which is one of the best in the game) keeps the fight intense[/spoiler].\n\nThe game really opens up to you when you beat the game with the first two of the four story-based characters. The third of the primary characters is [i]EXTREMELY HARD[/i], so your mind may wander towards the side characters, each of which have meaningfully unique playstyles.\n\nThe final thing to mention about this game is that the original soundtrack is remixed by other artists [i]seven times[/i], so if you get tired of one set of tracks, you're free to switch to any of the other ones at any time, even mid-run. Not each of the soundtracks is incredible (no disrespect to any of the artists) but they're all interesting enough twists on the original tracks to be very, very worthwhile additions.\n\nIf you haven't tried necrodancer yet, now is the time.

You only use direction keys to move, and if you move into an enemy you attack. There's a tune playing and idealy, you want to time your actions with the tune, to keep some bonuses going.\n [*] Still getting DLCs/updates (despite being ancient). People who come to the party late might see Multiplayer being locked behind DLC and see it as a negative, but keep in mind this is not a cheap change to make (in terms of work).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Difficult. If you look at the game from the side difficulty feels fair, because every action can be calculated to avoid taking damage...assuming you can do it in like half of a second. It doesn't always feel fair in game, but I'll get to that.\n[*] Hectic. Difficulty stems from the fact you have consider multiple things in split second. You have 3 things to keep track of: \n  [list]\n    [*] Rhythm.\n    [*] Monster movement/attack pattern. All of them have patterns and none of them are random.\n    [*] Escape route. This is an extra step of Monster patterns. You have to consider where they will be/attack, because often times they can box you if you don't pay attention. \n   [/list]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n[b]Unfair aspect of the difficulty[/b]\nSo there's 1 aspect to the difficulty that doesn't feel fair, and it's the fact you have to learn most enemy patterns to have a chance of beating them.

This uses fixed thresholds/deadzones for controller axes, similar to previous versions of the game. In this case, it's recommended to switch to the new gamepad bindings (as described in the first section of the \"Controller not working?\" FAQ thread).\n\n2. The new action-based Steam Input bindings (called \"Crypt of the NecroDancer Standard Controls\") are in use, but the analog stick's deadzone is too low or too high. This can be reconfigured in the Steam Input settings (see here for more info: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/steam_controller/getting_started_for_players).\n\nv3.1.3 has a few minor controller-related fixes coming up as well, mostly related to the on-screen button prompts, and legacy bindings sometimes being used despite Steam Input being available, which we'll hopefully have out soon."}, "120374368": {"recommendationid": "120374368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000788475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1661673891}, "language": "english", "review": "I wouldn't recommend this at full price, it's basically a mobile game, but there's no denying it's fun.\n\nThe challenge laid out here is that you need to fight according to the beat, which is an interesting conceit.

It's my favourite game and staying objective will be pretty difficult.\n\n\nTL;DR: It is a fantastic game, and a must-buy considering how often it is on sale. Even if you don't put hundreds of hours into it, you will most likely get at least a couple of hours of enjoyment out of it, and boy is it worth it.\n\n\nJust some random points I find particularily noteworthy about this game:\n\n[list]\n[*]The soundtrack is just *Chef's Kiss*. If you ever feel like the game is kicking your ass just switch to another cover in the options now and again, it'll keep things fresh. The OST is also a banger outside of the game, consider buying it too.\n[*]The pixel art is simple but cute.\n[*]The game only recently received a huge update with countless QOL-improvements, a new DLC and a teaser for a (hopefully) sequel. The devs really care about this game, which is always a positive.\n[*]The game has a multitude of different characters, functioning as different difficulties and game modes. Coupled with other actual game modes and the new online modes you'll have a lot of variety.\n[*]The characters range from challenging but fun, perfect for small runs in between, to bone-grindingly difficult, making beating certain achievements and challenges a learning process that might take dozens and dozens of hours (currently practicing Coda, send help!)\n[*]Finally beating a challenging run in this game might be the most satisfying emotion I might've felt in a game, ever.\n[*]Finally getting to the point where everything clicks and you're instinctively able to play the game comfortably might be the second most satisfying emotion I might've felt in a game, ever.\n[*]The game really puts \"hard but fair\" first. Barring some rare niche situations (no game's perfect), you will always have a way to \"solve\" the game. Every death feels like a learning experience, an opportunity to get more and more comfortable with the game.\n[/list]\n\nSome small negative points that come to mind:\n\n[list]\n[*]Latency calibration for video and audio can take a couple of minutes of fine-tuning. Like every rhythm/music game, really. At least the auto-calibration does a good enough job for the beginning.\n[*]The new online modes are fun as hell, but latency can make it quite wonky at times. It's still fun though and has better net code that many other games (like seriously, CotND get's rollback but many fighting games don't?)\n[*]This game made me annoy a couple people because I'm way too enthusiastic and couldn't shut up about it.\n[/list]\n\n\nSo yeah, it's a really good game. It even made me write my first Steam review.\n\nWant to buy it, but are unsure about the DLCs? Here's a small recommendation:\nThe base game in itself is fantastic, but the Amplified DLC brings even more improvements to balance and variety, I highly recommend getting at least that DLC too.\nThe Synchrony DLC is still in Early Access, but also incredibly fun. Consider getting it too, but definitely prioritize Amplified if you intend to buy only one of the DLCs.", "timestamp_created": 1660000071, "timestamp_updated": 1660000257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120301575": {"recommendationid": "120301575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110665494", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 16777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13756, "last_played": 1699306233}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is satisfying to play and I keep coming back to it.

We've switched to Steam Input action sets for controller support in the v3.0.0 update. It sounds like Steam Input may be operating in \"legacy mode\", which emulates keyboard keys or Xbox-style gamepads. This typically happens when you've used a Steam-Input-enabled controller to play NecroDancer prior to the v3.0 update - Steam Input remembers the legacy controller configuration and tries to apply it in the newer patch.\n\nTo fix controller support, please enable Steam Input in the game's properties in the Steam library, then import and apply the recommended binding template (\"Crypt of the NecroDancer Standard Controls\") in Steam's controller configuration tool.\n\nIf you've already modified the bindings via the in-game options, you can reset them to default by entering \"Reassign Controls\" menu, selecting your controller, and choosing \"Show advanced options\" / \"Reset to default\". This restores the default mapping, allowing you to fully remap the buttons using Steam's Controller Configurator.\n\nThere's an additional setting that causes the game to switch between controller and keyboard input on the fly. This is known as \"controller hot-swap\". You can disable this in the menu under \"Options\" > \"Misc Options\" > \"Show advanced settings\" > \"Controller Hot-Swap\".\n\nIf controller input is still not working afterwards, please feel free

I get that you're supposed to \"dance\" with the enemies, but I dunno.... it just felt tedious going through their patterns and slowly whittling them down. I greatly enjoy both rhythm and roguelike games, and the overwhelmingly positive reviews made me believe I was gonna love this, but now I feel that this game does justice to neither of those genres. \n\nIn particular, the roguelike part feels extremely lacking in the sense of exploration and mystery, and the rhythm part is reduced to simply pressing buttons to the beat, all the time, without any  variation. As other reviewers have pointed out, this game is more like speed-chess with pieces you have to figure out on the fly. I could go to the practice rooms and grind to memorize the enemy patterns, but where's the fun in that? I've also read the suggestion to play as the Bard, but then there's no point in playing this game... I could play other, more dedicated roguelikes.\n\nIt's nice to see the developers still working to improve the game, so I'll throw some suggestions out there. I think there needs to be more animations for telegraphing when an enemy is going to attack. A lot of enemies do have such animations, so it's annoying to see others without them (the skeletons with the shields and bats, for instance).  Also, it would be really nice to have an in-game journal/bestiary so I can read up on enemies and items I have encountered, with animations showing how an enemy moves/attacks. It's really tedious to go to practice rooms and actually fight an enemy to figure out its patterns.\n\nI am not completely against this game... I can see why a lot of people love it, and I might even come back and try it again some time.

Selecting it should bring up a few extra entries, including one labeled \"Level editor\".

To keep the game from going stale it has a wide variety of enemies who's attacks you have to get accustomed to as you play, and just as you think you're starting to solve enemies, they'll start swarming you and leave you with less options. The RNG aspect is used really well here where you'll be able to have favorite types of weapons and item choices, but that might make you pass up better equipment, making you have to strategize to either save money or buy anything you can.

Sign me up!\nI've played this for more than 100 hours on Switch too, and it's an amazing game! You need to follow the rhythm to move, attack and do anything really, but it's extremely forgiving yet punishing.\nAs your chosen character, you have to descend the crypt, getting new weapons, armour and items while satisfyingly striking down everything in your path, while doing it all on an amazing grid-based, almost turn-based game.\nThere are many different enemies and bosses with their own stats and attack/movement patterns that over-time become second nature, and so many weapons that encourage different attack styles. Most of the weapons have variants too, allowing for even higher strategic depth.\nHowever, my biggest problem with the game is the difficulty spike. Now, this isn't a conventional rhythm game, so I did expect a bigger-than-average difficulty jump. However, Aria and Coda are key examples of how to NOT make a difficult character. Putting a no-hit and flawless rhythm challenge on the same character is brutal, and even more so when you are locked to the worst weapon on the game, the dagger. Coda then takes what makes Aria bad and makes it worse by attaching Monk and Bolt's characteristics to the already frustratingly difficult challenge of flawless gameplay.\nIt gets worse considering how:\n1. Aria is required for an achievement and story (yes, this game has a story, not a massive one but good at giving you a reason to murder anything and everything) progression.\n2. Coda is required for an achievement, and thus 100% completion.\nThose two factors means you probably wont 100% this game, even if you beat Aria.\nIf you're looking for a rhythm game with amazing strategic value and split-second decisions, combined with amazingly frustrating difficulty, this is for you. Just make sure you buy the DLC (due to the plethora of content it adds) and can stomach probably never 100-percenting this, and it's sure as hell worth it.\n\nEdited once to change a detail: they finally added the Switch exclusive character to the Steam version, so that's one less nitpick.", "timestamp_created": 1656252010, "timestamp_updated": 1693746570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

Weapon qualities include gold, blood, titanium, obsidian, and glass, which each have unique effects!\n\n[Spells] - If close quarter combat isn't your thing, NecroDancer offers a variety of spellbooks and scrolls (both rechargeable and one-time use). These include offensive spells such as a horizontal fireball and a diagonal pulse, and supportive spells including a fully protective temporary shield, or a self-heal.\n\n[Shopkeeper] - A staple of roguelike games, the shopkeeper can sell you up to three items per floor.

But sadly, when it comes to the Controller Support the PC version just kills every single bit of fun you might've had.\n\n- Menus are controlled with up/down accepting/declining is done through left/right\n\n- Button inputs and HUD names aren't easy to understand (instead of the actual names, the HUD lists every Item with combos of directional inputs, like \"Left + Right\", making it confusing for both new Players and those who use a Controller. Also there are no proper Xbox Inputs being displayed)\n\n- The menu for Control Mapping also only lists Combos instead of the actual action (who even knows what \"left + down\" even does in-game of the top of their head?) and never displays Xbox Inputs\n\n- The standard Steam Controller Profil used, maps the directional keys to the d-pad and face buttons, instead of making the game actually recognize the Controller\n\n- In order to make the Switch version more interesting, they released a completely original exclusive new Character on there, while also breaking any modding attempts from people to make that Character also work on PC or at least give an option to buy it as DLC or something\n\nTaking all this into account, this game is a hot mess for anyone who dares to use a Controller on PC and, in my opinion, should get the \"Full Controller Support\" Tag entirely removed. And from what I read on Valve's review of this game's Steam Deck compatibility, you can't even use the Multiplayer-mode on the Steam Deck.\nReally disappointed in the Devs for this game...\n\n...Until they announced the new DLC for the game and alongside with it a gigantic new Update (7 Years after it's release)! It added proper Controller support, better mod support and so, so much more! It has never been this fun to play the game and now even on PC! The only thing missing now, is the Switch exclusive Character Reaper, who has one of the most interesting playstyles of any of the Characters, using the Souls of deafeted enemies to damage even more of them!\nNo matter the platform, this game is now a must-own for every rhythm game enjoyer out there!\n\nJust be careful, it's tough as nails ;)", "timestamp_created": 1646916115, "timestamp_updated": 1665546133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523259520530700684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111896397": {"recommendationid": "111896397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053785314", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1646882866}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is everything I wish Guitar Hero was", "timestamp_created": 1646883076, "timestamp_updated": 1646883076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111895596": {"recommendationid": "111895596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137250093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1646903117}, "language": "english", "review": "funky", "timestamp_created": 1646881739, "timestamp_updated": 1646881739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111878077": {"recommendationid": "111878077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065385663", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1651319506}, "language": "english", "review": "I really can't express how i haven't played much but still think its the greatest game of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1646854820, "timestamp_updated": 1646854820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556731820106506348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111868944": {"recommendationid": "111868944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137965192", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1699287161}, "language": "english", "review": "Bow chicka bow wow\n\nThat's what my baby says\n\nMow mow mow\n\nAnd my heart starts pumping\n\nChicka chicka choo wap\n\nNever gonna stop", "timestamp_created": 1646843409, "timestamp_updated": 1647071284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111844972": {"recommendationid": "111844972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431204803", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1686716676}, "language": "english", "review": "it's all fun and games until a red dragon comes outta nowhere and beats your ass", "timestamp_created": 1646804088, "timestamp_updated": 1646804088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111761573": {"recommendationid": "111761573", "author": {"steamid": "76561199093336652", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1646575069}, "language": "english", "review": "The soundtrack is fantastic, but the gameplay is tedious and difficult to follow.I don't really know how to attack or even what I have to do, despite that it has a tutorial.\n\nI wouldn't recommend playing the game, but listening to the soundtrack on YouTube.\n\nEdit: Retrospectively, I was way too harsh on the game.

The base game is already impressive and creative enough, but additional features really elevate this game to a well-polished, fully realized experience. \n\nIt's core gameplay loop of a tempo based dungeon crawler is a great, creative idea, that the developers play with to great extent. Some enemies move on every beat, some every other, dragons will recharge their breath attack every three beats, it's a game of timing that will get more intense as the tempo picks up. There's also a diverse cast of playable characters letting you change up the formula in some creative ways, such as a \"enemies only move when you move\" type character. I was constantly blown away by the creativity in this game, I mean there is a boss where you essentially play rhythmic speed-chess. Absolutely genius.\n\nThe progression system works very similar to games like Enter the Gungeon, where as you earn currency in stages, you can spend said currency to unlock new items to spawn in during your runs, such as improved armor or new weapons. The main lobby lets you practice one on one with specific enemies, bosses, and mini-bosses. There are daily challenges, run modifiers, puzzle modes, it's brimming with content that is already worth it's $15 price tag, but it often goes on sale for as low as $3, a BARGAIN.\n\nOne of the most fun and unexpected features was the addition of custom music. Yes, you can add your own music to each level, and the game will, for the most part, doing a pretty great job matching the tempo, even if tempo changes and time signature changes. You can manually set it if the game doesn't get the tempo exactly right, but I've seen music software do a worse job finding the tempo than this game. What this means is that you can just make this game all high octane death metal music album running at 200 BPM, or a Johnny Cash concert, or an orchestra performance. You can play this game to Mine Diamonds, Eye of the Spider, Take on Me, etc. That alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nI'm pleasantly surprised by how fun and well polished this game is, and I have nothing but high praise for it.

Los graficos no son algo muy especial pero no pediria mucho cuando el gameplay es tan simple pero bastante efectivo. Todos los temas estan muy bien adaptados a la mecanica de ritmo.

Instead, skill is paramount.  All characters, including monsters and yourself, are expected to move with the rhythm meter at the bottom of the screen.  If you can match it, you'll do fine.  If not, you will lose your turn, but the monsters keep going!\n\nThose with musical experience will probably find this game relatively easy.  For others, be prepared for a very hard experience.  This is a high-stakes game where having a good sense of rhythm is just as important as being able to make sound gameplay decisions.  This means that if you do NOT have a good sense of rhythm, the game is impossible (at least, when playing the game the way it was intended to be played).  You do have the option of playing as \"Bard\" if you can't handle the rhythm.\n\nImportantly, the skill needed increases as you progress.  Not only do the monsters get stronger and have more complicated movements, but the song tempos also increase, yielding even LESS time to decide which moves to make.  Those with weak heart conditions, beware!\n\nAll in all, it's definitely a worthwhile experience.  You have trainer resources to help you master monster and boss behavior.  You have many different character selections, which mix up the gameplay significantly.\n\nAnd most importantly, you have the music.  The Bloody Baron himself (D. Baranowsky) worked on the soundtrack, which is a treat to listen to, especially when entering a bazaar with an opera-singing shopkeeper.", "timestamp_created": 1640018412, "timestamp_updated":

stuff. The PC version is weird, as I think this kind of game is much better suited for keyboard, but the default control scheme is really bad, and it's hard to set up well with what they give you, so I stuck to controller for most of it. Other than that though, this game is amazing. The soundtrack is full of back to back bangers, and makes it super easy to trance into the game and follow the rhythm. The gameplay is a lot harder than it looks, since a lot more is going on than you'd typically see in other roguelikes, but the different zones and rate of progression help a lot at easing in new players. The variety of weapons and items make each run feel fresh, and the way everything is designed leads to tons of deaths, but they all end up feeling like my fault, and not the game's. COTN is a massively underrated gem, and if you have any interest in roguelikes, you owe it to yourself to check it out. Even if the gameplay doesn't look good to you, or the games too hard, check out the OST, Danny Baranowsky doesn't miss. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1636833293, "timestamp_updated": 1636833293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476377934217453003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102705721": {"recommendationid": "102705721", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967729016", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1636804963}, "language": "english", "review": "Rythm and me are two different and very distant worlds, so I struggle playing the game, yet it's hilarious so I keep it in my library anyway :)", "timestamp_created": 1636805075, "timestamp_updated": 1636805180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.40119364857673645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102671955": {"recommendationid": "102671955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198904599213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1637247025}, "language": "spanish", "review": "good music", "timestamp_created": 1636752467, "timestamp_updated": 1636752467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102671642": {"recommendationid": "102671642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198854358771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 19457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1390, "last_played": 1696745632}, "language": "english", "review": "singing shopkeeper\n10/10 game", "timestamp_created": 1636752003, "timestamp_updated": 1658692561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102618129": {"recommendationid": "102618129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107050216", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2960, "last_played": 1637286626}, "language": "english", "review": "outstanding game", "timestamp_created": 1636676560, "timestamp_updated": 1636676560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102567433": {"recommendationid": "102567433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979330251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1392, "last_played": 1679844079}, "language": "english", "review": "Great soundtrack and pretty challenging game-play while still fun.

Again, these initial items are strong enough to beat the game with, but are simpler than later unlocks.
