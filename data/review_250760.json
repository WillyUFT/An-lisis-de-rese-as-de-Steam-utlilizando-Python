Pero...el problema llega cuando (en mi caso) el 80% de las veces que muero no son por mi culpa. Claramente veo y pienso en los movimientos que hago y claramente observo como literalmente me muero por ejemplo con: una flecha que estaba debajo de mi, la cual ya habia pasado para que no me mate, movimientos que por alguna razon no funcionaron y por eso termine cayendome al vacio, etc. Lo cual me hizo frustrar demasiado al punto de pensar que soy un ser humano inutil por morir tantas veces como un completo idiota.

In terms of basic building blocks (art, music, setting, level design, gameplay mechanics), Treasure Trove is competent but unexceptional, and feels inferior to its original references like Mega Man or DuckTales. However, what it lacks in pure inspiration, it makes up for in diligence, always giving more varied stuff to do and more well-balanced challenges to beat until you can\u2019t help but be charmed by its dedication and scope.\n\nPlaying the 4 campaigns in the default order, I found them steadily getting better and better. Shovel Knight\u2019s beginning is rather unfriendly, with inertive, cumbersome movement and the ever-frustrating \"get hit midair and fall into a pit due to knockback\" shtick. There\u2019s also a Souls-like money-losing system that looks out of place in a platformer with frequent instadeath hazards. One could chalk it all up to retro design, but this is an unsatisfying kind of challenge; the kind where the main hurdle is game mechanics themselves rather than enemies or spikes. However, once you buy some QoL upgrades (as well as just get accustomed to the controls), most of the above stops being an issue, and the difficulty becomes nicely balanced until the end.\n\nPlague Knight progresses in a similar way, with a moveset that\u2019s very unruly and guarantees you a rough start, but also quite unique and rewarding once you get the hang of it. The narrative from here on continues to focus on the same cast, which I found to be a smart decision, since meeting the same knights under different circumstances helps to shape them into proper characters rather than just Mega Man-style bosses.\n\nThe biggest improvement comes with Specter Knight, as his moves are radically more fluid, tight and convenient, making level traversal a total joy from the start. You also get a more involved, serious story, as well as a very distinctive hub area. On the flip side, the gameplay gets maybe a tad too easy at times, but that\u2019s okay, since by this point it\u2019s clear that the devs never intended to push the players\u2019 limits too much in the first place. Even for the toughest achievements like deathless or speedruns, the game is never outright punishing, and it would rather give you 10 moderately difficult challenges than 5 really hard ones (which sound totally swell in my book).\n\nFinally, King Knight seals the deal with the biggest, most lush campaign full of adventurous spirit and funny character interactions. His controls are also tight and accessible, if less cool-looking than Specter\u2019s, but the real star is not even platforming or combat anymore; it\u2019s a card game, of all things. An in-universe collectible card game called Joustus deserves special praise both for its seamless integration into the story and for being a wonderfully designed minigame, having just enough strategy to keep it casual yet highly engaging.\n\nAs for the oft-criticized fighter/brawler Showdown, it is indeed quite rough around the edges, with most of the difficulty coming from the chaos of randomly chosen conditions. Thankfully, it\u2019s also very cheesable, as every character gets a ranged or safe attack that can be spammed without risking a \"proper\" engagement. Funny enough, this part also became a trove of extra rare achievements (around 0.3-0.4%, which is equal to or lower than anything in Super Meat Boy, or Dustforce, or Dead Cells, or N++, you name it), even though most are just slightly challenging variations of \"do X using Y while Z\", probably because the majority of players never bothered to try them.\n\nOverall (and unlike some adjacent indie superstars such as its brother-in-name Hollow Knight), this might not be a game that sets new standards for the genre, but it\u2019s still a lovingly crafted, content-packed experience. All that\u2019s required is a little bit of patience at the start; after that, it stays fresh and varied all the way up to 100% completion. Oh, and be sure to also play some classic Mega Man entries if you haven\u2019t (my personal favorites are 9 and 5), if only to see for yourself the unity between the \"new old\" and the \"old old\".", "timestamp_created": 1699732576, "timestamp_updated": 1699732576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149955487": {"recommendationid": "149955487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115792817", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1544, "playtime_at_review": 897, "last_played": 1700283840}, "language": "english", "review": "sholver knight good", "timestamp_created": 1699732020, "timestamp_updated": 1699732020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149904993": {"recommendationid": "149904993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275746337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6469, "last_played": 1578319921}, "language": "english", "review": "Shovel Knight is a special game for me.\nI was never that much of a video-game person.

Great game! Everyone knows how great Shovel Knight is. It's a modern game with the DNA of classic NES platformers like \"Duck Tales\" and \"Mega Man.\" It came out, rocked the world, super fun, sticks with you long after you've beaten it.\n\nAnd then they made Plague of Shadows, which took the same Shovel Knight levels and let you explore them with Plague Knight's modular explosions. And then they made Specter of Torment, which you could argue is even better than Shovel of Hope, an incredible Ninja Gaiden-esque tragedy telling the tale of the Enchantress' most loyal servant. And just to completely blow our collective minds, they made King of Cards, which gave us a Wario/Donkey Kong-style platformer AND one of those collectible card games that was all the rage back in the day.

There's so much detail and love put into every single aspect of the game, from the story, to the art, to the soundtrack, to the gameplay itself.  All of the characters, secrets, etc, are crafted with such incredible care and it all comes together to form a wonderful product.  If you're a fan of platformers, retro games, or rpgs, I can guarantee you will be more than satisfied with the game.  It's a wonderful love-letter to the NES-SNES era, and takes very obvious cues from games like Megaman and Castlevania, while making its identity wholly its own as well.  The depth of character and continuity of the storyline is incredible and it's very easy to get attached to the characters and world.\n\nIt may look like I only recently purchased Shovel Knight, but I actually bought the game from Humble Bundle back in 2017, before Specter of Torment was out, and never redeemed my steam key until recently due to losing access to the email I used to purchase the game, using the Humble direct download.  By the time I thought to redeem it, I had actually lost access to the email I originally used alongside the entire computer that the game was stored on, and I only very recently was able to restore the email account and finally redeem my key and finish the game thanks to the help of a friend who I inexplicably assigned the recovery email to.  Going through Shovel of Hope and Plague of Shadows for the first time in years felt just as incredible as it did when I first played them, and finishing up the rest of Specter of Torment, which I never actually completed back in the day, and being able to play King of Cards for the first time ever were amazing experiences, and it's almost like the developers managed to make each campaign a fuller and better thought-out experience than the last, which is an incredible accomplishment as even Shovel of Hope is an incredibly polished experience.  It genuinely feels like I committed theft by purchasing the game back when it was only ten dollars back in the day, because it is WELL worth the full forty dollars, or fifty if you buy the soundtrack (which is excellent, by the way).\n\nAlso, there are actually secret differences between the game depending on which platform you purchase it for.  In the Steam version, as well as the Xbox version, there's a secret fight against the Battletoads from Battletoads, which fits perfectly with the retro aesthetic and inspiration, and in the Playstation versions, in their place, you can face off against Kratos from God of War, and both versions have gear that Shovel Knight can get in the original campaign that go alongside the property of the corresponding version.  The Nintendo versions also have support for the amiibo figures of the characters, which is a fun exclusive for the platform, even if there isn't a special fight.  The game is amazing regardless of the version, but it's worth keeping in mind if you have a preference for the aforementioned characters or features.\n\nThe challenge mode and New Game+ give each campaign lots of replayability, and there are tons of collectibles exclusive to each character to keep you coming back if you're a completionist.  As well, there's a co-op mode that allows you and a friend to tackle the campaigns, and a pvp fighting game-esque mode that allows up to four players who can each choose from characters that you don't get to experience gameplay of in the main four campaigns (alongside the four main characters), which even has a story mode to go alongside it.

The game manages to strike a balance between nostalgic aesthetic and modern sensibilities, harkening back to early games without inheriting their limitations.\n\nShovel Knight is actually a four-in-one deal. In the original campaign, you play as Shovel Knight on a classic adventure fighting enemies and doing tricky platforming using your shovel to bounce around on your enemies heads. The game would be worth it just for this, but there is more:\n\nPlague of Shadows allows you to take control of plague knight, one of Shovel Knight's bosses. While the level layouts are similar to the main campaign, the way you traverse them is totally different. Plague Knight uses explosion alchemical concoctions to send himself flying chaotically around the level. It is difficult to control, but in like a cool fun way. You also are able to customize your bombs with various casings, fuses, and ingredients to create numerous combinations. Really delivers on the promise as playing as Plague Knight.\n\nSpecter of Torment of torment puts the player in the shoes of Specter Knight, who wields a scythe which can be used like a skateboard to grind on rails. It's just as rad as it sounds. Additionally, unlike Plague of Shadows which mirrors the original campaign closely, Specter of Torment features a whole set of bespoke levels designed around Specter Knights unique movement.\n\nFinally, King of Cards puts you in control of the pompous King Knight (or Queen Knight, depending on your settings). King of Cards also features original levels and a unique move set. The gimmick on this one though, is the collectable trading card mini-game. The mini-game features a fairly unique system of pushing cards around a grid.

Game And A Decent Challenge In Each Stage A Fun Boss At the End Of Each Stage While The Move Set Is Diverse After Getting Relics I Do Recommend Trying A Play-through Without The Phase Locket As It Is Easily The Most Broken Item In The Game.\n\nIn Plague Of Shadows You Get A Similar Experience But With A Harder Move-Set I Personally struggled With The Controls But It Was Still Great My Only Other

since this indie darling first wowed the world, and now Shovel Knight has graced almost every platform. In the bundle, you of course have the now classic Shovel Knight, now with the added subtitle \u201cShovel of Hope\u201d. It combines the pogo attacks from Duck Tales with the level design conventions found in classic Mega Man, all presented with a retro aesthetic. Yet despite the intentionally dated look, there was a lot of love and care that went into making those pixels stand out.\n\nFrom the Introduction stage, to each of the Order of No Quarter levels, and up until the final confrontation with the Enchantress, Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope is a fantastically designed platforming experience with bags of character. Every level has a new obstacle to overcome, fully utilising Shovel Knight\u2019s abilities.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a selection of levels present, as there are lots of things to discover \u2013 towns, shops, mini-games, extra bosses, and even whole levels. It\u2019s a shovel full of classic gaming goodness that anyone who likes platformers ought to give a try.\n\nIt\u2019s all accompanied by a stellar soundtrack by Jake Kaufman (who has worked on WayForward\u2019s Shantae franchise among other games). One of the few gaming soundtracks to have endured in the consciousness of gamers in recent memory, it still holds up well in 2017, three years after its initial release. It\u2019s catchy enough to emulate the classics of the 8-bit era and blend in well with the game.\n\nYacht Club Games have even added a few things to Treasure Trove. Firstly, there is now a Body Swap mode, inspired by an episode of Adventure Time and the concept behind Ms. Pacman. You can now select the gender of all the main characters, ranging from Shovel Knight, the Order of No Quarter, and even the final boss. It\u2019s a very inclusive addition that\u2019s as customisable as you\u2019d want it to be and the new sprites are well designed.\n\nCooperative mode is now available for all non-handheld platforms, no longer requiring the Shovel Knight amiibo for Wii U. While the levelling up mechanic is still amiibo exclusive for the time being, Yacht Club Games have included the Shovel Knight Fairy to accompany your character across three games. It doesn\u2019t actually do anything major, but it at least highlights any treasure you might have missed.\n\nAs a fan of the initial game, I was pretty excited to see that the support for the game would continue with meaningful content; with all campaigns included in the Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove being made available separately as well. There are three campaigns available for the collection thus far, with a fourth one featuring King Knight as a playable character on the horizon and a 4-player Battle Mode still to come this year.\n\nPlague of Shadows is Plague Knight\u2019s DLC, sporting a new character with an explosive move-set. Differences in level design to accompany his abilities better keep the game fresh. Plague Knight is somewhat difficult to control, but has an array of potions to be created, such as one to temporarily increase his life bar. As a side-story, it\u2019s a welcome addition, even if Plague Knight\u2019s abilities take some getting used to.\n\nThe marquee mode in Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is the brand new prequel campaign: \u201cSpecter of Torment\u201d. Unlike Plague of Shadows, Specter of Torment feels like its own game with heavily redesigned levels, new enemies, new boss battle variants, and even a meaningful backstory showing how Specter Knight came into the service of The Enchantress. Jake Kaufman has even remixed the entire soundtrack to keep the game feeling like a new experience. In short, it\u2019s wonderful.\n\nSpecter Knight controls wonderfully, though his aerial dash slash might take some getting used to. However, by finding red skulls in levels and trading them in at the fortress, Specter Knight can gain access to some really powerful sub-weapons, including the ability to heal. He can also channel his inner skateboarder by using his scythe to grind on rails.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n  [*]Stuffed full with three great campaigns\n  [*]Masterful soundtracks from Jake Kaufman\n  [*]Spectre Knight\u2019s campaign feels like a true prequel\n  [*]Cooperative mode now available for all without needing an amiibo\n[/list]\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n  [*]Plague Knight has a steep learning curve\n  [*]Having to wait for King Knight\u2019s campaign\n  [*]Retro aesthetic may put off some people\n[/list]\nWhile the original game was a fabulous romp, the Treasure Trove collection is more than worthy of investing some time into. Anyone who already has the original will obtain the upgraded package for free, but if bought separately, each of the three released campaigns should keep you entertained with great platforming that\u2019s full of charm. With more stuff coming in the next year, the Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is worth its weight in gold.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800", "timestamp_created":

I, King Knight, ruler of Pridemoor Keep and valiant knight of the Shovel Knight realm, am here to regale you with my resplendent review of the legendary game, Shovel Knight.\n\nFrom the moment I took up my royal scepter and embarked on this grand pixelated quest, I was enraptured by the magnificence that is Shovel Knight. This enchanting game, developed by Yacht Club Games, seamlessly combines the best elements of classic 8-bit platformers with a modern twist, crafting a masterpiece that truly stands the test of time.\n\nFirst and foremost, let us speak of the gameplay. As I, King Knight, leaped, dashed, and gracefully descended upon my foes with my kingly staff, I felt a rush of exhilaration like no other. The controls are impeccably precise, allowing for both seasoned adventurers and newcomers to seamlessly master the art of shovel-wielding combat. Each stage is meticulously designed, presenting unique challenges and introducing a colorful cast of adversaries that will put your mettle to the test.\n\nThe level of craftsmanship poured into every aspect of Shovel Knight is astounding. The art style is a glorious homage to the bygone era of 8-bit gaming, capturing the nostalgia of retro platformers while incorporating modern flair. The attention to detail in each pixel, each animated sprite, and each stunning backdrop is a testament to the dedication of the developers. The soundtrack, composed by Jake Kaufman, is a symphony of chiptune melodies that evoke a sense of adventure and heroism, making each step of the journey even more enthralling.\n\nSpeaking of the journey, the narrative of Shovel Knight is a tale woven with charm, wit, and a dash of royal panache. As players traverse the diverse lands, encountering valiant knights, eccentric townsfolk, and even treacherous bosses, they will be captivated by the heartwarming story that unfolds. The character development is remarkable, and even I, King Knight, found myself invested in the triumphs and tribulations of my fellow knights.\n\nBut what truly sets Shovel Knight apart from its contemporaries is its commitment to providing a wealth of content. From the original Shovel Knight campaign, aptly named \"Shovel of Hope,\" to the subsequent expansions like \"Plague of Shadows,\" \"Specter of Torment,\" and \"King of Cards,\" each adding a unique perspective to the overall story, players are granted hours upon hours of regal enjoyment. And let us not forget the challenge-filled gauntlet that is \"Shovel Knight Showdown,\" a competitive multiplayer mode that allows knights to test their skills against one another.\n\nIn conclusion, my loyal subjects, Shovel Knight is a game fit for kings and queens alike. Its splendid gameplay, meticulously crafted visuals, enchanting soundtrack, and captivating story make it an unforgettable adventure that will stand the test of time. Whether you are a seasoned knight or a newcomer to the realm of gaming, I wholeheartedly recommend embarking on this legendary quest.

Aparte es como el \u00e1pice del chiptune corte desde temas re punchi hasta fucking m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica acad\u00e9mica craneada a la perfecci\u00f3n, el tipo no falla una. Me quedan pendientes jugar al Shovel Knight Dig y Pocket Dungeon pero el soundtrack de esos tambi\u00e9n es incre\u00edble.\n\nDespu\u00e9s tenes el juego que bueno, tambi\u00e9n, plataformero de 5 estrellas. Todas las mec\u00e1nicas e items son divertidos y tiene la flexibilidad de que podes ir eligiendo los bosses que vas peleando (medio como el megaman obvio). Podes pasarte el juego comprando todo o podes ir con la pichulita al aire y cagar a palazos literalmente a todos (tambi\u00e9n como el megaman, ir full limonero). Otra desici\u00f3n de dise\u00f1o que es god es el hecho de poder romper los checkpoints para ganar guita y la gilada esa de que si te moris podes recuperar la plata pero tenes que volverte a meter en ese lio de cuanto de moriste.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente otro win, los stages son hermosos y el spirtework tambi\u00e9n, desde los bosses y enemigos hasta los npcs de las aldeas. Hablando de estos NPC's, el juego tiene un humor bastante boludo (con muchos juegos de palabras) pero que banco a full. Boludeces como el hecho de que seas un palad\u00edn (pala-din) y los mil y un chistes pelotudos del sapo croador ese (que encima te da el logro de sapiencia) hacen que te cagues de risa cada tanto. [Incre\u00edblemente con el idioma en espa\u00f1ol los chistes pegan, no se si los habr\u00e1n reescrito o si justo se traduc\u00edan bien tambi\u00e9n, un d\u00eda tengo que jugarlo en ingles y ver que onda].\n\nLa historia est\u00e1, tampoco es la gran cosa pero bueno es un plataformero que carajo queres. Igual es bonita y en los dlc's te cuentan un poco de lore de un par de jefes.\n\nSobre los DLC la verdad es que son muy buenos todos, te permiten jugar como 3 de los bosses de la orden sin cuartel lo cual esta buenisimo, el peak es Specter of Torment (el soundtrack en este se va al carajo mal y aparte la mecanica es re divertida) pero cada uno tiene su cosa piola. Para empezar si tenias el juego base desde el principio (antes que salga el Treasure Trove y Specter of Torment salga standalone) te regalaban los DLC, golazo mal. De todas formas pagar\u00eda sin problemas ya que todos te cambian completamente la forma de jugar y te meten mas lore y boludeces (algunos hasta tienen modos de juegos extra como el King of Cards que trae un juego de cartas llamado Joustus que esta bastante entretenido).\n\nComo extra el juego tiene muchas boludeces para toquetear y cambiar que estan buenas corte poner cheats dependiendo el nombre que te pongas en el savegame que hacen varios efectos (cambiarte el color, darte guita, god mode y hasta un modo culo que te remplaza palabras como pala, shovel o knight por culo) o una opcion de body swap para elegir y cambiar el genero de cada uno de los PJ del juego (y hacer realidad tus fantas\u00edas lesbicas o gays entre shovel y shield knight).\n\nEn fin, de los indies creo que es el mejor y de los juegos en general seria el mejor tambi\u00e9n si no fuese porque existe el Tony Hawks 4.\n\nNo se cuanto vale en tu region pero compralo igual es un juegazo vale la pena al 100%",

among other greats of that era.\n\nThe gameplay is overall very solid, the Mario-like map is a beautiful nod, there are enough variety and gimmicks througout the different stages, some are heavier on platforming, some are more focused on battle, enemy variety is good, hidden chambers everywhere, gold and collectables you can use in a Castlevania 2 -kind of town to upgrade your health and magic among others, boss fights that evoke that Megaman feeling...I loved the fact that certain stages or battles get much more manageable with certain upgrades (called Relics, or other names depending on the campaign) which gives you room to experiment and try to break certain hurdles the game throws at you.\n\nShovel Knight is brimming with content as well, offering 4 different campaigns, each of them taking abut 6-8 hours to complete.\n\nSo far I have beaten the first two (Shovel Knight and Plague Knight) and I sure plan to get back to play the other ones.\n\nSolid higher 8 low 9/10 game, and

The shovel knight series are some the best platforming games ever made. It is very simple but leaves a lot of room for experimentation and execution. Movement feels great, the story is limited but charming and unique, and the music and level design are top notch.\n\nI can't be positive enough about this series. That being said there are some negatives here. The original game can be a bit simple and can take a bit of getting used to because the method of combat is pretty different from a lot of games. Plague of shadows has very awkward controls and is for the most part the same as the original game with the main difference being a different playable character. And the card game mini game in king of cards can take away from the main game.\n\nThat being said those are mainly nitpicks from me. If you look at the entire package here this game is absolutely worth it even at its base asking point. The base game is dry but still a great high quality platformer with little filler, plague of shadows isn't my cup of tea but its a nice extra, Spectre of torment is one of the most fun games I have ever played with extremely fluid movement, and king of cards offers some of the most chaotic and fun platforming out there making you look at shovel knights mechanics in a completely new way. The fighting game/brawler is something I didn't experience and I don't care about too much but its also a nice extra on top of the 3 platformers I do like.\n\nEspecially Spectre of torment and King of cards are honestly worth the price of admission. These campaigns are way different from the original game, they have new playable characters and new levels. In these campaigns are some extremely creative and fun levels and power ups. Even just the base movement in those campaigns is something radically different and extremely fluid and fun.\n\nI highly recommend this game and if you dislike one campaign try another just to see what those are like.

It's unfortunate that it never quite reaches the same quality as its predecessors. The level design is, to put it short, uninspired and boring. Something felt off with controlling the Knight but I can't really put my finger to it, just something that I noticed when the game expects absolute precision in movement. The music is chirpy-chiptune but none of the beats truly make your foot tap. Pixel art is gorgeous at some scenes and lackluster in others, like in the level backgrounds. \n\nOne of my biggest gripes was the \"humor\" of the game. SK doesn't seem to know if it's trying to be funny or serious. Some lines are so close being funny that they left a strange taste in my mouth. It's pretty hard to describe but the overall atmosphere is just... stale. \n\nThe whole experience is riddled by the feeling of mediocrity and at two hours time I didn't feel any incentive to keep going, I just wasn't having fun. It feels like that better version of this game has been seen before. Maybe it's a semi-decent game if you don't have prior knowledge of platformers of yore, maybe. \n\nThe review could've tipped both ways but ultimately I feel that the experience is not solid enough.

This game somehow far exceeded the ludicrous-sounding goals set by its Kickstarter campaign, and it is genuinely insane, the amount of dedication put into the whole project by the entire team throughout the years. As someone who has followed the game since before its launch, I seriously keep finding brand new details and secrets watching my boyfriend play through it all again, it's magical!

All the other games are re-skins of the actual shovel knight, plague knight takes it way to far by quite literally copying and pasting the exact same shit from shovel knight.Which means instead of looking back on the game and going alright this sucked this was annoying lets get rid of it and replace it with something better 0 fucks were giving. Like when you die to a guy who knocked you of a ledge you had killed previously because you died because your pinky toe was over a spike. In king of cards they remove bosses in favour of becoming yu gi oh. The levels are now much shorter, the card game felt like they put twice as much effort into compared to plague knight, which isn't a compliment. In plague knight there a cool mechanics, which I feel would be much funner if the devs stopped caring about lore and actually focused on gameplay. A lot of the sections in plague knight you can really tell that this was designed for shovel knight instead of feeling like it's own stand alone game. Really shovel of hope and spectar knight are the only enjoyable one's in this collection. Even then the only reason I haven't talked about spectar knight is because I bought it as a stand alone game and haven't touched it in six months. Even in that game though I remember a lot of stupid shit happening that would get under my skin. A promising game just please get better level designers then this we will be enjoyable experience for anyone. Ps please make actual levels for plague knight.", "timestamp_created": 1673901832, "timestamp_updated": 1673901832, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.378787875175476074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130990965": {"recommendationid": "130990965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333810056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 702, "last_played": 1663789976}, "language": "english", "review": "I keep replaying the first mission", "timestamp_created": 1673900337, "timestamp_updated": 1673900337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130945144": {"recommendationid": "130945144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160294867", "num_games_owned": 539, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1681966587}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Quien lo diria, agarrar la pala no estaba tan mal.", "timestamp_created": 1673836089, "timestamp_updated": 1673836089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130937144": {"recommendationid": "130937144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025447541", "num_games_owned": 857, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1948, "last_played": 1673910612}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1673823920, "timestamp_updated": 1673823920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130936528": {"recommendationid": "130936528", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123980781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 729, "last_played": 1698975018}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't even know where to start... this is just quite wonderfully one of my favorite games-- lovable characters, fun levels, fun gamemodes, beating up my one friend, and the personality! it's wonderful, hands down.", "timestamp_created": 1673823091, "timestamp_updated": 1673823091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130882808": {"recommendationid": "130882808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037685932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2628, "last_played": 1676238892}, "language": "english", "review": "A fabulous game all around.

It's really damn good.  Great controls, great level design, great boss battles, great music...honestly it's got it all.  The game is really well done.  It even has a fairly interesting story even though it doesn't need one for the style of game it was going for.   Now, that's not to say it doesn't have its flaws, but they're really few and far in between.  My biggest gripes in this game are that some of the pits seem like you'll land in them unless you've played the game before.  There is definitely some BS parts, especially on the final boss where there are pits you can get knocked back into.  Still, overall the game is great.\n\n\nThis review is mostly for the original Shovel Knight game Shovel of Hope, since I haven't really done much of the DLC.  I'm not the biggest fan of Plague Knight's DLC so far, as he doesn't feel particularly good to control, but we'll see how things go.  I've managed to unlock every achievement in the base game...and I have to say that the game can begin to lose some of it's charm as you do the more challenging achievements, but that's par for the course if you're trying to complete something.\n\n\nTips: So this'll be very slight spoilers, but I thought I'd offer some tips for those playing the game for the first time.  Firstly, the shovel pogo Shovel Knight can do, does NOT require you to hold down.  Tapping down once will start the animation and you won't leave this pogo form until you hit solid ground or you attack in midair.  It's important to understand that you don't need to hold down.  When I first started playing I was holding down because I thought I needed to hold down, and it made bouncing around more difficult to control.  You simply tap down once and then move however you need.\n\n\nAs far as doing upgrades, you'll eventually have more than enough money to get everything, but if you're wondering what to purchase first you should definitely concentrate on meal tickets to get health upgrades.  More health makes the levels much easier.  Magic is helpful too, but health is the priority.  When you can upgrade your shovel or armor, I'd grab the silver armor first.  It has a neat function where it gives you a charge slash after you pogo twice in a row.  Since charge slashes are double damage this means you can kill things quicker.  The only shovel upgrade you should prioritize is the charge slash itself, although I'd get it after the silver armor personally.  As for relics I think you should grab the phase locket as soon as you can.  Invincibility is a powerful effect and definitely helps with harder sections of the game and in boss fights.  Buying the 2 chalices in the first town's basement should also be a priority as you can fill them for free with health potions that'll give you more life to survive especially in boss fights.", "timestamp_created": 1671928361, "timestamp_updated": 1671928361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129202958": {"recommendationid": "129202958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891830132", "num_games_owned": 997, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1672128191}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udfe2[b] Plug and Play [/b]\n\nTested on: OnexPlayer Mini Pro 6800U\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42772030-Handheld-Friendly/] Follow Handheld Friendly [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1671918145, "timestamp_updated": 1671918145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587620973587036133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129180276": {"recommendationid": "129180276", "author": {"steamid": "76561199150258589", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2023, "last_played": 1691278512}, "language": "spanish", "review": "caballero+pala= perfeccion", "timestamp_created": 1671895410, "timestamp_updated": 1671895410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129174942": {"recommendationid": "129174942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135889127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3334, "last_played": 1689019243}, "language": "spanish", "review": "-", "timestamp_created": 1671890586, "timestamp_updated": 1671890586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129136919": {"recommendationid": "129136919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165723447", "num_games_owned": 1309, "num_reviews": 145, "playtime_forever": 1742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1742, "last_played": 1671845885}, "language": "english", "review": "I had fun for like 40% of the time\nShovel of Hope Rules\nSpecter of Torment is a little gimmicy but mostly fun\nKing of Cards ruins the level design und adds a horrible card game\nPlague of Shadows is also one of the expansions", "timestamp_created": 1671845990, "timestamp_updated": 1671845990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.37216484546661377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129110145": {"recommendationid": "129110145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081475634", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1674162945}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El caballero de la pala va a ser lo mejor que te pase en la vida.

This is a masterfully crafted retro platformer that does everything right, providing essentially four games in one, with each campaign having its own character with unique movement and combat mechanics, collectibles, and hub areas. The only real criticism I could level at it is that the Plague Knight campaign reuses the levels from the original game, but even that feels like nitpicking when taken in the context of the full package. Besides, I still thoroughly enjoyed blasting my way through those levels with Plague Knight. Shovel Knight has fully earned its place in the indie canon, and you won't go wrong purchasing it.\n\nThere is one thing I feel I need to express - even compared to the high standards set by the previous campaigns, I was thoroughly impressed by King of Cards, the final campaign. It really goes to show how much the developers honed their craft by working on the same game for so long.

Having completed all of them, I'd like to share my in-depth thoughts for each campaign and help you find out which of them might be best for you and if you should pick up this game.\n\n[b] Shovel of Hope : [/b]\nIn this campaign we play as a titular hero - Shovel Knight. This is probably the first campaign people start when they pick up the game and what can I say? I really enjoyed it.\n\nShovel Knight's moveset is easy to grasp and feels polished. His simple moveset is complemented by relics, which give players a lot of unique abilities and make the character skillset feel complete. Combat and platforming experience feels good, but I think the combat is a bit better. Shovel Knight also has some of the coolest boss-fights I've got to play, really well-designed and challenging in a fair way. \n\nThe ost's are catchy and I really like the retro-colored pixel art-style. Story - it is quite simple, but in a good way and I think it fits game's general lighthearted aesthetic\n\nThe only critique I really have is that while difficulty is fair \nthroughout, there is one thing that feels simply unfair. Upon death Shovel Knight drops bags of gold that he can retrieve, but sometimes they can get stuck somewhere simply unreachable, which can get really frustrating. I recommend spending your gold on items before accessing certain levels so that you won't lose your time. This applies to all the campaigns.\n\n\n[b]  Plague of Shadows : [/b] \nThis one was a tough start for me, but after some time I think it's pretty good. Level-wise it is unfortunately the least unique campaign since you mostly play throughout the same levels as Shovel Knight that are slightly modified to fit the Plague Knight's playstyle.\n\nSpeaking of his playstyle - Plague Knight starts difficult to grasp. His platforming can be hard and frustrating, but it simply takes some time to master it. Contrary to level-design, his combat skillset might be one of the most unique and advanced in the entire game. Plague Knight can create different type of bombs using variety of casings, powders and fuses that  you can obtain. You can create a lot of cool bomb combinations and it is fun to try finding the best solutions for different situations. If you value freedom in your playstyle or you simply crave chaos, then I definitely recommend this campaign for you.\n\nPlague Knight's combat and healing capabilities make most boss fights a breeze. Unlike combat, you won't find as much ease in Plague Knight's platforming - it is really a mixed bag in my opinion,  had some of the most frustrating moments in the game, but once you master it, it's manageable, but still I wouldn't call it fun.\n\nI really enjoyed this campaign's story and I think it's sweet. Basically you're seeing the same world from a new perspective and embark on your own quest as Plague Knight. There's also a really cool, unique hub area.\n\n[b] Specter of Torment : [/b] \nIt is the shortest campaign in the game, but also one of my favorites. Specter of Torment is a must-play for those looking for platforming-focused gameplay. It has some of the most fun and dynamic platforming in the entire game!\n\nSpecter Knight's combat also feels really good, it's satisfying and effective. Similarly to Shovel Knight, Specter Knight's moveset is complemented by curios (his version of relics). His curios are a great addition and I like how the game gives you a little area to test them out after purchasing them.\n\nUnlike Plague of Shadows - Specter of Torment stages are noticably different from their original iterations and some are completely new, which feels really refreshing. Additionally stages have new enemies and some of the bosses have new attacks unique to this campaign! Stages also have remixed version of original music tracks. \n+ Specter Knight's hub world is amazing!\n\nI absolutely enjoyed this campaign story - it's interesting and really tragic. Specter Knight is probably one of the most engrossing characters in the game.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this campaign, it is the most polished and fun.\n\n[b]  King of Cards :[/b] \nThis one was also a tough start for me, but oh boy did it change. By the end of my playthrough it became one of my favorite campaigns!\n\nKing Knight is the most unique and also the funniest campaign in the game. His gameplay consists of two parts normal stages and card game called Joustus. At first I was really skeptical about both of them, but it just took me some time to warm up to them.\n\nLet's start with his platforming. I'll be honest - at first it felt really rough and I hated it, but after finishing the game I think I can say that he has the second best platforming moveset and some of the best platforming sections in the entire game! His platforming moveset is really simple, but it works extremely well and is really fun (especially in mid- and end-game).\n\nHis combat is also simple, but yet again works really well. Just like the previous campaigns, his skillset is complemented by heirlooms (King Knight's equivalent of relics) and I've got to admit - heirlooms are one of the best and funniest ability items. King of Cards also has few new, unique boss-fights, some of which\nbeing the most fast-paced and difficult in the entire game.\n\nThe second half of King of Cards gameplay consists of the card game Joustus, in which you have to claim more gems than your opponent by pushing your cards onto the gems. Each card has arrows which indicate the direction they can push other cards and some have unique abilities. At first it felt really mediocre to me, but once I grasped the mechanics it \njust kept on getting better. Strategizing, finding the best possible play, predicting your opponent's moves was all really satisfying and fun to me. But I have to admit that some of these card were really difficult and undeniably frustrating at times. Still, I think winning some of them even after 10 tries was worth the struggle.\n\nDesign-wise King of Cards has the most unique levels and some are completely new, previously unexplored parts/locations in the world of Shovel Knight. One thing some might find negative is that his levels were all relatively short, I personally also disliked that at first, but I quickly changed my mind - I think short length stages fit King Knight play-style \nbetter and considering that his campaign has an entirely fleshed-out \ncard-game, it only seems fair that the stages are shorter.\n\nOkay now let me tell you about the best part of this game - King Knight himself! This guy is the most charming and entertaining fellow in this entire game, his story was such a spectatle to follow. Some of the cutscenes and character interactions made me laugh multiple times. \nTo sum it up King of Cards story has a lot of personality and is sure to keep you engaged.\n\nOverall I recommend this campaign if you're looking for an unique challenge and difficult, \nbut fun platforming stages.\n\n\n[b] Showdown : [/b] \nThis multiplayer mode is really chaotic and fun. It doesn't have an online co-op, but you can still play it together with friends via Steam Remote Play and the experience is still really good if you have good internet connection and if not, playing against CPU is still a lot of fun! \nThere's also a story mode and other modes that you can play.", "timestamp_created": 1671482615, "timestamp_updated": 1671875573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820271015167236328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128843319": {"recommendationid": "128843319", "author": {"steamid": "76561199273921286", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 42361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19616, "last_played": 1694359272}, "language": "english", "review": "joustus > cringe skylanders game\nif you disagree you are a supporter of the confederacy", "timestamp_created": 1671443021, "timestamp_updated": 1671443021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490511804819107056", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128833759": {"recommendationid": "128833759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118906784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1456774008}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing, just buy it", "timestamp_created": 1671424798, "timestamp_updated": 1671424798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484378546476364136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128820951": {"recommendationid": "128820951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052277466", "num_games_owned": 2826, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1920, "last_played": 1622227019}, "language": "english", "review": "Ducktales 3.", "timestamp_created": 1671404380, "timestamp_updated": 1671404380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484378546476364136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128762275": {"recommendationid": "128762275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834873874", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 720, "last_played": 1669726104}, "language": "english", "review": "very frustrating slow and boring piece of game \n  \na true code waste", "timestamp_created": 1671324766, "timestamp_updated": 1671324766, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.328206866979598999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128757981": {"recommendationid": "128757981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110529428", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 3399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1575, "last_played": 1690799882}, "language": "english", "review": "shovel knight reaches its peak early on and never falls off of it", "timestamp_created": 1671318881, "timestamp_updated": 1690717654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493537873029708862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128669494": {"recommendationid": "128669494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052774133", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1672155982}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun platformer that brings me back to classic Nintendo games!

"playtime_at_review": 460, "last_played": 1670435350}, "language": "english", "review": "This is only a review of Shovel of Hope and Showdown games in from this pack, since I haven't played others yet.\n\nShovel of Hope is the main game of the Shovel Knight series. It's about 8 hours of pure 2D NES-talgia style platforming. And I'm not sure how much I like it. Nowadays you can get tons of high quality metroidvanias(this is not one) and platform games with both pixel-art and non-pixel art. Not to mention there are collections of real classic NES platform games, like Mega Man Legacy collection, which costs half of this and often goes to discount to fraction of this game.\n\nIf you're on edge about Shovel Knight I suggest getting the standalone version of Shovel of Hope - it's much cheaper. But if you end up loving it you will have to buy it at piece-meal prices and you'll pay more overall. Too bad they don't provide discount on Treasure Trove if you own some of the games.\n\nNow, how was Treasure Trove? It was OK. It was obviously a kickstarter game. You run into stuff that looks and feels like a stretch goal. There's a level with faces of biggest money spenders, there's few bosses that come out of nowhere and probably were added as a bonus. The game ends up having a lot of stuff in it, but it's kinda disjointed. The difficulty curve is all off, the first stages are the hardest, then middle game is a snooze-fest, then end-game is stress-filled joy-killing irritating machine of 1-block wide jumps in total darkness with knock-back monsters flying around. It's never really that hard, but it does get frustrating at moments.\n\nI didn't like how Shovel Knight plays too much. Attacking anyone with Shovel gives YOU so much knock-back you can easily knock yourself off the platform you're standing on. That makes fights where you can't jump real pain, slow, and just boring. There's an armor that lowers this knock back, but even then it's not really fun. \n\nYou can jump at enemies pogo-style, like in Ducktales, but most of the monsters are designed in a way to make sure you'll almost never combo multiple hits. They'll quickly dodge second hit too far for you to reach, or block their head etc. I would be fine with just some monsters doing that, or monsters later on, but I found myself almost never really being able to just have some fun, even in early stages, when revisiting them. \n\nYou also have some magic items you'll collect along the way. They are fun, and useful... Not as useful as alternate weapons in Mega Man 11, but useful enough. The issue is, they made sure you won't have fun unlocking them. When you find a chest with magic item you get a price on it, and you have to pay. If you can't pay for it on the spot you will be able to later find it in town... at increased price. It happened to me only once, I was few coins away, but it was very frustrating.\n\nThis game has souls-like system, where you have infinite lives, but you lose some of your gold when you die. The gold can be then recovered if you reach the same spot. In theory that is. In my experience this almost never works as intended. The balloons with gold fly off randomly, and often end up in places where you won't be able to jump without dying... or just unreachable even with best tricks. There's one item that can suck treasures towards you, but it takes the same slot as potent healing potion, so it's hard to carry around. Often you'll die by falling into a hole in the most dangerous part of the map, and the cash will be floating where you died - with no hope of retrieval. Even though money doesn't matter that much in this game and you can easily farm it it's really irritating to see your cash permanently lost in a system where in theory you should be able to get it back. That's just one additional small thing to be frustrated with.\n\nThere are also some stages that will make everything black, so you have to move in the darkness. And I don't know what they did with this effect, but whenever it was on screen it made me nauseous and I could barely play. I had to pause the game every few minutes in order not to puke. Similar to playing a VR game, but without VR. I don't think I'm photosensitive, no other 2D game ever had this kind of effect on me in my 30 years of gaming.\n\nOr they add fast travel at some point... But it's slower than actually using the map, so I don't see what's the point.\n\nAt some points random(?) 4 bosses will appear on the map. I don't know if the order is preset, but the first one I got was the hardest of them all by far. All other 3 were pushovers I defeated on first go. This game has other bad decisions. It has MM style boss rush near the end... but if MM can be excused by tradition... in this game boss rush really adds nothing and just wastes your time. Unless you're doing some kind of challenge run I guess...\n\nWell, I can see this is a fine game, and for some players it might be awesome. There are a lot of funny NPCs in town, there's tons of bosses to defeat, many stages can be repeated as bonus stages to gather cash. You have armors and skills to collect. Overall it's not bad, but it took me some breaks before I forced myself to finish. Where for example MM11 I got trough in one sitting and couldn't put my controller away.\n\nThere's just something in this game play that doesn't mesh well with me. As I mentioned - start with Shovel of Hope standalone. I really wish I did, I would have saved money. I thought I would love the series, due to all the acclaim it has.\n\nI also tried Showdown mode, which is full-fledged Smash-bros-like fighter. With story modes for all fighters, different fight conditions and so on. It's much more robust than I've expected, and I had fun with it. It's very good, and I would actually rate it higher than the main game. You can select multiple colors AND genders for each character (you can actually change genders of all characters even in Shovel of Hope). The thing is though... I have better fighting games that I will always run over this mode when I play with friends. \n\nThere are 3 other story games in this. One contains the same levels, but different character. The two others are completely original. I think one of them is kind of card game? I haven't tried them, so I can't comment on it yet. This makes for a good amount of games in one pack, but Disney Afternoon Collection also contains many good games, and can be much cheaper. There are many other 2D platform games on Steam that, both oldies and indies, that could be better for you. Shantae is great. Gunvolt series. Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth. Momodora series. And many, many others to choose from.", "timestamp_created": 1670607398, "timestamp_updated": 1670607398, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465798050165176392", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128216979": {"recommendationid": "128216979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287694340", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 861, "last_played": 1700474941}, "language": "english", "review": "good game great character please do get if you like jumping around", "timestamp_created": 1670582551, "timestamp_updated": 1670582551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128192360": {"recommendationid": "128192360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007088230", "num_games_owned": 986, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1405, "last_played": 1612155081}, "language": "english", "review": "Shovel Knight is a fun retro throwback that has a lot in common with Ducktales while carrying the soul of Megaman and Castlevania.

instantly).\n\nI think that the developers wanted to make a \"difficult retro platformer\" but in the end most of the end-game levels were unbearable.\nThe last 2 stages seemed like a parody of the game - every wall full of spikes, holes everywhere, enemies that are there just and only to be frustrating.\n\nThe first 2 hours were very enjoyable and I loved going through the different stages, meeting NPCs and progressing the story.\nBut around the half-way mark, the \"difficulty\" suddenly spiked - every screen has to have at least 3 instant-death mechanics.\nFrom that point forward, at the end of each level, more than anything else, I felt more relieved that I don't have to play through that again.\n\nThe art direction is great - the graphics and the music hit the exact spot that they were aiming for.\nThe story and dialogue is also very good and the character design fits the world.\nEven the boss designs and mechanics were interesting and not frustrating - they were what I would call actually difficult, instead of instant-death \"difficult\".\nIf only the game had 1/10th of the spikes and holes everywhere.\n\nAfter finishing the campaign, I'm glad that I don't have to

Here we are, 8 years later, I finally got to play the legendary indie title. I played through all four campaigns on the Steam Deck, mostly while on the road. Shovel drop, bomb burst, dash slash, and shoulder bash your way through the 4 \"Treasure Trove\" campaigns. Get knocked-back into bottomless pits or nipped by spikes and die many many times. The gameplay can be hard, but it's a rewarding experience.\n\n[b]Shovel of Hope[/b] - The game that started it all. I found Shovel Knight's campaign to be fantastic and the most challenging, but it's definitely the one that should be played first. The reason for this is that Shovel Knight himself is far more limited in traversal capabilities when compared to the other campaign protagonists. You can really only walk, jump, and shovel drop, which while fun to figure out, leaves little room for error. Story wise, Shovel Knight is rather independent outside of a few story beats near the beginning and end of the game, but it makes sense given what the ultimate goal is.\n\n[b]Plague of Shadows[/b] - Plague Knight is lots of fun to control. Go through nearly the same exact levels as Shovel Knight in an alternate storyline that runs parallel to Shovel of Hope. Watch as Plague Knight effortlessly launches across gaps that would have required precise shovel drop combos in the first campaign. The combat is spammy, the mobility is uncanny, and the story is somewhat hammy. More NPCs get to shine in this one. Really enjoyed Plague of Shadows, very forgiving relative to Shovel of Hope.\n\n[b]Specter of Torment[/b] - The first expansion with entirely new levels. Specter Knight's story is basically the tragic tale of his sorry state. The [i]cool factor[/i] here is dialed up to 11 as you combo midair dash-slashes and rail grinding. There are also flashback missions in which you get to play as his former self, which I thought was cool too. The character is unapologetically edgy despite being surrounded by allies and friends, but he's an unwilling, semi-dead servant to a corrupt dictator, so it checks out.\n\n[b]King of Cards[/b] - I don't know if it was the shoulder bashing and spin jumping, the shorter stages in place of full levels, the (almost) endearing story, or the newly introduced card game, but I enjoyed King Knight's campaign most of all. Joustus is the SK universe's equivalent to Gwent, in that it's a unique card game that everyone plays all of a sudden. While kind of tough to get into and used to, Joustus becomes quite fun when you get a deck that can win consistently. Play as the smartest dumbest narcissist in the world as he amasses an airship's worth of friends and rivals. Challenge hardened warriors to games of cards and challenge card-playing kings to fist fights.\n\nShovel Knight: Treasure Trove provides immense value and I regret not buying it much sooner. (I have not yet played the battle mode, \"Showdown\", but it's looking like more of a multiplayer thing.) For better, and [i]sometimes[/i] worse, it's an unrelenting homage to the NES/SNES days; when gaming was the furthest thing from creatively bankrupt.", "timestamp_created": 1668403294, "timestamp_updated": 1668403294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125445864": {"recommendationid": "125445864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081246115", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1052, "last_played": 1697326347}, "language": "english", "review": "sgovel nknigt", "timestamp_created": 1668396098, "timestamp_updated": 1668396098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125431119": {"recommendationid": "125431119", "author": {"steamid": "76561199049402267", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 406, "last_played": 1681869701}, "language": "spanish", "review": "wenardo", "timestamp_created": 1668371395, "timestamp_updated": 1668371395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125388569": {"recommendationid": "125388569", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966689925", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1668325364}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a shame the review has to be thumbs up or thumbs down, based only on recommendation.  There's a lot of to love here: the imagination, humor, music, and art design are all fantastic.  The commitment to updating the game across years with content at no charge to early adopters is an admirable model for the industry, and these developers were pioneers in embracing it. \n\nBut recommending Shovel Knight is very, very situational. The game worships an outdated game design from when hour-long games needed to be ridiculously difficult to pad out gameplay.  There's a type of gamer who thrives on the anxiety and frustration built in to such games, which fuels them to keep playing. As gaming evolved to be more accommodating and reasonable, most games adopted hard modes to keep appealing to them.  There is no such toggle here.  While there's no live system, the promise of unlimited continues is used here as a band-aid on a level design philosophy from the NES-hard era of games.  Many flying/floating enemies are programmed to approach and attack from angles you cannot, leaving no way to defend yourself without taking damage. Levels feel built for pixel-perfect reflexes, while the developers reward that play with tricks and traps at every turn.\n\nIf you enjoy the \"Get good\" creed, then you'll enjoy this game.

Due to their mostly water based biology, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick.

Sure, it's that 8-bit aesthetic, but with the charm and effort they put into these sprites, it's frankly amazing what they pull off. Not to mention how accurate it is to NES graphics, only limiting their color set to what the technology could handle...plus only a handful of colors to fit what they needed. Although, they didn't limit their technology, making it feel like an NES Game in terms of nostalgia, without the problematic technical limitations.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay. Technically it's 4 games each with different controls, but all of them are great. There's the classic run-and-hit style of Shovel Knight, the chaotic and explosive gameplay of Plague Knight, the hack-n-slash Ninja Gaiden-esque thrill of Specter Knight, and the wacky Wario-like shoulder bashing of King Knight. All feel great with the levels painstakingly made to give a fair, yet tough challenge that makes you feel like a legend to pull off.Thirdly, the music. My god, the music. Sure, it's chiptune, but what they do with it is amazing. A Thousand Leagues Below, High Above the Land, In the Halls of the Usurper, and many more are all beautifully composed to match each level and give the perfect feel for each one. Not to mention, they literally remixed the 10 main level tracks for Specter of Torment, taking these already phenomenal tracks, and turning them into versions that are just as good as, if not better than their original counterparts.\n\nLastly, the story. From the classic adventure of Shovel of Hope and the goofy romance of Plague of Shadows, to the tragic drama of Specter of Torment and the silly misadventure of King of Cards, all four of these tales are great to experience and will show you four fantastic stories that all intertwine with unforgettable characters you will fall in love with.\n\n(Plus there's Shovel Knight Showdown, but I kind of see that as just a bonus.)\n\nIn summary, Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is exactly what it says it is. A treasure trove of quality games that the crew at Yacht Club Games poured their heart and soul into to make easily one of the greatest indie masterpieces of all time, leaving a mark on gaming history that will last the test of time.\n\nAs for getting it, don't worry. If you have a recent-ish console, you can get it. PC, Xbox 360-X/S, PS3-4 and the Vita, Nintendo Wii, Wii U, 2DS, 3DS, and Switch...plus probably some others I'm missing.

I like to think about 2D platformers as being in two different camps; one being the speed-focused kind where you can fly across the screen in one jump, and the other being the more chunky kind with a focus on microadjustments. The best example of the first kind would be Super Meat Boy, and the best example of the latter is Shovel Knight. \n\nThe reason why I like to think about platformers this way is because I really disliked Super Meat Boy when I played it, I felt like the character was sliding all over the place and I felt a severe lack of control. Playing Shovel Knight, comparatively, fit me like a glove and I was able to pick up the game almost instantly. And yet there are (obviously) people who really vibe with Super Meat Boy and also people who really dislike the controls of Shovel Knight, and it wouldn't surprise me if those groups were linked. So, here's my point; if you're used to a platformer like Super Meat Boy (or other speed-focused platformers), then you might find Shovel Knight to be unresponsive in comparison. Getting from platform to platform requires you to hold down the directional button all the way through the jump in order to make it. On the flip side, you will rarely overshoot your target or slide into death faster than you can react to it. Your enjoyment of the game may very well depend on your preference, which is why I think it's important to point out.\n\nWith all of that said, let's get into what Shovel Knight has that is so special: the mix between careful and varied design. The level of craft and polish is almost extensive enough to be detrimental. Every screen has a clear path that makes sense from a glance, enemies are placed to be obstacles but also to be possible shortcuts by jumping on their heads, secrets are marked and placed at consistent intervals and places but never quite obvious enough to make it impossible to miss them. Every major area is half an hour long \u2013 what a thing to be able to say in a game \u2013 which is consistent enough that I could use it as a clock while playing. The game never breaks, has close to no bugs (I noticed a grand total of one, and it might not have been, I'm still not sure) and everything about the presentation is stellar, from music to animations to art style. \n\nIf the polish makes the game clear and consistent, then the variety is where the fun comes from. That comes partially from the different environmental variations that exist between stages, like Megaman games in the past; icey floors, low gravity due to being underwater, wind currents etc. These are great for the same reasons why they're great in Megaman games, and bosses are similarly designed around these aspects as well. But on top of this there are other surprises. Suddenly you might have to fight a miniboss, sometimes there's an autoscrolling section that require you to speed up, sometimes it's both at once. The amount of times that the game manages to surprise you with its mechanics and challenges is wild, and it keeps things interesting to the end and across every expansion, which feature many of the same levels. Add to that the items you can find and buy, adding more options on the player side, and you have a game that never really gets old.\n\nOr at least, not because of the content. Shovel Knight is known for being a difficult game, and a punishing one. You lose 25% of your currency when you die, even if it's retrievable, and it's entirely possible to exit a stage poorer than you entered it, despite the treasure you collect throughout. So, you might ask, is the difficulty overtuned? And I have to say... yeah. I think it is. There are options, some items that make certain sections easier, armor sets that make you drop half as much gold or give you more damage abilities. But even then, it's without a question a brutal game. There were times when I didn't think I would make it past an obstacle, banging my fist in the desk from pure frustration. Especially the end of the last expansion, King of Cards, feels like the developers were racing against player capabilities, making levels and bosses harder just for the sake of keeping their reputation for difficulty. \n\nThe punishment is also too harsh, because the gold you lose don't just sit on the nearest platform; instead it gets thrown into the air in the shape of three balloons. These balloons can be, and often are, unreachable, either because you died in the middle of a high jump and they drift too high, or because they're floating just above a death drop. Even in Dark Souls, your souls are put in a location where you can easily take them back, as long as you can reach it again. In Shovel Knight, you often have to just cut your losses, because even if a balloon is technically retrievable, it might not be worth the risk.\n\nYou might wonder, why did I complete the game if it is so difficult? About a third of players who own this game do get to the ending of the base game, after all. Is it really that bad? And while it is, one thing that does keep you going is the story. It's a simple rescue story with a twist and a minimalistic one at that, but the way that they tell it is something special. I won't spoil too much, but the gameplay connected to the story together with the musical themes and the change of tone towards the end... it's all really good in a way that is hard to put your finger on. You really start to care about the characters of Shovel Knight, and to some extent the expansions as well. It leads to a drive to see the end, and a huge satisfaction when you reach it. This goes for every expansion except King of Cards, which I felt left on a pretty big downer.\n\nOverall, Shovel Knight is a great game and one of my favorites. I love everything about it and I want more people to see it... which is why it's a shame that some people will hesitate because of the difficulty, perhaps rightfully so. I can only say that I recommend the game based on my own experience. If you're a fan of platformers and don't at least try this game out, you might just rob yourself of one of the best experiences there is in the genre.

I did enjoy the story even if it's just another love story, I felt like they did a better job of getting us to care about the relationship here more.\n\nSoT (10/10) I love this game so much, arguably the best game in the series, Specter of torment introduces entirely new level design, a unique control scheme, and incredibly fun platforming, the music is remixed and amazing, and the story is peak in this game.\n\nKoC (8/10) I wasn't huge on this game, King Knight just feels really clunky and weird to me, Joustus hurts my brain, and the story is realllllly stupid, seriously this game was based around some man-child wanting to become rich by playing a card game.\n\nShowdown (9/10) I actually really enjoyed showdown, even if I didn't have anyone to play it with and getting the achievements will probably suck. Showdown's lets you play as pretty much every major character in the series and more, classic mode also gives us pretty unique interactions, the problem is this game is soo unbalanced, literally any heavy character is screwed.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

What Shovel Knight turned into, Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove, was not for me. The base game that was originally released, now called Shovel of Hope, is a fun game that's well made with a few caveats. I would recommend it at $15 by [url=store.steampowered.com/app/589500/Shovel_Knight_Shovel_of_Hope]clicking this link![/url] Save your money and just buy the base game. If you really want more, you're only paying $5 more in the end if you pay full price.\n\nThe game was added on to with \"free\" campaigns from Kickstarter stretch goals. Yacht Club Games over promised three new campaigns which became, Plague of Shadows, [url=store.steampowered.com/app/589510/Shovel_Knight_Specter_of_Torment]Specter of Torment[/url], [url=store.steampowered.com/app/1116780/Shovel_Knight_King_of_Cards]King of Cards[/url], and even a multiplayer fighting game called [url=store.steampowered.com/app/1116770/Shovel_Knight_Showdown]Showdown[/url]. Anyone that backed the game or purchased the retail release before a certain time got all this content for free and then the price was raised to $40. To be fair, and give YCG credit where credit is due, you can still purchase each of the campaigns \u00e0 la carte except for Plague of Shadows which is included in Shovel of Hope, supposedly unlocked after you beat the main game, but I can not confirm that. (Some have said it simply isn't available separately.)\n\nThese campaigns took 5 years to make, tying YCG up from doing something fresh with their talent. The \"new\" campaigns use the same levels and sometimes are largely unchanged. The main difference is the moveset and controls of the other characters. The new characters don't really change the game, and are more like a remix. I'm sure opinions will differ, but I had my fill of \"retro 8-bit NES action inspired largely by Capcom's DuckTales from ex-members of Wayforward, the studio that created Shantae\" with the original Shovel Knight and just didn't enjoy the new characters enough to care. And if I didn't get far enough in the new campaigns to see a major difference, then I was still apathetic enough that I didn't care. I especially hated the play style for Plague of Shadows.\n\nFor me, there was just too much content I didn't want or ask for. Just because it's free doesn't mean it's added value worthy of your time. It's also been disappointing how much YCG has exploited Shovel Knight in cross-game cameos and merchandise. What was once a charming indie underdog story and a fun game, I now find unpleasant. I don't blame them; they have to pay the bills, but I hope I never have to see this tin can ever again.

I will also note that I am not nostalgic for the NES, SNES, or any retro gaming console really. I will also be reviewing this game as a whole package, not every game individually for the most part. But as for my opinion on that, four great games + a cute little side mode for only $40 is a total steal in my opinion. Last thing to note is that I really enjoy a good challenge in my games, and don't get frustrated at it generally. \n\n[b] Things I like: [/b]\nFirst off, all of the pixel art is incredible. Every single sprite and background of every area looks great. I'm sure that this game is the entire reason some people tried out pixel art, which is a great thing. Secondly, the music is iconic. In fact, it's so iconic I'm willing to bet many people heard a song from this game before even knowing about it's existence. If you're a sucker for chiptune music, this game is your holy grail. Even for people who aren't, I'm sure they'll still like at least a few songs here. As for gameplay, I found it a total treat. Sure, it's difficult, but it's usually entirely fair, and even then I found the average difficulty level to be much more reasonable than most actual NES games. You can also to an extent decide your own difficulty by just choosing not to use some of the cheesier items. The game is also surprisingly long for something based off of NES games, but that may be just because there are 4 individual campaigns. Last thing I'll say is that even after beating the campaigns, there are still quite a few things to toy around with.\n\n[b] Things I Don't Like/Things Other People Might Not Like: [/b]\nThe only thing I could personally say I genuinely didn't really like is that the side mode feels kind of boring. It's like Classic Mode from the Super Smash Brothers games, but with less variety. If you're trying to get 100%, you'll have to replay that mode quite a few times, and I personally found it to be a bit boring. Even then, it's just a side mode, and I didn't even dislike my time with the mode. The difficulty may be a turn off for a lot of people. While it's not too hard, it's still hard enough for me to see a decent amount of people getting mad with it, especially some of the harder achievements. I could also see some people getting bored with games trying to invoke NES/SNES nostalgia, but this game came out before that became the popular thing to do as far as I remember.\n\n[b] Overview and Tl;dr [/b]\nOne of, if not the finest retro throwback games to ever exist, everything about this game is fantastic. I can't see too many real flaws with this game, most of them just being a matter of taste. Since there's 4 games + 1 side game packaged into one, and the whole package is $40, you can view it as paying $10 for each game individually, which I view as a total steal.\n\nTl;dr: Probably the best and most iconic retro throwback game, pick it up if you're okay with a decent challenge. While the side mode can get a bit repetitive, I'd say that each other game is will worth $10, which is effectively what you're paying for each of them.", "timestamp_created": 1660011573, "timestamp_updated": 1660011573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120283161": {"recommendationid": "120283161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347837067", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 455, "last_played": 1657060111}, "language": "english", "review": "schuble nyte is fun!!!! i lyke the fights and schobel mechanincs!!!", "timestamp_created": 1659973775, "timestamp_updated": 1659973775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120215270": {"recommendationid": "120215270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201366977", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 776, "last_played": 1688574358}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic retro 2d platformer with amazing retro sound design full of easter eggs and call backs to many classic games, the humour is very good aswel.", "timestamp_created": 1659873002, "timestamp_updated": 1659873002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120199204": {"recommendationid": "120199204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171050929", "num_games_owned": 1938, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1611724842}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Shovel Knight, seguramente sea de esos clasicos modernos que quienes jugamos juegos indies o al menos estamos en la onda, hemos jugado alguna vez. \nEs un plataformero de fantasia con algo de rol, recuerda a retros 8-bit de hace decadas, tiene buena musica y su gameplay es muy preciso y entretenido.

You can buy the individual campaigns + Showdown seperately although last I heard Plague of Shadows is only available in Treasure Trove.\n\nOverall what you have here is a challenging and fun 2D platformer. Sometimes it gets annoying if you are finding yourself short on patience, but I honestly find this game too much of a delight to play during its best parts to stay mad for long when it gets difficult.", "timestamp_created": 1659572182, "timestamp_updated": 1659572182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119990015": {"recommendationid": "119990015", "author": {"steamid": "76561199200109996", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1693, "last_played": 1664762405}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved shoveling all of the bosses", "timestamp_created": 1659528600, "timestamp_updated": 1659528600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119958323": {"recommendationid": "119958323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232464988", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1674296946}, "language": "english", "review": "Not much story but with game play like this I don't even care", "timestamp_created": 1659474046, "timestamp_updated": 1659474046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119950492": {"recommendationid": "119950492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287953699", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1694574240}, "language": "english", "review": "Best digging simulator I ever played", "timestamp_created": 1659463994, "timestamp_updated": 1659463994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119941983": {"recommendationid": "119941983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087204715", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 4826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1172, "last_played": 1664415505}, "language": "english", "review": "There are too many games on my backlog already why did you give me 3 games for free, I thought I was just getting shovel knight", "timestamp_created": 1659452769, "timestamp_updated": 1676677753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.380789577960968018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119918112": {"recommendationid": "119918112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156128074", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1659411736}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this because the reviews were high, but after playing for many hours, I can say that it was over-rated to say the least.

Although I don't think Shovel Knight is a bad game, I'd definitely not call it good either.\n\nThe base game - Shovel of Hope - is a typical \"you're a good guy and you must save the world\" story with zero world-building and character development. The only thing the game tells you is how the antagonists - the Enchantress and her Order of No Quarter - are bad and you have to stop them. That's 9 unique characters which could have been interesting had the developers put any effort in fleshing them out.\n\nPlague of Shadows is the first and the laziest DLC out of the three. You play as Plague Knight (one of the antagonists) who's trying to create a potion capable of giving super powers to anyone who drinks it so that he can... ask his assistant out on a date. While the premise is silly, I like it much more than the cliche that Shovel of Hope is, and we actually get a little character development this time (but just a little, god forbid the developers actually try expanding the almost non-existent game lore). What's not as good here is the gameplay: this DLC is effectively a reskin of the base game. You play the same levels and beat the same bosses except now you throw bombs instead of swinging a shovel and you can jump higher. There's some variation in how your attack works due to bomb modifiers but this, obviously, doesn't change the fact that you're playing the same game all over again.\n\nSpecter of Torment is the second DLC, and, surprisingly, it's actually good. You play as Specter Knight (another antagonist) on his quest to recruit people into the Enchantress's Order of No Quarter. While the plot comes down to beating all the same bosses, the level layouts were changed, so there's at least some novelty in terms of gameplay, and what's more important, the developers actually managed to come up with a backstory for a whole one(!) character and explain a couple of things relevant to the plot of the main game - a massive achievement on their part.\n\nKing of Cards is the third and the most controversial DLC in my opinion. You play as King Knight (yet another antagonist) trying to become the King of Cards - the champion in a card game called Joustus. The levels layouts were changed once again (in fact, instead of having few long levels with a boss at the end like in the previous campaigns, there're many shorter levels which you have to simply run through now) for gameplay novelty, and the developers worked even more on the game lore this time, not only coming up with one(!) character backstory, but also doing some world-building which explains how some things came to be in the main story. Unfortunately, there's one thing that ruins the experience, and that is this DLC's main gimmick - Joustus. To put it shortly, it's a poorly designed and poorly balanced mini-game which seems rich in mechanics and content but at the same time feels like a cheap afterthought. Hopefully, you can ignore it and beat the campaign by playing only the regular platforming levels (although it's not clear that you can actually do so) but playing Joustus is required if you want to experience all of the available content.\n\n(As for the Showdown \"DLC\", I'm not going to spend any time explaining anything in depth. It's a Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game in Shovel Knight universe, and all you need to know is that it is cancer. Showdown is such an atrocious piece of trash that by no means you should ever touch it.)\n\nNow that I've walked through all the separate in-game campaigns, I'd like to talk about the thing that is common among all of them, the main design point of Shovel Knight - the attempt to make an \"old-school\" game, or, as the developers understand it, to make a very frustrating game:\n\n[list]\n [*] many enemies are very annoying to deal with due to their movement and attack behavior\n [*] all the levels are riddled with instant-death traps (bottomless pits, lava pools, and spike floors/walls/ceilings)\n [*] getting hit stuns you shortly, which paired with the previous two points means you'll be dying a lot\n [*] in case you die, you drop money which has to be collected back, and in case you die again in the process, the old money bags disappear forever, which paired with the previous three points means you'll be losing a lot of money too if you're not good at platformers\n [*] Propeller Knight (and his level as a whole) in the Shovel of Hope/Plague of Shadows campaigns is the worst part of the game and was most likely created specifically to make you suffer\n[/list]\n\nHaving achieved 100% completion in each campaign I don't think I can remember a single point where I found Shovel Knight satisfying. Either the game is so easy and boring (yet again thanks to how little effort was put into designing the story, the world, and its characters) that you feel apathetic about it, or it's so rage-inducing that you only feel relief after finally getting past some bullshit thrown in by the developers to make your life miserable.", "timestamp_created": 1657491005, "timestamp_updated": 1657580961, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.369531393051147461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118369574": {"recommendationid": "118369574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398281940", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 2217, "last_played": 1700363542}, "language": "english", "review": "good story very fun worth every penny. specter of torment might be my favorite, however they are all a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1657173807, "timestamp_updated": 1657173807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118368809": {"recommendationid": "118368809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410888599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1692762725}, "language": "english", "review": "I actually very much enjoy shovel knight.

There are a bunch of upgrades to be found/bought, but most are completely useless and you end up using the same ones over and over as they're just more effective. The other games that come with the Treasure Trove are basically the same game but played as different characters. This is normally one of my favorite things with games like these but the other characters are just as clunky with their new mechanics. \n\nI don't understand the praise/hype around this game as there are a fair amount of other 8/16-bit styled games that are way better than whatever shovel Knight was trying to do.

Not Recommended 5/10.[/h2]\n[i][b]For Linux: [/b] Native.[/i]\n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]Summary[/h3]\nI know this game has fans but in my opinion this game doesn\u2019t elicit the kind of old school nostalgia feel the same classic action platform games of the past. It certainly has the look and the sound of a retro 8-bit game but old school action platform \u2013 such as Megaman, Contra, Ninja Gaiden and the like \u2013 has a flow to the game that Shovel Knight just does not have. In fact, Yacht Club went out of their way to make their game flow like rocks in your shoes. \n\nThe level is designed with cheap deaths to stop you every step of the way instead of a having continuous motion and progress. Ever tried to run or jog 10 miles with rocks in your shoes, well, this is how it feels like in video game format. It is so annoying. \n\nOn top of that, the controls are just sub-par compared to Shovel Knights contemporaries such as Celeste, Hollow Knight, Metroid Dread, Bloodstained Curse Of The Moon, and even remastered games such as Wonder Boy And The Dragon\u2019s Trap has better controls. \n\nIs it all bad? No. Depending on your level of tolerance, you may find much enjoyment and you may click with this kind of gameplay. However, looking at the achievements, 76% of purchasers did not in fact finished the game which is an indication of a game with a lot of hype but does not have the substance to back it up. It is an indication that my assessment is more correct than not. \n\nWill you like this game. My bet is that you will not. Not recommended. \n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]What\u2019s Excellent[/h3]\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]1. Soundtrack is excellent.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]2. Graphics are colorful, vibrant and well animated.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]3. Narrative is simple but is well told. Cast of characters are memorable.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nIt\u2019s a shame really because Shovel Knight nailed a lot of things right. The music is top-notch chiptune; energetic, enthusiastic and thematically coherent. The graphics really nailed retro 8-bit in the best of sense; colorful, vibrant, detailed and immersive. The game even has a well-told story with a lively and memorable cast of characters. Everything is great except for the gameplay. \n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]What\u2019s Bad[/h3]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]1. Controls are just subpar. The hit box and hit detection is way too small making platforming, jumping and evading more of a hindrance.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]2. Levels are designed with cheap deaths. It\u2019s literally a case of players\u2019 \u201cOh how did I not predict that ahead of time\u201d design philosophy. Rather than challenging, the levels are cheesy. [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]3. Combat is unfulfilling. It\u2019s not terrible but it\u2019s really just meh. Enemies are aggravating rather than challenging. [/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAs stated, the controls is just not good enough. [b]Simply not good enough.[/b] You will find that often you\u2019re fighting against the controls during platforming to jump and land precisely where you want. This has to do with Shovel Knight accelerating way too fast from a standstill, and controlling SK in mid-air or when pogo-ing becomes unwieldy. This is in stark contrast to the really fine controls you get with games such as Celeste and Hollow Knight, where you can exactly move, stop, jump and land where you intend to. \n\nThe levels too is just aggravating. In a platform sense, it\u2019s not hard but it\u2019s just filled with cheap deaths designed to get you because the player cannot predict what is going to happen next, such as falling down a level only to land on insta-kill floor which you won\u2019t know it\u2019s there unless you\u2019ve been there before. This cheap level design is a way to mask the short and uninteresting level design for each stage. The levels are not there to challenge you, rather it\u2019s there to halt your progress on purpose, slows down you playthrough to mask it\u2019s lack of content. \n\nCombat too, is designed the same way. Combat in videogames is a dance. There is rhythm and motion and the combat in Shovel Knight is akin to an awkward white guy in a dance club. It has geeky, nerdy and jerky grooves and moves, almost laughable if it wasn\u2019t so cringe to watch. It is not satisfying and feels unfulfilling. By the end of it, you don\u2019t feel like a better gamer for finishing the game, rather you feel unsatisfied. \n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nI realize that Shovel Knight has fans. Hey, don\u2019t let me stop you from enjoying the game if you like it. But for me, this ain\u2019t it. Not by a long shot. \n\nIf you want good action platformer, try Bloodstained Curse Of The Moon.", "timestamp_created": 1651643039, "timestamp_updated": 1651643189, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433979004621505737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114909811": {"recommendationid": "114909811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077518212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1477382324}, "language": "english", "review": "great", "timestamp_created": 1651623631, "timestamp_updated": 1651623631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114887192": {"recommendationid": "114887192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008999296", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 5066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2297, "last_played": 1692369947}, "language": "english", "review": "just play it, its worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1651588165, "timestamp_updated": 1651588165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114873383": {"recommendationid": "114873383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016595489", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1904, "last_played": 1689460028}, "language": "english", "review": "good fun", "timestamp_created": 1651565010, "timestamp_updated": 1651565010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114852772": {"recommendationid": "114852772", "author": {"steamid": "76561199113500749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1679190284}, "language": "english", "review": "I went into Shovel Knight with pretty high expectations. I had heard good things about it and it looked like a cool, 8-bit inspired game. However, my experience with the game wasn't as good as I had hoped. I found the movement of the characters to be very clunky and awkward. Shovel Knight feels okay, a bit old-school in control, not the most precise, but functional. Plague Knight was so miserable and awkward to control that I considered him nearly unusable. I enjoy a challenge from my games, but if I wanted a challenge based on bad controls I would just play Getting Over It. If I'm playing a platformer, I don't want it to feel like garbage when I'm trying to platform.\n\nI like the premise of the game, and the way that some of the different story lines weave together. It was a cool idea, and it was okay execution, but I honestly found the game to just not be very fun, especially beyond the main (Shovel Knight) campaign.

Also a pretty good story.\n\nKing of Cards has shorter levels which allow it to add crazy and fun new mechanics, as well as a super fun movement system with a shoulder bash, which is consistently utilised in clever and creative ways. Also it has a (completely optional) strategy card game integrated into it, which is great fun to play.\n\nIf you're into platformers or retro-style games this is absolutely worth picking up.

When I bought this I was, and it turned out to be an excellent platformer. Make no mistake, the combat in this game is amazing, but it is mainly a platformer. Fortunately, I love platformers.\n\nBosses\n  Bosses come at the end of every stage, and none were too difficult. Most of them I was able to beat first try. Furthermore, after a certain point in the game your character has so much health that you can trade hits with the boss and come out on top. Despite this, I found every boss fun to battle. Each boss is unique. No copy and paste bosses at all.\n\nPlatforming\n  The bosses may be easy, but the platforming is very challenging.\n  The amount of health you have does not make the platforming easier-- the main cause of death is falling off the map which kills you instantly. Besides missing a jump, enemies can easily knock you off the map (one is even designed to, and caused me more than my fair share of deaths). On later stages, checkpoints are further apart and enemies will quickly whittle down your health if you are not careful.\n  As shovel knight, you have several moves you can use to get around. Of course you can walk (no sprinting), but you also can pogo off enemies and certain objects with your shovel. You gain more abilities as you play, including artifacts which give the player powerful attacks or utilities which consume magic.\n  That is only shovel knight's moveset, which is tame in comparison to the others. The other characters you can play (further discussed in the next section) have many more abilities, like bomb jumps and slashing through a target to gain height, to name a couple.\n\nEven more content\n  The main part of the game you play as shovel knight. There are three more characters with completely different move sets you can play as: Plague Knight, Specter Knight, and King Knight. The first stages they play on are similar the same as the ones you play on as shovel knight. Later stages are completely different, though they use the same tilesets as the original levels.\n  Besides the main game and bonus characters, there is a challenge mode that is unlocked after you beat the game in which you can play mini games, and a brawl mode where you can face your friends or the computer (the AI is not hard even at the highest difficulty) in a variety of different gamemodes.\n\nFinal thoughts\n  The controls are precise. The pixel art is beautiful. The soundtrack is good. And I highly recommend this game.\n\nIf you notice anything wrong with this review (grammar, spelling, bad information) let me know.", "timestamp_created": 1650039034, "timestamp_updated": 1650046752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708198487758636475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113895101": {"recommendationid": "113895101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124407909", "num_games_owned": 1877, "num_reviews": 413, "playtime_forever": 3687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3687, "last_played": 1649837109}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]GOLDEN MEDAL[/h1]\n\nI would be happy if you followed my Steam Curator Page :)\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/", "timestamp_created": 1650031870, "timestamp_updated": 1650031870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.34389793872833252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113829142": {"recommendationid": "113829142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838078222", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 2976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2976, "last_played": 1644795083}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant platformer, great music, lovely world.\n\nJuuust a touch frustrating occasionally, and I say that having grown up with Mega Man games.

It's got a couple of cool innovations like the player-chosen difficulty through letting you break checkpoints for a cash boost in exchange for losing more progress if you die, but in then end a game like Shovel Knight lives of dies on the moment-to-moment gameplay, and in my opinion the moment to moment gameplay of Shovel knight is awful. The character feels clumsy to control, challenges are poorly balanced, and most of the boss fights had cool enemy design but left me feeling more relief that I lucked out enough times to win than

game with a very good team. different challenges and stories with different characters that feel meaningfully connected without being the same exact experience.\n\ndifferent rewards for doing more difficult decisions, rarely feels obligatory to try something. enemies have different skills that feel fun to dodge and attack around. hidden secret rooms are usually very interesting explorations of mechanics. collectibles range from useful tools to just fun secrets.\n\nmaps are all very interesting themes, they are of course the usual platformer levels of ice and water and air etc. but they give a very good feeling. music matches the looks matches the expectations very well. if absolutely nothing else i would recommend the music to most people.\n\nthe king knight card game is pretty unpopular, i enjoyed it thoroughly and it is optional in the confines of the playthrough. it is not like the rest of the game, it is much more lateral thinking in my opinion. \n\nsmash bros-like gamemode adds different characters from the main story who all play very differently from one another. in general I really like everyone's abilities in the game, shovel knight (the character not the game....) is very straightforward but still manages to feel unique.\n\nfor platformers: very few of the jumps feel like pixel-perfect timing is required, and often rooms with jumps that are like that are immediately preceded by a checkpoint. feels very rhythmic.\n\ni would recommend the game to anybody who likes platformers. i would also recommend it to somebody who likes feeling games. i would

I loved this game, I love the look, I love the music, I love the characters, and I love the stories, This is definitely one of these reviews that I wish Steam had a mixed review option like they have with Curator reviews giving options to have reviews be \"informational\" rather than just only positive and negative. I had a blast with Shovel Knight's campaign and I was enjoying myself up until I got up to Polar Knight. I feel that the game decides to start leaning more on cheap and instant kills rather than the fun platforming that was present early on.\n\nNow to clarify there were some stages and areas in the early stages where you could just die by being knocked into a bottomless pit or dying by stepping on a spike or grazing it as you're jumping by, but Polar Knight is where you start to see it bumped up from maybe 15% of the stages and the like to about 75% of the map screens being you jumping over bottomless pits or navigating areas filled with spikes and not to mention. The stage itself is pretty fun, but once you get to the end you have to deal with Polar Knight shoveling out spike traps in a small arena and have to avoid them knocking you into it as it makes the arena you fight smaller and smaller. It does refresh it with snow after a while, but you have to basically speed through the fight to avoid being left on a small ledge or two to fight and avoid getting hit while you wait for the snow to refresh or just instantly die. Propeller Knight's fight has a similar aspect where the game ends up having him summon his ship which fires cannonballs which splits the stage into 3 different parts and trying to navigate the battle. \n\nI feel that Yacht Club Games even realized how bad it was for Shovel Of Hope as when you get to the last part of the game and you fight against all 8 bosses again you fight against Polar Knight first and while it still uses the spikes and everything that it did prior, Propeller Knight doesn't destroy the stage this time around and instead just drops bombs all over the stage to fight you with. That's not even mentioning the fight with the Enchantress's first phase being over a bottom less pit, but for Shovel Knight the fight is a lot easier then doing the fight as Plague Knight. I got through the fight and the campaign, but I'm fairly certain during my playthrough of SoH and Plague of Shadow (which I'll discuss in a second) I've died more from being knocked into a bottomless pit or into spikes then I ever did in any fight or any boss battle. \n\nFor PoS there are a lot of problems I have, it's the same as SoH and I mean this as a compliment for the first part of the game where it's enjoyable and you are having a blast playing through the game with the new mechanics and gameplay features made the game so much fun, but then you get to Polar Knight and the same issue occurs. Heck, even elaborating over the mention of the fight in the last section my biggest problem is the final boss is much harder as the Plague Knight. As shovel Knight you can attack without having to worry about destroying the arena and you can do your best in navigating and fighting the Enchantress, but as Plague Knight,all your attacks basically destroy the arena and even using the Sentry Fuses would lead to either bombs that didn't hit a mark or them destroying a small amount of the stage which lead to me falling into a pit during the fight. I did the fight as Shovel Knight once and the same first phase as Plague Knight 9 times with 8 of the times that I died being because I was knocked into a bottomless pit. The only other problem I had was Phase 2 of the last boss being the same, but arena was constantly scrolling up with more room to blow up or navigate so it feels once again that YCG realized the mistake they made with balancing and decided to actually make the fight a an enjoyable challenge rather than it just being a fight where the challenge is hoping you don't get knocked into a bottomless pit.\n\nThere is one other thing that I do have to say for those who didn't buy Treasure Trove, I recommend picking it up over buying the standalone versions because despite me having a few issues with the campaigns, it is the only way to play/buy Plague of Shadows because despite it being years since the devs said they were going to make it a standalone release (or even just including it into SoH's campaign since it's the most expensive standalone entry) there is still no information about PoS being a standalone release as of March 2022.\n\nI'm sure that Specter Knight and King Knight both have great campaigns, but after the frustration I experienced with both the last third of Shovel Knight and Plague Knight leaves a bad taste in my mouth and make it so I don't want to play the game any further as a result.", "timestamp_created": 1647420085, "timestamp_updated": 1647420085, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.388658910989761353",

"Unfortunately, to my surprise, I have to post a negative review of this game. It has many amazing elements, interesting gameplay and enemies, but even after wanting to play it since it was released, playing it a bit some time later, so many years ago and finally finishing it recently, I can't pretend it didn't disappoint me. What have gone wrong?\n\n[h1]Perfect atmosphere[/h1]\nThe game captured the old school platformers without a flaw. Not only with the simple mechanics, the same vibe of playing, especially with so many inspirations from [b]Rockman[/b] (Megaman) series, but also with artistic style, like game intros, retro graphics and other choices. But what made it so great, was also what makes this game so annoying.\n\n[h1]Completionism[/h1]\nI love games with things to collect. I always do 100% in the game, unless it's really unbalanced and unfair. Even if doing so is somewhat annoying. I did finish [b]Shovel of Hope[/b] with all collectibles, purchases etc. But that's one of the issue. After playing so many [i]metroidvanias[/i] I finally wanted some classic platformer experience, so I have chosen [strike]death[/strike] Shovel Knight, which I started long time ago, but never finished, because of frustration. But there's a problem.\n\n[h1]Downsides[/h1]\nMy initial try of this game ended in a fiasco, because I couldn't bear how much You have to be perfect to not land in a hole. I could bear just that, but not that I felt cheated every time I died, because of those hard controls. I like characters that move freely, not like they were dragged by some kind of force. And every time I died I just lost [i]far too much monies[/i]. I can lose a progress and be backed to last checkpoint, but the amount of currency lost was too much. Just to Your knowledge. I played and love Dark Souls and I never felt cheated like I did in Shovel Knight. And I could always get my souls back, because of fair system that my bloodstains spawn in accessible area. It's not always the case in Shovel Knight. You could have 10k money, die 3 times and You can get below 5k of Your cash if You can't manage to get it back. And I have to mention one more thing. Some deaths were not fait at all. I dashed with one of my item, just to be pushed be suddenly spawned enemy and fell into the pit, before being able to get my money back. And because You lose 25% of Your cash, divided by 3 cash bags every time You die... You can imagine how quickly You can run out of money.\n\nAnd here we are going to a point of why I hated the game. I mentioned I am completionist. So I had to get money to buy everything. It wasn't really a big deal. What was big deal was me burning out when collecting in-level collectibles (music sheets). I started to see a level not as a level I have to finish, but as an annoying secret wall I have to find, not die and get the sheet, and then finish the level. I stopped seeing levels as a levels. As a challenge. Instead it was just a way to the collectible. I didn't pay attention to the level, but to the breakable walls.\n\nAnd at the end, some kind of challenges were just annoying. Not hard, but fakely hard. You needed meta knowledge, not skill, not agility, not fast reaction/thinking. I'm specifically saying about [spoiler]that pressing wall, that You have to time and find a safe place to not be squashed. But at one moment, I was confused as what to actually do. I thought I will be safe here. Nope. Dead. There? Dead again. And again and again and again. I was dying only because I didn't have a knowledge I couldn't have. And I had to react quickly or be squashed[/spoiler]. I am pretty good at platformers, so it's not that I complain, because game is too hard. Game wasn't really that hard. But some moments were like \"we expect player to do something they can't expect to do, it will be fun\". I didn't like it.\n\nSo despite they made artistic, visual, atmospheric part of the game perfectly, they didn't provide good gameplay. I didn't enjoy playing through the game, I just wanted to finish the game already, something I never feel while playing the game. Just to have it done. I even tried to play Plague Knight after finishing Shovel Knight's campaign, but after I died in pit, because I had (and still have) no idea how to do suepr precise bomb jump, I just quitted. I finished main campaign and couldn't start the next one, because of that. The controls of Plague Knight are so confusing, I don't really know where would I end up, after using his powers. So I didn't want to play the \"guess game\" with the controls.\n\nSome people may enjoy the game, I didn't. I just share my issues, because someone may not like controls like that or severe punishments. The gameplay isn't fair and I can't just ignore that.", "timestamp_created": 1646055336, "timestamp_updated": 1646055336, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.408352673053741455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111214727": {"recommendationid": "111214727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044827577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1647066626}, "language": "english", "review": "I had put off playing this game for so many years... but man, did it deliver.

The levels get increasingly difficult and introduce new mechanics constantly, so no two levels feel alike. The themes of the bosses and their mechanics are perfectly suited to their stages.

It discards everything that didn't work like the cheap deaths and lives systems that send you back to the beginning of the game, while keeping everything that people loved about them such as the high difficulty, colorful characters, and catchy chiptunes. \n\nOur protagonist is a kind adventurer who's hesitant to fight, but WILL kick your ass if needed. Every boss has their own colorful personality, theme, and of course love being evil. \n\nThe story is simple and is told through dialogue before boss fights. Shovel Knight's inner struggle is also depicted through playable dream sequences, which is a clever way to include a touching story into a silly platform game. The ending is also a total tear jerker. \n\nThe spikes and bottomless pits are one hit kills and there's a LOT of them throughout the game, and you'll mostly die from them instead of running out of health. A lot of tight platforming jumps. This is what gives the game its \"NES-hard\" feel. It can be frustrating at times, but that's also what makes the game extremely rewarding to complete. \n\nThe boss fights are easily my favorite part of the game. They challenge your skill and each is a big puzzle to be solved. They will constantly kill you and force you to get better.", "timestamp_created": 1645413080, "timestamp_updated": 1645413080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

So it\u2019s now time for the story. In the land of Pridemoor it was wild and free, where legendary adventurers would face monsters to protect the people and no two knights were more famous than Shovel Knight and his trusty companion Shield night.\n\nThe two were an inseparable pair, but that all changed when the Tower of Fate opened up, sensing great danger from its opening Shovel Knight and Shield Knight went to investigate. Unfortunately Shield Knight was lost and Shovel Knight barely escaped the Tower of Fate with his life.\n\nHeartbroken he went into solitude only to hear tales of evil knights called The Order of No Quarter led by the mysterious and evil leader the enchantress. Now Shovel Knight must raise his mighty shovel against the new evil. But unknown to everyone the order is not as united as they think, the Crafty and tricky Plague Knight has a plan to get the essence of each member of the order of No Quarter as well as the enchantress in order to gain ultimate power and to gain the courage for love.\n\nBut before all that how did this all start, how did the order come together and who is the enchantress? Well Specter Knight the first member of the order is tasked by the enchantress to gather each of the evil knights in order to make a powerful and invincible order, Specter Knight complies having no choice but to obey the enchantress, but in the dark Fortress he laments on how it all went wrong in his life. With that going on, a crazy new pastime has taken up residence in the land, a card game called Joustus and a tournament is taking place the winner will be crowned King Of Cards and that title alone is interesting to one particular person the one and only King knight whose desires to be king will test him as he tries to claim what he desires no matter the cost.\n\nAll right let's talk about what's to like about the games, the gameplay for each of the games is fun, frustrating and tight. Shovel Knight\u2019s gameplay is good as you use your shovel as not just as a weapon, but as a way to traverse the environment, Plague Knight\u2019s gameplay is good it can be a bit tricky at times, but it has a nice variety of different bombs and power ups to use. Specter Knight\u2019s gameplay is extremely fun definitely has a nice ninja vibe to it, King Knight\u2019s gameplay like Plague Knight is a bit tricky but there are some nice power ups to use. The gameplay definitely has a nice variety. \n\nThe platforming in the game is very good, definitely tight with   different ways to play in not just the main game, but in the three other games. The power ups in the game are very good each one with their own unique look and purpose that can help you to traverse certain difficulty levels.\n\nThe pixel graphics/arts style is very good nicely detailed with plenty of great locations to look at, the levels in the game are very good, nice and varied with plenty of interesting locations also if you think you know a level because you beat it in Shovel Knight, well how you play the level and traverse it is quite different in plague Knight or the other two games.\nThe enemy and boss designs are very good, especially the bosses each one with their own unique look and feel. \n\nThe enemies and bosses are also pretty fun to fight, some of the enemies having their own unique powers specific for that level, while the bosses has their own unique powers and ways to beat you if you're not careful. The music in the game is very good each level has its own unique tract and you'll be hard-pressed to find one that you don't love.\n\nThe stories in each of the games are really good, Shovel Knight is quite simple, but has some nice surprises and some heartfelt moments in it.  Plague Knight\u2019s story is probably the most adorable and heartfelt having you watch him try to get the courage to ask the one he loves out it also has a good moral message.\n\nSpecter Knight is a good prequel story that shows how everything transpired; it definitely has a nice tragic feel to it and has good themes in it like heroism. King Knight\u2019s story is really good, it has a great Shakespearean tragedy to it.The characters in the game are very good especially the side characters and especially in the three other games like plague Knight, Specter Knight and King Knight\u2019s story.\n\nThe Comedy of the game is okay nothing really laugh out loud but enjoyable nonetheless, the game also has plenty of nice references to other games like Megaman. Shovel Knight Showdown is a great versus game that lets you play with different characters, bosses and some enemy types you have seen in the game.\n\nAll right let's talk about what's to dislike, there are just a little bits that can be a pain, like certain levels can be a real pain and feel a bit cheap like propeller Knight\u2019s level.\n\nI also didn't like the mini game Joustus that was in King Knight\u2019s game, I don't know it was very frustrating and I feel it was a bit unneeded, like you could have told King Knight\u2019s story without needing the card game gimmick.\n\nAll right then with that finished Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is an incredible old school style Adventure, platformer with a lot to love, from the really good stories, the fun, frustrating and tight gameplay and very good pixel graphics/arts style. The whole game is just a great, great example on how to capture the feel and look of classic games, so I highly, highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1644634093, "timestamp_updated": 1644873713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110019331": {"recommendationid": "110019331", "author": {"steamid": "76561199080585822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12356, "last_played": 1650233804}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have EVER played a 2d retro platformer, then this is the game Collection you didn't know you needed. This is one of my all-time favorite Steam games, and for very good reason. It plays like any of your favorite retros, and expands upon them in fun ways.\n\nShovel Of Hope:\nShovel of Hope is a really good introduction to the story, and the gameplay. Your adventuring buddy, Shield Knight has been taken by The Enchantress, and it is your duty to save Shield Knight from her. In order to get to her, you must defeat all of \"The Order of No Quarter.\" This game has fun mechanics, like bouncing of the enemies head, charging up for a super slash, or using mana to use relics. The relics all have different uses, like a barrage of attacks with the Dust Knuckles, eliminating every enemy at once with the blow of the War Horn, or soaring through the air, slicing through enemies with an awesome propeller called the Propeller Dagger. In every game you also get special armors that can give you interesting effects.\n\nPlague of Shadows:\nIn Plague of Shadows, you have the same levels from before, but you have a completely different way to play them. You have even more customization options, that change the way you play. You can choose a different bomb set to best fit your play style. As the evil Plague Knight, you wish to obtain a potion to become immortal. In \"order\" to do this, you must defeat, \"The Order of No Quarter\" that you are a part of. You also get a bunch of different relic-type weapons, called Arcana. While this game is fun, it is definitely the worst one you can get. After playing Shovel of Hope, it feels like the same thing, but worse. There is customization, but the customization only slightly alters moves, and the moveset doesn't match with the level design, since it was made for Shovel of Hope. If you only plan one, DO NOT choose this one. You will think the rest of the games are as bad, without giving those treasure troves a proper chance. This game takes place in the same time as Shovel of Hope.\n\nSpecter of Torment:\nA dark, stormy night, a mysterious figure, and a tragic backstory are all a part of my favorite Shovel Knight game. Specter of Torment does everything right. Like in the previous entries, you platform through levels, defeating \"The Order of No Quarter.\" We start off knowing almost nothing of our \"hero,\" Specter Knight. Throughout the levels, we learn more and more of his tragic backstory. That's another thing different, the levels are all accessible from the beginning, and you can choose any level, at any time. You get to slash your scythe through enemies, use the Curios, to inflict critical damage, and fly through the air with a quick slash. You even get to ride on rails like a skateboard, and you're Tony Hawk! The Curios are the Relics of the game including a healing item, a powerful claw attack, a time slowing device, a cloning mirror, and a skeleton minion. Not to mention the fact that all of the Curios can be upgraded to be EVEN BETTER. This prequel is so much fun, and my personal favorite with it's fun mechanics.\n\nKing of Cards:\nPlay as King Knight, the self proclaimed ruler, as he traverses through an incredible amount of levels. In King of Cards, there are more changes that can be definitely be called improvements. King knight uses his heavy armor to bash into enemies. After bashing, you bounce into the air, spinning. This can be used to bounce through levels using it's interesting mechanics. The story is about King Knight wanting to be the best at a card game called Joustus That's it. It's that simple. The Relics this time are called heirlooms, and they are a lot of fun. A flaming sword you fling around your body multiple times, float in a bubble with a frog, and get this, boots that make you turn into a tornado! This game is the second best in my opinion, because they learned what needed to be improved more and more. I admit it is more fun then Specter of Torment overall. By the time they got to this game, they learned everything that needed fixing. I'd say this game is flawless. It is good in every way as long as you like this type of game.\n\nShowdown:\nUse many different characters previously unplayable to defeat everyone else. Showdown is basically Super Smash Bros, but with Shovel Knight Characters. You get to select rules, stages, characters and their colors, and game modes to dominate the battlefield. There are achievements and a story mode. FOR EVERY CHARACTER. The game is fun, but it just can't compete with the glorious other games.", "timestamp_created": 1644623596, "timestamp_updated": 1644623596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538202106952667236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109949300": {"recommendationid": "109949300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199469721", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 942, "last_played": 1681498248}, "language": "english", "review": "just so well made", "timestamp_created": 1644533293, "timestamp_updated": 1644533293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109899148": {"recommendationid": "109899148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057720280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 716, "last_played": 1644709073}, "language": "english", "review": "blast of a game. clearly made by people who love platformers. wonderful cast of memorable characters, i luv u plague knight u little devil. ur missing out if u dont play shovel of hope at least once!!", "timestamp_created": 1644462072, "timestamp_updated": 1644462187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109865027": {"recommendationid": "109865027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008556139", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1451754504}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming artstyle;

Yacht Club Games doing this was genius. They took the first three bosses you fight, other than Back Knight, and gave them so much story. It is not necessary for the story of Shovel of Hope, in fact, I don't even think you unlock the other stories until after the campaign, but the other campaigns have just as much heart.

You also may find challenge rooms where the reward is a special magic ability. These abilities while not required certainly help in later areas.

Here's a breakdown of my thoughts of each game, followed by a rating for the collection!\n\n[h2] Shovel of Hope [/h2]\n\nThe OG adventure was fantastic! I enjoyed the colorfully organized pixel art, the simple yet difficult gameplay, and the amazing soundtrack. However, the final levels were a bit frustrating and I wished that some characters were fleshed out more. I liked that there was a varied customization within this game without it feeling overwhelming. There are shovel upgrades and different types of armor to purchase as well as health/mana upgrades. Additionally, there is a number of collectibles, and many weren\u2019t too hard to find. Collectible hunting didn\u2019t feel like a chore nor felt like I was going too far out of my way to break game flow!\n\nThe story is good but lacks some depth. I wish some characters had more personality, and the level designs could have been crafted in a way where it gave some insight to their backstories rather than an overall theme. However, the themes were great! I also really loved the soundtrack, with it being one of the best I have heard in gaming! There are some serious jams in here and they fit a lot of the fights that occur.\n\nOverall, this first entry is delightful. It has a few flaws that kept it from being \u201cnext level\u201d for me, but it is a finely crafted platformer with a whole lot of charm. I can easily [b] Recommend [/b] this entry, and it left me excited to see what\u2019s next in store with\u2026\n\n[h3] Final Verdict: 9/10 (Excellent) [/h3]\n\n[h2] Plague of Shadows [/h2]\n\nThe first expansion was a disappointment. A slew of bombs, boosts, and abilities are introduced to the player, and Plague Knight plays very differently from Shovel Knight himself. However, I felt that this overcomplicated things, and along with the reuse of all the OG levels, led to a more frustrating experience at times rather than rewarding. I did like the large offering of abilities for \"PK\", but I felt that I rarely used many. There are some types of bombs and boosts that are more effective in some levels or against certain bosses, but I never felt a desire to play around with them. The armor sets are also reused from the OG, except now with \"PK's\" theme. I also was disappointed that there weren\u2019t many new stages for \"PK\", which sucks because some older stages failed to fit with his playstyle. Instead, he feels sort of shoved into the OG with a new story. The story was nice, focusing on \"PK\" and his partner Mona as they figure out a way to prove to the world that they are great alchemists. There is still the trademark humor, and some more depth is given to many characters. This addition was great and gave me more of what I enjoyed in the OG.\n\nOverall, this entry was just \u201cgood\u201d. I felt that there were some missteps that led to a more underwhelming experience than I had hoped to have. \"PK\" takes some getting used to, and I wasn\u2019t really a fan of the mixture of projectile weaponry and jump boosts being a dominant focus. I can still [b] Recommend [/b] it, but I much prefer the OG and its streamlined design.\n\n[h3] Final Verdict: 7/10 (Good) [/h3]\n\n[h2] Specter of Torment [/h2]\n\nThe second expansion turned out to be a delightful resurgence to the quality of the OG. The player takes control of Specter Knight in a prequel to the OG, and there is a lot more emphasis on storytelling and level redesign. I liked the return to melee combat, as well as a new form of traversal. \"SK\" can dash into foes mid-air, allowing for chain attacks to kill multiple enemies or scale certain obstacles. The timing of these jumps was tricky, but they became fluid enough in time. In addition, there's the ability to scale walls for a short time as well as to wall jump. This made for some cool acrobatic segments, and there were only a handful of times where mechanics seemed to frustrate me.\n\nThe level design does what I wished [b] PoS [/b] would have done - revamp the OG levels to suit the new character. Some were changed for \"SK\" to move around easier, and it was a great choice. Besides that, the enemies and bosses are a bit samey, with a few new changes. The best part of this game is the way characters are fleshed out. While \"PK\" is given a bit more character in \u201cPoS\u201d, his humor and quirkiness didn\u2019t quite hit the same tone as \"SK\". There's an emotional story here that both the OG and first expansion sorely lack, and it helps make \"SK\" a unique character. Other than that, there's a new set of upgrades, armors, and set of collectible items. The weapon upgrades were more useful here than in [b] PoS [/b] and did not feel as redundant. The music is still mostly just remixed stuff from the base game, but it's still solid despite being less memorable.\n\nOverall, [b] SoT [/b] was a great bounce back that reached the same level of quality as the OG. There is a nice character redesign, cool tweaks, and a great story here! I can easily [b] Recommend [/b] this expansion if the idea of mid-air attack dashes and wall-climbing sound like cool additions!\n\n[h3] Final Verdict: 9/10 (Excellent) [/h3]\n\n[h2] King of Cards [/h2]\n\nArguably one of the best send-offs any series could ask for, the third expansion manages to bring together nearly all the beloved cast, forward thinking platforming, and charm the series had built up prior to its release - all while adding in a solid card game. King Knight gets his time to shine in a wacky adventure where he attempts to become ruler of all the lands, and many antics ensue. Gameplay here is very brute force compared to other entries - \"SK\" was floaty and bouncy, \"PK\" was reserved and tactical, and \"SK\" was flashy and dexterous. \"KK\u2019s\" focus is using his strength to bash into enemies in the most flamboyant of ways, and it showcases an interesting dynamic of his character in the process - he\u2019s equally capable of showcasing strength yet can quiver in fear and become a momma\u2019s boy at any moment. The gameplay supports his character, which is tricky to perfect in a single title alone, but Yacht Club has proven this time and again. The card game introduced is not perfect, but it's a nice change of pace and adds a rich layer of content. I also enjoyed the smaller but more numerous levels, as it kept the platforming diversity high in the process.\n\nOverall, [b] KoC [/b] is one of the best finales I have ever played and showcases so much of what Yacht Club has learned. I can easily [b] Recommend [/b] it to any platformer fan or card-game fan looking for a fun and humorous adventure!\n\n[h3] Final Verdict: 9/10 (Excellent) [/h3]\n\n[h2] Showdown [/h2]\n\nThe \u201cmeh\u201d entry for me, which is fine because it is sort of an \u201cextra\u201d. It's a fighting game combining various characters and stages throughout the series, and it takes some elements from famous fighting games to provide a decent package.\n\nOverall, the presentation is neat, and the controls are solid, but it's not very compelling. It\u2019s a nice addition but I wouldn\u2019t buy it outside of [b] Treasure Trove [/b].

Here was what I wrote to explain why:\n\n\n\nShovel Knight is another game I heard about years before I played it.  The titular character's blue armor, horned helmet, and curious choice of weapon popped up all over the place.  Just the idea of a video game about a knight on a platforming adventure who uses a shovel as both a weapon and a tool sounds like something straight out of the good old NES days.\n\nOf course, if you want a short summary of why Shovel Knight is so good, just spare a minute and a half to watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktCH_zpEMN4 .  He says it better, and catchier, than I can.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to say that everything about this game is as good as Brentalfloss says.  I'd go so far as to call Shovel Knight \"the next Cave Story\" with how classic, good and influential it is and how it channels the greatness of so many other great games while still having its own identity.  This is a game that feels like it was made by people who grew up loving video games and they wanted to bring back and revitalize their favorites.  I can't think of a single bad thing about it.\n\nBy the time I started playing in late 2016, it had gotten its first expansion, Plague of Shadows, so I moved on to that when I was done with the baseline game (or \"Shovel of Hope\" as it's now called).  Shovel of Hope already set new standards in indie gaming, but Plague of Shadows defines what DLC should be: Adding good things to the base game while also doing its own thing (the fact that it was free if you already owned Shovel Knight is pretty nice too, but I'd have paid money for it).  Getting used to the new gameplay took some time (Plague Knight is practically made for speedrunners, one of which I am not), and from reading comments elsewhere I can tell I'm not the only one with that opinion, but it's not for nothing they usually say that \"it's worth it.\"  The only unfortunate thing about PoS is its acronym, because, pun intended given the alchemical expertise of its protagonist, Plague of Shadows mixes up Shovel of Hope's already winning formula and creates gold from it.\n\nAbout half a year after I finished PoS, the next DLC came out, and when I call Specter of Torment \"DLC\" I mean it's more like a full-on sequel.  All the stages, bosses and music are remixed (and the series so far already had great music, but I just love these remixes).  Specter Knight's mobility gimmicks are easier to get a handle on than Plague Knight's while still being fun to use, and I like his items and upgrades more than Shovel Knight's.  It was even more replayable than the first two thanks to New Game+ mode revamping the gameplay in a big way.  Playing a prequel so I could see how the events of these games got started was also some nice perspective, especially seeing it from the point of view of someone on the bad guys' side even if I now think of Specter Knight as more of a tragic hero than a villain (or at least, as an \"he's not clear-cut good or evil\" character).  The story in general has a darker tone while still retaining a lot of color and humor.  I already expected something fantastic, but Yacht Club gave me more than that; they managed to top themselves and make something even better than the first two games.\n\nIt's also cool that SoT was released with an option to genderswap the main characters in Shovel of Hope, which got me to play it again not only to re-sharpen my platforming skills but also to see what everyone looked like.\n\nFinally, after some delays, at the end of the decade came the final DLC, this time about who was generally considered the weakest of the bad guys (but he was tougher in SoT), enough so that he was more of a practice boss than anything else: King Knight.  I already liked the idea of \"the most disposable bad guy gets to be a main character,\" especially with how high my standards for Shovel Knight were by then.  It's got everything the other games have: Great graphics, sound (especially since it uses both Shovel of Hope and Specter of Torment's tunes), characters and gameplay.  Like Specter of Torment, it's a prequel that does a good job of setting up the main game, and also like all the other expansions, I appreciate how it takes some previously inconsequential (if still likeable) characters and gives them bigger roles.\n\nWorthy of its own section is King of Cards' game-spanning Joustus sidequest/minigame.  When it comes to card games, I tend to either be good or suck at them and to either love or not care for them.  After more initial failures than I have any excuse for, I gave up on it for the rest of my first time through the game, and then I took it more seriously when I went back to do achievement hunting.  It helps that by then I had much better cards and had more room to make (and learn from) mistakes when playing earlier opponents...and gave myself permission to use cheat cards.  Yeah, you can buy ways to cheat at Joustus, and don't feel bad for doing so, at least until you're ready to try to earn the \"become Joustus champion without buying cheats or cards\" achievement.  While Joustus didn't interest me at first, the more I played the more I liked it.  It's a real solid game in and of itself, not like some other card game-related sidequests from other video games (and I know we can all think of at least one).  The rules and strategies are easy to learn with some practice, I liked seeing the themed decks all these characters I've come to love use (not to mention seeing those characters as collectible cards), and lots of new mechanics are introduced as you progress through the game to keep things fresh throughout.  If that's not enough, there's an optional boss fight unlocked from the Joustus sidequest, and it's easily the toughest boss in the series...and when you love a game so much that you want to complete everything it has to offer, Joustus just adds that much more fun and satisfaction to make it all even more worth it.  Joustus warrants plenty of play time on its own, both for the rewards and just for fun, and that's the mark of a great game.\n\nOf course, KoC wasn't the only thing released at the end of the year.  Also released was the \"if I can't be playable in Smash Bros., I'll make my own\" Shovel Knight Showdown.  Much like Smash, it's a great way to wrap things from across the series in one game while still adding new things, especially being able to play as characters we previously couldn't, even if they won't get their own DLCs.  The characters' story modes add some more insight into their motivations and actions in their respective games, even main characters like Shovel Knight himself and a couple of regular enemies that were previously just faceless baddies with no personality beyond a line or two of dialogue in Specter of  Torment, and being able to play as so many characters is a huge treat for fans of the series.  There are only two game modes (three if you include Targets, which can be its whole other level of challenge), but there's a ton of variety in the variant rules those modes can have.\n\nReally, what I said about Shovel of Hope applies to the entire series: It combines the best things about so many games while still having its own identity, it's pure classic, and I can't really think of anything bad to say about it.  How much do I love it?  Shovel of Hope and Plague of Shadows were, if you take them as a combined game (since I played them back to back and SoT hadn't been released yet), only the second game that has achievements for which I've gotten all of them, and I've done the same with Specter of Torment, King of Cards, and Showdown.\n\nI've gotten a lot of, \"Thank you for playing!\" messages in the credits in my time, but rarely have I said, \"You're welcome,\" and meant it as much as I do to your special thank-you message in Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove.", "timestamp_created": 1642867947, "timestamp_updated": 1642867947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108461846": {"recommendationid": "108461846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140214628", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2788, "last_played": 1677244610}, "language": "english", "review": "this new megaman game looks weird but it's fun so that's ok ig", "timestamp_created": 1642774312, "timestamp_updated": 1642774312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108425563": {"recommendationid": "108425563", "author": {"steamid": "76561199119984261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1661721746}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't recommend this game enough.

A tour de force!\n\nIt's also a difficult game. It can be incredibly frustrating, I'm talking like Super Meat Boy, Dark Souls, \"Oh my god I am about to throw my controller across the room\" levels of rage.

detallazo).\nTambien creo que este juego es un claro ejemplo de que los graficos no lo son todo, su dise\u00f1o pixelart encaja perfectamente con el humor de su mundo.\nLos ocho jefes que tiene a lo

Tailor-made levels for him would have been a home run.\n\n[h1]Specter of Torment[/h1]\n\n[b]Positives[/b]\n\n+ Specter Knight's abilities to wall-climb, dash through objects and enemies, and rail-grind are arguably the most fun parts across all of the games.\n+ Great new levels purpose-built for him and his new abilities.\n+ The remixed bosses play great and are arguably better than the originals.\n+ Can still be knocked to his death as per Shovel Knight but has an ability which allows his mana bar to take a big hit to avoid instant death which makes it a little less harsh.\n+ The most fully realised, lean story game of the four.\n\n[h1]King of Cards[/h1]\n\n[b]Positives[/b]\n\n+ Joustus is a fun puzzle card game which isn\u2019t too complicated while still having some depth.\n+ Fun to build up a collection of cards and build the best deck.\n+ Not as fun to control as Specter Knight, but still has unique controls and abilities combined with tailor-made levels.\n+ Great new levels which explore more of the world.\n+ Makes full use of the rich world it has built up to fully enjoy itself in a fun and easy-going plot.\n\n[h1]Showdown[/h1]\n\n[b]Positives[/b]\n\n+ Lots of stages to play on.\n+ Lots of characters to play as and unlock, all faithful to the original game.\n+ Can be good fun with some friends playing locally.\n\n[b]Negatives[/b]\n\n- Characters don\u2019t have that many moves and it\u2019s not particularly deep.\n- No online multiplayer.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nI would rank them: Specter > King > Shovel > Plague > Showdown\n\nOverall this is a fantastic package of games, all of which I would recommend. There\u2019s a fun world to explore here and if you have even a slight retro itch then this will scratch it. That being said, this game isn\u2019t good just because of its obvious retro style - it\u2019s a very well-made 2D platformer regardless and fully-realised.

And some abilities you just don't want to use. But if you are dedicated i'm sure even those abilities can be useful :P Maybe i should go dedicate myself now...

The only real problem I had (aside from my own pure inadequacy) is that while the platforming structure isn't bad, I think it's pretty damn solid, what it lacks is that some checkpoints are WAY too far apart, especially on the last 2 levels (besides Enchanter/Enchantress).

Some would even go as far as calling the game \"ground-breaking\". I also read that that the base game and the Plague DLC are the worst part of the series, that I'll never be able to know.\nI can see it has 96% positive reviews which astonishes me.\n\nFirst off, i'd like to start and say: there's nothing inherently wrong with SK. It's a platformer. It has a lot of charm, soundtrack is a mixed bag, but it has some very good tracks nonetheless, gameplay is also a mixed bag. You have some abilities that are completly broken, and some you wont ever use... because they suck. The combat system is extremly limited too.\n\nAt any rate, you have dozens of hours of gameplay in front of you if you enjoy the game, so it's a good investment. Story is non-existent.\n\nMy problem lies in the fact that the game goes too far in the platforming aspect. I've played Celeste, 100% the game, so I dont mean it's hard. I mean it's tedious. It's boring. It's repetitive. There's also quite a few bullshit section that are die and retry. Find the perfect path, the perfect jump. Some think it's what makes a platformer interesting, and I'd agree. But the game failed to charm me enough to make me want to push through those sections\n\nIn my opinion, there isnt a single groundbreaking thing in Shovel Knight.\nIt's Megaman with a shovel.

Die once, learn from it, and don't die again.\n\nThe precise, detailed, complex, and diverse gameplay of Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is backed by retro style music, and visuals which are clear, and oddly cute.\n\nThe final innovation of Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is the differentiation of the four campaigns. They share themes, mechanics, aesthetics, collectibles, and ideas, but alter, tweak, and adjust them for divergent results. \n\nSimultaneous with King of Cards, Yacht Club Games released Showdown (all of which is included in the Treasure Trove).Showdown includes two game modes; a four person melee, and a short story mode for one or two players. In the story mode the player chooses one of eight starting characters. Each character has their own story. The story mode requires the player to win seven matches, destroy targets in an arena, and fight the final boss.

It\u00b4s quite challenging, but rewarding if you finish a level. Htough the levels stay the same, each character brings a different feel to them.\n\nShovel Knight : \n the original character. His weapon of choice is a shovel, which enabels you not only to swing at your foes, \n but to jump on them.  Though this seems very simple, various gadgets and different approaches in Levels \n make this a very great character to play\n\nPlague Knight: \n a little guy who\u00b4s strenght is jumping around, and throwing bombs. Although his jumping height is the lowest \n of all other characters he has a double jump and the possibility to fexplode himself even higher into the air \n and float. You can customise his bombs to adapt to various situations. \n\nSpecter Knight : \n This one has a scythe. That does not only mean he is cool, he can dash through enemies and some objects \n to get through the levels. He also benefits from gadgets ( different ones from shovel knight though ) but the \n main reason he is great are his dashes. \n\nKing Knight: \n With this Character comes a cardgame within the game. Not only can he dash to enemies and pirrouett from \n / on top of them , but you get to play a card game against varoius foes you\u00b4ve encountered before. Fun to \n platform with and also fun to play the cardgame. \n\nThis is a great platforming game , I\u00b4d highly recogmend it to anyone seeking a challenge and or liking pixel graphics and a retro

I remember looking at the game and thinking, \u201cwait, a knight that has a shovel? That sounds lame, how\u2019s that going to work?\u201d\n\nOh me of little faith, and how I felt it! As I watched youtubers gush over how great the game was, with Quarter Guy being particularly outspoken, I decided, eff it, I\u2019ll give it a shot. I fell in love with the game after just a few levels, and quickly realized that indie games still have a lot to offer the industry, even if they take on an 8-bit appearance. Now what was once a great game is now a phenomenal treasure trove of games, and I\u2019m amped to see what else Yacht Club can come up with.\n\nWith five whole games to talk about, let me go from what I feel are my least to most favorite in that order. Shovel Knight Showdown is technically at the bottom, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad title, far from it. It\u2019s a blast to have a title that lets you play pretty much any knight, or any character you want, and I enjoyed checking out all of them. My only real issue is, if you\u2019ve played Super Smash Bros., Showdown doesn\u2019t have a whole lot else to offer, aside from some story bits. Still, if you\u2019re into the more competitive side of gaming, give this title a try!\n\nShovel Knight: Plague of Shadows comes next, and I was stoked that Plague Knight was one of the three knights selected for extra titles. As a game, I found the story to be quite heartwarming and even rather surprising; love comes in all shapes and sizes, after all. I think out of all of the games, Plague Knight\u2019s set of powers are, to me, the most varied, from unleashing various explosions to summoning purple liquid vats to use as platforms or detonate for damage, among others. The reason I rate this the lowest of the four is simply because I felt like I was jumping in and out of the menu rather frequently, as there were lots of ways to manipulate the basic attack, and certain factors were better in some situations and worse in others; it made the game feel a bit slower than I liked. Still, it was a very fun title that put a clever spin on the not-too-often-used villainous protagonist formula.\n\nKing of Cards comes next, and man, that one made me laugh. Nothing adds life to an already decadent dandy by painting him as an immature momma\u2019s boy who wants to be all powerful and amazing and such. The addition of a card based minigame was a clever way to add a new feature to the title, although I was thankful that it was entirely optional, as I wasn\u2019t very good at it. The decision to make levels more numerous and shorter was a nice touch as well. I never had any issues with the longer levels in the other games, but I liked how they made this game stand out as well. The fact that, to me, King Knight had one of the more difficult control styles was my only real complaint with the game, and even then it wasn\u2019t terrible.\n\nFor my second place, the original Shovel of Hope takes the cake. I was aware of most of the best parts of classic NES games put into the title, and yet even I had no idea how a common attack style from Duck Tales would be so fun to do! This one feels the most well-balanced in terms of gameplay and is a satisfying title to get to, and as such not really having anything to stand out with other than being Shovel Knight is the only negative thought I have about it. Suffice to say, it isn\u2019t my number one favorite, but it\u2019s easy to see how a game with such a simple idea that took successful pages from past classics could go on to become such a monumental triumph in the indie circle.\n\nFinally, Spectre of Torment, or as I\u2019ve heard it to be called, the speedrunner\u2019s favorite of the franchise. What I enjoyed the most about this game wasn\u2019t just the fast-paced nature of the game, the fact that it resembled Mega Man so well, or the crazy fun powers you get, but rather the backstory you get to enjoy. Now I know from the look and feel of the game that the stories are more lighthearted and closer to the background, which is fine by me, but the moments where the game cuts back to the protagonist\u2019s past were the best parts, as it not only gave me an idea as to who Spectre Knight really is, but even how the whole Enchantress\u2019s Tower issue came to light. That, and the noble sacrifice SK makes in the end just makes the whole package that much sweeter. My only real eyeroll I got from the game was the underwhelming final boss.\n\nAesthetic-wise, everything is so good. Between the nostalgic 8-bit graphical style filled with vibrant colors, the strong and somewhat weighty sound effects, and Jake Kaufman\u2019s musical score that is, erm, music to my ears, the visual and auditory work on this collection of games only adds to the enjoyment that this treasure trove provides.\n\nI\u2019ll make it simple: if you or anyone you know likes VIDEO GAMES, play this series of games. The only real negative trait they all share is that they\u2019re all short games, but that only proves why it\u2019s worth getting them all. These are games created by people who knew exactly how new games should be put together. Why more devs don\u2019t give the \u201cbest parts of the past\u201d method a try, I\u2019ll never know.

There\u2019s a lot to talk about since there are, technically, 5 games in it. I will review each game separately, and then add my thoughts about the bundle itself.\n\n[b]Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope[/b] is the main game, the first one released, the one with more care put into, and the basis for all the other games, in a number of ways. As the screenshots suggest, the game is a homage to many NES games. If you like pixel art, and chiptunes, you\u2019ll love the graphics and the music. The controls are also a throwback to these days, almost to a fault. Shovel Knight plays a lot like Link in Zelda 2, while being able to bounce off enemies after a \u201cdownstab\u201d, almost like Scrooge McDuck\u2019s pogo bounce in Duck Tales. \nThere are also relics,  that work exactly like the NES Castlevania sub-weapons, with legally distinct axes and crosses, the same energy system (using potions instead of hearts to refill) and, by default, the same command to activate them (up + attack). You can (and should) change the commando to a single button, though, and you\u2019ll need when/if you get the  dash. The sub-weapons are permanent, though, you\u2019ll need to buy it from a shopper (strangely) hidden in a chest. If you miss him, you can find him at the town after the stage. Either way, you\u2019ll have to buy from him, an even stranger decision.\nThis game uses a map to select its stages, similar to Super Mario Bros 3. There are the main stages, wandering enemies, bonus stages and secret stages. You can revisit stages, if you want to grind money for upgrades, or if you forgot a collectible. It is a bit of a short game, something that can be said about all games, but it\u2019s fun nonetheless. \nThe story is good too, a story of a grieving knight that gave up on adventuring, getting back to save the world from the Enchantress. There\u2019s somber moments, humorous parts and a nice twist. It\u2019s a pretty good game overall.\n\nThe second game is [b]Plague of Shadows[/b]. It\u2019s the only game which you can\u2019t buy separately. There is a reason for that. \nAll games from this package heavily recycle assets from Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope, be graphics, songs, bosses, you name it. But none other is more blatant than this game, since it uses a barely modified map. The secret parts of the game are different, but the main path, hell, even the map is the same.\nThat wouldn't be so bad if Plague Knight was such a terrible character to control. His jump is just terrible, with an abysmal height. He has a double jump, and a chargeable third jump. Sometimes you need these 3 jumps to get into places where Shovel Knight just needed one and a bouce. Worse yet, Plague is incapable of shooting his potions directly forward without a late game optional upgrade. In fact, I don\u2019t think you can shoot forward on air at all, he will always shoot it diagonally down. There are a lot of customization for his potions and his charged jump, which counts as an attack, but they all feel off. You also have different sub-weapons, but they use a energy bar instead of a number system, and you need to find a relic AND the seller to actually have it. \nWhat makes it worse is, since PoS\u2019s stages are mostly reused from Shovel Knight, none the stages aren\u2019t built with Plague\u2019s strange abilities in mind. \nThe story is nice, though. It happens at the same time at Sword of Hope, and details Plague\u2019s own agenda. Very straightforward, but cute. \nFrom what I\u2019ve read, PoS wasn\u2019t very well received at launch by its Kickstart backers, so the next expansion needed to be be very different.\n\n\n[b]Specter of Torment[/b] is a different beast altogether. It\u2019s a dark prequel to the Shovel of Hope story\nSoT graphics are (usually) gloomier, the songs have been remixed, it actually feels like a different game. The story is significantly darker; it follows Specter Knight\u2019s story to recruit 8 knights for the Enchantress and get his life back. The story takes a few turns, and it is very enjoyable, arguably better than Shovel of Hope\u2019s story.\nSpecter\u2019s playing style is interesting: while standing, he uses his scythe to attack. On air, he uses something called Dash Slash; enemies and obstacles will be market with a gash, and you dash directly into it, giving Specter a kind of a double jump. It\u2019s a very interesting gameplay style, and the stages were remodeled to accommodate his moveset. He also has sub-weapons, which you \"buy\" with red skulls, hidden in all stages.\nEven the stage selection is different: You don\u2019t use a map at all, instead there\u2019s a stage selection, almost like Mega Man. In fact, there are even events that happen after a few bosses are defeated, just like later Mega Man/X/Zero games.\nI liked this one a lot, even more than Shovel of Hope.\n\nThe last main campaign of the package is [b]King of Cards[/b]. His gameplay style is very interesting: he uses a shoulder tackle, similar to Wario\u2019s attack, but when it bumps into an enemy, breakable obstacles or most walls, King Knight rebounds into a spinning jump, that works similarly to Super Mario World\u2019s spinning jump. The comparisons with the Mario 2D games don\u2019t stop there, though: We\u2019re back to a map similar to the Mario games, the stages are smaller but more numerous, not all stages finish with a boss battle. Actually, with most of bosses are roaming enemies. \nThe platforming by itself is fun, but that\u2019s not all that is to do in the game. There is a card game. Ther a few stages dedicated to the card game. Winning all matches is not necessary, but winning against every opponent gives you an excellent extra boss, so that\u2019s nice, I guess.\nThe story is what killed it for me. It\u2019s really bad, infuriating in some parts. It\u2019s actually kinda reminiscent of [spoiler]Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith[/spoiler], believe it or not. [spoiler]It\u2019s about a petulant child who really believes he should have absolute power despite being immature and unprepared. That\u2019s the entire joke of game, or at least a set up for a joke that never comes. Instead, the King Knight allies himself with the Enchantress, and betrays every single character he had met, including his mother, that pampered him throughout the campaign[/spoiler]. [spoiler]He even order the Enchantress\u2019 minions to burn the cards, just make sure this story was as pointlessly mean spirited as possible.[/spoiler] I hated it, to the point where I felt I should stop playing the rest of the game altogether.\n\nThat being said, I played a bit of Shovel Knight Showdown. It\u2019s a platform fighting game, but not a very good one. It reuses mechanics and assets from all Shove Knight games. I wish I could say more, but it didn\u2019t grab me, specially after the King of Cards campaign.\n\nAnd that\u2019s Treasure Trove. All games have unlockables, like a sound test and a stupidly hard New Game+, plus small challenges. By themselves, the games are not that strong (specially King of Cards and Showdown), but as a bundle, it\u2019s a strong recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1629586545, "timestamp_updated":

It's a very polished game, with lots of content, great pixel art and an amazing soundtrack. The controls are smooth, the balance is tight, and the game is a complete joy from start to finish. Just keep in mind that this is an actually challenging game with a level of difficulty similar to actual NES games from the 90's, don't expect a chill game to button mash through.\n\n[b]Treasure Trove[/b] is a collection of all four Shovel Knight campaigns, each being roughly 10 hours long. All but [b]Plague of Shadows[/b] can also be [url=https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=Shovel+Knight&developer=Yacht+Club+Games]bought separately[/url] as standalone games.\n\n[h1]Shovel of Hope:[/h1]\nThis is the game that started it all. Think [url=store.steampowered.com/app/237630]DuckTales[/url] meets [url=store.steampowered.com/app/363440]Mega Man[/url]. Shovel Knight has a short range melee attack and when jumping he can point his shovel down allowing him to pogo off enemies or obstacles. During the course of the game he also acquires many relics which are essentially Mega Man style weapons. This is a level based platformer where you have to beat each level (and its boss) in one sitting. There are checkpoints used for respawning but the game only saves after beating a boss. Bosses are honestly not that difficult, especially if you spam items, but the platforming can be very challenging and demanding. Oftentimes you're required to execute a very precise sequence, e.g. pogo off these 3 enemies, then jump on that crumbling block, all the while dodging projectiles, over a pit of spikes. Most of the difficulty comes from the knockback mechanic (think Castlevania on the NES), and unlike the other playable characters Shovel Knight has no air recovery options, if you're hit mid-air you will plummet down and probably die instantly.\n\nHonestly, Shovel is probably overall the weakest campaign in this package, it's a very solid platformer for sure but feels pretty basic compared to the expansions. Which is actually not a bad thing as it already was a pretty high bar.\n\n[h1]Plague of Shadows:[/h1]\nWhen you first start this campaign you might think that Plague Knight's moveset is bizarre and unwieldy and you'll die a few times in the very first level. But, after coming to grips with the controls and getting a few upgrades it actually becomes very, very fun. Plague Knight has an insane amount of mobility, he can launch himself in any direction in mid-air, quickly covering a lot of distance, he can triple jump and float, he can create up to 4 platforms in the air to help him zig-zag around pretty much any obstacle. And his massive arsenal of fully customizable bombs (you can change casing/powder/fuse etc at any time using a hotkey) allows him to easily shred through bosses.\n\nBut ultimately, this was the first expansion pack and it's definitely the most budget one. Plague largely reuses all the same levels and bosses as in Shovel, with only a small number of unique sections added here and there and a couple of new boss fights. It's essentially just a retread but with a higher skill ceiling. The story is lots of fun though, you play as a mad scientist with his own secret lair and minions, and then it turns into a very wholesome romance.\n\n[h1]Specter of Torment:[/h1]\nThis is probably the smoothest game in this collection. Specter Knight has an amazing and easy to learn moveset, he can wall run/jump and dash attack (basically the same as Bash in [url=store.steampowered.com/app/387290]Ori[/url], but you can only do it in two diagonal directions). This works on enemies, projectiles and lamps, when you're below an object you dash through it upwards, and vice versa. Specter Knight also has a large arsenal of \"curios\", including an estus flask like healing item, various projectile attacks, and some more interesting abilities, e.g. creating a clone of himself, slowing down time or even dashing through walls to home onto an enemy. Specter's campaign features all new levels, which are better designed than the base Shovel campaign, both visuals and level design wise. The story is very interesting too, it's a prequel to Shovel, and explains how Specter came to be in service of the Enchantress, how he died and why is he a ghost now.\n\nThe only downside is, Specter is way too strong, and the estus mechanic makes him nigh impossible to kill, since simply hitting any enemy including a boss regenerates his \"mana\" allowing you to spam the estus almost indefinitely. You can face tank and first try every boss fight that doesn't have bottomless pits. And the first armor upgrade allows you to survive spikes and bottomless pits at the cost of some health and mana, further removing challenge.\n\n[h1]King of Cards:[/h1]\nThis is the final and most lavish campaign, which is very fitting for the self-centered buffoon that is King Knight. This is the swan song of the series and the developers tried to put in as many bells and whistles as they could. There's a card game, Joustus, which is its own beast and while it can be ignored completely you might feel left out as the story revolves around it and winning matches is required for unlocking all upgrades. Personally, I didn't have too many problems with the card game, but it can be heavy on RNG, even if you know what you're doing.\n\nAs for the platforming gameplay, King Knight's moveset is small at first, he can dash horizontally and if he hits something (anything really, as long as it's not a cushioned wall), he will bounce back and do a ballerina spin which can be used to pogo on enemies and obstacles. This allows for some interesting and challenging platforming, which becomes even more fun as you unlock his other abilities. With some upgrades King can dash vertically as well, suspend himself in a bubble (allowing you to chain multiple dashes), or unleash a powerful combo with a fire sword easily decimating bosses.\n\nThe production values are much higher than the other campaigns, there are many completely new bosses and locations, and very little is recycled. This time around the game is split into 4 large worlds Super Mario World style, with many levels being optional or available only through secret exits. The story is once again a prequel where we take control of another villainous character, but unlike Plague and Specter there's no subversion here, King Knight is selfish and evil all the way through, which makes his interactions with other characters incredibly hilarious.", "timestamp_created": 1628871079, "timestamp_updated": 1628884852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724395453929901123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97476401": {"recommendationid": "97476401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141711723", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1689352157}, "language": "english", "review": "it good", "timestamp_created": 1628850535, "timestamp_updated": 1628850535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97450421": {"recommendationid": "97450421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136944089", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 199, "playtime_forever": 7266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7266, "last_played": 1577213834}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buen juego", "timestamp_created": 1628812332, "timestamp_updated": 1628812332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97447162": {"recommendationid": "97447162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030593881", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 475, "last_played": 1689169630}, "language": "english", "review": "Even after several expansions, Shovel of Hope is still a playable master piece with a hearth warming story.", "timestamp_created": 1628807466, "timestamp_updated": 1628807466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97405222": {"recommendationid": "97405222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398040820", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 491, "last_played": 1629025107}, "language": "english", "review": "LETS SHOVEL THE GROUND, KNIGHT!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1628756274, "timestamp_updated": 1628756274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97399627": {"recommendationid": "97399627", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087378396", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 1553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 594, "last_played": 1693923967}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, although i did feel some glitches, but none the less its pretty well made and fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1628747873, "timestamp_updated": 1628747873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97349836": {"recommendationid": "97349836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093368378", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 2476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2474, "last_played": 1674809126}, "language": "english", "review": "Shovel Knight Treasure Trove has an absurd amount of content:\n\n-4 full campaigns which on average take 8 hours each (Plague of Shadows has a bunch of rehashed content, but is still worth going through.

The King of Cards DLC even has its own invented card game that was far from a distraction from the main platforming; I thoroughly enjoyed and looked forward to each match in the card game, as it was well designed and fun.\n\nThe music, written by Jake Kaufman, is something I can't describe without resorting to banal verbiage such as \"genius,\" \"masterpiece,\" or \"perfect.\" The all-chiptune composition makes use of the same waveforms as the Famicom's VRC6 sound chip, famously included in Akumajou Densetsu/Castlevania III. This chip represents the full realization of the NES/Famicom's musical aesthetic, in a \"this is how it felt when we were kids playing it\" sort of way. The numerous channels gave Kaufman the flexibility to write some incredible counterpoint and texture into the tracks. Above all, they sound great, they're highly memorable, and they're thematically appropriate for each setting. Think \"Mozart\" levels of \"wow, every single track is excellent and makes it seem like he doesn't even have to try.\"\n\nThe sprite artwork is similarly the full realization of the NES/Famicom's visual style. It almost certainly uses more colors and sprites per scan line (but who's counting?), the aspect is different, and the vertical resolution may be slightly different, but the sizing and relative scale of everything is convincingly Famicom. It has parallax, which very few NES games did, but Shovel Knight sells it. I'd imagine it technically matches the capabilities of the SNES/Super Famicom, but, through and through, the Famicom is the scripture this game drew from. I understand that grand claims over the music may be contentious, but I can't imagine a single other game that nails 4th-gen graphics in the same way Shovel Knight does.\n\nAs for the gameplay... just play the game.

Esta versi\u00f3n, incluye todas las campa\u00f1as de Shovel Knight que se han lanzado desde su lanzamiento y cada una es distinta de las dem\u00e1s en cuanto gameplay e historia se refiere.\n\nShovel of Hope (8/10)\nLa aventura original de Shovel Knight recoge elementos caracter\u00edsticos de los mejores juegos de la NES como el moveset de Ducktales, el mapa de Super Mario Bros 3, el dise\u00f1o de niveles, de personajes y de m\u00fasica de los Mega Man, las paredes ocultas y el sistema de salud de los Castlevania y un largo etc y los junta todos para crear un juegazo. Mi unica queja del juego es que la historia es bastante meh y que los objetos est\u00e1n desbalanceados.\n\nPlague of Shadows (7/10)\nEsta fue la primera campa\u00f1a extra creada para el juego y se nota, Plague Knight tiene un moveset bastante variado ya que es posible customizarlo a tu gusto pero hay un problema con esto, los niveles son exactamente los mismos que los de Shovel of Hope y al estar dise\u00f1ados para Shovel Knight en mente no tienen en cuenta la gran movilidad que tiene Plague Knight en comparaci\u00f3n y con determinadas builds puedes pasarte un nivel entero casi volando y se pierde toda dificultad, a\u00fan as\u00ed, no deja de ser divertido ya que hay m\u00e1s coleccionables que buscar por los niveles, hay muy poca m\u00fasica nueva pero esa poca es bastante buena y la historia y personajes son superiores a Shovel of Hope, haciendo incluso que Plague Knight tenga m\u00e1s personalidad que Shovel Knight. \n\nSpecter of Torment (9/10)\nAqu\u00ed fue donde los creadores se la sacaron muy fuertemente. La movilidad de esta campa\u00f1a es la hostia y la mejor de todas, la historia es bastante chula y mejor que las anteriores, la banda sonora original si bien reh\u00fasa alguna que otra m\u00fasica de Shovel of Hope, en su mayor\u00eda es bastante buena y la originalidad de los niveles y mec\u00e1nicas es bastante creativa, no hay otro juego en el que puedas hacer skate sobre ra\u00edles con una guada\u00f1a. \nMi \u00fanica queja es que es m\u00e1s corta que las otras campa\u00f1as.\n\nKing of Cards (10/10)\nPara mi, esta es la mejor campa\u00f1a de las 4. El gameplay inspirado en los Wario Land es muy bueno, la historia es normalita pero esta bien, se sustituye el patron de niveles que ha habido en las otras campa\u00f1as de nivel muy largo con muchas mec\u00e1nicas con un jefe al final inspirado en los Mega Man por   niveles cortos que giran en torno de una sola mec\u00e1nica y la expanden todo lo que pueden y que adem\u00e1s tienen salidas secretas el cual est\u00e1 insipirado en Super Mario Bros 3 y creo que es mucho mejor as\u00ed ya que incita mucho m\u00e1s a la exploraci\u00f3n de los niveles y es menos tedioso pasar niveles cortos. Pero lo mejor de todo de King of Cards es el nuevo a\u00f1adido que es un juego de cartas llamado Justus, es tan bueno, que a mi que no me gustan los juegos de cartas, me ha viciado bastante. Espero que los desarrolladores hagan alg\u00fan spin-off centrado solo en el Justus porque es un vicio total.\n\n\n\nEsta versi\u00f3n incluye un juego de lucha llamado Showdown pero lo he estado jugando y no me ha llamado la atenci\u00f3n. En general, el juego merece much\u00edsimo la pena y espero con ansias el pr\u00f3ximo juego de Yacht Club Games.\n\nPD: Mona besto waifu", "timestamp_created": 1627925041, "timestamp_updated": 1628146641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96793451": {"recommendationid": "96793451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389683193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1627971413}, "language": "english", "review": "Game l\u1ed3n.", "timestamp_created": 1627883366, "timestamp_updated": 1627883366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96771569": {"recommendationid": "96771569", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100073837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1173, "last_played": 1643171081}, "language": "english", "review": "baby love your game", "timestamp_created": 1627848584, "timestamp_updated": 1627848584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96717272": {"recommendationid": "96717272", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996428329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 746, "last_played": 1599319131}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to start by saying this is *exclusively a review for shovel of hope*. I have played very little of specter of torment and none of the other 2 campaigns. And specter of torment actually fixes my main issue. \n\nFor the most part, Shovel Knight is a great game. It does almost everything right. Unfortunately, I found it extremely frustrating and not very fun due to one simple issue. The controls are just too slow. First of all, I have an extremely high threshold for responsiveness and speed in games. Anything short of Celeste can be frustrating to me. In reality, Shovel of Hope is pretty responsive. But it still often feels like an input can just be too slow. \n\nA lot of the time, the game just throws things at you without them being visible until they've already almost hit you. This, in and of itself, is not a problem, but the shovel is fairly slow, meaning that it's often impossible to react to things. I personally hate being out of control in this way. \n\nA related, though slightly different issue comes down to how many blind spots you have. There is no way to swing up, which means that often flying enemies placed near platforms just straight up cannot be attacked. On flat ground, you could just walk to the side, but on platforms you can't do this often, which can lead to unfair gameplay. \n\nThese issues are ones that will not ruin the experience for most people, but they did for me. Specter of Torment fixes the unresponsive controls issue, so I kind of wish I owned Shovel of Hope on its own to place this review exclusively there.

As the titular hero, you set out across the kingdom to find treasures, overcome obstacles and fight the knights of the Order of No Quarter. The gameplay is quite fine-tuned to suit players overall and has attained a fine difficulty balance.\n\nTreasure Trove also includes other titles that focus on a few other knights, which I played in the story's chronological order. Each of their story modes presents unique features and movesets that act like its own game while sharing the memorable cast and same levels, albeit re-implemented to suit each playable character. King of Cards is quite vast with an optional card game that expands the content while Plague of Shadows features a system that allows you to customize your moves, which took me a while to figure out at first but was well worth overall (with a charming love story to boot). The only pack that didn't stick with me long was Showdown, which is rather arena-based and confined within its own fighting core with nary any story to boot.\n\nThe soundtrack is faithfully chiptune-based, even designed on actual hardware used for 8-bit consoles. The composer manages to make each soundtrack memorable that suits the mood and environment of each level or event; my favorite would be the melancholic and dreamy (duh) tune \"Requiem\".\n\nShovel Knight is a game that is rich with contents and ticks all the boxes required to make an addictive, fun and satisfying game. For that, Treasure Trove justifies its retail value more than set. A must-have for fans of action-platformers and 8-bit classics.", "timestamp_created": 1627049660, "timestamp_updated": 1627049660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96217568": {"recommendationid": "96217568", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962556029", "num_games_owned": 821, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1618883347}, "language": "english", "review": "Play it, it's pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1627011514, "timestamp_updated": 1627011514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96187917": {"recommendationid": "96187917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356450631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2497, "last_played": 1687362423}, "language": "english", "review": "Tight, precise platforming as well as an amazing soundtrack and fun, memorable characters make for a fun and memorable experience from start to finish.

BEST GAME EVER CREATED [/h1]\n   Certainly one of the best games i've ever played in my entire life.\n   A complete experience with five different types of gameplay (6 if you include the card game in the King Knight's dlc), including a fighter game with a Super Smash Bros style. Dozens of missions to play, that will encourage you to learn more and more about the mechanics of the different games inside this pack.\n   I would recomend you start playing the main campaign (shovel knight) first, then Plague's, Specter's and King's campaign as the last one. But you can play however you want.\n   When it comes to talk about difficulty, this game can be a little frustating at times, but I don't think that's a problem, since it feels like a real experience from the 16 bits games era.\n   In my opinion the toughness goes from 0 to 70% in a very good progressive development, starting at Shovel, King, Specter and Plague as the most difficult game of the bunch (one of the best to master aswell), in Plague's campaign you'll have a lot of magic combinations going from fast paced gameplay, speedrun style, to ultra slow with helping spells, creating magic platforms to aid you while getting to the end of the level alive.\n\n[b] T.L.D.R..: \nAWESOME, LARGE CAMPAIGN, LOCAL PVP MODE (Online with steam's remote play), HARD AND A LOT OF FUN!!!

Centering the game around money makes for a good incentive to actually fight the enemies rather than skip past them, but the death mechanic can really screw you over if you end up dying in an awkward spot. This also means you have to keep spending money to avoid that money getting lost -- a penny saved is a penny stuck in a money bag tucked under a platform with no way for you to reach it. The bosses are a ton of fun. I dont really tend to follow stories often in games but the characters seem fun in their own ways and the connection between shovel knight and shield knight is very cute.\n\nPlague of Shadows did not click with me at first -- the weapon is so awkward because the angle you throw it at can never hit any enemies. That was until I learned I was playing the game wrong the entire time. The true way to experience plague of shadows is to craft the most crazy and unique combinations of casings, powder, and fusings. For example, at first I thought the lob casing, cascade powder, and remote fuse were all useless. The lob casing has a terrible angle that couldn't hit an enemy right in front of you, the cascade powder limits you to one bomb and needs to cover distance and is hard to control. The remote fuse also essentially limits you to one bomb. But combine all three of those together ? you get one of the coolest weapons ive ever seen in a game. The lob casing gives the cascade powder the necessary distance and the cascade powder allows the lob casing to hit grounded enemies in front of you. The remote fuse gives the cascade powder the control it needs and it doesnt matter that the remote fuse limits you to one bomb because the cascade powder does that anyways. This all results in a remote death bomb that drops down on enemies at your command. This cool combination isn't going to work for every enemy or boss though, but that only means you get to come up with more clever combinations. Coming up with a new combination of casing powder and fuse for different areas and bosses is so cool and what makes the game fun. Also the characters in this game are so so so so cute.\n\nI haven't gotten too far into specter of torment but it seems pretty fun. Again I'm not very much of a story person but the story does seem to be shaping up to be pretty good. Character controls fun.\n\nHave not started King of Cards but I look forward to it.\n\nOverall, Treasure Trove is a super awesome experience but to be entirely honest I don't think it's worth the 40 dollars. You aren't really paying for 4 games in my opinion you're paying for 4 different versions of the same game. The reimagines are super clever and there are certainly different gameplay elements but I wouldn't recommend spending 40 dollars on one platformer with 4 different characters. But if you catch it on sale for a decent price or money isn't really an issue for you, I would definitely go ahead and buy it. I think every fan of the platforming genre at some point in their life has to play Shovel of Hope though.\n\nAnd yes, the soundtrack is amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1625773098, "timestamp_updated": 1625773098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95283403": {"recommendationid": "95283403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149042884", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2418, "last_played": 1577213516}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically 4 games in one, all connected in the universe.

(i am using an xbox one controller) you also cant dash or sprint by default. there is only one relic you unlock towards the end of the game that requires blue-potion energy to use that lets you dash. but you have to equip it and meanwhile you can't use any other relic abilities. everything is so slow - even the first mario game from 30 years ago is more satisfying to play.\n[*]story and dialogue are so annoying and uninteresting you will skip through all of it.\n[*]almost every room is single screen and transitions are painfully slow breaking the flow of the game constantly.\n[*]enemies respawn behind you even if you don't leave the room.\n[*]levels are designed so you can't backtrack meaning if you forgot to pick up an item you are f\u03bccked.\n[*]there are TONS of basically impossible to obtain achievements in this game with highly unrealistic conditions. be prepared for your average game completion rate on your steam profile to tank hard after playing this game. i think i saw about 20 achievements for playing through the ENTIRE game with different conditions, like not dying, not taking longer than 90 minutes, not spending gold, not using relics, etc. etc. - those are challenges that a player takes on their own willingsness because your game is so good, (e.g. dark souls, castlevania or metroid, or even mario games) not because they are a completionist being forced into them by achievement requirements.\n[*]the game is too hard and too easy at the same time. the gameplay itself is way too easy. you won't ever die fighting enemies even if you are braindead. the only thing posing any challenges are the bossfights on the end of every stage, but even those are most of the time beaten on your first try. you might aswell not even have a health bar. to compensate for this the devs added one-hit-kill pits and spikes in every level causing you to die over and over and over. very frustrating and not fun at all, might as well play catmario or i wanna be the guy. it's like the devs didn't know if they wanted to make a metroidvania or something like super meatboy or celeste. the result is something that takes the worst out of both worlds in my opinion.\n[*]also the game is very very short. the main playthrough took about 5 hours. they fake-increased the playtime by adding 3 more characters to play through the same levels again, just that they somehow control even worse than the main character. also there is a new-game-plus mode where you play through the game AGAIN just a lot harder and even more frustrating. so basically if you just want to finish the game and feel like you didn't miss out on any content you will have to play through the same 15 levels 8 times... LOVELY.\n[*]there is a game mode called \"showdown\" that i don't quite understand. seems like more padding to me. you can also play through the game with a buddy couch-cooping. that makes the game even less fun in my opinion because you are constantly hindering each other while platforming. it does not feel like you are compounding each other at all.\n[*]in summary, in the 20 hours or so i played this game i didn't have fun a single time. the game is either boring or frustrating. i have no idea how it has such high ratings.", "timestamp_created": 1624059829, "timestamp_updated": 1624232037, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.296489536762237549", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93878303": {"recommendationid": "93878303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354329518", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3975, "last_played": 1680836859}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego de plataformas que ofrece una rejugabilidad como pocos, diferentes mec\u00e1nicas y mucha acci\u00f3n, a pesar de que sus historias sean algo clich\u00e9, sus soundtracks son son buenos y el arte del juego es atemporal, lo e jugado cientos de ocasiones y podr\u00eda seguir jugandolo, ademas de poder disfrutar un multijugador en Shovel of Hope.", "timestamp_created": 1623887996, "timestamp_updated": 1623887996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93834963": {"recommendationid": "93834963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365316660", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1587600471}, "language": "english", "review": "good\n", "timestamp_created": 1623816821, "timestamp_updated": 1623816821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93831448": {"recommendationid": "93831448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153645784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2823, "last_played": 1623809732}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it.

An exceptional platformer. Scratch that - four exceptional platformers. You get four games in one with the Treasure Trove, and each plays very differently.\n\nShovel of Hope is platforming on the bleeding edge, just you, your found power ups, and your shovel against the world. No frills to the gameplay with a beautiful execution, excellent and memorable level design, a fantastic soundtrack, and a serviceable and occasionally endearing story. \n\nPlague of Shadows is a Bomberman variant that takes you through remixed versions of SoH's levels. I found this gameplay to be the least entertaining, but the story is by far and away the best one. Plague Knight is so incredibly cute and his quest is interesting and unexpected, with the perfect amount of cheese.\n\nSpecter of Torment is a hack-and-slash platformer variant that I adored - it takes the cake for gameplay in my opinion. It introduced a non-linear mission set up and some additional 'dream' levels, along with an entirely reworked hero. \n\nKing of Cards is a platformer with a card playing mini-game attached. This...was a little odd, though it does help to make this installment stand out as a unique game itself. Featuring a 'choose-your-path' adventure map, shorter and more abundant levels, and the aforementioned card game is fairly entertaining. Probably the weakest in the series, but still a very good platformer.\n\nThese games are very hard, but the developers keep close relations with the speedrunning community, so if you enjoy the rush of blitzing a platformer level that you've done a hundred times before like it's the old Nintendo days, you'll find that rush here.

I've just played it (the whole collection) on the Wii U, that's why my timer shows only 94 minutes as my total play time. I'm basically overdosing in Shovel Knight, so I won't play it for now. But here's what I think of the whole package:\n\n1. Shovel of Hope\nIt's a fantastic game. Certainly could be better, but it's a stellar first entry for the studio. The art is beautiful, the music is great, the atmosphere is also very good. Not much to complain here. The game is fair, a little bit tough to master and overall a great experience.\nScore: 8.5/10\n\n2. Plague of Shadows\nThe first sequel (I don't consider them expansions, extensions or DLC. To me they're sequels) is a little shy design-wise in that many levels are taken straight from the first game, except for an extra little section in each of them. Still, Plague Knight is a chaotic fun mess to control, which gives the game an extra challenge (it takes a bit to get used to, but once you start getting the hang of it, the game flows nicely). Her character development is also much better than Shovel Knight's very basic story. The world they built for Plague Knight within the first game's world is very well made. I recommend this one ONLY if you've played Shovel of Hope.\nScore: 9/10\n\n3. Specter of Torment\nMasterpiece. Their greatest achievement. If they ended the series here I'd totally forgive them. There's absolutely nothing to be critical of here: the level design is their best yet. The revamped levels feel tailor-made to Specter Knight. The music is SO TASTY, the baroque style complements the character so much! Not to mention that many pieces were rearranged to fit Specter Knight better. The story is the deepest out of the whole series (which shouldn't say much, but I consider this to be the one Shovel Knight game with a proper story). The art is gorgeous, their best work out of the first three games. Finally, the whole atmosphere is perfectly built. It's a pity this is the shortest of the campaigns, but WOW did they deliver an excellent game. This is a must play. Get it for full price, on sale, as part of the whole package, as a standalone title, I don't care, just do yourself a favor and play this one!\nScore: 10/10\n\n4. King of Cards\nThe longest game in the package... I almost abandoned the game in the beginning, but I'm so glad I decided to stay! While most of this game feels like a step back from the previous title, they still managed to improve in some areas. Levels are now shorter, but there are also more of them. The overworld is a bit less linear than that of the first two games. Monarch/King Knight isn't half as fun to control as the other characters, in my opinion, but they're still very good. The Joustus game that is the premise of the whole main game is a bit confusing at first, but there is something addicting in its formula. I did end up being Queen of Cards, but it was a bit of a rough road to get there, especially without cheat cards (which are an option - the whole Joustus game is optional). Back to the main game, the absolutely best thing it brings to the table, alongside its sense of humor and world-building, are the graphics. The whole game looks gorgeous, but there is a secret boss battle that looks fantastic. The final boss and the levels leading up to it are also great. But there is a secret area accessed via the third world that is quite possibly the most beautiful art that could be built with the tools they've made this game. I was in awe. It's a truly breathtaking and jaw-dropping little secret. These are the main reasons I loved exploring all of this game's nooks and crannies. It is a rougher ride if you're coming straight from the other three games, especially coming from Specter of Torment, but it's also a worthwhile ride if you decide to stick with it to the end.\nScore: 9/10\n\n5. Shovel Knight Showdown\nThis is the only game in the package that didn't really make me fall in love with it. Part of the reason is that I can only play single-player during the pandemic. But even the single-player story mode didn't feel very good. I ended up not playing through it all, but I'm sure many people would enjoy it greatly.\nScore: 6.5/10\n\nIn the end I only have a minor complaint about the whole package: the Brazilian Portuguese translation felt rushed. I don't know if this is Yacht Club's, the translator's, or everyone's fault, but it surely took away some of the game's charm. Translation isn't an easy feat, and there ARE good solutions, but there are many more bad ones that hurt the final experience. Not to mention that body swap doesn't seem to work in Portuguese (and also not to mention the complete lack of gender neutral options in Portuguese).

One of the tougher achievements that was fun to get is Checkpointless which requires you to destroy the checkpoints in every level you play, forcing you to start over at the beginning of the (Pretty long) level.

Sometimes it felt great and I could flow-state through levels, sometimes hitboxes were inscrutable.\n\nA lot of the game's secrets revolve around smashing open walls, and the game becomes considerably easier the more secrets you unlock, so be prepared to get frustrated if you rush.\n\nIf you're very good at platforming, I suspect speedrunning is pretty fun for each of these games, and if you're more into storytelling than action gameplay, the writing here really isn't that bad. \n\nOverall, I think this is a really safe purchase if you like platformers, but could be super frustrating if you have a negative reaction to instadeath pits, spikes, and precision pogos.", "timestamp_created": 1620533339, "timestamp_updated": 1620533339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91634545": {"recommendationid": "91634545", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999798031", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 942, "last_played": 1636736527}, "language": "english", "review": "I Love Shovel Knight one of bests 8 bit retro game.

Plague Knight is pretty repetitive, gameplay-wise, but the research and upgrade mechanics offset it. \nMy only real complaint is that the level design can be frustratingly bad. Some will brush it off as \"the game's just hard, git gud\" but this isn't a complaint about difficulty. A difficult level has segments that compliment the abilities of the character but still require a significant amount of skill to overcome. A badly designed level will outright sabotage/work against the mechanics that have been put in place, just to artificially boost difficulty. Unfortunately, the level design can lean a bit further towards the latter. Thankfully, this isn't always the case.\nOverall, I enjoy the game. The level design can be frustrating, as said before, but it's not really enough to write the game off completely.

One minor complaint is that there are things for ceartian vearsions wich made me piss off when i first knew about it. But still its good and defnently the first one to play. (9.5/10) \nTIP: None\n\n2-Plauge of shadows: Well.... from what i heard of this DLC, it was sort of the bad one of all the DLC. But hey, dont let the fans tell you what to do; after beating this DLC i managed to master the ''ways of the plauge'' hee hee... Well, complaints for this DLC are none; its just that it gets some getting used to. (8/10) \nTIP: Look for all the chipter coins on the last stages, since the main stages are more fun to re-play.\n\n3-Specter of torment: This DLC is kinda Shovel of hope remixed and re-imaginated. It features good mechanics and a good basic moveset. I think that most people should apreciate the story as well, i mean, the story was good, but not like shovel of hope. It would be nice if some people just would apreciate the story more. (10/10) \nTIP: Most of the red skulls are out of sight, requiering some later items to access, one boss order suggestion would be to have the hover plume before mole knight is done.\n\n4-King of cards: This DLC is kinda one of the best standing between shovel of hope and specter of torment. I get it that the levels are more shorter, but there are soooo much twists and turns thats it kinda makes the game more fun. This is kinda the best last DLC that everyone wanted. And the story is kinda funny and child-ish but thats expected from a teen (or kid idk his age) that just wants to be good at a card game and becomes a usurper at the end. (shut up comment section, everyone knows that he becomes a king at the end). (8.5/10)\nTIP: If you think that youll get someting for exchange out of all the merit medals sorry to tell you this but its just for 100% clompetition stats and nothing else. \n-JOUSTUS: Look.... i get it that most people arent good at card games but give joustus a try, its good and test your abilities to solve problems outside of the main game. Joustus may sound like a way to make a playthough longer, but its acctually a nice change of pace. (69/10)\nTIP: Getting the house champ achivement might help you 100% your joustus library. And for the Hey thats mine achivement, you just need LUCK; you heard me right: YOU HAVE TO BE LUCKY TO GET THIS ACHIEVEMENT.\n\n5-SHOWDOWN: So Yatch club games once sat and thouth: ''HEY! HOW BOUT WE DO A COPY OF SMASH BROTHERS BUT WITH OUR CHARACTERS?'' And thus this DLC is born. Its kinda like smash brothers, but you unlock things as you spend more time battleling your friends or a CPU. Its a nice change of pace from what we know. Some extra characters are in there, with their own movesets. (10/10)\nTIP:\n\nCONCLUSION: Shovel knight treasure trove, is the BEST indie game collection of Yatch club games. Its well made, stands out for tons of people and hey, its worth the investment. Youll surely have a blast with the game. Now we wait till Yatch club is done with DIG, Pocket dungeon Or maybe something entirely new. Whatever the case, I am glad to have this indie GEM as one of my steam games.\n\nP.S: Sorry if my english typing is bad, its my second language.\nEXTRA: How about we make Joustus a REAL card game?", "timestamp_created": 1618616857, "timestamp_updated": 1618616857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90377356": {"recommendationid": "90377356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060409038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1663620753}, "language": "english", "review": "For Shovelry!", "timestamp_created": 1618531120, "timestamp_updated": 1618531120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90374110": {"recommendationid": "90374110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799202808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2304, "last_played": 1624825399}, "language": "english", "review": "very swag", "timestamp_created": 1618525435, "timestamp_updated": 1618525435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90359119": {"recommendationid": "90359119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000829680", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1369, "last_played": 1618632403}, "language": "english", "review": "haha funny man go bonk with shovel", "timestamp_created": 1618504014, "timestamp_updated": 1618504014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90341167": {"recommendationid": "90341167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368730431", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3201, "last_played": 1578059086}, "language": "english", "review": "really good, haven't had this much fun with an indie game for a while, the free dlc is amazing as well", "timestamp_created": 1618478403, "timestamp_updated": 1618478403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90338294": {"recommendationid": "90338294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209414836", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1681615381}, "language": "english", "review": "Game: Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove\nRating: 10/10\nTL:DR: Most underrated addictive game.\nReview: Shovel Knight Treasure Trove is a platformer/combat game, It's a pretty good game with interesting 8bit graphics to make you feel the old times of megaman and such as its inspired by megaman.\nThe soundtrack is well done, you can listen to most of it to vibe, Doing homework, Studying, Takin a break etc.\nThe game has 4 campaigns to play from, starting with:\nSHOVEL OF HOPE\nThe story is also well written, Its about shovel knight and shield knight, As one day shield knight had been gone missing after their adventure to the Tower of Fate, Which lead shovel knight to stop adventuring only to continue again later after a long period due to threat of the Order of the No Quarter, A group made by the enchantress with 8 strong knights that plan to take over everything!\nFirst off, The mechanics and checkpoint systems are pretty good, Its not complicated and pretty simple although it does require a bit of skill and focusing  instead of playing freely.\nThe boss fights are also pretty good, you can beat the campaign in a good 8 hour sitting of fun! If you plan on getting all upgrades/relics/armors It could take a few more hours, But it is fun!\nAfter you beat the game, You get to play New game + which is restarting the campaign but with all your upgrades except that its even harder, Less checkpoints, More damage from enemies, Meals are replaced with bombs!\nIf i were to give a rating to this campaign it would be 8.5/10 because it may not be best due to some reasons. But its great for a first campaign\nPLAGUE OF SHADOWS\nIn this campaign, You play as plague knight, The story is sided with Shovel of Hope's story (same time) and it revolves on plague knight's quest to crafting the ultimate potion\nThe Soundtrack in this campaign is pretty okay, would pick shovel of hope's than this one.\nThe mechanics and upgrade system is pretty good and thought of well! You get to make your own interesting bomb combinations and mixes through upgrades and such.\nI mean what is more interesting than bomb jumping into the air?\nThe story is also pretty well written and funny sometimes which really fits Plague knight's character!\nThe downside of this campaign is its levels are pretty similar to Shovel of Hope's which makes it a lil boring/uninteresting.\nIf i were to give a rating to this campaign it would be 8/10\nSPECTER OF TORMENT\nPlay in this campaign as Specter knight in this awesome prequel to Shovel of Hope, With your quest to hire knights for the Order of the No quarter for the enchantress!\nThe story is probably the best out of the 4 campaigns, Saying so would spoil alot of it, But its pretty perfect. Even has alot of tragedy in it and is unexpected!\nThe mechanics and Upgrade systems are pretty great too, The attack system is good, You get to wall climb etc.\nLevel design is different too, It has all kinds of interesting things\nThe soundtrack is the best out of the 4 here as its basically every Shovel of Hope track but remixed!\nDownside here is probably the content since its the shortest campaign which is pretty sad in my opinion, But i think its enough for its story.\nThe New game + in this one is more challenging too, Your mana and health get fused into one bar aka if you use a spell/curio your health gets reduced too. There is even like a timer, Every second a part of your health/mana bar is reduced which makes it even harder and more challenging to finish the level as quick as you can\nIf i were to give a rating to this campaign it would be 9.9/10\nKING OF CARDS\nPlay in another awesome prequel as King knight on his main journey to become the king of Joustus!\nThe map and content in this campaign is around triple the content in any campaign, There is also a new thing to play called Joustus, which is like its own side story which is basically a cards style game, Its creative too! It has things like King Knights' personality like cheating, stealing cards.. etc.\nThe mechanics are great too! You get to shoulder bash enemies, Spin, Roll\nUpgrades are wide in variety but a bit harder to get this time probably due to levels not paying much money because levels are shorter now.\nThe story is good, But not the best, Its a bit comedic sometimes as there are even new characters like King Knight's Mom and at the same time the story may feel silly/docuhebagy due to King knight's personality (he's an asshole)\nThe New game + for this campaign is actually hard, To use relics you need to pay money, You have less health etc.\nIf i were to rate this campaign i would give it 9/10\n\n\nMeanwhile though since i talked about the 4 campaigns i want to talk about Showdown, a small gamemode thing outside the campaigns, Its a super smash bros like game where you get to play as 16 different characters from Shovel knight and Shield knight to Goldarmors (a basic enemy) Its very fun, Creative, One of the best things in shovel knight treasure trove.\nIts extremely fun i dont even know how to express it!\nFinal things to talk about are the achievements for this game\nThey are sometimes fun, Sometimes tedious, Generally they are fun and feel satisfying but each campaign has painful achievements like speedrunning or checkpointless, If you are picking this game as a completionist, You will have pain. Trust me.\nIts probably just time consuming and skill at the end though\n\n\nI think Shovel knight treasure trove is a pretty worth game for 40$ You have 4 standalone games and a super smash bros like game so, 5 games for 40$ is generous\nTo probably excite you more, There are two spinoffs in the making:\nShovel knight Dig\nShovel knight: Pocket Dungeon\nI hope you liked my review anyways, Dont forget to pick the game up :)", "timestamp_created": 1618472985, "timestamp_updated": 1620229704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

But to be clear, none of these games are bad.\n\n4: King Of Cards\nEven though it introduces a lot, King of cards is definitely my least favorite. I'm not a card game guy. and I cannot fathom how annoying joust can be. But at least it's skippable. The levels are shorter, except there's more of them, and there are some cool and creative ideas in this one. But not the best. But you might like it! Good chance of it.\n\n3: Shovel Of Hope (Shovel Knight)\nAn incredibly solid campaign. A pure adventure that will always be a blast to play. It's challenging, it's a jam. There is nothing wrong with this one\n\n2: Specter Of Torment\nNot only is this one incredibly pretty with visuals, AND extremely inventive with it's gameplay, the story is flawless. You go back and forth between the past and the present, learning about the characters, and why you are where you are. This one is a very impressive game. And not too long. You'll beat this one quick, but It'll be worth it.\n\n1: Plague Of Shadows\nI may be alone on this one, But I think plague of shadows is the best. The story is absolutely adorable, the levels are cool, and you can pull off some CRAZY stuff with the power-ups. I found myself experimenting a bunch with what I could do, which made for even more exciting gameplay. And you can dance. This one alone is a 10/10.\n\nAnyway what are you doing. This is literally 4 games (Plus Showdown) for the price of one.

The core game is already great on it's own, with its challenging levels, fun and creative level design, items and bosses, and even a big potential for speedruning, accompanied of wonderful chiptunes... and then there's the extra content.\n\nPlague of Shadows... is OK. I like Plague Knight and I had fun playing through the campaign, but some elements like the bomb customization don't feel very useful at all, as you'll mostly end up sticking with one combination that you like. Even if it is still good, it's the only one that actually feels like DLC.\n\nSpecter of Torment is incredible and easily my favorite game of them all. The overhaul the game receives is spectacular and Specter Knight himself controls perfectly, plus the idea of having a \"home\" to return to after stages was genius. Hell, I even got invested in the story. Splendid.\n\nFinally, after a bit of delay, we got King of Cards, and as usual, it was a blast to play through. Even though I personally wasn't a fan of the more bite-sized stages, it was more than made up with the fantastic new locations, and of course, the always on point gameplay. Plus, Joustus is simply a delight to play and waste hours on, trying to complete your collection.\n\nYacht Games put all their love and care into this project, and they went out of their way to deliver on everything they promised back when they started their Kickstarter, I admire their dedication to this project and I'm grateful for getting to play it, as I had a big smile on my face during the whole time I was playing this. Its only downside is that Plague of Shadows is a slightly sore thumb in the catalogue, but even then that's only due to how amazing the other games are.

to know why Shovel Knight has appeared as a cameo in basically every indie game ever made, well it's about time you see why. As a 2D platformer, the base game of Shovel Knight is still as amazing as it was when I first played it. Every pixel on the screen exists on screen for a reason - leading to densely designed levels that are constantly testing you and ramping up the challenge in a beautifully gradual way. There's tonnes of secrets to find if you know how to use the enemies to your advantage, one of the best soundtracks in any video game ever, and some very sweet dialogue to pep you up throughout your epic digging journey. I honestly really don't think the 'treasure trove' pack here is quite worth the high asking price considering I don't think the DLC is that great (unless you like replaying the exact same lengthy game over and over again with slightly different controls), but the base game is still as special as it ever was.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606", "timestamp_created":

difficulty to find anything else to play that is remotely close to its amount of content  and level of polish. \nThe love put into this experience bleeds out of every  crack; the sheer creativity never seems to run out. The soundtrack is so good that it justifies the individual tracks' inclusion as in-game collectables. To save anyone the time, that one song that you hope plays in every level you're about to start is called 'Strike the Earth'.\n\nFor the price of $45 Canadian, you get:\n - Four 8-15 hour-long campaigns, each with radically different move sets and mechanics.\n - A fully featured, highly addictive card game, complete with rares to collect.\n - A PvP/PvE mode with unlockable stages, character skins, and a fully-featured randomised \n    campaign/tournament mode.\n - The soundtracks of all four campaigns and an integrated music player.\n - 120 purpose-built challenge stages, 30 for each character move set.\n - New-Game-Plus for all campaigns that introduce gameplay mechanics different from the \n    first playthrough.\n - All non-challenge levels playable in local co-op\n - 100% compatible RGB keyboard support, with colour effects that change depending on \n    stage, completion, and sometimes syncs up directly with the in-game soundtrack\n \nAnd all of it, by God, is without equal.

I am playing the successive campaigns in order, and updating this review as I go. Overall, the Treasure Trove package isn't the cheapest and I wasn't as impressed by the first game as others. That said, there is sufficient quality - and in later campaigns, innovation! - that Shovel Knight definitely deserves a thumbs up.\n\nSHOVEL OF HOPE:\nIt seems to me that the majority of people who were blown away by this game in 2014 (or 2021) simply lacked a \"classical gaming education\" with NES/SNES Mario, Megaman, the original Castlevanias, etc. What's here is all designed competently enough, but it's also all a little derivative of these earlier platformers - and, in my opinion, doesn't match the original experiences. Castlevania's music and whip are still more iconic, Mario's light vibe and less punishing level design are still more approachable, and Megaman's boss order still offers more freedom to the player. SoH is kind of a pastiche of all of these games' ideas (plus Link's downward thrust from Zelda II), and the few modern tweaks (like Dark Souls-esque gold drop at place of death) are imo just grating distractions from the core concept. Re the difficulty: Shovel Knight is neither easy enough to be a fun, relaxing romp (losing gold just absolutely sucks...), nor challenging enough to focus entirely on this aspect (unlike Super Meat Boy and Cuphead, which both do away with distractions and allow quicker replays of difficult platforming and ingenious bosses, respectively). SoH being up for GOTY I find especially confusing, when put up against much more innovative games from 2014 like Alien: Isolation, Divinity Original Sin, Valiant Hearts: The Great War, Child of Light, Hearthstone, Titanfall, Transistor; heck, even Shadow of Mordor and Far Cry 4. Guacamelee came out in 2013, and even that game brought more to the table with a brawler / platformer hybrid approach and unique Luchador theme that I hadn't seen before. Oh well, SoH is still a solid platformer and does provide 6ish hours of fun; so although it is not a masterpiece I can recommend it. \n\nPLAGUE OF SHADOWS:\nAlright, now I'm starting to get the appeal of these games... Plague Knight has one of the coolest character designs out of the Knights, and perhaps with more exposure I am starting to appreciate the graphics in these games more. Scenes like Shovel Knight entering the village in the background while you sneak in via a secret tunnel are a great bit of \"evil\" fun, and there are many such nods to the original game throughout  (trading Chester \"useless\" artifacts from the first game that he will then sell to Shovel Knight also tickles me). Gameplay-wise, I have to admit that Plague of Shadows is a really well-done mixup of the original's concepts: Plague Knight controls in a very innovative way, more floaty but dissimilar to other platformers and much harder to master. Consequently, platforming difficulty is increased but bosses are actually a bit easier this time around, which imo fits into the evil power fantasy. My favorite addition is the ability to customize your bombs and moveset - imo, this adds real depth to the platforming and combat and is a great expansion of the first game. Mixing bomb fuses, casings, and powders also recalls the underappreciated bomb system from Assassin's Creed Revelations, except it is even more impactful in a tight platformer like this. Overall, experiencing Plague Knight has really shifted my opinion of the game - well done.\n\nSPECTER OF TORMENT:\nA little bit shorter and more streamlined than the previous two campaigns, but this one is just a more condensed kind of quality, with less annoyance and breaks in the enjoyment. The way Specter Knight controls, especially with the very fun Rail Mail, is a huge departure from Shovel Knight and Plague Knight. The wall-climbing is classic Ninja Gaiden added to the Shovel Knight pastiche, but the way Specter combines this with the diverse Curios and other abilities feels somehow fresh regardless - much more so than the original Shove Knight campaign. It's worth noting that compared to PoS, SoT is even more of a power trip: I absolutely crushed every boss, and even the platforming was simpler this time. But for this prequel story, with this character, it works for me! Spectre of Torment was the only campaign I thought ended too soon, and had enough depth to its mechanics to warrant many more hours of platforming: this is both a positive and a negative, but with the possibility of New Game+ and challenge runs like beating the game without Curios, I'll lean on the former.\n\nKING OF CARDS:\nIn my opinion, the very best campaign of the lot, and a testament to the progress this team have made as developers since 2014's original Shovel Knight. By this point, the Treasure Trove package had already fully grown on me, and KoC *still* blew me away! Graphics, music, and story are as charming as ever (imo, the peak of the series), but where this campaign truly outshines its predecessors is in the quality and quantity of its gameplay. Firstly, the amount of variety that was squeezed out of a simple shoulder bash move is crazy, and most importantly finally feels like a totally new and unique platforming concept. Breaking up the levels into shorter, digestible sequences with a larger world map was also inspired, and the power creep in Plague of Shadows and Spectre of Torment was finally toned down: King Knight is strong, but challenge is present throughout the game this time like in the original Shovel Knight. Finally, Joustus! This card game not only provides an interesting protagonist motivation in the narrative, but is a very fun, fleshed-out puzzle game in its own right! I liked everything about it: its surprisingly deep tactics, strategic deck-building, and refreshing breaks from platforming were all amazing. King of Cards is Shovel Knight at its most realized version, and feels like the team applying everything they've learned so far to make a truly great game. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nSimply put, the variety of campaigns and gameplay styles on offer here is fantastic. PoS, SoT, and KoC all make innovative and fun tweaks to the original Shovel Knight's platforming, and the final campaign especially is a top-notch champion in the genre. It's pretty incredible that all of this content plus Joustus (plus Showdown!) were free for the original backers. Now that's value, and respect for kickstarters! So despite finding the original 2014 Shovel Knight merely \"good\", I give the full Treasure Trove package a big thumbs up!", "timestamp_created": 1612549161, "timestamp_updated": 1617064149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784137308597564697", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86018040": {"recommendationid": "86018040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059980903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1688317157}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're itching to play a platformer just buy this game already.", "timestamp_created": 1612545889, "timestamp_updated": 1612545889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85993479": {"recommendationid": "85993479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344173430", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 1500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1384, "last_played": 1688838343}, "language": "english", "review": "Shovel Knight is incredible, the game is very very good. \nThe music is great, the artstyle is great, the gameplay is great, the characters are great, everything is great.", "timestamp_created": 1612516778, "timestamp_updated": 1612516778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85981939": {"recommendationid": "85981939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799152647", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 10342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7993, "last_played": 1658822126}, "language": "english", "review": "shovel", "timestamp_created": 1612498570, "timestamp_updated": 1612498570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85942082": {"recommendationid": "85942082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008851805", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1615054623}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n-straightforward game mechanics and gameplay\n-Nice little RPG elements like health, magic and gear upgrades (which are essential of course to manage in later stages)\n-somewhat linear learning curve - at the beginning the game is quite easy, after that not, but everything is doable.\n-fantastic retro music tracks and sound effects\n-fun dialogue\n-lots of great stuff, many game modes/challenges, unlockables etc.\n-good replay value\n\nCons:\n-\"Trial and error\" level design at some settings and instant death traps (although nothing like Spelunky)\n-dropping to pit causes instant death\n     *usually caused by a monster, which nudges you of the ledge.\n-enemies nudge backwards you after contact ;D (it's possible to negate with upgrade)\n-The game can be frustratingly hard in some small sections if you are used to speedrunning through the most platformers.

As you've no doubt seen and heard, Shovel Knight is heavily inspired by the 8-bit platformers of the NES/SNES era and puts its own twist on things, such as light RPG elements involving upgrading your health, changing up your armor for different gameplay effects, and items that you can use for various purposes from a flame wand to an invincibility locket.\n\nSome quality-of-life things are in this package, though. For one thing, each level has a certain number of checkpoints, and a dark souls-esque system exists where instead of losing a life upon death, all of your gold is dropped and must be retrieved, and dying before you retrieve it will mean you lost that gold. As an achievement collector, Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove scratches that itch, with achievements spread across all four campaigns including the versus-based mode, Showdown. Plenty of achievements are seriously tough, too, with ones that involve breaking every checkpoint in the game, not dying once in the entirety of the game, and beating the campaigns without ANY upgrades. That's no joke.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous and the artists at Yacht Club Games have proven themselves as masters of pixel art. Every little sprite from the characters to the backgrounds are beautifully crafted in every way. I really love it. Music can't be understated either; I have it on Spotify and some of those songs are serious earworms.\n\nTreasure Trove comes with FOUR campaigns each focused on different characters, and each character plays very differently. These four campaigns are Shovel of Hope, Plague of Shadows, Specter of Torment, and King of Cards. The fifth isn't really a campaign but more of a 2-player mode with a story mode attached.\n\nThe campaigns, ranked:\n\n- SHOVEL OF HOPE -\n\nWhile the subsequent campaigns are amazing on their own, Shovel of Hope still takes the cake for me thanks to the gameplay of Shovel Knight himself. He's easy to control, his gameplay is classic and fun, and it has the virtue of simply being the game that started it all. The story is engaging, the levels are extremely well-crafted, the bosses are awesome, and the campaign overall is just a masterpiece.\n\n- KING OF CARDS -\n\nKing of Cards comes in second in the list of my favorite campaigns. At first I found King Knight very difficult to get the hang of, having to combine shoulder bashes with indirect aerial hits and a health bar that drained faster than I was used to. However, with more health, vigor, and heirlooms, I quickly began to enjoy playing him just as much, if not more than Shovel Knight at times.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the completely new set of zone maps filled with levels that were slightly shorter and didn't involve bosses at the end, as well as secret exits that opened up more paths on the map. Each map has its own boss, but what's great is that the random adventurers that would pop up to fight you in Shovel of Hope were the bosses from the original campaign.\n\nFinally, a huge (albeit optional) part of King Knight's adventure is the Joustus card game that you're able to play. Although I wasn't interested in it, I didn't mind playing it given its necessity for 100% completion.\n\nKing of Cards is able to stand above Plague of Shadows and Specter of Torment because of its increased originality. It kind of feels like the Plague of Shadows variant of Specter of Torment, with similar levels but an overall more enjoyable experience.\n\n- PLAGUE OF SHADOWS -\n\nBetween the two final knights, I found it easy to put Plague Knight's campaign above Specter Knight's because of Plague Knight's gameplay. Yes, he's very indirect and tricky to maneuver, but given the right bombs and arcana, you can really give yourself the advantage. This advantage is what made playing him so damn fun for me, and I really enjoyed playing an identical campaign as a character that fights from range. Switching up bombs on the fly for maximum effect is fun as hell, and Plague Knight's aesthetic is easily my favorite of the four. Story-wise, however, I wasn't as invested as Specter of Torment.\n\n- SPECTER OF TORMENT -\n\nI want to be clear here: I didn't dislike Specter of Torment. At all. On its own it's absolutely fantastic, and Specter Knight's gameplay and aesthetic is awesome. The campaign itself was great, and the fact that EVERY level was completely original similar to King of Cards made it a very solid campaign. I liked that it built much of the campaign around maneuvering Specter Knight through the levels rather than focusing on combat, giving it an interesting relationship toward platforming. Story-wise, I'd say it even ranks just below Shovel of Hope.\n\nHowever... of the four campaigns, it's my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, Specter Knight's movement tricks were really cool, but his gameplay just wasn't as fun for me as the other's. The campaign was also just too easy, I think. I suppose to an extent I get that, though, as it came right after Plague of Shadows which is considered one of the harder characters to play. However, I enjoyed Plague Knight's gameplay from the get-go, so I actually found it to be kind of a step down when I compared. The Will Skull makes death a difficult thing to achieve.\n\nThe bosses were cool, as they always are, but they were also too damn easy. Specter of Torment feels like a power trip and it was fun as hell but it was the weakest campaign in comparison to me.", "timestamp_created": 1611920240, "timestamp_updated": 1611920240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57411503791809082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85549890": {"recommendationid": "85549890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335252776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1679330569}, "language": "english", "review": "Checkpoint system is a joke.

O resultado \u00e9 um jogo que quando voc\u00ea morre, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pensa \"que jogo sacana!\", mas sim \"ah, entendi... vou tentar de novo\".\n\nA hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 simples e bobinha, mas com lampejos de profundidade e reviravoltas que a deixam muito agrad\u00e1vel. \u00c9 como se voc\u00ea estivesse entrando em um mundo que j\u00e1 tem uma hist\u00f3ria longa, e que por mais clich\u00ea que seja, ainda \u00e9 muito satisfat\u00f3ria. O jogo \u00e9 cheio de um humor leve, que transparece em detalhes sutis, di\u00e1logos breves, e anima\u00e7\u00f5es. Estas anima\u00e7\u00f5es, inclusive, s\u00e3o muito bem feitas. O jogo, apesar de (ou exatamente por ser) pixel-art, tem uma legibilidade fant\u00e1stica, e a escolha de cores, mesmo com uma paleta limitada, \u00e9 sempre feita em prol do jogador. Voc\u00ea nunca fica em d\u00favida sobre o que \u00e9 plano de fundo e o que s\u00e3o elementos que voc\u00ea pode pisar ou interagir.\n\nO jogo foi lan\u00e7ado em uma vers\u00e3o inicial, s\u00f3 com o Shovel Knight, e depois foi expandido pra incluir mais 3 personagens que estavam no jogo original. Pessoalmente, achei o segundo (Plague Knight) confuso e dif\u00edcil de controlar, e o quarto (King Knight) um pouco simplista demais, e com uma mec\u00e2nica de jogo de cartas que n\u00e3o me agradou muito. O terceiro cavaleiro, certamente, foi o que achei mais divertido, perdendo somente para o original. Os dois (Specter Knight e Shovel Knight) parecem muito com o Zero e o Megaman, em termos de estilo e controles (e esquema de cores, vermelho e azul).\n\nJogo fortemente recomendado pra qualquer pessoa remotamente interessada em jogos de plataforma.

"language": "english", "review": "this is literally my favorite platformer.  it's straightforward - just run, jump, and shovel - and you can pull off getting all the collectibles if you are more skilled, or you can skip them and just make it to the end if you arent as good at platforming. to simply complete the game, you dont really need skill - just persistence, honestly, which makes it accessible. my only critiques are 1. movement can on rare occasions be clunky, meaning sometimes it's *just* not as precise as i want it in those extra-tight moments, and 2. the lack of assist mode. i dont think the game is too hard for a casual game, but an assist mode could make the game more accessible to disabled players. more of the good stuff: the art has a cool retro feel but still is unique with fun character and enemy designs. the soundtrack is AMAZING and i literally listen to it casually/outside of game. also, the co-op is so so so fun and is just as balanced as the single player game, and i highly recommend it even if you and your friend arent at equal skill levels. please give shovel knight a try!", "timestamp_created": 1610957022, "timestamp_updated": 1610957022,
