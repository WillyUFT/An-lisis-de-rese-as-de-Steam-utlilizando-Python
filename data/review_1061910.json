WHO CARES. \n\nimagine if in doom at the end of every level you had to interact with notifications telling you what guns you picked up, then put a global leaderboard in your face. wouldnt that be weird? ya, its fucking weird. \n\nthe game is so good though that I will suffer annoying design surrounding everything. the demo made it seem like this would be a much simpler/more straightforward experience. oh and the story is an absolute drag. 5 mins of sitting through errant calibration and boring slow cutscenes with poorly written slow boring voice acting before you get to even play the game. and the first level is CONSTANTLY stopping the action entirely to flash pointless, easily intuited information in front of your face. stop go stop go stop go stop go. jesus fucking christ just let me PLAY THE GAME FOR FUCKS SAKES.

Rhythm battle is a love of mine.  (BPM is great joy.)  However, this game, as strange as it may sound, made their music too good.  Good music has syncopation, a variance to the beat.  (1-2-3-4,1-2-3-4,1-2-ta-3-ta-4,1-2-3-4)  These extra rhythms can throw you off.  This is even more true with the vocals, as lyrics have a rhythm of their own, mandated by the language.  This means you can actually get worse results by getting too into the music and enjoying those complex rhythms.  In a genre where flow state is a key sign of quality, requiring people to disengage from a primary element of the game is... disappointing.\n\nOther things bother me in small ways as well.\nThe grouped spawning and level design means you will sometimes kill the last of group B and turn to find no enemies from group C until you waste several beats looking.  This kills flow.\nIt's short.  I beat the main line with 6 hours playtime and, really, most of that was probably the second to last level.

Even a game like Titanfall 2, which has a notoriously short campaign, will give you 7hours of playtime for $30... and if you were to compare the graphics, gunplay, voice acting & story of this game with Titanfall 2, then Titanfall 2 absolutely obliterates this game... the only aspect where this game is superior, is the music.\n\nCons: [b]#1.[/b] The game freezes when you alt+tab\n[b]#2.[/b] The reload time on some of the guns is 4seconds+\n[b]#3.[/b] You're given zero information regarding the difficulty settings\n[b]#4.[/b] Enemies spawn directly next to you\n[b]#5.[/b] The amount of content is tiny and you can complete the game in 5hours easily, with no replayability.\n[b]#6.[/b] You do 30dmg to an enemy when hitting it off-beat, and 120dmg when on-beat... this essentially forces you to hit all enemies on the beat, ALL the time. Forcing the player to play the game a certain way, or else they suffer a 400% damage decrease is bad. I wouldn't mind it if you dealt 50% less damage when hitting something off-beat, but 400% less damage is just unacceptable. You can play the game with cheats, which disables the off-beat mechanic partially, but that just makes the game feel trivial instead.\n[b]#7.[/b] The environmental detail is poor. It's very obvious that they spunked their entire budget on the music and the character detail (which are both great) and then left nothing for the finer details, like the environment.\n[b]#8.[/b] The regional pricing is terrible and the game is available in ruzzia\n\nThe game isn't bad, but it just doesn't justify a $30 pricetag. When you compare it to similar games like DOOM, Serious Sam, Bulletstorm, Titanfall2, etc. then you realize just how overpriced this game is, because the other games provide far more content (of equal or greater quality) for the same amount of money (DOOM is $10 more & Serious Sam is $10 less). The only thing this game has going for it, is the music, and if you're OK paying $30 for a game that has top-tier music but second-rate gameplay, then have at it... I myself would rather replay Bulletstorm or Titanfall2.\n\nFor more reviews, visit my curator page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7851637/\nFor my full recommended list of games: https://steamcommunity.com/id/lfpg/recommended/", "timestamp_created": 1700291991, "timestamp_updated": 1700292426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.195715904235839844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150303592": {"recommendationid": "150303592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020100855", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 185, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1700567094}, "language": "english", "review": "an absolute blast! worth the effort.\n", "timestamp_created": 1700255378, "timestamp_updated": 1700255378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150301680": {"recommendationid": "150301680", "author": {"steamid": "76561199466546374", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1700373180}, "language": "english", "review": "Banger", "timestamp_created": 1700253171, "timestamp_updated": 1700253171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150260842": {"recommendationid": "150260842", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059463519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 439, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1700570416}, "language": "english", "review": "metal as FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. so good, and get the DLC (but not the Essentials Hits one)", "timestamp_created": 1700197704, "timestamp_updated": 1700197704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150253884": {"recommendationid": "150253884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074325998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 346, "playtime_at_review": 143, "last_played": 1700261190}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm going to stick my microphone into the unknown and make her sing HALLE F**KING LUJAH!! \n\nWhy are you reading my sick, twisted, perverted review?

It's not a bad game, per se, but it has some general flaws that make me think it's not really worth the price of sell as I write this review. I really wanted to like this game, as I really enjoy BPM and the idea of a rhythm fps.\n\nOn a very broad level is that I feel like this game needed two things: more variety of enemies and character skills/abilities to lead the player to use basic strategy to make their way through each level. That being said, I really like the look/aesthetics of the game.\n\nOverall rating: 3.5/10. Absolutely top-tier aesthetics, but average to below-average gameplay on a short game. I feel like I'd rather just buy an album with the songs rather than replay the game lol\n\nTo start off with the good:\n- Amazing music: As others have stated, the music is really quite great. I listen to a lot of metal in the same sort of subgenres, so it really adds to the experience. One small critique I do have the music though is that, while it's amazing, each piece sort of is similar to each other. After you play through it, each song starts to meld together apart from whoever is singing. This could arguably be a result of the same artist writing the instrumental for each + the limitations for the game genre. In any case, great music-- just wish there was a little more variety, but that's being picky.\n- The story/cutscene style. I feel like this game has quite a bit of stylizing to it that I enjoy. It just has a cool atmosphere and some really interesting looks to everything. The VA is limited but satisfying and nicely done. The cutscenes pop.\n\nProblems (from greatest to least, with minor spoilers):\n- The gameplay length: I ran through the game on a mix of 'Beast' (hard) and Goat (medium) difficulty. I beat it in 3.7 hours with some delays due to the game unexpectedly crashing at the end of a level.\n- Re-playability: After beating the game, I don't really see much worth in replaying it unless I am grinding for a highscore on a leaderboard. This goes hand-in-hand with my other issue...\n- A repetitive nature to it: During the early levels, it was more interesting -- I'm unlocking weapons, seeing new enemies, etc.. After some levels pass, I unlock all the weapons, I see an occasional new enemy, but the enemies ended up feeling fairly similar to each other. It ended up just being running around, sponging stray attacks, healing from a mob with a glory kill, rinse/repeat. I wish there were more mechanics to it, i.e. utilizing the dash more, a skill tree, a timed shield needed on certain attacks-- something. For instance, some enemies in BPM have a 'dodge' indicator pop up on screen that requires a dash to be used else almost get surely hit. The enemies in this game I noticed didn't really have a ton of clear indicators of attacks. Especially by the end of game, it felt like unavoidable amounts of bullets (unless you're a Touhou god who can dodge rain drops), and it was just a matter of sponging the least amount to then find a mob/crystal to heal. It didn't feel like a whole lot of skill was needed, just a matter of running around in a circle around the stage whittling down the health of everything piece by piece with whatever weapon. The environment layout made minimal difference for each room. They looked cool visually but there wasn't any particular difference between rooms except for maybe a few rooms that contributed much to the gameplay difficulty or feel. Again, it all came back to just running around in circles/sponging/healing.\n- The boss mechanics: I like the attempt to add progression to the boss moves, but I don't really believe in the execution. To explain, it felt to me sort of like the same boss repeated each time apart from more bullets added to each attack and some sort of gimmick. The gimmick changed up the bosses minimally, and each boss was a predictable knock off some health, defeat some mobs, rinse/repeat. I didn't really feel satisfied from the boss fights. The only boss that was challenging in my opinion was the final, because it felt more like bullet spam on a practically unavoidable level.\n- A bit of enemy clunkiness: This is minor, but I noticed at times occasionally, the enemies mid-fight seemed to pause(?) and not try to attack or face my direction or do anything for a period of time until I started re-attacking them. Maybe I'm just imagining this one, who knows. I also noticed a bit of lag on seemingly a couple weapons (running a 3080 for graphics card) but nothing crazy or influential to gameplay, just a very brief frozen screens.", "timestamp_created": 1699809765, "timestamp_updated": 1699809765, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472131133079528809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149981664": {"recommendationid": "149981664", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015112315", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "playtime_at_review": 704, "last_played": 1699645473}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very fun, I would recommend this game if you like fast-paced FPS games such as doom.", "timestamp_created": 1699767731, "timestamp_updated": 1699767731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149974871": {"recommendationid": "149974871", "author": {"steamid": "76561199150397369", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 312, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1700097109}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1699757225, "timestamp_updated": 1699757225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149974195": {"recommendationid": "149974195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143311570", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1693794205}, "language": "english", "review": "I try and get everyone to play this game.

You have to shoot to the beat of the music or you get penalized... shoot to the beat, while dodging hellfire and claws all the way, so difficulty is twofold: as both a FPS and a rhythm game (so players with 1337 skills might still want to consider before setting the game on top difficulty). As expected, the music is what cynches the experience together and ties it in a neat little bow. Between this game and Valfaris I'm glad metal is still alive and well in the old world. \n\nI haven't played a single game from Funcom I haven't loved (Anarchy Online, TSW, AoC) and this one is not the exception. Play it if you love Doom, play it if you love metal, play it if you love metal.", "timestamp_created": 1699667537, "timestamp_updated": 1699667537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

There is no benefit for changing weapons on the full beat. It's optimal to be switching in between the beats so naturally, you think hit on beat, swap right after. You can't do that since there is no input buffer for this and you have to wait for the half beat, something with no visual indicator nor natural to perform. Not a huge deal, you only lose \"1 beat\" worth of time but is just an example of terrible execution\n- The glory-kill you can do on some enemies expire right before a full beat rather than right after a full beat. Your brain is geared for full beat glory kill and execute and without keeping a mental timer on your head at that exact time which enemy is going to expire right before that perfect beat, you're not going to do a glory kill. This could easily have been changed to removing the glory-kill glow right after the full beat with coyote time for a good beat timing to still execute. \n- The way to keep your combo going is switching to your infinite ammo ranged weapon and fire that rather them promoting perfect beat dashes. There are benefits to perfect beat dashes but they recommended to swap to the infinite ammo ranged to keep the streak.\n- The reloading of the shotgun, which is the only weapon I got, is far less interactive versus BPM. I think full reload is 4 beats but you can hit reload again on the third beat to quicken it, like gears of war. This is a departure from BPM where each beat you have to tap reload again. I much preferred that\n- The interaction with the environment and the dash makes it far more awkward than it was in BPM. BPM there is backtracking so not being able to glide around with perfect dashes would have made that game much worse. Not having that here is less of an issue\n- The soundtrack and beat clarity in BPM was better but that's wholly subjective.", "timestamp_created": 1698891267, "timestamp_updated": 1698891267, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449826985597610474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149340334": {"recommendationid": "149340334", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972967471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1698880289}, "language": "english", "review": "Metal as fvck.", "timestamp_created": 1698880614, "timestamp_updated": 1698880614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547444820404053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149339058": {"recommendationid": "149339058", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972709005", "num_games_owned": 697, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1700264403}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this in the Oct '23 Humble and I love it. great sound track and solid shooting.

Maybe\". dammit.\n\nthe campaign (on \"easy\" AKA \"LAMB\") takes about 2h to complete if you don't do the 'trials' that you unlock as you progress.

Importantly, occasionally the 'beat' of the music can change and this obscures the tempo making shooting on the beat... harder.\n\nThe music is layered - a bassline, a drum, a screaming guitar, and a screaming human, and as your kill multiplyer adds up, if you keep the streak running, these layers are added to the score making it more intense. it's a cool premise, actually.\n\nBUT> There are like 5 enemies, all pretty clearly 'inspired' from other games\nThere are\nGrunts (Zombie things that dance to the beat) funny I'm not sure where these are borrowed from;\nThere are quazimotos that shoot you\nThere are shielded quazimotos that look like the annoying asf shielded guys from the original halo\nThere are behemoths which are literally bile trolls from Vermintide\nThere are Stalkers - which are straight outta L4D\nThe Seraphim - somewhere between Achviles (DOOM16) and Spirit/Maykers from DOOM Eternal\nAnd bosses are generic bat looking things I'm sure they're from something\nOh, final boss is a watered down Icon Of Sin from DOOM ETERNAL\n\nSound is good, music is good, movemnt is good.

If you are interested in the game and it's before November 7th, 2023, consider picking up the game as part of the current monthly bundle.\n\nRocking the devil\u2019s house. \n\nMetal Hellsing is an FPS and a rhythm game.  Players will want to try to shoot, reload, and dash on the beat to build their combo and enhance their damage.  Doing both will also help build up fury.  It\u2019s a fast-paced arena shooter, only enhanced by the music.  With layered musical tracks, each tier of fury brings more of the musical accompaniment, and that pushes players to master the mechanics. I might even say this has better music than Doom, and that\u2019s a high bar. \n\nThat being said, if you don\u2019t have rhythm this is going to be frustratingly hard.  In addition, I think the best part of this game is the music and when I challenged myself when playing on Game Pass, it meant the music wasn\u2019t as good due to the music layering.  However, playing on easy might not be acceptable for other people, but it's what I recommend for novices.  Also, while the game looks great, the bosses all are the same design though a different move set, which was disappointing. \n\nPick this up if you like FPSes and heavy metal.  If you enjoyed BPS this is perfect for you, but even if you didn\u2019t love it, I know I didn\u2019t, this one may still surprise you.  That being said, if you don\u2019t like this type of music, this is an instant pass.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review or want to know what I think of other games in the bundle, check out the full review on or subscribe to my Youtube channel: https://youtu.be/rdJm-7HQysM", "timestamp_created": 1697012238, "timestamp_updated": 1697012238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148011535": {"recommendationid": "148011535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075230153", "num_games_owned": 608, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1683633270}, "language": "english", "review": "The dynamic soundtrack and rhythm based weaponry merge together into an almost trance like symphony of savagery that few games can hope to match.", "timestamp_created": 1697001913, "timestamp_updated": 1697007999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148000867": {"recommendationid": "148000867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113677851", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1696731695}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, hope for the sequel it seems they set up in the ending.

Great soundtrack, amazing music, sound design, and supporting mechanics. Satisfying polished shooting, though engagements often felt too predictable and repetitive. Great feeling weapons except the crossbow seemed lacking. Repetitive boss design was a letdown. Poor protagonist, antagonist, and narrator design... art was technically good but voice and manner were off. The mute protagonist was bland, scrawny, & gender neutral nothing about her screamed metal. The antagonist looked great but sounded like a mother reading bedtime stories to her children, not metal at all. The sound designers should have listened to the growl of female vocalists for inspiration; a heavy metal lord of hell shouldn't sound like the girl next door. The antagonists mewling at the end was also decidedly not metal, did I just beat the lord of hell or queen of the emo girls? The narrator sounded thematically out of place, like he should have been narrating a western or a game called \"Country: Prariesinger\" ...He sounded like a cowboy and not in the \"cowboy from hell\" Pantera kinda way. He sounded so out of place in fact I kept waiting for it to be revealed that he had formerly been a country singer doomed to hell in a \"devil went down to Georgia\" gone wrong kinda way... which would have been a lot cooler... but nope just a jarring design choice.

You won't believe what I've been doing! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udfae\n\n\ud83e\udd18 Sharon: (Looking up from her magazine) What is it now, Ozzy?\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Ozzy: (Waving the game controller) I've been playing this game called Metal Hellsinger, and it's absolutely ****ing insane! \ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udd25\n\n\ud83d\ude0f Sharon: (Curious) Oh, really? Another one of your video games?\n\n\ud83c\udfb8 Ozzy: (Nods enthusiastically) Yeah, but this one's different, Sharon. It's a heavy metal rhythm-based shooter game! \ud83c\udfb8\ud83e\udd16\n\n\ud83e\uddd0 Sharon: (Raises an eyebrow) A rhythm-based shooter? How on earth did you get into that?\n\n\ud83e\udd2a Ozzy: (Chuckles) Well, it's got all this amazing heavy metal music, and I thought, \"Why not give it a try?\" And I'm telling you, it's like being on stage, only with guns and demons! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udd2b\n\n\ud83d\ude06 Sharon: (Skeptical) Guns and demons, Ozzy?\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Ozzy: (Excited) Yeah, it's like being in one of my concerts, but with more firepower! \ud83d\udca5\n\n[Ozzy starts playing the game, and the TV screen shows the intense gameplay.]\n\n\ud83e\udd18 Ozzy: (Concentrating) Look at this, Sharon! I'm shooting demons in time with the music! It's like a bloody heavy metal symphony of destruction! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udfb5\ud83d\udd25\n\n\ud83d\ude02 Sharon: (Laughing) It's a symphony, is it?\n\n\ud83e\udd18 Ozzy: (Nods) A symphony with lots of explosions and growling monsters! \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udc79\n\n[Ozzy's character in the game encounters a particularly nasty demon, and he starts screaming as he frantically shoots at it.]\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Ozzy: (Screaming) Sharon, I'm feeling the power of metal coursing through my veins! \u26a1\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\udd25\n\n[Ozzy's character in the game defeats the demon with a final epic gunshot.]\n\n\ud83d\ude04 Sharon: (Amused) It does look rather intense, Ozzy.\n\n\ud83c\udfae Ozzy: (Excited) And, Sharon, I've got a ****ing brilliant idea! I should be in the game!\n\n\ud83c\udfae Sharon: (Smirking) You want to be a character in Metal Hellsinger?\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Ozzy: (Nods) Absolutely! Imagine me, Ozzy Osbourne, as a demon-slaying hero in the game! They could call me \"Ozzy the Destroyer\" or something like that!\n\n\ud83e\udd29 Sharon: (Chuckling) \"Ozzy the Destroyer,\" huh? Well, it does have a nice ring to it.\n\n\ud83e\udd18 Ozzy: (Serious) I'm not ****ing kidding, Sharon. I could record some exclusive tracks for the game and bring my unique flavor of heavy metal to Metal Hellsinger!\n\n\ud83d\ude01 Sharon: (Smiling) You know what, Ozzy? That might just be the craziest idea you've had in a while. But it's not a bad one.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Ozzy: (Excited) I knew you'd see the ****ing potential, Sharon! I'll call up the developers and tell them to get ready for the Prince of Darkness!\n\n[Ozzy pauses the game and starts dialing the phone.]\n\n\ud83d\ude0f Sharon: (Muttering to herself) Ozzy Osbourne, the demon-slaying video game character.

A game that lives and dies by its metal tracks and the beats they provide. \n\nThere\u2019s not a single fiber of design that doesn\u2019t work towards that same goal. You are playing along to the music. Every action counts. From shooting and reloading, to dashing and jumping. Enemies are less about getting in your way, and all about enabling you to [i]play[/i]. Even the levels themselves, with all their fire and brimstone, pulsate along, rewarding you with exploding crescendos and lyrics that keep building and heightening. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome either. Each of the nine hells you run through feel appropriately paced. There\u2019s a cadence to them, like with any good piece of music. Always with a big baddie or climax at the end -- a final cramped mosh pit full of enemies and blaring projectiles. Always intense.

The rest of the game was not tuned to my liking.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is the checkpoint system, or rather, the lack thereof. Dying to the boss at the end of the stage and getting kicked all the way back to the beginning is so frustrating that I went from hard mode to normal mode around stage 4. I believe the reasoning behind this is for score, but why not just set your score to zero and send you to the start of the last combat encounter if you die? They even do this (kinda) in the normal mode where you can resurrect mid fight twice, but that's just going too far in the other direction as well!\n\nThis void between baby mode and go fuck yourself is really visible with the weapons as well. The crossbow is the best weapon. By far. Slap the upgrade that gives you 2-8 shots for free on it and you become a foot soldier equivalent of an AC-130 gunship. It has high damage, no damage falloff, and a HUGE AoE. You can literally stand still in the last stages of the game (on normal) and it just mows everything down. I really wanted to go back to hard at this point, because piloting that AC-130 in a tense scenario is really fun, but I hated the checkpoint system so much that I could not be bothered. \n\nAlso the shield guy. Fuck the shield guy. \n\nThankfully, the music backing up the gameplay is superb. I am a big metalhead myself, so Serj Tankian being in the game was a huge selling point for me. The song he is in is great, and it is so damn hype.\n\nThe story is pretty mid. Average video game plot. The cutscenes for the story are all animated with tweening, which has always looked horrible to me. They also setup a sequel at the end, because of course. At least the narrator's voice was as smooth as butter. He was the only thing keeping me from skipping the damn cutscenes.\n\nThe music from this game will go in my music playlist, but the difficulty pacing is bad enough for you to not even wishlist this game.", "timestamp_created": 1695695385, "timestamp_updated": 1695765938, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545969367027282715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147033388": {"recommendationid": "147033388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014945740", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1695687764}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is super short and sweet, but definitely worth it.

The concept is simple, yet effective. Shooting in time with the beat deals more damage and builds up a multiplier. Amazing music from masters of the genre, great aesthetics that fit perfectly the metal concept and fluid controls elevate the experience. Yet, after a while it may feel a bit monotonous due to the never evolving gameplay, repetitive enemies and generic boss battles. It's one of the best rhythmic games out there though and if you love headbanging you should give it a try.\n\n\nManometer: 8/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- Great aesthetics. Graphics are a bit bulky, but everything is fantastically designed to fit metal music culture. Hell, demons, fire, horns, everything you would expect is here. It's a bit stereotypical but looks good. 2d cut scenes are nice and artistic too.\n- Amazing melodic death, doom, Gothenburg metal music featuring some masters of the genre. Brutal vocals are awesome and it feels great when they  enter in higher fury levels. There are a lot of tracks and an independent media player to hear them whenever you want.\n- Great, fast paced battles with responsive, fluid controls. Hitting on rhythm is critical affecting your power and various mechanics like combos and fury. Rhythmically killing enemies to a beat is incredibly satisfying.\n- The plot is cool but crampy. The lore though is great evolving nice backstories about the \"Hells\" and its daemons. A well built universe.\n- It's challenging. Each time you finish a chapter the \"Torments\" side levels get unlocked with extra lore and rewards. Harder difficulty levels can give you a hell of a challenge so you have to hit precisely on the beat. Scoring and leaderboards add plenty of replayability.\n- Animations are fast and smooth. Especially those on protagonist's hands look very pleasing.\n- Well written narration with inspiring sense of humor. Narrator's voice is as cool as you would expect for a death metal game.\n- Menus look gorgeous and fit great the overall metal theme.\n- One of few games that make good use of the keyboard's led lights. Great animations that follow the beat and help you perform better.\n- Some extra things like outfits, weapons' skins, art book, music tracks, a media player. Unfortunately most of them are locked behind paid dlcs.\n\nThe bad\n- Battles are great but the gameplay lacks variety and looks like relying solely on the \"hit on beat\" formula. It never evolves or adds new ideas as you proceed. You don't gain skills and you acquire all the weapons pretty quickly. The environment is just a backdrop and each chapter is different only visually. It can get a bit monotonous.\n- Small variation of generic looking enemies. A single new enemy is introduced per chapter, but the rest of them are same through the entire game.\n- Disappointing, anticlimactic boss fights for a game full of epicenes. Essentially it's always the same boring looking boss with some small mechanics alterations. Their attacks feel basic and lack imagination. It doesn't feel rewarding beating them.", "timestamp_created": 1695221890, "timestamp_updated": 1695221890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146626006": {"recommendationid": "146626006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033963808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1695515174}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1695179809, "timestamp_updated": 1695179809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146623796": {"recommendationid": "146623796", "author": {"steamid": "76561199518967622", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 513, "last_played": 1695153553}, "language": "spanish", "review": "A dazzling tapestry of sonorous and devilish brutality, infused with a labyrinthine web of rhythm and chaos that serves as a veritable crucible for the player's skills.

Even if you are on time like a bloody human metronome, the game will say otherwise just to f*ck with you. So when a shooter comes that makes pitch-perfect bpm consistency a fundamental factor of success and progression i'm immediately like \"nah, thanks!\"\nSecond, I've been somewhat disappointed with Doom Eternal and that games' decent but constantly droning and slightly obnoxious djent metal soundtrack wasn't exactly working against that. But when I saw Metal: Hellsinger for 50% off, I decided to not give a damn and try it.\n\nFirst and foremost I have to say: It works. If you like what you see in the trailers, then just get this game because actually playing it is even more fun than you'd expect. For me it was at least as fun, if not slightly more so than Doom Eternal.\n\nThis recommendation has it's obvious limits though:\n#1 You have to like old-school boomer shooters (Doom, Quake, Serious Sam, Painkiller, Bulletstorm, etc.).\n#2 If you don't like metal, the game will p*ss you off.\n#3 It's downright obligatory to have at least a rudimentary feeling for a consistent rhythm. All the songs are in a simple 4/4 measure without any fancy tempo changes or blast beats at 200 bpm, but if you are unable to consistently tap your feed or clap your hands to a 120 bpm metronome then stay away at all costs because you will fail miserably. Believe me, I've been a passionate hobby musician for decades now (guitar for 10 years, bass for close to 20) and even on the lowest difficulty i found this game to be a pretty hefty challenge in the final stages. If you want to git gud at Metal: Hellsinger, you basically have to be a near-perfect multitasker: shooting, reloading, switching weapons and executing your special abilities constantly in line with the beat, all while managing your health- and special attack meters and of course prioritizing the enemy threads and dodging their neverending barrage of attacks. After just a few hours the game will leave you like a thrash metal concert: Sweaty, totally exhausted and with a brain that feels like mashed potatoes.\n\nSpeaking of metal: I like metal, but I'm not a metal uber-fan (a 90s/00s alternative rock shooter would actually be much more my thing). But nevertheless I have to say: The soundtrack in Metal: Hellsinger is absolutely fantastic, and that's not just because of the prominent vocalists (Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Dennis Lyxzen from Refused, Randy Blythe from Lamb of God and Matt Heafy from Trivium just to name the most famous ones). My favorite two tracks are the ones with a Alissa White-Gluz from Arch Enemy and that guy from Soilwork, I mean, those two songs are masterpieces and some of the best metal songs I've heard in a long time.\n\nThe gameplay is basically Doom Eternal, just with the additional twist that you have to do everything in sync with the beat to keep your damage multiplier up or you'll get your ass handed to you. This gameplay mechanic is both Metal: Hellsinger's biggest strength and weakness at the same time. Once you got the hang of it, it becomes second nature and is quite fun, but if there is only the tiniest bit of a framerate drop (or if you are simply rhythmically dyslexic) you will constantly lose your rhythm and that will turn the game into a hard-as-f*ck exercise of frustration.\n\nJust to casually mention the story at the end: It doesn't make much sense and ends on a cliffhanger but at least it's told through pretty cool looking and stylized grafic novel cutscenes.\n\nSo if you find yourself meeting the three requirements mentioned above then chances are you'll be having a damn good time with Metal: Hellsinger. If not, well... then you are obviously not metal enough.\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMETAL: HELLSINGER (Essential Hits Edition)\nGenre: First-Person-Shooter\nRelease: Q3 2022\n\n( ) 0/8 Simply one of the worst games ever made.

Incredibly fun, fast-paced gameplay, phenomenal soundtrack, fantastic visuals, I was hooked immediately. \n\n[h1] Good stuff: [/h1]\n+ Obvious thing out of the way, the soundtrack. As a metalhead, such a soundtrack is highly enjoyable. It SLAPS. It just makes you feel pumped and ready to kill. Each song features a famous metal vocalist and seeing all their names always filled me with excitement to keep playing on.\n\n+ Gameplay feels smooth. Controls are responsive, maps have smooth clipping, no invisible things to get caught on. You have incredible control over your character movements which is essential in such hectic gameplay.\n\n+ The \u201crhythm game\u201d aspect might be a bit hard to get used to at first but once you\u2019re past that initial hurdle, it eventually becomes second nature when you\u2019re in the zone. Getting the sound effects (gunshots, reload) to sync up and play in tandem with the hard hitting music is incredibly satisfying. Even your footsteps always play in time with the music. All the sound design is a huge plus in general.\n\n+ 4 different guns (5 with DLC) that all handle very differently to one another. You\u2019re sure to find your favourites. You are only allowed to take two guns at a time with you into the levels so you have to pick and choose. Bonus levels (Torments) don\u2019t allow you to pick your weapons so you\u2019re forced to have some time with each weapon so you have the chance to learn how to use all of them.\n\n\nAs for the negatives, I really don\u2019t have too much to say. These are far from the most concerning issues but they are still things I'd like to note.\n\n[h1] The less good: [/h1]\n- Lack of the traditional quick-switch button is highly disappointing. It\u2019s such a universally used control in first person shooters so I really wonder why it wasn\u2019t included in this game. There is a button to quick-switch to Paz (a specific weapon) which I do find useful but I don\u2019t see why both controls couldn\u2019t be included as separate bindings. Relying on scrolling or pressing number keys is hella annoying and always risks you switching to the wrong weapon when in a critical situation. Really miss it.\n\n- The game\u2019s performance really dips during high activity moments. The range of fps is quite large, it can drop from a comfortable frame rate really quickly which gets distracting in a first person shooter. It didn\u2019t hinder me too much while playing, but it is something to note if you\u2019re worried about your rig's ability to run this game.\n\n- (Incoming salt) Everything was pretty well balanced up until the final boss. I didn\u2019t die a single time in any of the previous levels during my first playthrough on Goat difficulty. Come to the final boss and it\u2019s an absolute train wreck of a fight, if you can even call it that. It\u2019s a chaotic first person bullet hell. I did manage to beat on my second try (like months later cuz I'm lazy) so it is doable for sure. But it might catch some people off guard if they didn't find the rest of the game as challenging. Yes, it's the final boss. It\u2019s supposed to be challenging. But I expected it to be a little more intuitive than just running and dashing around randomly in hopes of not getting hit. I feel like the main issue is the lack of healing opportunities in the first section of the battle. If you deplete the available health crystals too quickly, you\u2019re kinda on your own. You don\u2019t get the opportunity to slaughter fodder (which also heals you) until much later.\n\n[h1] Bottom line: [/h1]\nI intentionally avoided making comparisons to the Doom series but there is no doubting that they are very similar games. If you enjoy Doom and are interested in adding a little rhythm element to your gameplay, I can pretty much guarantee that you will enjoy this game as well. And for everyone else, there\u2019s a lot of fun to be had in this game. It\u2019s not the longest game, but you\u2019re still sure to get your money\u2019s worth with the 8 - 10 hours you\u2019ll put into completing the campaign, and the all Torment levels.\n\n[h1] Overall: 10/10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1694259163, "timestamp_updated": 1694370356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145953240": {"recommendationid": "145953240", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985165955", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 848, "last_played": 1694232731}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game.

Tambi\u00e9n haber guardado el tremendo temazo de [spoiler] Serj Tankian de System of a Down[/spoiler] para el jefe final, me pareci\u00f3 muy acertado. A nivel de m\u00fasica ya es 10 de 10, todas las canciones del juego son buenas, hay una por nivel, cada nivel es un \"infierno\" por el que debe pasar nuestra protagonista que es una mujer demonio conocida (O no xD) como \"The Unknown\" o \"La Desconocida\".\n\nA nivel de gameplay el juego me recuerda un poco a Doom Eternal pero de ritmo. Requiere cierta habilidad para coordinar bien los movimientos, pero nada del otro mundo para los que est\u00e1n acostumbrados a este tipo de juegos, igual tiene modo f\u00e1cil por si solo quieres disfrutar un rato sin mucho desaf\u00edo, pero en dificultades altas, mantener el ritmo es esencial. Algunos jefes parece que convierten el juego en un Bullet Hell xD\n\nCada infierno del juego tiene una canci\u00f3n diferente, con ritmo diferente y obviamente un BPM diferente, haciendo que las armas disparen m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido o m\u00e1s lento y condicionando tu movimiento tambi\u00e9n ya que debes seguir el ritmo.\n\nEs un crimen que este juego no gan\u00f3 a mejor soundtrack en

The lighting in some areas just seems off in some way and makes it hard to notice enemies at times.\nThe green bug things and stalkers are often very frustrating to deal with, the former because of what feels like extremely janky hitboxes, and the latter because of the constant teleporting that clashes with the rhythm-based shooting. I understand what they were going for with these enemies, but it doesn't work in the context of this game.\nThe bosses consist of repetitive bullet hells and the final boss is especially poorly designed as close range weapons don't even work in its second phase, which I think is a huge oversight.\nThe story is there, but I got tired of the narrator with the cowboy accent pretty quickly and he just narrates for so long without any substance in the writing. I wish there was less focus on the story. \nOther than that, the gameplay is fantastically exhilarating and all the songs are absolute bangers that are stuck in my head.

I think you have to jam something in your head that doesn't make sense for this to click, and I'm just not willing to do so. Map design, enemy placements, firing rate of weapons, and reload pattern/frequency don't jive with what the game is asking of you as the player. I see lots of people playing the game very well, but they are kind of just building their own tempo aside from the music, which seems....not the point?\n\nAs an FPS it's just OK, the guns don't feel all that special and the enemy/environment designs are super limited - so far as I can tell the game literally only has one boss over and over. Game looks nice enough technically but the environments are all very small. The way the story is told via narration is cool, but the story itself is just the minimum to convey why you keep walking through hell shooting the same 5 types of demons over and over. \n\nIt's not a bad game, it's just what they put together doesn't mesh comfortably with the design intention of being a rhythm game - at least that was my experience in about 4 hours of play, I often found myself very annoyed and frustrated. I only had a couple of stages left too, and I think I left the game idling once on the pause menu for a good bit to talk on the phone, so it's a very brief experience as well outside of high score chasing.\n\nIt's just not what I expected based on the trailers and the description.

As a huge metalhead, I was very much looking forward to it and I\u2019m so glad I finally played it now since this game rocks!\n\nI loved the unique story and the awesome animated parts in between to deliver it in a way that made it fresh, engaging, and fun to play. As you keep advancing through levels, you get new weapons as I loved the awesome selection. There is a good variety here with guns, swords, skulls that deal magic, and more.\n\nThis game feels like DOOM meets Darksiders in a super fun and short action-packed FPS adventure in Hell. I loved all the blood, gore, and violence while trying to hit those beats in one of the best metal soundtracks I\u2019ve ever played besides the legendary Brutal Legend way back in the day.\n\nBesides that, there are a few problems with Metal: Hellsinger that annoyed me a bit. The whole \u201ccalibration\u201d definitely takes some getting used to as it was a bit annoying trying to figure out just to hit those beats for maximum points. It took me a while to finally get the metal rhythm down on my keyboard and mouse as it\u2019s probably a lot easier on a controller. I play all my Steam games on KBM so if you have a gaming controller, you\u2019d probably enjoy this game even more since it\u2019ll likely be easier to get the rhythms down that way.\n\nThis game also has some annoying glitches where boss fights or levels will not progress at all even though you cleared everything and are literally stuck. It looks like an enemy is hidden that you can\u2019t kill so it just stays like that. The only way to combat this is to restart the whole level again. This happened to me three times while playing, twice on a regular level and once on a boss which was pretty frustrating.\n\nRegardless, I still had a ton of fun playing Metal: Hellsinger. I felt as if I was a female DOOM Slayer with some fantastic graphics, awesome levels, and just a really surprisingly fun video game. I beat the whole game in a little over 13 hours and if it wasn\u2019t for the final boss needed 4 tries to FINALLY get the rhythm and sequence of the fight down, I probably would have finished it even sooner.\n\nThere is lots of replayability here with leaderboards and torments to jump into besides completing the main story campaign. I thought the ending was great and don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t ruin it for you but I just hope we see more of the Hellsinger in the future.\n\nI give Metal: Hellsinger a 4/5 as I feel it\u2019s definitely worth playing if you love single-player FPS games and even more so if you also love metal. It has an awesome arcade aspect to things with multipliers at the end of everything you do to earn more points which makes things even more addictive to play, especially with the active leaderboards.

The variety of enemies keeps you on your toes, requiring quick reflexes and a good sense of rhythm to triumph over the chaos. And let's not forget the epic boss battles that make you feel like a true metal hero.\n\nThe character progression and customization options add depth to the game, allowing you to tailor your experience and enhance your abilities in ways that suit your playstyle.

Every level is the same and even has the same boss fight at the end.  Could really use some variety.  Now the really big thing is that the whole concept of the game is somewhat flawed. Some songs really have a good audible beats and kick ass others just have no distinct audible rhythm and beat in certain parts. This is fine if you are just listening to the song but it affects the gameplay when you get off beat. So whole game levels are harder just because the song is not as good.  I've played guitar for like 4 years now and im by no means a drummer but certain songs are just better than others gameplay wise because the rhythm is more audible.  Certain song sections i find myself just looking at the on screen promts because the drums are not clearly audible.

One day I was just casually listening to music on YouTube and noticed \u201cStygia feat. Alissa White-Gluz\u201d in the recommendations. Because she is my favorite singer, I immediately checked out the song. I did not find it very memorable but remembered the game and now, almost a year since its release, I finally got my hands on it. Before playing Metal: Hellsinger I actually tried Bullets Per Minute as an earlier installation of rhythm-based FPS\u2026 It irritated me so much that I thought I\u2019m just deaf and disabled for the genre\u2026 Oh, how wrong I was!\n\nGameplay. It\u2019s fiery hot as hell! The game does not have an absurd number of different weapons or sigils (buffing items) but the ones presented are unique enough to let you experiment and create different builds. Though there are only 8 levels, each of them not only looks majestic esthetically but works great as an arena for demon slaughtering. The mechanics are put together so well, that I seriously consider Metal: Hellsinger to be the best rhythm-FPS available for the time this review is published! Even if I try to be nitpicky, I can only come up with two small complaints. The character movement seems a bit too slow compared to Doom Eternal and there are no speed buffs in the game at all. The difficulty gap between medium and hard is a bit too large but this becomes less of a problem the more you play and master your skills. \n\nSoundtrack. It\u2019s a hell let loose! The only way not to enjoy it that I can come up with is if a person is not into heavy music. However, if you are a fan of metal, especially death metal, you will absolutely love this game! Sure, the tracks are not as complex and technical as some metal songs but they are composed just right for a rhythm game where you not only have to push a button on beat but also control the surroundings, evade projectiles, and prioritize the enemies. The songs do not seem very memorable by themselves but when mixed with the gameplay they become absolute bangers! The only serious issue of the soundtrack is that it\u2019s not on Spotify and there is nowhere to buy the full album. Seriously, it\u2019s been a year and the only way to listen to these songs is via Youtube! #ADDTHISTOSPOTIFY #RELEASETHEFULLALBUM #SHUTUPANDTAKEMYMONEY\n\nStory. Hella good! I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s outstanding but it\u2019s not bad. It provides a narrative, it gives you more motivation to finish the game, the cutscenes let you have a break between levels, and the ending even has some plot twists and drama. Overall, the story is not a masterpiece but I enjoyed it more than I expected. \n\nIn conclusion, Metal: Hellsinger is freaking hell of a game! If you are a metalhead \u2013 this is a mustplay! If you like rhythm games or unusual shooters \u2013 you should definitely give it a try! If you are looking for something relaxing with butterflies and flowers and slow-paced gameplay \u2013 this one is not for you!  \n", "timestamp_created": 1692662820, "timestamp_updated": 1692662820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439999967813491821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144744586": {"recommendationid": "144744586", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992282104", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1692577589}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey dudes and dudettes, it's me, a chill '80s Californian rocker, here to shred some truth about \"Metal: Hellsinger.\" \ud83c\udfb8\n\nSo, like, you know I dig hard rock, right?

Game looks nice and has a variaty of weapons, of which i never really got into some, due to the equipment limit. (When i tried them there were fun) The Bossfights sadly are one of the less impressive parts, with the bosses all having the same, slightly altered desgin (exept the final boss), which they make up with each one of them having a different twist to the fight, also it makes sense since you are fighting the same demon each boss fight. To the Music i have to say: I like metal, but i am unsure if there was more than 3 tracks or such in the game because those ones all started to sounf pretty much the same after a while. Also im shit at hearing the rythm so i had to orient myself on the visual indikators which worked a treat! So this game is pretty solid, even without horned Twink main character.

I wasn't very interested at first but tried the demo and fell in love with it. \n\nIn short, PLAY THIS DAMN GAME!", "timestamp_created": 1691323006, "timestamp_updated": 1691323006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143515098": {"recommendationid": "143515098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279395739", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1691244452}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't even finish the game because it keeps crashing on the second to last level\n", "timestamp_created": 1691320785, "timestamp_updated": 1691320785, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143506202": {"recommendationid": "143506202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452520333", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 348, "last_played": 1698996871}, "language": "english", "review": "Whether you like metal or not I highly recommend checking this game out.

The demo helped me figure out if I actually wanted this game. The game does feel short and I wish it was longer, with 3 \"mini levels\" on each of the main ones. The game may seem long at first but once you get used to it, it's easy to breeze past the levels. Regardless I still enjoy the game, stuff like endless mode would be fun to have here.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add, those wondering why you only hear instrumentals for the most part, the songs for the game (the ones where you can play while streaming) you have to keep getting kills and reach 16 streaks to get the vocals.

En cada misi\u00f3n habr\u00e1 un tema principal con diferente tempo y a partir de ah\u00ed deberemos encajar los disparos, recargas y combos en ese ritmo, contra m\u00e1s sigamos el ritmo mejor ser\u00e1 la experiencia. Dispondremos de diferentes armas, escopeta, doble pistola, arco explosivo, hachas, una espada y una \"calavera pistola\", cada una tiene un tiempo de disparo y recarga y deberemos ir acomodando dichos tempos a las diferentes canciones. Deberemos ir completando infiernos (que act\u00faan a modo de fase) y a su vez, cuando los finalicemos podremos hacer 3 desaf\u00edos por cada infierno (llamados tormentos). \nEn cuanto a la jugabilidad me parece exquisita, han sabido combinar perfectamente las canciones con la t\u00e9cnica de disparo con las diferentes armas y movimientos. \n\nYendo ya a la \"experiencia\" en si, considero que es un juego expresamente hecho para los que amamos el metal, y cuando he estado jugando me lo he tomado como si me quisiera poner un \u00e1lbum de un grupo (\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1y que grupos!!!) pero con un fondo interactivo, en este caso el pretexto de estar jugando a un shooter, pero NO, esto no es un DOOM por lo que para aquellos esperen encontrar una experiencia similar, no va a ser el caso, ya que aunque la base del mismo sea muy parecido (un shooter endiablado; nunca mejor dicho) el trasfondo de los mismos es completamente diferente, Metall Hellsinger es un juego musical y DOOM es un juego de tiros con metal de fondo. Como puntos negativos (aunque comprensible por no ser un triple A) el juego, si eres h\u00e1bil, se hace muy corto (apenas llega a las 8h), los enemigos son bastante repetitivos y hay muy pocos diferentes y los enfrentamientos contra los jefes de casa fase (excepto el \u00faltimo) son todos exactamente iguales, literalmente hablando. \n\nEn definitiva, si eres un terco metalero como es mi caso o quieres adentrarte como ne\u00f3fito en el metal, Metall Hellsinger te lo va a poner f\u00e1cil y lo vas a disfrutar, si lo que buscas es un shooter fren\u00e9tico probablemente encuentres una decepci\u00f3n en \u00e9l, ya que a pese ser fren\u00e9tico, como ya he mencionado anteriormente, el juego se basa en disfrutar de la m\u00fasica y en seguir una jugabilidad concreta. \n\n*Como mel\u00f3mano he de decir que los artistas escogidos para el videojuego (Serj Tankian, Matt Heaffy  etc...) han sido un claro acierto, y los temas que han compuesto son (a mi parecer) exquisitos.",

The characters are pretty good and fitting too, but nothing too serious.\nAlso here's a tutorial that helps you set negative audio latency that some people struggle with, might save you some headache: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9qQO67oilE", "timestamp_created": 1691002162, "timestamp_updated": 1691002162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143277568": {"recommendationid": "143277568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145169441", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1691002004}, "language": "english", "review": "lovely", "timestamp_created": 1691002037, "timestamp_updated": 1691002037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143266567": {"recommendationid": "143266567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826052922", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1696874161}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a simple man\nI like metal\nI like fps\nI like this game", "timestamp_created": 1690989599, "timestamp_updated": 1690989599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143262747": {"recommendationid": "143262747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198935948737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1699159679}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, music-10/10, way better than bpm apart from the fact that you can shoot off beat.", "timestamp_created": 1690985171, "timestamp_updated": 1691230447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143246961": {"recommendationid": "143246961", "author": {"steamid": "76561199280800015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1699137274}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is most certainly awesome.

Crazy, I know. The music also is banger after banger. I'm not even the biggest metal head, but I think I would give this metal head. My only issue with it is the cutscenes, which seem somewhat hastily made. You can tell they did some wallpaper engine auto animation on these. I imagine this is because the fantastic gameplay was the primary focus. Mostly though, this game is very satisfying to play. I would recommend it to anyone who has a device that can run it.

Did you know bpm came first in the equation here? Bpm is also strait up better game than this. So this game litterally copied, sorry, was REALLY inspired by bpm (fps doomlike rythm game in hell) but also has some HUGE bugs that kills some of the good ideas it has, for example the fast reload. Pretty good idea on the surface until you realise that it dosn't work more time that it does. Also the game has 8 levels. Bro really. \n\nSecondly, it tries to be a doom like fps. Cool. The only thing is that you cannot sprint (only dash but you cant fire when you dash) Maby it was not shown in the tutorial or i missed it but i'm pretty sure that's not the case. the combo depleats way to fast and there's not enough ennemy to keep it at max, so you'll hear the full song for like 3 second and return to intrumental. So the gameplay feels slow and unrefined.\n\nFinally, I want to share some of my other criticisms about the game. the torments are like little minigames, pretty boring not intresting nor replayable, very forgettable. The bosses. WOW these are like the most boring and dissapointing bosses of all time. I'm at the third boss now and it's a reskin of the first AND second boss!?! Like WTF!?! these are also not fun just immense punching bag and of course they're all spawner bosses. The worst kind of boss possible. Also, I know this is a standart for rythm game to have strict timing. But trust me when I say this I played a lot of rythm games and this one, even on the normal difficulty, has some of the most strict timing i've ever seen. I'm supposed to be pretty good at this! Also, the game is far too easy. I'ts like child play. I died like two times in my playthrough so far and you can just resurect to respawn at full hp. I dont want to replay through the game with a higher difficulty setting because the ennemys just takes 2x the time to kill so it's just more slow and frustrating.\n\nPositives :\nThe songs are great tho (even if you will never hear it more than 5 seconds, its on yt) the character designs are ok apart from the main character who is pretty good, it has some personality, and yeah I will come back here if it feels necessary.\n\nYou only buy this if you prefer a game with better graphics and easy as fuck, if it does not matter to you, just go play Bullets per minutes.", "timestamp_created": 1690946660, "timestamp_updated": 1690946660, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48885539174079895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143236212": {"recommendationid": "143236212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051497667", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1690940768}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta bueno es un doom ritmico...", "timestamp_created": 1690940928, "timestamp_updated": 1690940928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143234088": {"recommendationid": "143234088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132156475", "num_games_owned": 821, "num_reviews": 194, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1691449801}, "language": "english", "review": "DIABOLICAL", "timestamp_created": 1690937234, "timestamp_updated": 1690937234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479377955198287964", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143229544": {"recommendationid": "143229544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088574666", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 549, "last_played": 1691066680}, "language": "english", "review": "If Doom was a metal concert.

It does the rhythm shooter angle so much better than this. It does it so much better I even have a list.\n\n1. You cannot fire on half-beats. This is by far the biggest mistake this game makes. By counting half-beats, BPM feels like it has a faster pace and makes it more forgiving as you can just hop right back into the beat instead of having to wait and ultimately missing it. BPM even counts quarter beats at some points depending on your equipment.\n2. Reloading feels much slower than BPM because you only need to hit the reload button once. In BPM, you MUST hit the reload button multiple times (more or less depending on the gun) in order to complete the reload. In this you just hit it once on the beat and you can't fire for a couple beats until your character is done. It does allow you to hit it a second time to make it go by faster, but that doesn't excuse it.\n3. You can still shoot off-beat, albeit with little to no damage. It's good that it does almost no damage, but simply being able to fire off-beat at all will cause the player to make more mistakes, as instead of frantically trying to get back on-beat you just wait until your slight difference in beat catches up.\n4. The music is MUCH worse from a rhythm standpoint. I did not say it's bad, it's pretty good all things considered, but it did not have as strong a base as BPM's. In BPM, I could count every beat by the song alone no matter the situation. In this, I often lose track of the beat because the game is too busy screaming into my ears and playing guitar riffs (not like I'd find the beat anyway when the drums are going so fast). I'll also add that the enemies not attacking on-beat makes this even worse because I can't follow their actions to get on-beat either.\n5. The beat tracker is sometimes hard to read. This may just be me being stupid, but I find the beat tracker to be way too busy. It shows the shadow of my shots so I know how far off I was, but it just ends up confusing me due to their size and length. BPM did it right by making it so that the beat tracker just turns red and continues if I make a mistake. It's so much simpler and easy to read.\n6. The narrator can be annoying sometimes. This isn't related to gameplay, but I find narrators interrupting the game to tell me exactly what the character is thinking instead of what I think she's thinking is just a dumb decision. There's a moment in the second level when a mysterious monster flees behind a corner. I thought to myself \"I wonder what that was, guess I'll follow it to find out\", and then the narrator chimed in to tell me the exact thing I was thinking. Just let me think for the character please.\n7. BPM has much more varied gameplay. It has many different characters and difficulties to pick from, and adds their own challenges that change how you have to play. Hellsinger does nothing of the sort, but I guess that might just be because BPM is a roguelike. At least you can start with different loadouts.\n8. I could tell that from a pure enemy and level design standpoint that this game is easier than BPM. This game has a long tutorial that explains super simple mechanics (for a person that's played rhythm games and shooter games before), and BPM has no tutorial at all outside a practice mode. Most of the difficulty comes from how frustrating the controls are compared to BPM for all the reasons listed above. I died within 5 minutes in BPM, and soon got good enough to beat the next couple of bosses within 15-ish minutes. I got through two stages without dying in Hellsinger, and I didn't improve by playing these stages.\n\nThis does not mean the game is without its perks though. Here's a couple I could think of in the small span I'm writing this.\n1. The inclusion of melee weapons is such a no-brainer I'm surprised BPM didn't include it at all. I'd prefer if it was bound to a single key like borderlands, but this works perfectly fine.\n2. The weapons are pretty nice. I always like dual-wielded revolvers and was pleasantly surprised to see them in the trailer and game. I'm sure there's many more interesting weapons later in the game that I didn't get to see.\n3. It's nice that it has an actual story. BPM never even attempted at a plotline. You just go through a dungeon and kill a dragon. I especially like the narrator's voice, even though he often rudely interrupts the gameplay so I can hear what the character's thinking. If the voice was confined to just cutscenes it would make it much more tolerable.\n4. The graphics are much more refined than BPM's. Obviously this is due to the game's budget and the it looks much better, but I don't think it feels as inspired as BPM's. BPM's graphics are very stylized with it's cell-shaded high-saturated look. Hellsinger's looks much better, but it mostly feels like a rehash of doom. This isn't helped by it being a journey through hell.\n5. The player character is much cooler looking than most of the valkyries in BPM. I'm a bit of a sucker for demonic character design and this character really hits that for me. Still not as good as Gery though, nothing is.\n\nI will say that this is not a bad game. As much as I rag on it, I think it's a worthwhile game for many to play seeing it's a much more mainstream approach to a rhythm shooter. I mostly criticize all this because I think BPM is more worth your time than this because of it's much more fun gameplay and better-integrated rhythm mechanics. In some ways this feels like the comparison between Doom Eternal and Ultrakill. Ultrakill is a much more fast-paced and skill oriented shooter than Doom, and BPM is a much more fast-paced and skill oriented rhythm shooter than Hellsinger.

It's also quite frustrating that the hardest available difficulty is essentially perma-death, and sends you back to the beginning of the stage after a single failure. I really liked the challenge of this mode, but when I had to redo an entire level, it made the game's general repetition feel much more noticeable. I don't really understand the point of only equipping a couple weapons and not allowing quick-swapping through the entire arsenal, I would have loved to have the skull, sword, shotgun, pistols, \"rocket launcher\" etc. all at the same time like some other FPS titles.\n\nThe rhythm elements are great, and I really felt myself getting into the groove when soaring (dash + jump) over enemies and rocket-jumping. Here's a tip - unlock Ghost Rounds (free ammo for the first few shots after changing weapons) and quick-swap between the shotgun and \"rocket launcher\" as much as you can, that was a lot of fun. The extra challenges are great for teaching some of the more advanced mechanics, although some of the later ones are a bit too strict and made me lose my patience. I was going to complete all of them, but gave up on the last few because it wasn't worth wasting my time. I also lowered the difficulty onto Medium for the last two levels because I just wanted the game to be over already, instead of restarting from the beginning after one annoying death.\n\nAgain - it was good!

It would be interesting to see the rhythm meter following the songs fully.\n\nOverall, an amazing game and an even more amazing soundtrack. \n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1689965604, "timestamp_updated": 1689965604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142540549": {"recommendationid": "142540549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126294605", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1577, "last_played": 1689964477}, "language": "english", "review": "Sick game with an even better soundtrack to listen to while you slay demons to the beat.Nothing better I could ask for!", "timestamp_created": 1689964711, "timestamp_updated": 1689964711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142527909": {"recommendationid": "142527909", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092663249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 859, "last_played": 1689635767}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played this all the way through now and the story was great.

However, songs tend to all into a samey-ness with their style. It is a little disappointing that they didn't experiment with different sub-genres, but it's understandable as different tempos could be more difficult to play with. That being said, the guest vocalists create a killer cast that frankly is impressive for a studio of this caliber.\n\nAesthetic:\nThe style of this game reeks of DOOM influence, but not to its detriment. It feels different enough from its influences that it doesn't feel like a rip-off of any of them. It does play more heavily into the underworld theme than the metal theme, with references to both the Christian and Greek mythological afterlife.\n\nGame-play:\nThe game-play feels passable, however the calibration felt off when I tried to use the in-game helper. While movement is not limited to the beat, for any reasonable amount of success in combat, all attacks are on the beat. While there is an accessibility option concerning this requirement, I feel that it goes a bit too far off to still keep the rhythm element intact. However, all of the weapons feel good to fire, even if their power doesn't quite match.\n\nUnfortunately, my praise ends here. I have a few gripes with the game as a whole.\n\nBalance:\nUnfortunately, there is a dominant strategy of using the Vulkan with the Ghost Ammo Sigil, leading to next to infinite ammo for a very strong weapon by just swapping weapons before Ghost Ammo runs out. This doesn't trivialize any content, but it does make it significantly easier.\n\nMovement:\nThe movement in this game feels just a bit too slow for the speed that this game asks of you. The walking speed is sluggish, asking you to dash to move around with any amount of speed. However, dashing from the ground into the air depletes that dash, meaning that you cannot dash again until you touch the ground, which can easily eat an input if you aren't careful. The jump has a good height, but is way too floaty which leaves you awkwardly floating into attack more often than not.\n\nDifficulty:\nBecause of the movement, you will more often than not eat attacks that would otherwise be avoidable if you hadn't jumped 3 seconds ago. Additionally, as you get into the higher difficulty, the enemies become bullet-sponges taking far too many shots to bring down.\n\nOverall jank:\nBesides the listed issues above, there are also soft-locks that you can randomly run into, issues with enemies in unreachable areas, and other issues upon launching the game. There exists a list in the Steam forums detailing possible fixes for some of these issues, however, one of the level bosses has been broken for months with seemingly no impending fix from the devs. If this soft-lock happens to you, you will have to repeat 15-25 minutes of game-play going through the entire level again to fight a boss that remained invincible due to you doing any number of things during their fight.\n\nOverall, while I enjoyed my time with the game, it slowly soured as the cracks became more and more apparent. I cannot stress enough to purchase this game on sale. I was able to complete the campaign and side-challenges in under 10 hours. Additionally, there are hidden collectibles hidden in each level on each difficulty that you can collect for cosmetic rewards that I did not complete. In total, I found 3 of the 32 in game. Unless you are a fan of all 3 fandoms that this game is trying to appeal to, I cannot recommend this game to you, despite the fun that I had with it. Perhaps if the devs showed more love to the game with bug fixes and a rebalance, my opinion would be more positive. However, in its current state, I cannot recommend Metal: Hellsinger to the common buyer. I truly hope that in the future, my opinion will change as there is a great game underneath it all.", "timestamp_created": 1689813930, "timestamp_updated": 1689813930, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142436489": {"recommendationid": "142436489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198971574480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1691174858}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is short and enjoyable\nSoundtrack is great in my opinion well matched with climate of the game", "timestamp_created": 1689810804, "timestamp_updated": 1689810804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142435460": {"recommendationid": "142435460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041587772", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1689944018}, "language": "english", "review": "It's short but sweet.

Of course, spoilers ahead.\n\nWhile this is a fully developed game, with enemies, story, weapon variety, skills, etc. etc., it kind of feels like you are getting more of a digital album. Why? Because the game felt short, but it does have a lot of replayability if you would like to go for better and higher scores. The gameplay and fighting enemies is also made in the style of Doom (but on rhythm!), with levels split in either stages where you fight multiple waves of enemies, either transitioning passages so you can get to the next multiple wave stage.\n\nThe bosses were at first interesting, but they rapidly became boring in design as they only feature one type of design which is modified in every of the next stages, the last stage being special because the final boss is, well, different.\n\nAs for the music, hats down, it must be one of the games with the best music available right now on Steam, if you are into this type of music, of course.\n\nTo summarize everything:\n\nPROS\n-> spectacular OST\n-> on beat gameplay mechanics feel really well done\n-> adjustable difficulty\n-> performing everything on rhythm feels really, really good\n-> replayability (only if you are into scoring more points than on previous runs)\n\nCONS\n-> game feels way too short if not interested in game score (takes about 6 hours together with all the torments, only 8 levels without tutorial)\n-> boss design is lacking (visually it's almost the same boss everytime; gameplay wise, every boss just adds another kind of mechanic to make the fight harder)\n-> enemy variety is also very, very limited (there are normal enemies, and the elite variant of some of the enemies)\n\nADDITIONAL INFO\n-> if you go for all achievements, it shouldn't take too much time considering you can finish the game on any kind of difficulty, torments aren't that hard and there are already guides on the other achievements\n-> replayability is kind of lacking\n-> the last difficulty is locked until you finish the game on any type of difficulty, case in which this should add replayability, but I am not too much into this so it's neither a pro nor a con\n-> game can get a little heavy on the eyes if you try to keep the score up with the dashes, so dash only if necessary so you don't get a headache after 2 levels\n-> the story and cutscenes are there, but I think they would need a little more polishing \n\nAll in all, a solid rhythm game, personally. I still would have liked if there were more levels and if the weapon variety was bigger.

The story is okay, but it's really just a vehicle to get you to the action, and I wish there was more variety in the visual style of the bosses. Even though the bosses all have slightly different mechanics, they have very similar silhouettes, and that makes them kind of boring after the first 3 boss fights (forgot to add this initially, but some of the boss music repeats, and that doesn't help with the feeling of boredom in the boss fights). I wish the weapons were a little more varied or maybe wish there were more of them, I guess. I like the idea of a loadout you pick before a level, but in this doom style shooter, I think it would just make more sense to have all of them accessible at any given moment.\nAlso, fuck the shield demons. They can suck a fart out of my ass.\nThose are my problems with the game, the rest is awesome. The soundtrack is fantastic, obviously, and when you get into a flow state while playing, it's exhilarating. I played through on Beast difficulty, and it was difficult but fun to balance the multiplier, my lifebar, and the enemies on screen.\nCompared to something like Bullets Per Minute, the overall gamefeel is different enough to make direct comparisons difficult. I like Metal's soundtrack more, as the gameplay feels like it was designed around the soundtrack, whereas in BPM it feels like the soundtrack was designed around the gameplay. They are both music centered FPS games, but in BPM, since the game is a rogue-like, the encounters vary in difficulty and perceived fairness, whereas Metal feels like a tight experience since it's a campaign shooter.\nOverall, Metal: Hellsinger is a must buy for Doom fans, and a fantastic experience overall. $30 USD is an extremely reasonable price for this game, and I can't wait to see what this studio puts out next.", "timestamp_created": 1689150226, "timestamp_updated": 1689150533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141890126": {"recommendationid": "141890126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297966952", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1690516725}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game; but don't bother if you don't have perfect reaction times or the best pc equipment.

The weapons are satisfying to use and the enemies are oh-so very crunchy.\nI'm about three hours in and appear to be about halfway through the main story mission (not including challenges and trials), but that's not a criticism of the game; it's shaping up to be a compact, yet competent experience - a simple meal well made.\nEdit: I feel calling this a simple meal well made really undersells just how intense the game is, but I'm not sure how else to put it quite so succinctly.

The game isn't beaten by you simply looking at a demon and clickling LMB, rather it is beaten by you being able to dodge their attacks and find the most advantagous position before taking your shot.\n\nThe music is indescribably good, especially if you're a big metal fan like me. Not only do you get a bunch of amazing guitar work but also some featured bands who put a lot of effort and passion into these songs and you can hear it. I recall watching an interview of Triviums singer Matt Heafy were he mentioned that he wanted to rerecord his singing in his soundtrack because he wanted to make sure that it was good, and it bloody is.\n\nThe only downside to this game is how short it is but at the same time it makes it even more unique compared to most games nowdays where they include over 500 hours of content without putting much effort making it feel forced and arbitrary.

A game that forces you to follow the tempo of the music, and in doing so, mor effective at defeating your enemies.\n\nNow before I go any farther I have to say, if you can't follow the tempo of music (tapping your foot), you might want to pass on this game. While there is graphic interfaces to help with this, I personally ignore them using the tempo of the music itself as my guide to be devastating.\n\nBack to the review, this game is all around well done. Even when you take out the amazing job it does with a combat system around music, you still have a beautiful environment, well designed characters, and a good story, not to mention Troy Baker as the narrator sounds amazing (only one I could see better would have been Sam Elliott). \n\nI also want to point out the weapons in this game. Their designers already are awesome (I also love the revolvers name, the \"hounds\" that includes Cerberus). But what I find almost mind blowing is their attributes. They aren't all the same in the sense you can choose what you want and they play the same. They have different styles of play you might say, handling different in relation to using them with the tempo of the music. For instance, the Hellcrow, is like a pair of boomerangs, however, because of how they work, you can't just continuously shoot them. I found myself using them ever 1st and 2nd beat of the tempo (then pause and repeat). To me this was VERY well done by the developers, adding that extra to this game that helps it stand out.\n\nOh and another cool think, all the music was composed for this game, so you can stream it, without fearing some copyright strike.\n\nNow the game does offer the ability to adjust latency with the audio and visual, however, when I tried to configure this, it actually made it worst. My audio was offset, my video wasn't, and I found myself messing up. Not sure if it's meant to help with the visual cues or what, but for me, I leave it alone.\n\nIf you have any curiosity in this game, I would STRONGLY suggest purchasing it. Like I have laid out, it's rather unique in its nature, with not many games that can match. Where they didn't just take this \"cool\" feature and kind of build a game around it. Instead using it as a foundation and utilizing it to the fullest.\n\nOne last thing, piece of advice, you may want to turn down the sfx in the game. In my case, I need to hear the tempo of the music, and sometimes the sfx drown it out, causing me to mess up the tempo.", "timestamp_created": 1688696725, "timestamp_updated": 1688696725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567567586898803711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141484039": {"recommendationid": "141484039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192471961", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1689552260}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty metal", "timestamp_created": 1688685124, "timestamp_updated": 1688685124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141478974": {"recommendationid": "141478974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010558913", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1688679005}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game! \nI wish for more rhythm based shooters.", "timestamp_created": 1688679137, "timestamp_updated": 1688679137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738642036914825439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141474786": {"recommendationid": "141474786", "author": {"steamid": "76561199472679137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1945, "last_played": 1684603376}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed playing this game.

Or at least, that's all you know.\nYou'll learn more about what's going in between stages by listening to exposition from your friendly skull who's voiced by Troy Baker.\nThe plot here's only purpose is to drive you forward from one stage to another and it's not the reason you're buying this game for.\n\nGameplay:\nThe story is pretty much a tutorial where you'll acquire all the weapons and learn how to adapt to the game's rules by performing actions according to the right beats of the songs in each stage.\nEach song has different beats and each weapon works differently with the purpose of throwing you off balance.\nNow there's a learning curve but by sticking to it you'll get better and better and once you've got the gist you'll just wanna play for the hell of it.\nThe gun-play is good, there are some execution animations but not that amazing. Killing demons on the beat is the gratification this comes with. On top of that if you sync your attacks to the beat not only does it deal more damage but at max combo the vocals kick in and make the experience even more intense. \n\nSoundtracks:\nThe soundtracks vary from good to very good to freaking awesome - as it should.\nThere's no variety here unless you purchase the DLC. It's metal, from start to finish but it's good.\nCombined with the gameplay you get the fun of it.\n\nDownside:\nGraphics and stage layout isn't something that aim to impress.\nThe length of the game's awfully short as you can only play through a couple of stages and  it gets repetitive fast. You get locked in a room, have to clear out multiple waves of enemies, then go to the next room. Do it 5 more times before you get to the boss.\nAnd speaking of bosses, they are a big shame since they're all the same -copy paste from one stage to the other instead of using unique demons for each stage. They do change their attack pattern but nothing more than that.\nYou do not have the option to implement your own custom songs in the game which I believe it's one of its greatest flaws and drawbacks. Freedom to the player is always a win.\n\nOverall:\nDespite its downsides you will want to replay stages, try out more songs and complete special challenges for powers that offer you a better benefit on higher difficulties.\nThis is probably the best first person rhythm shooter and it doesn\u2019t punish you if you miss all of your shots. You still can play and enjoy this audiovisual masterpiece.\nHowever I don't recommend this at full price unless you're a die-hard fan of metal and doom.\nGet it on sale, preferably for 15 bucks.\nAnd if you happen to enjoy the experience, buy the DLC for the extra songs.", "timestamp_created": 1688500724, "timestamp_updated": 1688500724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141316437": {"recommendationid": "141316437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082671810", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1688805302}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Excellent game when it comes to combining music and gameplay\n\nCons: Too few levels, you will finish it in less than 4/5 hours if you do not repeat some levels.\n\nThis review will change after adding more maps of course", "timestamp_created": 1688498657, "timestamp_updated": 1688498657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141311428": {"recommendationid": "141311428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212107672", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1699118221}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty fun DOOM style rhythm game.

But it isn't without it's flaws. If you can grab this for less than 20 bucks, it's worth it.\n\nPros:\n+ Awesome soundtrack for metalheads. Best in the whole industry\n+ Power fantasy, as you aggressively bash your way through the hells\n+ Gameplay is solid and everything plays to the rhythm of the song\n+ Decent variety of guns, although there could be more like a rocket launcher or two swords\n+ Replay value in challenges, leaderboards and difficulties \nCons:\n- Story is basically irrelevant, even though cutscenes and voice acting is great\n- The story is over in 2 hours if you're good\n- There's basically 2 bosses in the story. 1 that you kill like 8 times and the last boss, which was very annoying. You get hit by random stuff and the feedback to what hit you is non-existent\n- I bought a DLC that gave me new songs. I don't know what to play to get them, as they weren't present in the story\n- The level design is boring. Basically every level consists of several closed arenas, where enemies keep spawning until you've killed them all. This is not very exciting. It would be much cooler to run through long hallways and places and just keep moving forward while destroying everything in the path.\n- The variety of mobs. There's literally 10 mobs in the game and a few of them are the same but different colour. They're not very exciting and it gets repetitive real quick.", "timestamp_created": 1688380350, "timestamp_updated": 1688380350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141194687": {"recommendationid": "141194687", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981351241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1698016208}, "language": "english", "review": "I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME.", "timestamp_created": 1688367278, "timestamp_updated": 1688367278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5318756103515625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141193963": {"recommendationid": "141193963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000832480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1694909544}, "language": "english", "review": "This game obviously has an amazing soundtrack, but it also feels great to play- you can easily enter a flow state once you get into the rhythm.

That being said, I think there's some great replayability here simply because it's so fun to slaughter demons to the beat. \n\nAs a side note, the narration from your skull companion Paz (voiced by the talented Troy Baker) adds some nice levity and is just a joy to listen to.

While the game is great, and has a perfect amounth of length, not very long to get boring, not too short to make you crave more, it kinda feels a bit off price-wise, but that's probably because they also have to pay the musicians.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, with a very chaotic atmosphere, reminds me of Doom and Quake very much, and that's a very good thing in my book.\n\nWhile you cannot add your custom music just from few clicks, the devs enabled some modding. It's a very complicated process that i am too old for, sadly, but maybe in the future there will be an easier way (Installing F Mod Studio is fine, but all that importing songs in another software and locking the BPM and all that is very finicky)  \n\nI strongly recommend this.

And the fact that it's allegedly a passion project makes it even better.\n\nMinor setbacks are that I often get stuck on objects, but that might just be from me playing like a maniac, constantly flying across the maps at Mach 10. Also the in-game latency calibration could provide a way to slide into negative values, but there's a workaround for that, so no big deal.\n\nOverall, this game is awesome rhythm practice (Which I appreciate as a guitarist). \nIt got me to try out vocals for the first time, including screaming, and I can't stop myself from doing stuff on beat while listening to any music anywhere.\nThe OST is an absolute masterpiece involving some of my favorite artists and some that I didn't know about before that I now love. Just a shame that it's not officially on Spotify at the moment.\nThe story and lore is not on the level of something like Hollow Knight(bad comparison, I know) but it's good enough for the game, and there are even some interesting twists thrown in.\n\nThe narration, Oh the narration. The story is told from the perspective of Paz, the flaming skull you use as a weapon.

More than just the beat (though that is a core mechanic). Took me a while, I generally suck at this kind of thing.\n\nOnly one tip I would give that really helped me get the \"feel,\" was after the tutorial, and perhaps a few deaths in Voke you may be thinking, Arrg crrssp I can't get the hang of this. I was anyway,, if you are good at this kind of thing/game may not be necessary.\nSo, After a while dieing and getting basic mechanics down, head to the accessability menu and change the color of one or more bright white squares. I used green instead of default white for \"good.\" Headshot of course remains red. One more in the top section, I used blue instead of white default for, crap can't remember the name but it's the second one, beat maybe? Leave Hud at 100% opacity (default) and for me at least this really made it come alive and feel natural.\n\nNot for every one, and maybe change just one or any combo or leave default. All I can say is what I wrote above helped me enjoy the game much more. It felt great! It may be useful, but I think, for me at least, it wouldn't have helped at the very first few plays. It was by chance because I had that idea after failing to kill the first boss, in Voke too many times (on medium or goat difficulty)  I thought about if I had done that at first and quickly realized it may have confused me more, or something else, but default colours first IMHO, are best. But it's a guess based on my cruddy forgetting which button to press, timing off, missing slaughters blah blah blah. That's just my take, and seeing as I suck generally taking my advice may lead to fits of rage or mental breakdown.\n \nOh, yeah, the game. I love it. It is just a lot of fun, great action set to catching the beat. I would strongly recommend it! For talentless players like me the first few sessions were pretty irritating, but now it feels more natural. Just in very violently pleasant way, with heavy metal fully integrated and a main part of the game.\nThat just sounds like a very good thing to me, literally, and generally!!", "timestamp_created": 1686002270, "timestamp_updated": 1686002270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634502947330474854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139607294": {"recommendationid": "139607294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359640711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 853, "last_played": 1686091174}, "language": "english", "review": "Glorious metal brutality.", "timestamp_created": 1685995391, "timestamp_updated": 1685995391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139567509": {"recommendationid": "139567509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042566540", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 340, "last_played": 1686525642}, "language": "english", "review": "If Dethklok made a game, it still wouldn't be this good.", "timestamp_created": 1685923671, "timestamp_updated": 1685923671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139545011": {"recommendationid": "139545011", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058019161", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1685895598}, "language": "english", "review": "yipee", "timestamp_created": 1685893164, "timestamp_updated": 1685893164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139504842": {"recommendationid": "139504842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115746980", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1685819832}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive FPS.

The first game of this sub-genre I tried was BPM. It`s a fun game, yet something about it just didn`t click with me. So I try the subject of the review - Metal: Hellsinger, and I can confidently say that this game single-handedly ignite the spark of interest for the sub-genre for me. The rhythmic gameplay, the theme, and bonus challenges are really well-done. I highly recommend this game for those also looking to jump into the rhythmic shooters sub-genre.\n\n[h1]Thing I Like About Metal: Hellsinger:[/h1]\n\n[b]Combat, Arsenal, Music, EVERYTHING[/b]\nEverything about this game is amazing.\n\u2192[b]Combat[/b]: I cannot stress enough how great it feels to shoot a gun in sync with rhythm of background music. This feature alone instills a certain flow of gameplay which is hard to recreate in other boomer shooters. Everything must be on beat. Bullets deal much more damage on beat. Shooting on beat grants more points. And music hypes up progressively as you do things on beat. All of this good traits form together a strong core gameplay loop that can easily pulls you in for hours.\n\u2192[b]Arsenal[/b]: Besides actions, Metal: Hellsinger also introduces 7 hellish armaments that each has its own unique flow of rhythm. Since all the weapons performs equally strong on beat, players can just choose whichever suits their playstyle. My favorite weapons of mass destruction are The Hounds and Hellcorw. Dual-wielding revolvers is something I can never pass up. Shooting these two bad boys on beat never gets old, and the dopamine never stops coming. Hellcrow, on the other hand, bounces off me at first. It`s weird beat and boomerang style really are my thing, until I dive in, giving it a shot. This weapon is actually a great multi-kill and crowd-control tools.\n\u2192[b]Music[/b]: Metal, as the music genre, is inherently compatible with extreme violence. Like Doom, Metal: Hellsinger has several blood-pumping soundtracks that merge wonderfully with on beat gameplay and demon-killing. One feature I have mentioned above is that as you build up the Fury meter, music gets progressively more hype-up. At maximum 16x, vocals start kicking in, and THAT is when the gameplay tension and immersion elevate to the utmost hype.\n\n[h1]Things I Dislike About Metal: Hellsinger:[/h1]\n\n[b]Minor Complaints[/b]\n\u2192Bosses are kinda boring considering all of them are basically the same model.\n\u2192Late game arena sections could be hard to dodge projectiles and shoot on beat at the same time.\n\n\u4e2d\u6587\u5c0f\u7c21\u8a55\n\u2192\u60f3\u4e0d\u5230\u5c60\u6bba\u60e1\u9b54\u548c\u6253\u7bc0\u62cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u9019\u9ebc\u4e00\u62cd\u5373\u5408\u3002\n\u2192\u9019\u6b3e\u904a\u6232\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5448\u73fe\u7bc0\u594f\u5c04\u64ca\u7684\u512a\u9ede\u3002\n\u2192\u6bcf\u500b\u52d5\u4f5c\u548c\u6bcf\u6b21\u958b\u69cd\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5408\u62cd\u5b50\u4e0a\u624d\u80fd\u6253\u51fa\u9ad8\u50b7\u5bb3\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u6578\u3002\n\u2192\u6bcf\u628a\u6b66\u5668\u90fd\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7bc0\u594f\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f9d\u81ea\u5df1\u559c\u597d\u9078\u64c7\u3002\n\u2192\u97f3\u6a02\u597d\u807d\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u7576\u4f60\u7bc0\u62cd\u6253\u7684\u8d8a\u6e96\uff0c\u97f3\u6a02\u6703\u8d8a\u4f86\u8d8a\u55e8\uff0c\u5230\u9054\u6700\u5927\u503c\u6642\u6703\u6709\u6b4c\u8072\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u6c23\u6c1b\u76f4\u63a5\u7206\u8868\u3002\n\u2192\u53ef\u60dcBoss\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u500b\u6a21\u7d44\u91cd\u8907\u7528\uff0c\u6beb\u7121\u7279\u8272\u53ef\u8a00\u3002\n\u2192\u904a\u6232\u5f8c\u671f\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u6575\u4eba\u5bc6\u96c6\u5b50\u5f48\u6253\u65b7\u7bc0\u594f\uff0c\u7279\u5225\u662f\u5c0d\u7bc0\u594f\u904a\u6232\u4e0d\u719f\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u9583\u8eb2\u8ddf\u5408\u62cd\u96e3\u4ee5\u517c\u9867\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1684857656, "timestamp_updated": 1684857656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69472813606262207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138822923": {"recommendationid": "138822923", "author": {"steamid": "76561199110221474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 417, "last_played": 1692136650}, "language": "spanish", "review": "heavy metal, oh yeah", "timestamp_created": 1684832317, "timestamp_updated": 1684832317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138810784": {"recommendationid": "138810784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019651636", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 935, "last_played": 1699055600}, "language": "english", "review": "Like metal?

Narrative is good though.\n= Cutscenes have some good art style, but they are not great. Mostly it feels like seeing same thing over and over again.\n= Game takes away the music as you fail and rewards you with extra instrument layers as you succeed. I think it makes everything too focused on the music and almost not care about the combat part, I might as well play guitar hero. Though I think some might like it this way so, neutral.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- Game gets old fast:\n-- There is small pool of enemies, one boss that spawns at the end of each level and one more final boss(2 in total).\n-- 4 Unlockable weapons(+1 with DLC, I don't have it); close range, long range, AOE, infinite ammo with a slightly harder shooting mechanic. Nothing exciting.\n-- You don't have much chance to get familiar with boomerang-like weapon, other weapons are pretty simple so it's just one weapon you'll probably never use. It's still effective if you can't get the timing perfect(throwing without waiting to get both back) so it's not a big deal.\n-- Challenge stages keeps repeating themselves mostly\n---Overall it's pretty linear experience.---\n- You have to switch to skull and keep shooting to keep your multiplayer from decaying, it's makes game exhausting and makes me rush through one battle to another. I didn't have any chance to look around and explore the world, I was like tunnel visioned through the whole game.\n\nUnfortunately this looks like negative review more than anything and it breaks my hearth. Personally I prefer BPM over and over again, which is much small production and much simpler game, but it's much more enjoyable for me. I also liked the lack of vocals in BPM. This game is too focused on music part and gameplay aspects falls too short in my opinion. \n\nStill, by no means it's not an enjoyable game, I enjoyed it very much but I don't think I'm going back playing this game again. Playing this game makes me want to install BPM. I think they should ditch the narrative driven campaign and just let us shoot stuff on beat in fun and unique ways.", "timestamp_created": 1683120315, "timestamp_updated": 1683120315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137699718": {"recommendationid": "137699718", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094447709", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "playtime_at_review": 856, "last_played": 1700565275}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than sex!!

The gameplay loop from arena to arena with waves of enemies let me mow down monsters to a banger of a song. \n* The music in every level was top-notch and I enjoyed them all immensely.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n* The game felt too short. I'm not one to 100% and I don't care about pushing stats on a leaderboard of people I don't know, so I finished the game in about 4 hours. That includes all the levels, and the minigames that I cared about. \n* On the minigames, the rewards were boons that never really felt impactful to the game, so on the one hand it was easy to play the ones I wanted, but on the other I wasn't incentivized to play the ones I didn't.\n* The boss arenas played very differently from the level arenas, and it was jarring at times. Apart from the final boss, they felt like cut-and-paste copies with different bullet-hell mechanics not present in the rest of the game, with scripted minion swarm intermissions that never felt as good as the levels. The final boss was completely different from every boss before it, but it also felt like the devs took all the ideas they had for the game and dumped them into a single encounter. The only way to practice the boss was to play the boss. That wouldn't be an issue except that restarting meant playing through the entire level again. The boss mechanics being different meant weapon choices for the level and weapon choices for the bosses varied, which ultimately lead to a less than satisfying experience.\n\nOverall:\nI enjoyed the majority of my time spent playing this game. I feel that $30 for a 4 hour game is a bit pricey, but if someone has the cash and wants to hear some great metal for a few hours it's a good buy.", "timestamp_created": 1682702527, "timestamp_updated": 1682702527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137429180": {"recommendationid": "137429180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080414788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1682698061}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fairly short game if you're not going for achievements and high scores, but it's also a fantastic music album.

The most glaring issue simply is the lack of content and underdeveloped rhythm mechanic. In every department you are going to notice shortcomings and lack of diversity: The environments pretty much all look the same, the story is the same thing happening 8 times in a row, you have the same boss fight 8 times in a row, weapons all feel very similar, unending waves of the same enemy types over and over again, soundtrack - even if an absolute curated list of bangers - blends together. The only thing the different difficulties change is how much damage you take, how big the enemy health bar is, and how many enemies there are. The enemies don't become smarter or faster, it's just more of them and they become very, very tanky. There's one new enemy on the highest difficulty but it's just an advanced version of another regular enemy and it also only appears rarely. Not to forget, I don't know who in their right mind would think that waiting for a boss to go through 20 invincibility phases during a boss fight would be fun, half of the time you are just waiting for the boss to be fucking done with transforming and I'm not exaggerating.\nNow regarding the rhythm mechanic - it's simple and underdeveloped: You shoot, reload, or dash on time, only on full beats, that's it. No interesting rhythms, no faster timings, just always slow full beats. You might think to yourself that this is plenty enough when you also have to play a FPS simultaneously and you are right to think so, for the first 10 minutes that is. After that, the game is the same from start to finish. For that reason, I'm telling you to play BPM: Bullets Per Minute first. Not only does it have amazing weapon and item variety, but it builds rhythm into the game in an interesting way as well. In addition, BPM has great replay value due to it being a rogue-like and having multiple, game-changing characters to play as. Metal: Hellsinger on the other hand is just really the same being served to you time after time.\n\nSo in conclusion, you will have fun with MH but your money will be better invested in BPM.", "timestamp_created": 1682339528, "timestamp_updated": 1682339769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137215881": {"recommendationid": "137215881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833941754", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1699232791}, "language": "english", "review": "SERJ TANKIAN", "timestamp_created": 1682323593, "timestamp_updated": 1682323593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137214182": {"recommendationid": "137214182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140734647", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1683241173}, "language": "english", "review": "wowow good gaming", "timestamp_created": 1682319260, "timestamp_updated": 1682319260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137211993": {"recommendationid": "137211993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274970677", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "playtime_at_review": 1935, "last_played": 1700624262}, "language": "english", "review": "Goddamn, what an absolute banger!", "timestamp_created": 1682313434, "timestamp_updated": 1682313434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137204451": {"recommendationid": "137204451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043483813", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 161, "last_played": 1683076268}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the lovechild of Doom and Guitar Hero and I'm here for it.", "timestamp_created": 1682297312, "timestamp_updated": 1682297312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137203257": {"recommendationid": "137203257", "author": {"steamid": "76561199142236631", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1699334015}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta bien chingon, ya solo espero el Cumbia Hellsinger.", "timestamp_created": 1682295102, "timestamp_updated": 1682295102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137189919": {"recommendationid": "137189919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413974899", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1227, "last_played": 1682253210}, "language": "english", "review": "I can say that I wanted this game for a long time but only now I managed to buy it.

Each song has a set \"metronome\" behind it that corresponds with its average beats per minute. You're supposed to match all your shots and kills up to this metronome regardless of how the song might change. Almost every song in the game has multiple tempo changes, but this metronome never slows or speeds up to match. It's extremely jarring to be on a kill streak only to have the song reach a quiet bridge section that makes you completely lose your timing.\n\nWhile I like metal music, and think most of the songs are great both on their own, and to accompany a demon shooter, I can't help but shake the feeling I would be better off playing this game without the sound on. The game gives a visual on-screen queue next to your aim reticle that's there to help you match up to the aforementioned metronome. It's easier to keep with this constant, never changing rhythm without having a song playing that might distract you into deviating from it.\n\nIf anyone has ever played a Guitar Hero/Rock Band game, you'll remember the calibration settings. This game has that as well, but I found it extremely difficult to get right. I looked around on the internet a bit, and found that this is a common issue a lot of players have. I can't say exactly why this is, but I've found different songs feel better with different calibrations, even though I'm using the exact same pair of headphones each time.\n\nOutside of the rhythm stuff, it has other conventional gameplay issues.\n\nI was disappointed in the similarity of all the boss fights. Excluding the final boss, they're almost identical in design, even if the arenas and move-sets differ slightly. They all even play to the exact same song. I get the desire to have a \"boss theme\" for your game, but that type of repetition doesn't lend itself well to a game who's primary mechanic focuses on music.\n\nI also frequently felt like I was searching for more stuff to kill to keep my streaks going. The levels in the game are mostly made-up of a string of loosely connected battle arenas (a la Doom 2016/Eternal), and you're locked into each arena until the scripted number of spawns are slain. The problem is that the spawns don't continue until every single enemy (no matter how small) has been picked off from the previous spawn, and the AI is also prone to get stuck on walls. As a result, it wasn't uncommon for me to finish a wave of monsters and then lose my streak looking around the arena for scrub #999 who had his toe caught on a staircase somewhere.\n\nThe other single worst contributor to its pacing issues are the shield-wielding enemies. They were harder and more annoying than any other enemy in the entire rest of the game, and it introduces you to them fairly early on. Their shields are too large too shoot around without a good amount of precision that many guns don't have (you have to shoot their left hand), hitting their shields doesn't count as a \"hit\" so it's easy to lose your streaks, and they aren't particularly easy to strafe around in some environments either. I can't tell you the number of times one of these guys would linger around after everything else was dead because I just couldn't kill it with a reasonable amount of effort. It was a great way to completely destroy some otherwise amazing action sequences, as my streak and music would die during all the extra seconds I would have to spend trying to jump around to get behind one of these guys' shields.\n\n\nDespite some of these glaring flaws, this is still a good, fun game. You will still enjoy it if you like metal music and can get past the feeling of handicapping yourself by leaving the music on. I'm giving it some tough love here because I WANT it to succeed and be better. I want Hellsinger 2 someday, and I want them to get the music matching right to make it the true rhythm shooter everyone dreamed this could be. I fully support what they're trying to do here, and what they have is still a lot of fun, it just has a lot of missed potential.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1682190964, "timestamp_updated": 1682190964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137117453": {"recommendationid": "137117453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010270887", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1682820311}, "language": "english", "review": "This game grabs you from the start with its gameplay.

Finished the game (story) and... Damn, that was something, and in a good way.\nAn FPS that mixes rhythm-style game aspects is something rather unique, i mean what else can i say.\nThe weapon choice, despite there being few, are all well designed, imo none of them came off as \"This gun is better than rest\"\nAlso holy hell (No pun intended) the OST is absolute banger, catjam spam dare i say.\nThe difficulty in my opinion is also pretty well balanced.\n\nThough one big issue i have with the game is the fact that the game can be beaten quickly, VERY quickly if you are playing on Lamb (Easy difficulty). I beat the game in 5 hours, and thats considering the fact i went for nearly 50% of the Torments (Challenges).\nPricing... The pricing is hard to say its justified. As i mentioned, the game takes around 5 hours, this is considering you arent playing on Easy/Hard difficulty, arent going for all Torments, and have died multiple times. Giving 30 Dollars for a 5 hour experience is pretty... Eh. Obviously this is void if you are planning to 100% the game or plan on playing the game a lot (Like Speedrunning). If you are planning for a one-time playthrough, i recommend getting the game on sale.\n\nTLDR + Extra:\nPro:\n- Epic OST\n- Balanced difficulty\n- Good weapon choices.\n- Generally satisfying and rewarding gameplay\n- Visuals are nice (Note: I should not be asked for visual ratings in games)\n- Tomboy Demon protagonist pog!!!!!!!\n\nCons:\n- Short playtime for 1-time playthrough.\n\nNeutral:\n- Price, but this is pretty subjective thing honestly. For some reason, the 30$ will feel pretty meh for a 5 hour game, for other people the 30$ can be worthy if they are planning to play the game for a decent amount of time since the game does have extra challenges post main-game (Like the 4th difficulty or generally trying to 100% the game)\n\nJoke review:\nFriday Night Funkin, but with guns and without 100 different danger notes and no cringe ahh OC.", "timestamp_created": 1681974338, "timestamp_updated": 1681974338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136983108": {"recommendationid": "136983108", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023622852", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1684020540}, "language": "english", "review": "FUCKING MASTERPIECE \\m/", "timestamp_created": 1681953005, "timestamp_updated": 1681953005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136977445": {"recommendationid": "136977445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045777195", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 513, "last_played": 1684523529}, "language": "english", "review": "pog", "timestamp_created": 1681941425, "timestamp_updated": 1681941425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136977272": {"recommendationid": "136977272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075745042", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 647, "last_played": 1698792715}, "language": "english", "review": "Metal: Hellsinger is an immensely enjoyable game to play.

As someone who deeply enjoyed BPM, this was just the fix I needed. The gameplay is a bit more forgiving than BPM, but oooh... Just as satisfying.\nThe story actually surprised me in that there is one. Narrated by Troy Baker as Paz, a talking skull with a smooth accent and no memory, the story managed to do juuust enough to transcend the bog-standard \"Kill demons, kill more demons, then finally kill Satan\" plot it first appears to be. Even when I thought that was all it would be, the sexy narration and charmingly simple cutscenes were still kinda doing it for me.\nNot that the game even needs much in story, as the pick-up-and-game style feels more at home in an arcade than a theater. Here, gameplay and soundtrack are king, and Hellsinger knows it.\nThe music rocks, as should be no surprise, though I hope you like metal, as the soundtrack only barely transcends the genre of its namesake. Though if metal isn't your cup of tea and you bought the game with a demon glaring over the title \"METAL: HELLSINGER\", I do question your purchasing wisdom.\nLucky for me, I do at least somewhat enjoy a thumping jam, and this game brings it. I'm no metalhead, but really anything with a solid beat would still be fun, and there a few songs in the soundtrack that even I as a filthy casual greatly enjoyed.\n\nThe only negative notes I have are glorified nitpicks.\n\nThe guns are pretty hit and miss.\nThe first four work great. You start with a sword and a simple semi-automatic projectile weapon to learn the beat matching mechanics, and they each have unique strengths enough to remain relevant for most of the game. Next are a shotgun and akimbo revolvers. These are awesome. Satisfying, effective and intuitive.\nThe last two (in the base game at least, I haven't tried the DLC) I feel very different about.\nFirst is something that seems like it should be good. A long range precision explosive crossbow. But it doesn't deal that much damage, so its use is more for mopping up hoards of smaller weaker enemies. But it only has two shots before needing a reload, which is the longest reload in the game (and is one of the few actions that feels off-beat, unless you nail the active reload). At the damage it does, it needed to have a lot more shots to be useful, or if you're dead set on only two, please give it some oomph. This crossbow had all the reload speed and explosive power of a water balloon launcher.\nThe last weapon is a pair of boomerangs. Which aren't quite as terrible as they at least deal decent damage and can cut through multiple enemies. However, they are fairly close range and are easily surpassed in high single target damage by the revolvers or shotgun. Their flight path is too difficult to track to use in any way beyond occasional accidental extra corpses near your intended target.\nSo yeah, bit of a bummer that after a certain point there's really no reason to try any other weapons beyond tried and true shotgun and revolvers.\n\nThe challenge trials are fine I guess. Some feel pretty impossible, or arbitrarily testing skills that have little to do with the primary gameplay loop, but eh, better than nothing I guess.\n\nDon't let those two tiny little vestigial nubs hanging off this gem like skin tags hiding under the armpit of a supermodel stop you from taking it on the town. You'll only be in a position to notice if you've already gotten close enough that you're committed, and it's easy to overlook anyway. \n\nTL;DR\nFun gameplay, 70% good weapons, rockin' soundtrack make great game.

I'm not even a huge metal fan, but this all just works. \n* Movement feels really good\n* Weapon variety isn't bad.\n* Optional challenge levels were also mostly fun to play through, even though a couple of them had me a little frustrated\n* Short and sweet, but higher difficulties are available, and I will probably go through and give the hardest difficulty a shot\n\nCons:\n* Probably a bit too short, though I think the game as-is doesn't really have the legs for a much longer campaign\n* Story is nonsense. After sitting through the dialog for the first two levels, I skipped the rest. It doesn't really matter, so if you play feel free to skip it. I still loved the game without listening to the story.\n* While there's plenty of weapon variety, it felt like the pistols were by far the best. I used them through pretty much the whole game except against the shield enemies where I pulled out the sword. I also found them and the shotgun the easiest to keep rhythm with, but the pistols have the range/ammo advantage.\n* Bosses kinda sucked and were the worst part of the game. They're all the same model with slightly different movesets. The game would have been better without them IMO. They didn't ruin the game by any means, and didn't make me want to quit, but they're definitely the game's weakest aspect.\n* The DLC was pretty good, but the DLC weapon felt pretty awkward. \n\nOverall though, I absolutely loved this and played through the game and got all achievements in one day.

The music and fast-paced tempo is as good as it gets, and the atmosphere matches.  Blasting through demons to the beat of great metal tracks is amazing.  But I simply can't recommend it for one reason - game-breaking bugs.  My first playthrough ended when I repeatedly encountered a bug on a level late in the game that prevented me from progressing and was widely known.  Eventually, a patch was released that fixed this bug.\n\nSo I pick the game back up because, well it's an awesome game and now my blocker is fixed.  I beat that level and progress to the next level, only to encounter yet another game-breaking bug that prevents any possible progression.  This is the best game I'll never finish.  It is beyond frustrating to repeatedly get stuck because \"game broken\".  It is crazy to me that these types of bugs got through QA on a title.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1681525807, "timestamp_updated": 1681525807, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136709613": {"recommendationid": "136709613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064334302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1681515288}, "language": "english", "review": "It's kinda just a 'big' budget experiment and it's not really good tbh.\n\nThe sound design is good, the music is fine too, but outside of that it doesn't do anything particularly well for me to recommend any of it.\n\nThe combat ranges from \"200 cannon fodder enemies get one hit by you\" to \"haha heres 400 projectiles and area damage with no clear telegraphing so youll take damage alright\" all the while you gotta stay on beat and generally move around the arena. It's a lot at once thrown at you with very sloppy visuals.\nLike 90% of this game is orangey-brown. Enemies, the environment, everything. It quickly becomes very mushy and eh i am not a fan.\n\nKinda spoilery? The bosses are like all the same with one annoying thing switching out between encounters. Shoot the boss, kill the weak enemies that waste your time, then shoot the boss some more. Incredible. \nThe level of danger from each boss is very arbitrary? some you just kinda run in circles without taking damage and thats it, some have random invisible-feeling attacks that come from outside your field of view that chunk you for a third of your health, and nope not fun.\n\nIn general suffers from the same issues as BPM, just because the concept of \"DOOM, but youre forced to shoot with the beat of the music that plays\" is fundamentally just very flawed? \nAnd worse than in BPM, except for the sword, sub-divisions of the 4/4 beat just do not exist at all in this game. Which for a rhythm game... is very disappointing. If I wanna shoot 3 8ths in a row, i should be able to do that with proper timing, rather than be forced to do 3 4th beats. It's a super arbitrary restriction that just makes the game worse.\n\nStory exists in this. The narration is... very... mediocre? It's not bad, not good, it's very predictable, generally uninteresting, but not bad enough for me to skip it, so i end up sitting through something i have no investment in with the cutscenes. \n\nthe funny numbers:\naudio 8/10\ngameplay: 5/10\nstory: 3/10\noverall enjoyment: 4/10\n\nCan't recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1681515998, "timestamp_updated": 1681515998, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472972989082336426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136703168": {"recommendationid": "136703168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114033999", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 216, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1681679256}, "language": "english", "review": "Gun goes \"boom\" while song goes \"baam\". \n\nCan recommend if you like deep riffs, metal and want to summon demons just to send them again to hell as you ride the riff.", "timestamp_created": 1681506369, "timestamp_updated": 1681506369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136700593": {"recommendationid": "136700593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159878550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1681503557}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really cool concept - I just wish there was a way to turn off rhythm mode, so I could actually listen to the music while I play. \n\nI seem to have no concept of how to stay on beat, and trying to look at the little arrows is very distracting...

A bit harder then I expected but still nice. Of course it has some issues. Climbing absence really disturbs sometimes. And the main problem is unbalanced difficulty. For me it's too easy on the 2nd one, but a bit too tough on the 3rd. It would be better if we had 1 revival on the 3rd difficulty. For one life is the 4th one - for true hardcore players. That's why I didn't complete last level on the 3rd. It's too much to bear - 20 minutes you get to the boss and then die in 20 seconds without any chances to understand wtf is going on. I think that 8th level should contain only boss fight. It's pretty easy before the one but really annoying. \n\nBut enough with the negative, it's still a great game with nice visual, powerful soundtrack and awesome gameplay.

It works surprisingly well, and within no time you'll be headbanging along to the soundtrack while blasting demons. It is a very difficult game in parts; I played the game on Beast difficulty and had to restart the last level several times, along with some others. Also some of the torment trials were incredibly difficult. The weapon selection is diverse, and help you to blast apart the large variety of enemies.\nIt is pure metal violence and I loved every second of it. Honestly, the soundtrack alone is worth the pricetag.. and you get a free journey of pure dopamine along with it. The combat is unbelievably satisfying, the story is interesting enough and the graphics are far better than I expected.\n\nNote that most people report playing the main story in only around 4 hours, but I spent longer due to replaying some levels and playing through the torments (challenge trials to unlock this game's equivalent of Doom 2016's runes). I will say that it is definitely worth it regardless, the quality is insane, nothing is padded out for the sake of it.\n\nOnce I finished the main story, I bought the DLC and replayed a couple levels with the new songs, gun and outfit. That's worth it too imo - both songs work so well in this game; especially Will's.\n\nPlayed entirely on linux, no issues there - I believe steam deck support is fine too.", "timestamp_created":

Combining fast-paced action with timing and rhythm creates a unique and exciting experience.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]\ud83d\udfe9 Pros[/th]\n[th]\ud83d\udfe5 Cons[/th][/tr]\n[td]\nSoundtrack\nImmersion\nGameplay\n[/td]\n[td]Story, Short[/td][/table]\n\n[h2] \\m/ [/h2]\n\nThe concept is simple and rarely seen at this production level. The game's premise is simple, you are in Hell and must fight a horde of demons to find your voice again stolen by the Underlord himself. While the story starts as an exciting concept, it sadly is a complete afterthought. Unmemorable at best, there is little to do throughout the game about character development despite all the interesting elements you encounter throughout your playthrough.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959616033\n\nYou are not grabbing Metal: Hellsinger for its story; you are here because it's a Rhythm game, and it's achieving that exceptionally well. You need to follow the tempo set by both visual and sound cues. On top of that, to attain peak headbanging status, you will have to ensure that you don't lose the combos you are building. Each level has its particular soundtrack that keeps building up the more you kill, dodge, reload, and jump on the beat to let the vocals be heard finally. I don't think there's anything more satisfying than the drums connecting with a properly timed reload+headshot\n\nYou will also get to use finishers ala Doom to regain lost health, and ammunitions are infinite so that you can focus on the action. The controls are very intuitive and easy to take on, and we must applaud the developers for the accessibility features included in the game that are going to make sure that everyone gets to enjoy the game.\n\nIt would be impossible to review this game without talking about the soundtrack. It is one of the best I've heard in a video game. Two Feathers, a studio focused on video game music, delivered a phenomenal product with the help of famous Metal singers ranging from Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquility to Trivium, Lamb of God etc. The singers also did an outstanding job on each track, and the music is seamlessly integrated into the gameplay; the result is an incredibly immersive experience.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959616083\n\nGraphically speaking, the themes are exactly what you would expect from hell, dark, gothic, and satanic, with each demon being different and identifiable. \n\nSadly, the game is short, and the level design is all the same level after level. The boss fights especially, it\u2019s all the same enemy with little variations, and even though there are some challenges to extend the game's length, it\u2019s not quite that. Though, it must be said that the game is infinitely replayable if you want to compete for leaderboards. Indeed you can compare your score with other players, improve on it and keep headbanging.\n\nFinally, Metal: Hellsingers is a fun and unique game that will appeal to both metal fans and rhythm gamers, and while it is short, the spectacular soundtrack and gameplay make up for it.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959618213\n\n[h1] Let's connect [/h1]\nIf you liked this review, you could check my curating page for other games you may like.\n[quote]\u2022 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33562948/]Curating Page[/url]\n\u2022 [url=https://discord.gg/U5Katayh6v]You can also join the Discussion on the Trash Can Discord server [/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1680986391, "timestamp_updated": 1680986411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735813736915588379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136368993": {"recommendationid": "136368993", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000111369", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1681945769}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun", "timestamp_created": 1680985640, "timestamp_updated": 1680985640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136354647": {"recommendationid": "136354647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164500041", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1668997410}, "language": "english", "review": "My heart beats to the beat of the drum", "timestamp_created": 1680970259, "timestamp_updated": 1680970259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136319930": {"recommendationid": "136319930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058157252", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1687392930}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!

Outside of that I wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\nMetal: Hellsinger is a first person shooter where pretty much everything is dictated by the rhythm of the soundtrack. And to start somewhere I'll talk about the soundtrack. It's so damn good. If you're into heavy metal music you'll absolutely love the OST. And even if you're not there's still some great tracks in this.\n\nNow moving onto the gameplay itself as mentioned before the game runs off of the rhythm/beat of the soundtrack. If you match if with your dashes you can chain them together, or doing more damage with your guns, reloading faster, and even being able to perform finishing moves. This all sounds good and when you're moving around in perfect sync then it feels amazing. But when you lose the beat and fumble to recover it feels really shitty to try and get back to where you were. Granted the game has a suite of difficulty options as well as an accessibility option to make sure that you're always on beat, which is nice\n\nAs a quick aside shout outs to the dev team for giving the player a whole host of tools to customize how they want to play the game. Fully remappable controls, changing the color of UI elements and many other options to tweak to the player's content.\n\nThough I do have address the elephant in the room, and that is it's length. It took me about 7 hours to get all the achievements in the game. And although while there are still other things to do such as getting the Coat of Arms (weapons skins), it wouldn't add that much to the runtime. And this can be even far less if you're either really good at the game or just go from beginning to end and don't bother with the extra content. That said if you're looking to chase high scores and top leaderboards then this game has immense replay value in that regard. \n\nBut there's no getting around the fact that at retail price it's $30 and even half off it's $15. Truly I believe that everyone that worked on this game deserves that $30 (and frankly more) due to the sheer quality, it'll undoubtedly be a hard sell for those that want their games to be meaty in content. Doubly so when they can find games around the same price or cheaper and provide bare minimum double the amount of playtime.

The weapons in the game are also really fun and you fire them all at different timings (skull is 4/4, shotgun is 2/4, etc).

It's playable, it's good fun at times, and most of the songs go hard enough that, besides the obvious drive to try and keep the max combo multiplier going, you're also driven to keep it high enough that you can hear the backing track in its glorious entirety. The problem is that Metal: Hellsinger clearly designed itself around the new DOOM games and, consequently, suffers from constant nagging comparisons to that franchise - whereas DOOM's soundtrack ducks and swells with the chaotic action and extremely brief moments of peace around you, M:H's backing track stays (mostly) the same throughout the level, and indeed the whole game; whereas the glory kills in DOOM instill a sense of liberating violence, the 'slaughters' in M:H feel somewhat lifeless and weak; whereas the legions of hell in DOOM come in many shapes and sizes with all kinds of interesting mechanics and weak points, the enemies of M:H start off as somewhat uninspiring and only grow more tedious with exposure (I was particularly unimpressed with [spoiler]the final boss of each level being the same enemy with a slightly different gimmick each time[/spoiler]); whereas there is a constant back-and-forth in DOOM as you juggle your health and ammunition against those legions, you have infinite ammunition in M:H, health tends not to be much of a problem, and when it does become a problem there's a lot of conveniently placed wall crystals to heal from, which kinda defeats the point of having the slaughters/glory kills rewarding you with health in the first place.\n\nIndeed, perhaps the biggest comparison-problem with M:H is that that back-and-forth in DOOM has an internal rhythm of itself - jump, dash, shoot, switch weapon, glory kill, jump, dash, grenade, rip, tear, etc etc; it's a masterpiece of game design that this internal rhythm is both set and felt by the player simultaneously, affording an experience that is completely unmatched in singleplayer FPS.

Worth all the praise it gets. Just a couple of complaints:\n\n1) The Coats of Arms are bloody awful. They're dingy lil' collectibles, each one hidden in ONE obscure corner of the map and there's no way to tell where any of them are. In a game that works very damn well without exploration and functions as a great linear rhythm shooter, these things are an active detriment to the experience. Secrets and collectables are nice when the game isn't punishing you for not progressing or keeping to the rhythm and I have better things to do than rub my nose on every single corner for a specific doodad. And I have to do this ONCE for each difficulty level?! That is beyond parody.\n\n2) The bosses are cool but it's very annoying when I have to start the whole level again when I die to the boss. I get that a rhythm game means I have to play the song to its end but each boss has their own song separate from the level. What's more, I often died trying to learn the boss' attack patterns, so I have to play through the entire stage again to get back to them, only I still haven't committed them to muscle memory and all that time back in the stage has made me forget again. This wouldn't be so bad if the bullet hell-esque mechanics of each boss didn't mean that I get blindsided in the first person perspective all too often and am often left in complete bewilderment as to what killed me. The final boss in particular just melted me all the time with alarming speed. I just wish the bosses were their own stages.\n\nBut aside from those two glaring issues, this is a fantastic game. What I really appreciate is that there's an actual story with actual characters with actual interactions and goals in play. I like a bloodfest as much as anyone else but I really need some context in my games and <u>Metal: Hellsinger</u> provides in abundance. I enjoyed how Paz revered the Unknown and how the Red Judge actually interacted with her subjects and how she schemed. There's depth here that a lot of retro-aspiring FPSes feel is beneath them. Yes, I care about the story; we can have good story and gameplay in accordance. New Blood, this is aimed at you.\n\nAlthough I don't like inconclusive conclusions; I sincerely hope there actually is a sequel to round out the plot.

Could be good. But boss fights are tedious and boring. Bullet sponge bosses. Lose interest in the fight. Fail = have to repeat entire lvl. Game is good for a single run through.

Also base enemy melee attack connects far away, basically invisible close quarter ranged attack with no visual for confirmation except loss of life.Meh... Just meh. Potential is there.\n\nEDIT: (correction to above, a save option for the start of boss fights would alleviate the worst aggravation of their spongyness, Ghostrunner (where everything is one hit kills apart from bosses, which are very well made) implemented that without overuse.)\nSo... Lets expand upon this. I gave it a no recommendation... Because a neutral option does not exists. But also due to the fact that it has recieved an inflated rating. It suffers from the same issue that plagues \"Stray\". And alot of other media. It seems to be in the current zeitgeist (Be it hate or fanatic hype, either is equally hurtful). \nEven though past titles exists that does what this does already, and in several cases... Does it better.\n\nIve played alot of rhytm based game, and alot of hi-intensity games the likes of later Doom Titles, Beat Saber, Ghostrunner, BPM, Succubus etc. I found all of those alternative titles to do what this game does better. Each in their own way.\nAnd even if we only take the music into account. Some pretty nice tracks are found in both Doom Eternal and (Guardians of the Galaxy; granted thats an entirely different genre)\n\nThis game is a case of average. The jack of alot (not all) of trades, master of none. \n\nShould you play it... Maybe? Depends. Not my decision to make. Its a good game in on of its own. But in the broad spectrum of available titles. Better can be found. Does'nt mean its bad, just that better can be had.

I'm not a huge metal fan, but know plenty of people who are and like the music enough to be able to keep the beat and have fun with the title. I'm only 3 hours in at the moment and have been really enjoying the challenge, visuals and just uniqueness of a game that combines Rhythm and FPS. That aside the game fails in a few different areas. \n\n- Weapons, throughout the game you get a few different weapons. Some are cool, but only like 2 of the weapons out of the 6 actually carry the beat well. \n- The rest can throw you off at times, since there are no sounds for the them after their original hit. Outside of that, the weapons just seem poorly optimized. Some weapons seem to do crazy damage, while others seem to do barely any. \n- Enemies could be better too, the list just keeps growing so levels towards the end just have everything. I'm to the 3rd to last level and the \"newest\" thing I've seen was a enemy unit. The boss has been the same boss every level, which might make sense for the story but is truthfully a little lame.\n- Difficulty is kinda weird. I'm fairly good at first person shooters and aim for a positive K/D Ratio in most FPS titles; Halo, COD, Valorant, etc. And this game was actually killing me pretty often, but more just from what I'd view as kind of bad design more so than it just being \"Difficult\" like a Souls-esque game. \n- In this game, you have like the same base health and weapons act the same throughout the entirety of the game, from what I've seen. And I really feel like the game would gain A LOT from even having Stats to upgrade health or maybe upgradable  weapons, since it does get slightly stale. \n\nOverall, as I said in the first paragraph. I would recommend this game to others. It's a fun game.

Instead Paz is its own weapon slot, and you're also given a sword for some reason. So in a bullet hell / beat situation, you end up futzing way too much with selecting the right weapon instead of shooting things.\n\nThe \"aspects\" of the Judge are disappointing. Ideally we'd instead have separate boss designs with more distinct boss mechanics. Instead we get (essentially) one recycled boss. The worst part of the boss fights is when the boss becomes immaterial.... oftentimes you're just waiting around for no reason, which kills the game's momentum. It's also discouraging to see so many arena battles with ads during boss fights, since arena battles were all you were doing before the boss.\n\nLast complaint is - if you're going to spend so much time on storytelling, don't do it all through narration. I mean, the story's not great, but the retrospective narrative format makes it even more of a slog.\n\nThe music's great, though, and unlocking vocals only at 16x fury is a nice touch. The weapons feel good and the enemy designs are great (although the shield enemy can oftentimes be at an angle where you don't have a shot, so you waste time and fury re-positioning, which dampens the game's flow). The finishing melee moves for health a la Doom are also always satisfying (especially for aerial finishers).", "timestamp_created": 1679119799, "timestamp_updated": 1679120724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134859714": {"recommendationid": "134859714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078660123", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1680278659}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game from start to finish with some of the heaviest riffs a metal game has seen since doom 2016/eternal.

All but one enemy type are dealt with in the same way and don't require any particular tactics or specific weapons, which does not encourage people to play around with different approaches. The movement is stock standard: there is a double jump and a dash, neither being used all that much for combat purposes. Lastly, the special abilities are underwhelming and somehow detract from the intended on-the-beat experience.\n\nFor the game set in hell, the levels and enemies are extremely uninspired. There is only a handful of enemy types and, again, they don't require any specific technique to be taken down. As for the bosses, there are practically only two: the one that gets recycled X times and the final boss. Both of them shoot projectiles and spawn minions - nothing more, nothing less.\n\nI haven't followed the story as I found the first few cutscenes extremely boring, which made me skip all the following cutscenes.\n\nAll in all, considering the Metal: Hellsinger's price tag, the amount of content is severely limited. I finished it in four hours, which includes spending some time on the optional challenges.

masterclass in Rhythm Action design, along with the likes of BPM, Crypt of the Necrodancer/Cadence of Hyrule, and now Hi Fi Rush (released after Hellsinger.)\nAs a note, it looks as if I may be \"reviewing\" this game with little time in it, but on the contrary I've completed the game 100% on game pass, then purchased on console, and now purchased on Steam.\nThis game is just that good, (if this genre clicks with you.)\nI say that, but at the same time, I TRULY believe that anyone who enjoys the hard rock/metal genre and at least a base level enjoyment of shooters will absolutely adore this game. \n\nI think the best way to describe Hellsinger, among other's in it's masterclass, is just utterly satisfying. Shooting, movement, and synchronization to the music come together to form an incredibly cathartic loop of \"Easy to learn, difficult to master.\"\n\nThe game features multiple difficulty settings and tweaks, allowing for players of all skill levels (and rhythmic capabilities) to jump in and feel like they are being given a fair shake at the game.\n\nBut once you REALLY get it, and you can just jump in and stack up flawless combos up to the hundreds while being accompanied by the glorious soundtrack that The Outsiders have put together for this game, crunching bones and popping skulls right in line with the heavy thump of the kick drum, is unlike most things you can experience in gaming. \n\nIf anything of what I've said here peaks your interest, or if you watch a trailer and even THINK \"That looks pretty cool,\" then yes.

The unique gameplay twist is that you have to fire your guns in time to the beat of heavy metal music to build up your damage multiplier, allowing you to kill enemies quickly.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\n\u2022\tFeels like an old school shooter where the movement is fast, there are lots of enemies in each encounter, and you have to always be moving to avoid taking damage.\n\n\u2022\tThe beat matching gameplay mechanic is fun. I found that I didn\u2019t really have to look at the on screen timing indicator, I was able to use my ears to track the beat, so my eyes could focus on aiming at the demons.\n\n\u2022\tThere are four main weapons including dual pistols, shotgun, explosive crossbow and dual throwing axes. I mostly used the shotgun because its click click boom click click boom firing speed is a close match to the music beat, while the pistols\u2019 longer effective range makes them more useful against bosses.\n\n\u2022\tA couple of other mechanics add a tactical element to the combat. Successful attacks build up your weapon\u2019s ultimate meter, allowing you to use a special attack powerful enough to one hit kill most enemies, which I would save for the more dangerous demons. And when an enemy is near death, you can press a button to quickly fly over and execute them, causing them to drop shards which restore your health (similar to the modern Doom games).\n\n\u2022\tI played on the medium (\u201cgoat\u201d) difficulty because I wasn\u2019t sure how tricky the beat matching mechanic would be. Regular encounters can get intense on the later levels, while the bosses are quite challenging because of their bullet hell style attacks.\n\n\u2022\tI didn\u2019t have any problems with bugs, crashes or framerate. Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\n\u2022\tThe game is incredibly short, as I completed it in just 3.4 hours. It seems like the developers intend the player to replay the same levels over and over again chasing high scores for the leaderboards, which isn\u2019t really what I\u2019m looking for in a single player FPS, although I suppose I\u2019ll have to do it to salvage some value for money.\n\n[h1]The Recommendation[/h1]\n\nIf you like your shooters fast and your music loud, Metal Hellsinger is definitely the game for you. Its just a massive shame that the game is so short, and because of this I can only recommend it on a deep sale.", "timestamp_created": 1678576211, "timestamp_updated": 1678576244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 106, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851137340068817139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134487377": {"recommendationid": "134487377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051562383", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1695489018}, "language": "english", "review": "Yo so i normally don't put reviews up on here but DAYYYYUM this was a good game bro, id say this game is the perfect rythem shooter i mean its godly, so if you read negative reviews then i'm telling you now they are wrong this is an insane game.\n\nId love to meet the developers for a chat because this game has so many aspects to it that are new its insane.", "timestamp_created": 1678559185, "timestamp_updated": 1678559185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134457499": {"recommendationid": "134457499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164102466", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 477, "last_played": 1686289488}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is amazing. 10/10 soundtrack.

Some hitboxes (both yours and the enemies) can feel a bit off at times, causing you to get hit by attacks that look like they shouldn't have landed, but also the reverse where attacks that go right through you just decide to not register. It's not bad enough where it makes the game frustrating to play (but I guess that also depends on how easily you get frustrated), but it can definitely be noticeable. \n\nThe game isn't incredibly long, with 8 missions that last about 20-ish minutes each you can play through the story in about 4 hours. The game does have replay value for those that want to hunt for cosmetics or highscores though, and personally I've replayed the levels a lot simply to listen to specific songs again. And my god are the songs good, I was a bit concerned I'd get sick of them eventually by replaying them too many times, but with 30 hours played and even more time spent listening to them on my free time, there isn't a single one that's gotten old yet. There's also modding tools that let you add custom songs to the game, although the process of making said mods can be a bit daunting even with the guides the devs have provided. \n\nSo anyway, buy the game.

banger.I dont even care about awards,and that alone made me saltiest person alive.The music is so god damn good,that it is literally a album with a free game.\n\nThe gameplay is fun as hell,slaughtering at the beat of the riffs makes you feel insanely badass,and the game itself motivates you to keep up the beat with a max streak rewarding you with the amazing voices of different metal legends.The boss fights didn't felt creative and lazy in design,but i guess it makes sense in a lore perspective and they all kinda have their own thing.\n\nThe story is very good in my opinion,not the best,but it does has a lot of lore potential im interested in.The Unknown is a literal female,demonic doom slayer,and Paz is a very likable narrator.The artwork is also as incredible as the music itself,turning every single aspect of this game into a beautiful piece of art\n\nI truly hope this game gets a sequel or even a DLC expansion to continue the story to the heavens,slaughter new enemies and see how many other iconic metal vocalists they can get to bless our ears.My only complain is that the game ends in general,but is very short in the end.It also broke

Occasionally a girl does chime in with some mellifluous vocals, and Serj Tankian comes on for the final boss fight. The arenas lock up after entering them until cleared, and monsters spawn in waves out of thin air in predetermined points in the arena. Levels are essentially corridors, and there is no platforming.\n\nThe shooting is pretty simple, but every weapon has an ultimate attack. Some of these can help get some breathing room when overwhelmed. Weapons include a sword; skull with a low-damage regular ranged attack with an ability to charge it up and freeze enemies in place; a customary shotgun; a set of revolvers; an area-of-effect crossbow; and a set of scythes. There is no BFG-equivalent here.\n\nYou have your basic, weak and numerous melee feeder enemies; a couple of larger and tougher melee enemies who can quickly close the distance; and a selection of ranged enemies - grounded or airborne - who have telegraphed hitscan or projectile-based attacks with dumb or homing projectiles. Some have an area of-effect attack to prevent the player from getting too close and staying there. Every level culminates in a boss fight with a big flying head which fires projectiles and spawns waves of enemies.\n\nIn addition to the regular levels, there are \"Torments\" - time-limited challenges which, if completed, award the player with bonuses like faster Ultimate attack meter build-up or room-for-error allowance to perform a few actions off-beat without losing the hit-streak multiplier. These arenas can also serve as practice.\n\nTrying the harder difficulties with spongier enemies, no player revives, and stricter rhythmic window made me realise I have no idea what a \"beat\" actually is. Basic movement and jumping off-beat is allowed unlike in The Crypt of the Necrodancer. However, shooting off-beat deals almost no damage, and having to lay it into a single enemy while getting swarmed by the others can get rather disheartening (regular enemies do not seem to have remaining health indicators to help decide if an enemy should be \"focused\"). Getting one of the achievements involves passing a level without a single action off-beat, even evasive dashes, and that seems impossible at this reviewer's skill-level. If requirements for beat-matching become too much, it can be turned off completely in accessibility settings.\n\nOn \"Goat\" - the medium difficulty - the game took around eight hours to play through the story and all \"Torments\". One thing to note here - since one of the \"Torments\" requires weakening enemies first to perform executions on them, it seems a higher difficulty has to be selected for it, as the enemies have less health on lower ones and die before an execution can be performed on them (alternatively, the game recommends selecting a weaker weapon, but, to my untrained eye, that seemed less efficient). I find the game length to be plenty to show off what is on offer here.", "timestamp_created": 1675605756, "timestamp_updated": 1675634966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

I think the soundtrack is a bit too much screaming metal than what I'm into.\nAnd I will not say \"This game is better than BPM\" because both games have good things about each.\n\nPros: Setting, graphics, gameplay. I'm satisfied with this. The attack on beat is forgiving as you still attack it's just weaker if you make a mistake.\nVoice acting for Pak is great. I'm not sure why they chose that voice but it's a nice decision. Story is very well written, it's pretty simple, but enough for myself to enjoy.\nWeapons are good and have reload bonuses for timing. I have favorites and it's nice to change up and use different things.\nAlso a pro: the final song with Serj.\n\nCons:\nEnemies do not all attack on the beat. I don't know why but I'm moving and shooting to the beat and some enemies do attack on beat (I think) but the ones that fire whenever they want are harder to fight, causing you to have to quickly do a off beat maneuver, jump or dash. This might not be a problem for everyone but it is a mild annoyance.\n\nI would like it if there are no enemies then the combo meter just pauses. If you're wanting to keep the combo meter high you have to have the skull out and always clicking to fire it to keep the combo going. I don't agree with this. Why not \"any\" weapon? Why only the skull? And while on this topic, why does it have to keep going between battle rooms? Like when exploring or such.\n\nMinor complaint: I would like a glory kill with the other weapons. When you hit E you dash forward and pull out the sword to finish people off. I would've liked to do it with the other weapons but this is just a nitpick and not a real problem.\n\nCon, but this is personal because of my taste in music so you don't have to consider this as fully part of my review score.\nI said it above, I really like the music but I don't like most of the vocals. It's fully a personal opinion, but I honestly cannot stand playing the game more than like 30 minutes at a time because of the screaming lyrics.\nException: Serj did a great job, and the female voice accompaniments for stage 2 and 3 are also really good.

It lacks in some aspects but overall I definitely recommend it. Record says I got 11.8 hours but I was AFK with the game open a few times, so I think I got about 10 hours out of the game. I only played in the highest difficulty available from the start (you unlock another difficulty level after finishing the game but I didn't feel like playing in that mode tbh). I only played in the lowest difficulty to cheese two awful achivements (Pazifist and Not shaken, nor stirred) \n\nOverall, a 7/10 for me and I certainly recommend it even at full price. Breakdown below:\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\n- Really damn good music, they got some awesome singers for the soundtrack. The band Two Feathers really composed some fantastic stuff. I liked 4 songs the most (This Devastation, Stygia, Dissolution and No Tomorrow), but the whole OST is awesome. Wish I could buy it but so far I haven't seen a way to do so.\n- Good performance and graphics.\n- I really appreciate the fact that this game includes an audio/video latency calibration tool. However, it suggested me values that I found just wrong for my PC (g-sync monitor with good g2g latency and an usb-c audio interface with low latency). I was unable to get Perfect reliably until I decided to leave everything in 0 ms instead of the values provided by the tool. That fixed the rhythm issue for me and improved my flow with the game a lot.\n- Great combo of rhythm game + FPS. The devs did great with the mechanics, such as the weapon and how the reload works, the fury mechanic and how the song changes depending on how well you're doing,  and keeping it simple with a three tier scoring (perfect, good, miss) for each input.\n- Pretty cool aesthetics overall in both enemies and hells design.\n- Alright variety of enemies with nice mechanics. Though I wish there had been more types of [spoiler] angels [/spoiler] for making the game more interesting on the later levels.\n- Good voice acting (MC doesn't talk, tho).\n\nMy annoyances with this game:\n\n- Repetitive bosses. I wish it had had more unique mechanics to each fight than [spoiler] bullet hell with a few variations + wave of enemies[/spoiler].\n- Levels could've been a bit less linear, maybe have two or three different paths.\n- Repetitive execution animations...if there had been some a few more variants it'd have been nice.\n- Not a fan of the \"animated\" drawings used for the story telling. I figure they were on a tight budget so I understand that, but still, I didn't like them much\n- Ran into a few bugs, mostly getting stuck in some enviroment props and having to restart (happend twice I think). Also the execution animation of the tall elites sometimes glitched and the enemy's legs clipped through the floor. This happened more than 10 times probably.\n- Can't quick restart torments (challenges you complete to unlock perks). After failing some very challenging torments, having to sit a few seconds through the defeat animation plus a progress bar filling got old. It was faster to press ESC and restart than sitting through that, especially when I knew I had messed up and wouldn't win that run.\n- They added collectibles in a post release update to unlock skins for the weapons, but really, I don't understand why the devs thought it'd be a good idea to spread them in 3 difficulty levels. I wish that if I played in the highest difficulty, I'd be able to obtain them all at once, not having to play the same level at least 3 times - assuming I was able to find them in one run. Also I pretty much never found one on my own, only thanks to guides I was able to get a few, but by then I just gave up and decided to enjoy the game than looking obsessively to every single nook and cranny trying to get find one. In other words, it was a frustrating addition that took me out of the gameplay if Itried to find them.\n\nThe game could get a sequel given how the story goes, and I hope it does. I'd buy the sequel if it also has more great metal songs. Although if they went for a less brutal metal direction I'd also be interested. There's a lot of metal subgenres that could fit a siege to [spoiler] heaven.

The more in tune you are with the music the more fuel you are rewarded with. Not just your damage is boosted, but some things will change about your weapons when you shoot or hit in time. \n\nnow that my cringey explanation is out of the way i'm going to share my Pros:\nAscetically the game is one of the most interesting I've seen in a long time, it transitions to different levels of hell that are all different from the last, and each one has its own theme, as well as its own song. Some aspects of the environment will interact with your modifier, the higher the modifier the more spectacular it seems to be. you will see stuff like the torches pulse in time with the music, or those sparklers you would see at a metal concert go off all around the map.\n\nThe voice of the narrator is awesome, the lines are witty at times, and are as smooth as butter to listen to, I wish that he would talk more.\n\nThe enemies all have a different feel to them, but are all equally as bad-ass as the next one, and each bring something to the fight, and sort of compliment each other when it comes to making your life as difficult as possible sometimes.\n\nThe weapons are satisfying to use, and each one is unique.

Each is incredibly distinct and adds a metric F^@K ton to the soundtrack.\n\n[b] BUT [/b], I have one gripe and one suggestion with the music, plus one gripe for game play.\n\nMusic Gripe: The tempo can be a bit tedious after a while. For the most part, the BPM of each track is pretty similar, + a few for the Aspects and the double time of the Sword's ultimate ability. A bit more diversity in the tracks speed would be much appreciated in any DLC/Sequel. I understand that you wanna keep the core mechanics, i.e. the BPM, semi-consistent throughout the game, but it shouldn't be too much to expect that a player can handle faster/different speeds as the game progresses. \n\nMusic Suggestion: Imma be real, while I really do love the vocalists brought in, they're just not enough. The atmosphere of this game is LITERALLY Hell. There exists no place more evil, horrific, terrifying and brutal. As such, the music should reflect the environment. How? Bring in some Deathcore vocalists. [u]I'm talking Dickie Allen, I'm talking Ben Duer, I'm talking Will Ramos, I'm talking Kyle Anderson[/u]; all these dudes/ a ton of Deathcore musicians are massive nerds and would certainly love to have a hand in something like this. Sure, I understand, the vast majority of metal fans may not appreciate it as much as a Serj or Matt, but perhaps allow other vocalists to produce \"covers\" of certain tracks and release them as DLC. That's one DLC pack I'd buy in a heartbeat.\n\nGame play Suggestion: I gotta say, while its necessary for clean gameplay, I wish we had more options for beats to hit other than beats 1 and 3 of a bar. Especially in [spoiler] the final track with Serj [/spoiler], it took every fiber of my being not to click along to the 3:4 patterns of the track, as deviating from the 1/3 template would result in lower scores. I'd love if song-specific subdivisions were perhaps included as additional beats to hit. I know it could confuse some and would necessitate more work, but I feel the value added and the incentive it would create to implement more diverse tracks far outweighs any drawbacks.", "timestamp_created": 1674249999, "timestamp_updated": 1674250336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131230343": {"recommendationid": "131230343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198998454258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1695655878}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently my favourite game of all time.

I was having a little bit of problems with syncing at first, and it turned out I was trying to sync it up wrong. I would also recommend just doing a general play-through of a round first to see if your device is syncing the audio and visuals up with your actions on its own.

I do like that you can change game difficulties. It helps me to not feel as overwhelmed and get practice in on a lower difficulty, if needed. \n\nOverall, I'd say it's worth the money and I think it's a lot of fun. You can always wait until it goes on sale, too. AND there's a free demo, which I appreciated, because it gave me the chance to try out the game to see if I liked it before investing my money into it.

Rhythm games are my bread and butter, but nothing I do seems to line the visuals up with the audio in this case, which is a shame because the mechanics at play would be perfect if it would just sync up. I've done my best to research this issue to no avail. Most threads just explain how to calibrate at all, rather than the most effective approach to calibrating. I've tried sitting and down and messing with the settings manually and through the quick calibration of the game, and I tried waiting to see if maybe an update would address my issue. Alas, I'm forced to leave a negative review for what's probably an incredible game. The music, the visuals, and the plot have all clearly had a good amount of care put into them, but it's far too tedious for me to see those things through when I can't get the game to function as intended. \n\nI'm running a 4K 144HZ HDR Monitor with a Ryzen 9 and MSI 3080 12 Gb for reference", "timestamp_created": 1674105755, "timestamp_updated": 1674105755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131126986": {"recommendationid": "131126986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052010244", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1694829772}, "language": "english", "review": "I never would have guess a bullet hell, shooter, rhythm game would be this good.
