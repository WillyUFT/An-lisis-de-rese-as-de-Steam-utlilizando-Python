I snagged it.\n\nI  just finished installing it and fired it up. I found the usual issues with an older port but had no problem working them out. Got in the game was really excited  to see some familiar game concepts much like the Devil May Cry series that I have played extensively.\n\nSo I plugged away, and part way through  the combat tutorial I noticed something that I hadn't  figured on.

Every game in the series offered something unique to build off the previous one. FF13 offered a classic Final Fantasy story with one of the best protagonist, 13-2 gave us an expanded universe of time, space, and entourage. And with Lightning returns... it gives us the human, the ones that are the reason we are on this journey in the first place.\n\nThe side-quests play a vital role in the story and lore of the series. It humanizes the experience in a way the game hasn't done before. Doing what we're suppose to do versus knowing why we're doing it makes all the difference. \n\nThe game is sluggish to start, truthfully. I did ask myself during the early stages, \"Do I really care?\" In those moments, I didn't. I allowed prenotions to guide my feelings during that time, but once I continued on it was well worth the time spent. It surprised me, in more ways than one. \n\nThe main story is only half of the game...journeying through the side-quests makes it whole. There were many moments where -everything clicked-. I could see the beauty, the flaw, and raw in each one who asked for my assistance. It was situations you could both sympathize and empathize with. It weaved that emotional attachment to the world-little by little-to understand the 'why'.\n\nStory aside, there are a few unresolved gameplay glitches that can mess your enjoyment and time. The ones I've experienced are sudden simulation freezes after a battle (it will be an empty screen, failing to load). While only happening a few times, this took out quite a bit of progress done prior. I recommend always saving (and multiple save files) after a long-stretch of a main/side mission and at particular points of interest to save time.\n\nThe second bug is something I have not seen anyone (over all these years) experience. When you travel to the second location, I recommend not speaking to any of the food vendors until you accept a side-quest mission 'Family Food' (which is very close by). I ran through all the vendors prior of accepting that quest and there was nothing I could do to continue it. It failed to interact the story, making it forever stuck.\n\nThis game also has a NewGame+ feature. Do not fret if you somehow can't complete (or fail) every single thing in the game the first time...because you literally can't.\n\nAlso, go the the top left of your screen when in-game. If you had to adjust only one setting, let it be 'Color Correction: Advanced'. There is no other setting that makes the game look more modern. That yellow hue is GONE!\n\nIf you've made the commitment from 13 and 13-2...this is your journey's end. The story, the atmosphere, the characters... all of it. It's worth it.

While there are places where you can see that the budget was lower than the original 13, Lightning Returns has a lot of interesting ideas, but some of them are quite a bit different than I expected.\n\nThe overall premise of having a time limit felt like we were leading up to a Majora's Mask style time loop but that's not really the case. The game is quite generous with time if you utilize the timestop to the point where I slept through the last few days. This is odd, given that the game waits to open up some new mechanics until your second loop, such as leveling up equipment but you can clear it on the first run. The concept of no direct levels but getting your stats from completing quests worked well overall, and getting special drops and upgrade materials from extincting enemy types is a fairly unique system, though it does turn into a bit of a grind. The combat system is entirely different from 13 and 13-2 and I personally found it hard to ideally manage the ATB gauges. I'm not sure if that's a color blind thing or a sheer visual clutter thing but it wasn't the clearest but it's a much more active system than the others.\n\nThe story picks up directly from 13-2 and it's fine, there is definitely not enough main plot for the amount of time you have.

I love this game so much, If it resonates with you as much as it did with me, I'm sure you'll have a great time. But man... Squex and PC ports.\n\nI picked this game up on PC for two reasons:\nPerformance, and the ability to turn off the godforsaken timer.\n\n\nI was then faced with the atrocity that is this game's button layout. Holy, god damn. It would have been fine if we could re-map keys as you liked, but you can't. So it's either controller, or one hell of a transition period in order to get used to it. If you can get past that I recommend at least trying the game, while being aware of the in-game timer. \n\n\nI for one fall into the: hating-FFXIII-3's-timer-camp. Squex tried something, it failed. It's not horrible, and you can definitely still complete the game with plenty of time left; but that doesn't excuse the fact that it shouldn't be there, at all. It places unnecessary stress on the player for no reason, and that's basically my gripe with it. A casual player won't have more fun because of the timer's existence. And it baffles me that the implementation they went with, went through. While the lore backs up the timer, there are many other ways that Squex could have gone about making time pass in relation to the game; many of which don't involve unloading the responsilbility on the player.\n\n\nOther than that: The story is okay, the combat is hit or miss based on preference, the same goes for atmosphere, and the soundtrack slaps.\n\n\nAnyways, great game, very hard end-boss, horrid keybinds for [strike]M[/strike]&KB, and an unecessary timer (which can thankfully be removed on pc) \ud83d\udc4d.", "timestamp_created": 1694979781, "timestamp_updated": 1694979781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146421031": {"recommendationid": "146421031", "author": {"steamid": "76561199246946600", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 813, "last_played": 1694887827}, "language": "english", "review": "i thought this was very boring game. its almost like playing online which i really didnt like the online versions either.", "timestamp_created": 1694890969, "timestamp_updated": 1694890969, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146183041": {"recommendationid": "146183041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247162038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2333, "last_played": 1696631718}, "language": "english", "review": "I've definitely got more than 38 hours in this game lol, most of them are on the ps3 release tho.\n\nThis is a good port of the original (or at least i've not had any issues with it so far), and i've always liked the combat system in this game despite its departure from turn based gameplay that was expected from FF at the time.", "timestamp_created": 1694543700, "timestamp_updated": 1694543700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145925198": {"recommendationid": "145925198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053149914", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1528, "playtime_at_review": 723, "last_played": 1700514732}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Final Fantasy con una historia sencilla, un sistema de combate basado en \"jobs\" que te hace formularte las batallas.", "timestamp_created": 1694193055, "timestamp_updated": 1694193055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145809601": {"recommendationid": "145809601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024397157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3165, "last_played": 1697739334}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun action RPG, my personal favourite of the XIII trilogy.

While the removal of xp from killing monsters is an odd choice, it let me simply just avoid monsters when I wanted, and not feel like I had to passively farm them for some carrot on stick. Movement was actually very good feeling especially since you could sprint and jump/parkour around the map. You also had a time limit, which was pretty generous along with several mechanics that allowed you to feel really in control of what you were doing. Most importantly, the combat felt very nice and I can see that this would eventually become the foundation for FF15's and 7 remake's battle system, which is very nice and they should keep it like that. Everything was swell until the last act where difficulty simply spiked to the high heavens and the final fight became a slog. \n\n[h1]The Story:[/h1]\nIn short, the story was utter garbage that had no business being made for this setting. It seemed confused and had no proper focus causing a lot of it to just be random ramblings that get boring to listen to. This is before I touch on the fact that the premise is ridiculous and somehow more detached than the previous game which also did a terrible job with their story. Also putting the number 13 in things did not add to the story, nor did it really fit in any real way. Save for the characters, nothing was connected in any meaningful way. Any world building done by one game was thrown out by the next and by the time we get to the current setting, there is such a disconnect and lack of focus that it feels like another high budget fan-fiction. This is all because it tried to do too many things with it's plot and only succeeded at doing none of them well. It had the makings of a potentially good story as a base idea, but the execution was done terribly and it only executed my desire to learn any more of this story. \n\n[h1]The Visuals:[/h1]\nThe game was pleasant to look at, and the movie scenes were interesting to look at. The environments were designed well and I really loved the atmosphere created by the two cities that were in the game. That seems to be the one thing, no matter which game they seem to get incredibly right. The thing that seems to be lacking is the armor/weapon options. Half of Lightning's potential outfits were an ugly mess of belts and zippers that just somehow feel like it didn't fit her at all. Sadly this is the one game where the bonus DLC outfits seemed to fit better than the ones in the game. \n\n[h1]The Sound:[/h1]\nThe voice acting was superb as always, and we even get the bonus of almost any interaction you could have being voiced. The sound effects where also appropriate sounding, giving you the right oomph to your hits and swings. The music was also much better than it's predecessor 13-2 which was a mess. My only issue is the Victory Fan-fare happened to be the worst of all 3. I ended up using DLC outfits to avoid that cacophony. \n\n\n[h1]The Experience:[/h1]\nThis was a mixed bag, a true love/hate relationship was born from this game. I hated the story, but enjoyed the majority of the interactions that were generally not touching the overarching plot. I liked most of the music but really hated the fanfare. And I loved the game play until they started to enter end game where it became very tedious and seemed to favor the grind more and more. I enjoyed doing the side-quests (even though a lot of people did not) and ended up finishing it in 6 in game days. Unfortunately that is exactly the amount of time you are considered in the beginning of the game - after that you must grind to level up your skills. Ultimately, the game was not a completely bad experience, but since its major selling point is the story, and in order to get this game you have to play the travesty that is XIII-2, then this is a hard non-recommend. I went from enjoying 13, to understanding why no one ever talked about it, it was just not great after it was all said and done. Also the constant reference to the number 13 in literally anything that could be find was kind of annoying and is almost poetic to how the whole experience was for me.

These quests barely reveal anything about the games barebones world, only one or two of them have interesting characters and SO MANY of them don't care about the fact that every human being should have 500+ years of life experience and are about to face the end of all things. The game doesn't really offer you anything worthwhile outside of quests since thats the only way you can \"level up\" in this game, so you'll frequently find yourself just ignoring enemies. which is a shame! the combat is just ok! which is better than being held hostage by a quest giver telling you how much he really wants you to find his boil cream or some shit.\n\nI liked the broad strokes of the world, I like the places that the main characters end up in the quests, their paths makes sense after having 500+ years of hopelessness beat down on them. it really just feels like the side quest writers were a pair of interns that were just given the task of \"make quest to fill time\" It's even more insulting when they slap a comically large pair of glasses or huge top hat on a npc that has a very serious quest that deals with horrific violence or death, I've never felt so insulted dedicating my time to a game than I did listening to those gmod avatars.\n\nI understand the game was rushed, and I understand they reused almost every single asset just to make the game done on time..... BUT..... If this really is the final product even after all that? they should have just shortened the scope waaaaaaaay more. make it completely linear if it means that more people could have their eyes on the storytelling and localization. What a lame duck after all the amazing things 13-2 did.\n\nIt goes without saying this game suffers from openworlditis. The only way to salvage this game is a complete remake and overhaul (like what ff7 got), you can even keep the nice cinematics since those are the nicest parts of the whole game.\n\nI'd say still play 13-2 if you liked 13, then just watch the cutscenes on youtube for this one and you'll have a satisfying ending movie to the trilogy. it's not worth dedicating any more of your time to the \"just ok\" combat.\n\nEither that, or I'll see you in 13 years when they announce a complete remake of the trilogy (lol).", "timestamp_created": 1693603748, "timestamp_updated": 1693603748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604193747043609619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145400583": {"recommendationid": "145400583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310688871", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 111, "playtime_at_review": 6898, "last_played": 1700715093}, "language": "english", "review": "Final Fantasy VII Aerith not here in this game", "timestamp_created": 1693510595, "timestamp_updated": 1693510595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494809657335281372", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145326070": {"recommendationid": "145326070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967608474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1356, "playtime_at_review": 5113, "last_played": 1700695939}, "language": "english", "review": "As the name suggests, Lightning Returns gives back the spotlight to Lightning, the unrelenting, inexorable heroine from FF XIII. In this entry she will be thrusted into a dying world as the servant of an omnipotent deity, and will be tasked with carrying out the god's designs in what seems to be the only chance left for an agonizing humanity. Despite this central role, Lightning remains a humble character. As she answers the pleas of those in need, she will also realize the flaws within herself, turning her quest into a deeply psychological and introspective journey.\n\nThe combat is very novel, responsive and interactive. With only one controllable character, your gear and skills will be divided among three attires, each one with an independent configuration. You will be able to switch between these attires freely while fighting, allowing you to adapt to every situation. Timing and resource management is important, as is paying attention to the enemy's movement. This will seem challenging at first but with every battle you'll learn the patterns of your adversaries, thus gaining the insight on how to engage them. Multiple setups are viable, the system is fluid and lets you experiment while rewarding your creativity. \n\nAlthough the world is open and encourages exploration, progression is slow but very rewarding. Even with a limited number of days at your disposal, patience is essential. Completing missions will improve your statistics and health pool, and I recommend to do as many of these as possible.  While some might be long and time-consuming, they all earn important rewards and carry a story worth hearing.

Easily one of my all time favourite Final Fantasies out there, housing some of my most beloved FF characters, one of my favourite FF protagonists to date (seriously Lightning is just [i]chefs kiss[/i]), a great OST, combat system and gameplay loop and a really solid story arc as well which of course is a continuation of FFXIII and FFXIII-2.\nPlus you get to play dress up simulator with Lightning, so what's not to love?\n\nDespite the above it does have it's pros and cons of course, so here's a few of the things I think it does right and doesn't do so well with, I won't go too hard here because there's a lot I could say that would be very spoilery and because I already know this is going to be a massive wall of text after what I do want to mention is said;\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Combat system is extremely diverse and unique, while it is difficult to master and perfect it is one of the most rewarding combat systems ever in a Final Fantasy. You only get to control Lightning and won't have any other permanent party members but you have a ton of different outfits you can dress Light in and all of them have different effects and abilities which while some allow you to mix and match a little bit of everything to make the perfect builds, others have exclusive abilities locked to them which can be pretty fun to play around with and min-max. It's definitely different to anything you've probably seen in other FF games, but it works so well in this one because of how the games setup.\n\n[*]OST is absolutely phenomenal, there isn't a single bad track in this game and there won't be any you get tired of quickly, everything just hits right.\n\n[*]There is TONS of content! I really do mean that, there is so much to do in this game that it can legitimately take multiple full playthroughs to collect all unique gear and do everything you need for 100%.\n\n[*]The Boss fights for this game are really outstanding and actually difficult to beat if you don't build into fighting them correctly. The highlight for me was a special form of the final boss only fightable after clearing the secret Ultimate Lair on hard mode and it's probably one of the hardest fights in the franchise, the feeling you'll get after beating it is one you won't forget. Good luck!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Now I personally don't mind this, but the time mechanic this game has can be daunting for new players during their first playthrough so technically it's not so much a con as it is a pro subjectively. Basically in this game there's a Majora's Mask esc time mechanic where if time runs out, you lose the game. But what's interesting about this is instead of just getting a game over and needing to revert saves, it plays directly into the story and you automatically enter NG+, even without actually beating the game first. You'll carry over everything from that failed playthrough into the new one but enemies won't really get any stronger either so \"losing\" isn't as bad as you think. As well as this you will need multiple playthroughs to get as strong as possible anyway so sometimes failing a run might help you beat the game for real. However don't worry, the game gives you loads of opportunities to freeze time, and even without freezing it you still have plenty of time to do pretty much everything in the game before it runs out or you see the end credits.\n\n[*]The Side Quests... Ok not all of them are that bad but a lot of them are very traditional MMO like, just loads of fetch quests with nothing in-between them, lot's of go here and get this or kill this and boom here's your reward but there are some exceptions, some of the quests add to the story and are just really solid in general but most won't be quite as fulfilling, so be warned. However despite that I do highly recommend doing as many if not all of them as they're the only way to get stronger in this game.\n\n[*]The PC ports performance issues. First off this is more subjective than anything because the performance of this game is FAR better than the ports of 13 and 13-2, this one doesn't need any enhancements to actually get past the title screen and will sit at an almost perfect 60fps most of the time on good high end PC's, however you will 100% experience some hefty frame drops during gameplay in specific areas of the game. It will chug a little more frequently for people with mid to low range PC's, so for the most part this game will have almost no issues, but I'm throwing this in cons because when it chugs...

I am biased but I can't recommend this and the whole 13 trilogy enough to both new and old Final Fantasy fans alike who still haven't gotten around to trying them, or still have a sour taste about them after the bad rep they got on release.

Protagonist & only playable character in this game, Lightning, awakens from her crystal slumber (part of the DLC scenario in [i]Final Fantasy XIII-2[/i]) and encounters Bhunivelze, the God of Light. For the third time (!) in this trilogy, she ends up being tasked by a god, only this time to \u201csave the souls\u201d of the dying world\u2019s denizens.\n\nThe most important aspect about the new setting is the aforementioned time limit (6 days before the apocalypse), which is not only a narrative device but also shaping the gameplay: The in-game  clock runs continuously and only stops during dialogues or battles. Certain actions (e.g. taking a train or escaping from fights on higher difficulties) might even lose you entire hours. If you don\u2019t manage to fulfill your tasks in time, it\u2019s game over and you\u2019ll have to try again in New Game+. You can extend your time limit by \u201csaving souls\u201d (= completing main/side missions) up to a certain point but there\u2019s no way to rewind time, if you want to replay certain days for example.\n\nTime-limited missions in videogames are usually far from beloved, so time-limiting an entire game is a bold and interesting choice. Unfortunately, the gamble doesn\u2019t work out in the end. As mentioned, the time limit can only be extended by completing main/side missions. As a matter of fact, there\u2019s even an entire extra day & dungeon locked behind completing a certain amount of side quests (= most of them). Even worse, the only way to increase your stats (health, attack, etc.) apart from better equipment is by completing quests - since fighting random monsters only rewards money as well as Energy Point (EP), which can be used to perform powerful abilities.\n\nSpeaking of EP, here\u2019s a tip for those who are wary about the time limit but still want to play the game: One of the EP abilities does include the power to stop the in-game clock for a short while. There\u2019s also a mod to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/lightningreturnsfinalfantasy13/mods/13?tab=description]make this ability free[/url], which means you can explore Nova Chrysalia for as long as you wish, as long as you keep using the time-stop ability.\n\nTo get back on point, completing side quests is the main gameplay focus of [i]Lightning Returns[/i] (apart from the main missions), as they strengthen Lightning\u2019s stats and extend the overall time limit. This shouldn't be a problem, side quests are more interesting than killing monsters over & over again, but the ones featured here are of dull MMO-fetch quality \u2013 and work-intensive to locate.\n\nThe world of [i]Lightning Returns[/i] offers four different locations with surprisingly few ways to traverse them: Apart from the occasional train or rare teleport, you\u2019ll spend most of the time just running around. And there\u2019s another catch: Only main missions are marked on the map. So if you even just want to start a side quests, you\u2019ll have to manually scout the locations for potential quest givers.\n\nThis can take a lot of time, especially since some quest givers only appear during certain hour of the day or have other preliminary conditions that need to be fulfilled. So unless you want to scout all locations multiple times a day, which is a lot of boring footwork, there\u2019s still a big chance you\u2019re going to miss quite a few side quests - unless you came prepared with a [url=https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Lightning-Returns-Final-Fantasy-13/walkthrough]detailed guide[/url].\n\nAnd that\u2019s only starting the side quests. If you want to do enough to reach the bonus dungeon, you\u2019ll also spend a lot of time running around just doing them. Again, they\u2019re basically MMO-style fetch quests, boring gameplay-wise and surprisingly boring narrative-wise as well, considering the world is about to end. Yet there\u2019s still someone that wants you to kill X or get trivial thing Y for you, as if they didn\u2019t have bigger trouble to take care of. Only a few missions are slightly more memorable, which is just a waste of the unique setting.\n\nThe main missions of [i]Lightning Returns[/i] are only slightly more interesting compared to the side missions. They might offer bosses and sometimes even dungeons, but the bosses all follow the \u201cstagger, shock, slash\u201d formula and the dungeons are uninteresting affairs, with very simple puzzles or platforming challenges set in uninspired locations. Surprisingly, time only plays a part during one particular dungeon as well, where doors only open at certain times.\n\nAt least the modified ATB battle system is still fun: Instead of utilizing different party members, protagonist and [url=https://press.na.square-enix.com/LIGHTNING-BECOMES-A-FASHION-ICON-IN-LOUIS-VUITTONS-SERIES-4-CAMPAIGN]literal Louis Vuitton model[/url] Lightning can switch between customizable outfits to fulfill different roles in battle. It does take some time to get used to it and even on normal difficulty certain fights can take quite long but if you wrap your head around it, it\u2019s a decent refinement of what came before.\n\nTo sum things up, while the battle system is decent enough, the dull main and side missions are boring busywork. It\u2019s also quite annoying that a guide is basically necessary, if you want to make sure you finish all the side quests you might need. But what about the story?\n\nUnsurprisingly, the story of [i]Lightning Returns[/i] is turning the interesting setting into a predictable, messily told journey. Again, this is the third time Lightning became a servant of god and with all the time-travel trouble that came before, it\u2019s not surprising that the story feels weighed down by the mess the predecessors created.\n\nInitially, it seems like the game wants to fix that by focusing on Lightning alone, sidelining returning characters from the previous games. The problem here is that Lightning isn\u2019t a very interesting protagonist, her stoicism and little-to-no character development make for a pretty bland combination. As the story of the game continues, the focus does briefly touch upon Lightning and her relationship to previous characters. But fans especially aren\u2019t going to be delighted to hear that most of the returning characters are also quite different from how they used to be \u2013 which isn\u2019t that surprising since 500 years have passed but the game also doesn\u2019t spend enough time on them to really justify that change.\n\nSpeaking of time, ironically for a game with a constant time limit, the story pacing is all over the place, with basically no progress until the final day arrives. The explanation for that is quite easy: Every day before the final day is exactly the same, no matter what you did before. Even completing main quests doesn\u2019t have any lasting consequences until the ending arrives. Which means that the story is basically stuck or only moving forward in small steps until the last few hours of the game, where a lot of pathos is used to cover up the uneven build-up. And while the ending won\u2019t disappoint fans, it\u2019s also a predictable affair that\u2019s not going to surprise anyone.\n\nTo conclude, [i]Lightning Returns[/i] is a game with interesting ideas (setting, time limit) but held back by some gameplay decisions (dull questing) and its messy story not making most out of the setting. It\u2019s a game that should be just fine for fans of what came before \u2013 but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t manage to elevate/wrap-up the \u201cLightning saga\u201d in any meaningful way.", "timestamp_created": 1689340615, "timestamp_updated": 1689365501, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56258624792098999", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141680656": {"recommendationid": "141680656", "author": {"steamid": "76561199250913812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 890, "playtime_at_review": 31458, "last_played": 1700344098}, "language": "english", "review": "Delves unabashedly into religious and political issues and flips them all the bird.

You need to play with a guide since the game is pretty complicated to get 100% achievements or to beat bosses (Really challenging).\nDefinitely One of the Best series I've ever played so far. I just love everything about this game series, Like : the stories of each characters, Characters are unique each one, battle system are pretty unique each series, OST are just TOP QUALITY. Thank you SQUARE ENIX for making such amazing game. I just couldn't stop enjoying this game and wanted even more but im pretty satisfied with the ending.

There are 5 main quests before you reach the end in order to unlock the final day, with its small dungeon, unique enemies and final boss. If you fail to do so, you'll end the playthrough prematurely and enter New Game Plus. The time limit and management gimmick can appear scary to some, but it is definitely not oppressive (especially considering the availability of the Easy Mode), as you can stop time over and over by spending points you get by killing enemies.\nMonster species can be extinguished by Lightning, resulting in her facing the \"Last One\" version of it, granting unique loot.\nSpeaking of Lightning, she is the only playable character. In combat, you can swap between three Schemata (which are builds, with their respective equipment and skills), all of which have their separated ATB gauge. The building aspect of the game can be very entertaining, as you can influence the capacity and speed of the ATB gauge, upgrade skills (dropped by enemies or looted from chests) by spending other copies of them, and so on and so forth. This results in a much more interesting and entertaining level-up system compared to the Crystogen Points from the two previous games.\nCombat is much more deep and entertaining than XIII and XIII-2. It is way more action-oriented, and each skill has unique traits to itself. One particular skill is even buffed and gets a new, better animation if you wield a specific type of weapon.\nThroughout said 13 days you get to free roam around 4 medium-big open maps, each of which containing enemies unique to them, and lots of side quests. DLCs are included (some missing from the console version) and come in the form of exclusive and unique gear for Lightning.\n\nNarratively, this game did not do a very good job. The presentation of the ruin of some characters' (caused by the ending of the previous game) is lackluster at best. This game means to make you feel characters were \"reset\" by the advent of Chaos, and it manages to do so, though it could have done it much better. On the bright side of things, Lumina, a new character, is introduced, and I consider her one of the best presented and written characters of the trilogy alongside Noel, Caius and Yeul. This game does not come with side novels to read as its ending is an ending for good.\n\nAs usual, graphics are good, soundtrack great, and the dub is also good.\n\nAs a PC port, while still being lackluster and poorly optimised, it is the best of the three, and very much bearable, with no third parties fixes (as there's no need for them). The console version is still obviously much better (especially considering the 60fps on Xbox Series X/S), but this PC port remains ok still, and has lots less graphics fidelity issues compared to XIII and especially XIII-2, thus I do recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1685720887, "timestamp_updated": 1686671203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139215853": {"recommendationid": "139215853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247171326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 4383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4383, "last_played": 1685340759}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Todos los personajes carecen de personalidad (chida) es un fork de Kingdom Hearts y el sistema de evoluci\u00f3n de los comandos (sorcery) es ridisurdo y el jefes final no es muy interesante (adem\u00e1s la historia es demasiado absurda)", "timestamp_created": 1685371442, "timestamp_updated": 1685371442, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48298218846321106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139189249": {"recommendationid": "139189249", "author": {"steamid": "76561199502269093", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 935, "last_played": 1695699436}, "language": "english", "review": "i love her sm", "timestamp_created": 1685325761, "timestamp_updated": 1685325761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139182708": {"recommendationid": "139182708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064608698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1685313600}, "language": "english", "review": "As a FF 13 apologist, damn this thing SUCKS", "timestamp_created": 1685314388, "timestamp_updated": 1685314388, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479437708854675293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139067910": {"recommendationid": "139067910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274587850", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3213, "last_played": 1685173201}, "language": "english", "review": "A good, if very flawed game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1685173229, "timestamp_updated": 1685173229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138873811": {"recommendationid": "138873811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119439494", "num_games_owned": 1315, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1684883085}, "language": "english", "review": "I've attempted to get through this game a few times but i just can't, the game does my head in.

It's mostly a walking sim, there is little progression within the world, and most of the time you are running trying to find the thing that will complete the quest. It's super mindless. Very little is marked, even less makes sense.\nC) Time Limit. You have a certain amount of time to complete as many quests as possible. Some of these quests are not available at certain times. So much time was wasted running around looking around every corner for something that is easy to miss, only to find out that the thing you were looking for wasn't available until much later in the day, resulting in a TON of wasted time.\nD) Quests are how you \"level\". Killing enemies does very little for you. The only real sources of power progression is better gear and completing quests.\n\nThis game is tedious, It's boring. There is no redeeming value. It's a spreadsheet game. A timetable simulator.\n\nFFXIII had a good ending, didn't need a sequel.\nFFXIII-2 had a good ending (and story with a relatable villain).

Wasn't a fan of XIII or XIII-2. Out of all the mainline Final Fantasy's, I found the FF13 games to be the weakest. It really struggles with an overly convoluted plot that it fails to deliver coherently (though the lore is not necessarily bad), mixed with bad characters with questionable motives (except Sazh), and IMO a fairly boring combat-system.\n\nBut imagine my surprise to find this game is actually one of the best in the whole series. They revamped the combat-system in a fantastic way, kept the story simple and somewhat self-contained (but pulling from previous game just enough to keep things linked and continuous to wrap up loose story points), and finally they actually made me care about the characters. Lightning is generally too stoic for her own good, but here it really fits well. The plot setting is fantastic, and the limited-time element to get as much done before the looming final days really keeps the pacing going.\n\nGenuinely in my top 5 final fantasy games, and I still can't really believe it.", "timestamp_created": 1683558173, "timestamp_updated": 1683558173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137889105": {"recommendationid": "137889105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006307275", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5124, "last_played": 1683377352}, "language": "english", "review": "As an entry in the Final Fantasy series, it's pretty obvious that many people, with even a passing interest in JRPGs or the Final Fantasy universe in general, have already bought it and tried it, simply by its name alone.\n\nThis leaves the very few \"occasional\" potential purchasers, that may not be completely informed about this game... and to them it's [i]extremely[/i] hard to recommend a game like this, because there are not two ways about it: the early hours of Lightning Returns are [b]devastatingly miserable[/b].\n\nUpon starting the first run, the player is tasked with the objective of orienting themselves in a pretty peculiar world setting, made of 4 macro-areas that beg to be explored, while juggling a clock timer that forces a strictly objective-oriented gameplay style, all of this while listening to Hope and his machine-gun style of continuous expositions, the aural equivalent of an army of \"walls of text\".\n\nThe combat system, an attempt to re-purpose the paradigm-shift system of the first two chapters, to control the single character of Lightning, clashes with the controls seen in more \"traditional\" third-person action adventures: after a few tries, it's painfully clear that the system proposed here is far from intuitive, making \"twitch\" or strictly time-based moves way more difficult than they need to be, and is way better suited to macro-controlling a group of characters. Also, Lightning movement speed during combat is painfully slow, making quick re-positioning basically impossible via the standard controls.\n\nTo add insult to injury, having the difficulty settings labelled as easy/normal/hard does not help at all, as many new players will be tempted to select a \"normal\" difficulty for their first run, which is... uhm... [i]far from ideal[/i], as it introduces many unnecessary penalties to a gameplay experience that is already extremely challenging by default.\n\nSo, to sum things up, the quality of your experience with this game will strictly depend on your motivation to soldier through those chaotic first hours, master the peculiar combat system, and maybe even \"survive\" a few failures to reach the final day on your first attempts.\n\nThe prize for enduring those 10-20 hours of Chaos (pun intended) is a solid, albeit quite eccentric, gameplay experience.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned, I found the concepts presented here interesting, and competently aligned with the general \"Man versus God\" theme of the Final Fantasy 13 series.\n\nVisual production values are very high, except for a few instances of bad texturing (oh, hello \"desert rocks\"), or some polygonal models that elicit ilarity (oh, hi \"dog\"). \n\nAlso, the game really shines at 60 frames per second and high resolution, something that was not possible on PS3 about 10 years ago: the added fluidity is extremely noticeable during combat, and the high resolution makes justice to the stellar art direction.\n\nThe only downside to the graphics are the excessive particle effects during combat that, together with some unsolicited camera movements, make reading the state of the fight more difficult than necessary, especially when precise timing is required.\n\nMusic is an effective mix of familiar Final Fantasy 13 themes and new songs, and sound effects are flawlessy produced and extremely well done.\n\nAs far as this PC port is concerned, the game crashed on me a few times in a certain area, but saving is always available, so there's a workaround for that.\n\nAlso, controller vibration is completely absent.", "timestamp_created": 1683387644, "timestamp_updated": 1683387644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499053984880447388", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137795875": {"recommendationid": "137795875", "author": {"steamid": "76561199163276214", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 2866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2866, "last_played": 1674404289}, "language": "english", "review": "These tricks you're pulling\u2014they're not worthy of a god.", "timestamp_created": 1683231259, "timestamp_updated": 1683231259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137461623": {"recommendationid": "137461623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269355710", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1690469374}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1682743714, "timestamp_updated": 1682743714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464285701513290405", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137405800": {"recommendationid": "137405800", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216874041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1689204134}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good, and I used to play on ps3, happy I got again the fun game", "timestamp_created": 1682662841, "timestamp_updated": 1682662841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137305593": {"recommendationid": "137305593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063845752", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 528, "last_played": 1682477122}, "language": "english", "review": "Some final fantasy characters, some final fantasy skills - but not a final fantasy game as it has no real narrative.

That shit sucked. Otherwise, the role selection and combination between each character felt pretty solid overall and you could consider which paths to focus on when choosing between focusing on stats first or detouring to abilities/passives.\nFF13-2 made some alterations, with no more animation interruption when changing paradigms, thank god.... and even let each of the two chars have access to ALL roles, because here came the new  system where you have to go catch and collect monster pets to fight beside you.... which meant having to farm drops to power them up or spend GIL to buy them at the shop... and then making sure the monster had the right abilities, or the right stat growth, and the right passives that could be passed on to other pets and collect all the various pets you needed to make the one final end-game pet for its type because each pet can only have one role..... and also each main character only learned specific buffs from synergist.. but at least you could now buy weapons from the shop.\nand so we arrive at ff13-3... where you are only one character that will sometimes have to fight 2-5 monsters at a time and expend ATB to both block and attack in an active combat model that is no longer 'turn' based. The intention of the change is nice for more active combat that imo the entire ff13 line should have had, except here they do not intend for you to simly stand by and recharge your ATB, no you have to SWAP lightning from one of 3 customizable forms, that all have their own independent gear to maintain and look after, and only one neck and one ring accessory EACH that do not share these bonuses.\nSo you get your atks out and your block adn your spells that each all ahve their own atb gauge cost as you actively fight..... and when you run out it recharges sooooooooooooo slow, so the game makes you change styles because ones that are not the active one recharge atb faster. so what does that mean? your physical damage dealer ran out of atb so now u gota swap it for something less optimal. Did your mage form run out of atb against a foe that is weak to magic? too bad, swap, because your mage role will recharge atb faster while its not active than simply keeping it out. Not only that but you also have to make sure you get them appropriate weapons to match what they need and shields (yes, SHIELDS now) that affect your blocking damage mitigation and other potential bonus stats.\n\nI can see some of the influences that went into ff15, especially since it was originally meant to be something akin to a side story or something for ff13, but eventually ended up being its own gamed, and ff15 did a lot better job of doing the active action combat for the most part (though i still feel my eyes roll whenever i remember the 'just hold atk button down for auto combo) as well as the ability to guard at the right time for more effective defense. Another slightly annoying thing is that you are limited in how many potions you can carry. actually, not just potions, but TOTAL CONSUMABLE ITEMS you can carry, period. you start the game with 6 max, and apparently expand it as you complete some missions or events. You also have some resource that you can fill by fighting called EP that you can use for some game mechanics like slowing time or even using them to get a full heal or in combat to extend the time u get to smack an enemy that is staggered and capitalize on the beatdown...........however all in all the things that you get screwed over for, the rush due to the lack of time, as well as the fact that you have to handle mobs all on one single character and be constantly aware of multiple potential enemies throwing ranged atks at you while you're trying to take care of this one mob because combat is STILL targetted at single enemies and you move SLOW AS HELL walking in combat really hurts.\n\nI would've honestly prefered to have a ff mmo that allowed you to customize abilities and evolve them like this system can, except with free movement and aim-to-attack, and potential class changes like ff14 (because to my taste, ff14 combat is slow and a bit of a turn-off for most classes, especially melee ones that have to weave those boring ass slow auto atks\n\nbut yeah, the story and concept were interesting but implementation felt like they totally missed the mark. ff15 did a much better job. I may have rolled my eyes a bit at it because most of it was side missions, but at least in ff15 I am pretty free to explore and do as I want in any order I want, and can command my party to use active abilities when I need them to, and roam and look for loot and explore dungeon-like areas, something that none of the ff13 games really had that are staple exciting parts of RPG games.\nATM really looking forward to see how FF16 turns out after watching some of the early development videos and seeing the MC turn into a giant eidolon/ifrit and beating down other eidolons.

It has a quality story, full of soul and suspense, which its predecessors shared. Even though it picks up from a completely different landscape, it links directly to the end of XIII-2, rather than just ignore it altogether. \n\nCombat is excellent, probably the best of the 3 games, with the ability to guard and have more control in response to enemy behaviour through schemata, rather than stuck in a list of ATB commands queued. Another improved element is the open-world aspect, which contains loads of locations and quests with a lot more interesting story depth to them. Upgrading your parameters (HP, Magic, Strength) is no longer done in the Crystarium through points earned from battle, instead it is from completing quests - making it more story driven progression rather than repetitive farming of repeating battles to grow. \n \nI enjoyed the linked story line and it's conclusion to the trilogy story, some detailed aspects might fly over your head, but overall it does the trilogy justice in my opinion. The game has a fast start compared to the slower start in XIII-2, and although some may find the constant time pressure of the clock irritating, I thought it gave the game even more urgency and story, regardless of the stress!\n\nThe only negative I would say is that the graphics seem to be inferior compared to the other two games, especially XIII. This is more in terms of cut-scenes, with XIII having such advanced visuals way before its time. The beautiful, high-quality music scores and impressionable characters return and are added to, real trademarks of the XIII trilogy. \n\nA great game to cap a brilliant trilogy, which I think is hugely underrated.

I got it randomly from my father- he said something like \"it has a cool woman\" on it or somethin' I dunno I don't remember. This game was my first exposure to Final Fantasy. I have *never* even heard of FFVII in my life- let alone known that you were supposed to play this game *last* in the FXIII series (it doesn't help that this game doesn't say something like \"FFXIII-3\").\n\nAnyway, I played like an hour before I got confused and bored and never touched it again.\n\nAlmost 5-6 years later, I return with a...more positive look on Final Fantasy- I've found like waaaay better FF games to begin with, and they were enjoyable and extraordinary experiences. I, however, dreaded over playing the infamous FFXIII, overhearing how \"BAD\" it was and how \"LINEAR\" and \"DUMB\" the plot is. Indeed, it may be true, but I've never heard much from the LR: FFXIII critics.\n\nAfter finally, finally revisting this game over half a decade later (even though I've only played around 2 1/2 hours thus far), I came to the conclusion that LR: FFXIII is by *far* the most enjoyable FFXIII sequel to play- and it wasn't even close. I give kudos to the original FFXIII battle system for being \"unique,\" but it's so BORING. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing half the time, and the action is just... flat. The story kinda sucks and is unsatisfying, and I wasn't sure how the final sequel would hold up.\n\nSurprisingly, I'm enjoying it much more than the previous 2 entries. The story is actually bearable and the stakes are actually high (for REAL this time) so I feel like I'm actually fighting for something for once. The battle system is handled very interestingly (it's different) and although I don't like being rushed in games with a \"doomsday\" timer- it doesn't stress me out THAT bad (except for the \"curfew\" mechanic, kinda dumb and halts your progress for like 2 minutes but whatever).\n\nWould I recommend this game?:\n\nTo a person that doesn't care about the plot of the previous 2 games and only wants to play for the sake of gameplay- sure (or, let's be honest- we're only playing this game because Lightning is very cool (only when she doesn't speak because everything she says ruins the plot)).\n\nTo a person who has no idea what Final Fantasy is and this is their first game- ABSOLUTELY not. Please play like FFVI, FFX or something like that (vastly superior games). I say this from personal experience- LR: FFXIII is NOT a very good first impression for a Final Fantasy game.\n\nAnyway uh...I'm really bad at reviews so I'll end with a:\n\n7/10- cool gameplay and kinda cool story and cool visuals.

An effort to bring in as much money as possible by reusing many assets from Final Fantasy XIII whilst Final Fantasy Versus XIII (which eventually became FFXV) continued languishing in development hell & Final Fantasy XIV was gearing up for its big relaunch as A Realm Reborn. \n\nThe interesting thing about Lightning Returns is that, whereas XIII-2 felt like a game built around its accelerated development cycle, Lightning Returns is a game that feels too ambitious for its own good. Whilst XIII-2 reused as much from XIII as possible & used the time-travel premise as an excuse to reskin both old environments from XIII & most of the few new ones multiple times & made minimal changes to the gameplay; Lightning Returns completely overhauls the combat to more closely resemble an Action-RPG, mostly sets itself in new locations & has an ambitious & risky new mechanic that required a lot of balancing work to get right (more on that later). \n\nPerhaps this is a byproduct of Motomu Toriyama, the director of the Lightning Saga, & his\u2026 passion\u2026 for Lightning (seriously, this guy\u2019s love of Lightning borders on waifu territory) and a desire to give her story a happy ending & unforgettable sendoff. Maybe the XIII team as a whole wanted to stretch their legs & try some new things after XIII-2 mostly played things safe on the gameplay front so they could apply the lessons learned to future projects. Funnily enough, much of the team at Business Division 1 that made Lightning Returns would go on to develop Final Fantasy VII Remake & having played both games I can definitely say that game is much more of an evolution of this game\u2019s combat than it is of FFXV\u2019s combat. So you could call Lightning Returns\u2019 combat a dry run for VII Remake (if it weren\u2019t for VII Remake initially being planned to mostly be developed by CyberConnect 2 rather than by Business Division 1 themselves).\n\nRegardless of the reasoning, the aforementioned overambition has a noticeable impact on the game\u2019s graphics. The visuals noticeably take a step back from XIII & XIII-2, with the best-looking assets in the game being either reused from the previous two games or costumes for Lightning. The environments, in particular, look pretty bad for a game that was released for the PS3 & 360 in 2013 (The Last of Us & GTA V were released for the PS3 (and 360 in GTA\u2019s case) earlier that SAME YEAR and look a lot better than Lightning Returns on the same hardware). The more wide-open Wildlands & Dead Dunes fair the worst, but even the more closed-off Luxerion & Yusnaan fail to meet the visual highs of XIII & XIII-2. These hits to graphical fidelity were likely a combination of having to create so many new assets in less than a year and a half that fit in the memory pools of the aging hardware the game was made for & Crystal Tools being pushed to its limits to make this open-ended design happen. To think this trilogy started by raising the bar on this front\u2026 It\u2019s also worth mentioning that, like XIII-2, there are only three pre-rendered cinematics in the entire game (one at the beginning, one at the end & an unlockable post-credits scene). \n\nGoing back to the combat, it\u2019s probably the best thing about this entire game to be honest! As mentioned before, Lightning Returns utilizes an action-combat system with some turn-based elements like an ATB bar that\u2019s very similar to VII Remake in it\u2019s approach to mixing action-combat & turn-based combat. And for this team\u2019s first attempt, there\u2019s a surprisingly high skill ceiling involving timing, learning enemy attack patterns & maximizing the amount of stagger you dish out to an enemy. It\u2019s a real joy to engage with & I\u2019m glad that the dev team has evolved it into the system many people love in VII Remake. \nBut perhaps the most unconventional element of combat is how you increase Lightning\u2019s stats. Rather than doing so by gaining XP in combat, in Lightning Returns the only ways to get more powerful are through quests & the Canvas of Prayers (essentially a \u201cGet X in exchange for power\u201d system). While this is definitely a unique approach & I didn\u2019t hate this (it\u2019s especially great from a ludo-narrative synchronicity standpoint), I\u2019m also glad that this concept hasn\u2019t caught on in other RPGs (and that this didn\u2019t carry over to VII Remake)...\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ve talked around it enough. Let\u2019s talk about this game\u2019s time limit, by far the single biggest & most divisive change made to Lightning Returns compared to the previous two games & the mechanic everything else about this game revolves around. Lightning only has 13 days to save as many souls as she can before the world ends, and the game imposes this deadline upon players as well. Each in-game day corresponds to around an hour of real-time (2-3 hours on Easy mode), meaning you have 13 hours (+ however much time you spend in cutscenes, conversations & combat, which pause the timer) to finish the game (26-39 hours on Easy mode). Oh, and at the start of the game, you only have 7 days and have to unlock the remaining 6 days by completing the main story quest chains.\n\nAs for my personal opinion on it, at first, I found the time limit very daunting. But eventually, as I played through the game (on Easy), I started to come around on the idea. Plus it turns out that said time limit is actually pretty generous, so an average player might be able to complete the game in one go once they have their head wrapped around the combat. \n\nFortunately, the PC version of Lightning Returns is the best of the Lightning Saga\u2019s PC ports. There is a healthier amount of graphical options than XIII & XIII-2 & the game is much more stable, less crash-prone and generally works just fine right out of the box. No mod manager is needed. There are some performance issues in certain areas, but never quite as bad as XIII-2 is out of the box & it\u2019s clear that Crystal Tools was not designed for the kind of game Lightning Returns aspires to be.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about the story. Going into this game, my expectations were tempered by the mostly negative reception to the story. But this is where Lightning Returns surprised me most. While the story isn\u2019t perfect and the high degree of non-linearity can lead to things feeling disjointed, the overall story is pretty good, even if the identity of the main villain is pretty obvious after a few hours. I\u2019d say the story is at its best when it\u2019s exploring Lightning\u2019s flaws & worst tendencies as a character and at its worst when it devolves into a bunch of fetch quests (looking at you Sazh). As a finale\u2026 It\u2019s a good ending to the Lightning Saga, but it\u2019s no Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker for sure.\nConclusion\nLightning Returns is a very experimental game, an interesting choice for the for the finale of a trilogy (even if the devs marketed this as a \u201cnew experience\u201d, the story is very much written like a trilogy capper), but I suppose a highly experimental & ambitious game that tries out a bunch of new ideas is a very Final Fantasy way to cap off a trilogy. Not all of Lightning Returns\u2019 experiments are successes & even some of the ones that do work are things I wouldn\u2019t want to see in every Final Fantasy game going forward, but I applaud the ambition of this team, especially when, given the context of this game\u2019s creation & their company\u2019s financial troubles, they could have easily phoned it in with a safe & iterative finale. But they didn\u2019t and that\u2019s worthy of praise (even if their ambition did ultimately outstrip the time they had to ship this game). \n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect game, at times it\u2019s actually a pretty messy one. But it\u2019s definitely my favourite of the Lightning Saga & I\u2019ll likely do a New Game + run in the not-too-distant future\u2026\nRatings:\nCreative score: 8/10\nTechnical score: 6/10 (not bad for the time, but the PC port has some issues out of the box)\nBusiness Practices score: 7/10\nOverall score: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1678077680, "timestamp_updated": 1678122133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865092456340789795", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134091903": {"recommendationid": "134091903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090198445", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1677985851}, "language": "english", "review": "Just cant force myself to continue playing.

The first game was very innovative but had a lot of glaring issues, personally I hated the second game and the port was so bad it was a joke.\n\nThis game on the other hand is actually kind of good? And the port is more then acceptable? What a shock. I am genuinely surprised. When I saw this game had a time limit I thought I would hate it.\n\nFF 13 3 is a follow up to the ending of FF 13 - 2, for the sake of this review I can't avoid spoiling the last 2 games because of how important the story is to the gameplay here, if you want to avoid spoilers for the first 2 games then just know I recommend playing those first if you even want to play this game. *LAST SPOILER WARNING*\n\n\nAfter the horrible events of the last game Lightning has ended up in a crystal stasis. She is woken up by god and has been tasked with gathering souls, the world will end in a bit less then 2 weeks and god wants to recreate everything with the souls that you collect. This concept is incredibly strong and somehow makes the terrible writing from the 2nd game look slightly competent. \n\nSo how do you collect souls? By doing quests, if people don't have any regrets they can open themselves up to you and you gain more power as well as more time for the world. This also means grinding has been changed and the primary way to get stronger is by doing main and side quests. When I mean quests you might think defeating some great evil, but most quests are pretty simple in structure and are things like doing fetch quests or finding treasure chests around the map. \n\nAnd this is immediately where this game shows its strength and its weakness. The core concept for the game is really cool and fun, the first like 20 hours of this game are a blast. You are pushing your speedrun skills to the limit to try and fit as much as possible in the time limit. The world is dying and everyone knows it, the places you go to are generally really interesting and super imaginative, a lot of it reminds me Nier automata especially in the music department (even if FF 13-3 came first). You can explore a lot of it compared to the last 2 games and the side quests allows you to get a deep dive into all the characters. The mythos that has been built over the course of the last 2 games finally starts to get pay off and seeing it play out is very interesting. In that sense the content that is here is strong....\n\nBut this is a Final Fantasy 13 game and for some reason these games always need to have a catch. I decided to play on Easy because that allows you to get more time and after how frustrated I was with 13 2 I wanted to get this over with as soon as possible when I originally started. I usually hate time limits in RPG's and wanted to explore everything the game has to offer. I was able to finish with like 8 or more days left with NOTHING to do. Even if I played on Normal im very certain I would have had 0 problems beating everything with plenty of time to spare (You can't change difficulty mid game). \n\nThis game is just very lacking in things to do and it feels like they had to cut a lot of corners. Enemy variety is limited. Character customization and progression isn't very exciting and that is even more of a problem because you don't really have party members in this game. Side quests can be pretty hit or miss with some of them being fun and others just feeling like a waste of time. A lot of story elements feel forced in to make sure this is a proper conclusion to the story, this sucks because the story elements that feel natural are really interesting and engaging. The world looks a lot grimier, the set pieces are great but you can't help but notice the grime when the first game looked as good as it did. Lastly the time mechanic can be really annoying, oh you want to finish a side quests? Go wait 30 min or go walk to an INN and back to continue. There are too many time related blocks in the game and that can result in some really annoying moments.\n\nPersonally I also dislike the new combat system. This game uses a very similar system to the previous 2 games, but now you don't have a party so everything is a lot more dumbed down. Lightning gets access to a lot of powers and the combat has been made a lot faster. The stagger system also has been made a lot more confusing somehow yet the combat still feels much simpler in every other aspect. It almost feels like they wanted to go for an action game but decided they still needed to be an FF 13 game and they needed to use that combat system.\n\nThat doesn't detract from what the game does well. It still sounds fantastic and the world in itself is super interesting and open, the first 20 hours as you explore everything while being pressured by the clock are really magical. I love a lot of the personal scenes that make sense in the context of the overall story. I think it also somehow rounds out the story in a pretty satisfying manner. The combat is fast paced which means it usually isn't too much of a slog (me playing on Easy might have helped here). Lightnings movement is pretty fun and due to the structure of the world it can be really fun to just run around which is great because thats what you will be doing most of the time. There is a ton of voice acting and personality that has been put into even minor side quests, it helps breath life into this dying world.\n\nAnd one of the biggest things I want to commend is that the port quality is pretty good overall. The biggest problems I had were that you would sometimes get stutters when it loaded in a new part of a city. But past that it runs great most of the time and the settings are decent as well although I would have liked more customization. Overall im glad I didn't have to mod the game a bunch just to get it started properly.\n\nIn the end, should you play FF 13/3? This game is great but it relies a lot on what the previous games built on. I highly recommend playing this game if you somehow made it through 13 and 13.2. I would even say its a must play in that case because it really makes both of those games a lot better. If you haven't played the first 2 games then I wouldn't recommend this game on its own merit. Its a fun experience and a great way to round off the FF 13 trilogy but I am really sad to see that so many cool concepts just end up feeling unfinished or rushed. Those flaws are a sad mark on such a beautiful canvas.

I am so so GLAD I played it while trying to figure out if the criticisms are valid. This turned out to be my personal favourite among the FFXIII trilogy. I can understand where some criticisms are coming from. As the FFXIII trilogy, in terms of story and game development, they are messy, and each instalment is so different. The trilogy can upset some FF (Final Fantasy) fans (nobody asks for XIII to be a trilogy) as the narrative is not as strong as previous titles, SE is milking this franchise too much and sets the pace that FF won\u2019t likely return to turn-based combat in the future.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what is meh about this game. \nThe story, I would say just ignore it. At least it is not as confusing and nonsensical as the first FFXIII, when half of the time I didn\u2019t know wtf they are babbling about. But it does bring great satisfaction to Lightning and her gang\u2019s stories. Also, this game redeemed Snow. I never liked him, but he is actually pretty cool in this game. Unfortunately, they did a huge disservice to Sazh, AGAIN!\n\nResource management, in terms of time, gils and health. I wouldn\u2019t call these a weakness, but it does make the game less enjoyable and pushed players away. Who thinks setting time limit is a good game design?! This game forces you to strategize. I had to read up on the side quests to figure out what time, day and location certain side quest-givers will appear so I can plan my day (game days) ahead and be more efficient. In the beginning, I was stressed about the time tickling, that I couldn\u2019t properly travel around admiring the views, and unable to listen to NPCs and Hope\u2019s dialogues properly. Then I failed the first side quest, \u201cWither Faith\u201d which pissed me off. (This does motivated me to play New Game+) Then I discovered \u201cChronostasis\u201d, the best EP (energy point) ability in the game. Once you\u2019re allowed to spam Chronostasis, time won\u2019t be your enemy anymore. If you plan well, you can finish all the main quests by Day 7-10. I do appreciate the limited-time element later as it does give off the apocalypse vibe which gave Lightning more agency not to diddle dawdle.\n\nAbout the gil, the amount of gils the monsters (except Cactuars in the Dead Dunes) dropped is pathetic so you shouldn\u2019t spend your money on most weapons, shields and adornments. Buy the garbs but if you are in Hard mode, ignore the new garbs (I only bought \"The Duelist\" for Hard Mode). In your first playthrough (easy/normal), save up your gils so you can buy the Hard mode-only weapons or shields, and upgrade your weapons and shields in New Game+. Unfortunately, upgrading in Hard mode is stupidly costly. Some of the best garbs, weapons and shields are dropped by some monsters, the main quests\u2019 bosses (Chao\u2019s Revenge is my MVP weapon), and the DLCs (Cloud\u2019s upgraded Buster Sword in New Game+ is amazingballshit. Yuna FFX\u2019s whole set, Yuna FFX-2\u2019s shield and the sword, Brotherhood is my favourite sword of the FF series. I just keep Brotherhood for the aesthetic but in terms of power and bonus abilities, other weapons are better.) Also, I don\u2019t recommend selling the misc items that the monsters dropped. You can use them for Canvas of Prayers. If you need extra gils, sell the sparkling items you randomly will collect while roaming around, or the extra abilities.\n\nNow the good parts. \nCombat. I LOVE THE COMBAT. This is the saving grace for LR. It\u2019s brilliant, fast-paced and surprisingly tons of grinding. At first, I was upset Lightning is solo since I am used to having party members and I do use them for moral support when we roam scary locations or fight hard bosses. I was wary about the schemata system since it reminded me of \u201cFFX-2\u201d. I don\u2019t enjoy seeing another game with a \u201cmagical girl\u201d feature in which the girl may end up showing a lot of skins or suddenly sings Jpop. Thankfully, most outfits for this game don\u2019t make Lightning dressed up sexy. \n\nI personally love to grind, but this type of grinding is different from the past FFs. You do not level up by fighting tons of monsters. Also, it\u2019s better strategically not to quickly extinct most of them before Day 6 as they will drop higher level abilities on Day 10 onwards. Thus, defeating more monsters does not automatically make you stronger. If you fight the monsters, it is because you want to study their patterns, test out your new schemata or restore EP. Staggering is the key to beating them faster and increasing drop-rate for rarer items. Magic like ra-spells is great for staggering. This game taught me how important it is to observe opponents \u2018 movement, and timing and to guard. I am a button-masher player so when I guard and evade better, it becomes a game-changer. This game also switched my playstyle, which I will inflict some status ailments on all enemies. I rarely use status aliments like Poison, and Slow in other FFs, but debuffs become my staple. Imperil and Deprotect is my go-to debuffs. Debuff-ing and buffing (mostly by stealing the enemy's status enhancement) constantly is a must in Hard mode.\n\nThe game also lets you experiment so how it plays out, what schemata, weapons, abilities, and accessories become your favourite is highly dependent on your play style. In the past with the end-game, you tend to use the ultimate weapon. However, I like this game was designed in a way that you can pick your favourite to be the \u201cUltimate weapon or garb\u201d and it is more evident in New Game+. I love the combat system so much and I want to fight better that I switched from a keyboard to a game controller. I highly recommend playing this game with the controller. \n\nMy only complaint with the bestiary is, there is no Tonberry. :(\nAt least it gives us Cactair, the afro-haired Cactuar. That battle was hilarious.  \n\nSo how to level up? You do the side-quests, the other surprisingly pleasant elements of the games. I thought they are mostly fetch-quests, and then a few actually teared me up LMAO. (The Angel\u2019s Tear, Bhakti) The side quests are split into two categories, the ones bestowed by the NPCs and the Canvas of Prayers. Do attempt most side quests by the NPCs (you need to level up enough for the final boss. \u201cLast One Standing\u201d in Dead Dudes can only be completed in New Game+, but you can use your first playthrough to prepare for it). The Canvas of Prayers is the fetch-quests so only do them if you feel like it.  The NPCs\u2019 game models can look generic and silly, some dressing horribly stupid with hideous adornments. The best NPCs are the low-poly animals like the [url= https://www.gamesradar.com/why-i-love-this-dog-from-lightning-returns-final-fantasy-13/]dog [/url] and the [url= http://coldrungaming.blogspot.com/2019/08/ffxiii-lightning-returns-part-8-gem.html]cat [/url]. I died laughing. Oh, Biggs and Wedge are in this game!\n\nOf course, the OST. People can bash the FFXIII trilogy all they want, but we all agree the OST never fails. I love that the soundtracks will adjust to the timing of the day, and some inserts of previous instalments\u2019 OST are simply brilliant and got me emotional. (Blinded by Light with Snow\u2019s battle, FFXIII-2 New Bodhum, Crazy Chocobo, Invisible Abyss (with one of the superboss! My heart melts) FFXIII\u2019s Dust to Dust (Oerba\u2019s theme))\n\nAnd do start in Normal mode! Many recommend Easy but Normal mode is the one I feel that really forces you to manage your resources (health, gils, time) and appreciate the combat better since there is no HP regeneration out of battle.\n\nIs the FFXIII trilogy still controversial? Yes, but this doesn\u2019t automatically mean LR: FFXIII is a bad game.

How'd that work out? \n\nThey created dozens of Schemata outfits for Lightning but essentially put her in blocky, PS2-like budget corridor areas and deserts that put you to sleep. This level design is a disaster compared to 13 and 13-2. The shorter dev time is right in your face with how uninspired it feels. \n\nThe battle system in 13 and 13-2 weren't great, but in this you run out of ATB so fast that you're standing around waiting for it to fill up and at that point, your ACTION system turns into a goofy turned based. If it's action, just make it an action game. They fixed the chaotic camera in 13-2 for this game, but there's essentially nothing going on in the battles that warrant caring about the camera. \n\nTHINK about how FF13-2 started vs how this one started. This game is based around a doomsday clock but is an absolute slog. For a story about time running out and the end of the world, this story is atrocious. Serah is infinitely more likable than Lightning and this whole thing is laughable. There is nothing redeemable about what they've done here. Why am I looking for a girl's Carbuncle doll when Lightning is the KNIGHT of ETRO who slept for 500 years in a broken goddess throne after her sister died from seeing the entire TIMELINE? Where is the GAS PEDAL to your story? Why is Lightning doing fetch quests with 13 days left until the end of the world? What are we doing, Square Enix? If I don't do your dumb fetch quests, I don't get upgrades to my character because we can't grind. \n\nNew game+? Say less. Only the diehards will touch this NG+ with these shameful mechanics. \n\nYou get a sort of pass because this port at least fired up without me having to mod it.

The conclusion of the story was not bad, but the amount of gameplay things that exist for the sake of making the game \"filled\" with stuff is worse in this game that the others (I'm looking at you mission with the talking cat).\nAnd the gameplay decisions that are outdated, boring, and attempt against any RPG enjoyment IMO are back stronger than in the first game. For example: \n1. You have to wait until a second playthrough (NG+) to be able to upgrade your weapons.\n2. There is a timer that goes by too quickly for a game that makes no sense or guides you at all, so you don't know what to do (hence they kinda force you to do a NG+ if you want to see at least 80% of what the game offers).\n3. The achievements depend on guides 100% and not skills (Or replaying the game over and over until you memorize and optimize the best paths to take at each time of the day).\n4. Finally, the gameplay and combat strategies depend on griding or knowing the game from head to toe to be strong in battles (Again, if you don't read ahead guides, you better play at least three times the story). \n\nThe XIII saga has mechanics that are cool, refreshing, and innovative.

I think this game could appeal to both someone who is a fan of the other XIII games and someone that did not like them. In terms of gameplay, it evolves from XIII-2 in a natural way. If you look at the three games in order, then the gameplay goes something like this. Party of 6 following a linear path -> party of 2 + monsters you recruit where you can explore alternate paths (timelines) if you wish -> Lightning by herself in an open world game. Despite the time limit, there is a sense of freedom and calmness that aren't really present in the other 2.  You are able to tackle the four main zones in any order you like (though there is an optimal order and you will naturally probably follow it). While the combat is fun, there are 2 main problems with this game.\n\nThe first is the difficulty. There's easy and normal (well, and hard after you beat the game) and I think most people will think that the game is too easy on normal. The game's difficulty is highly dependent on what order you do the zones even though you're 'encouraged' to take them on however you like. Now because there aren't really any levels, if you do them out of order you will find some of the bosses to be really hard, conversely if you do them in the right order, then the bosses become completely trivialized. They tried to account for this by buffing the bosses after 7 days worth of time (out of 13), but its not nearly enough because most of your power in this game comes from abilities. In terms of content, there is a superboss in the overworld and also a hidden endgame dungeon. Even accounting for this, this game does not have anywhere near the amount of content in the previous 2 games. With all that being said, the final boss is extremely well done and the difficulty is really well thought out. While you are able to get to the final boss without engaging with and understanding the deeper combat systems, I promise you will not be able to beat the final boss unless you understand the combat system.\n\nThe second main problem is the time mechanic, well not the time mechanic itself but rather how you interact with it. I think most people found the system to be annoying because you have to go into the settings and then go into your time abilities. You end up interacting with this system constantly because you have a time stop ability, so the added time to get to the menu is just annoying. If there was a quick menu where you can pull up your time abilities in real time, it would be a lot better.\n\nIn terms of the story. Its not that great, but its not insultingly bad either. If you want to appreciate the story in any way shape or form, then you really have to go into this game thinking that its not a trilogy and this is a standalone game. The story and world doesn't really make sense canonically speaking so you just take it for what it is. \n\nSPOILERS:  I think the story and character growth shown in this game really highlights some of the problems with planning this as a trilogy from the get go. Why is Lightning and Lumina's story arc shown in the 3rd game when it is so vital to Lightning's character? No wonder people think she has no personality. Then on the flip side, you have Sazh, Vanille, and Fang all pretty much being the same character from the first game.\n\nWith all that being said, the game is still fun and the music is good.", "timestamp_created": 1662599115, "timestamp_updated": 1677027870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121903136": {"recommendationid": "121903136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023630074", "num_games_owned": 927, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 1338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1338, "last_played": 1662591946}, "language": "english", "review": "Lightnings Armpits *Blushes*", "timestamp_created": 1662592132, "timestamp_updated": 1662592132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47450980544090271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121826880": {"recommendationid": "121826880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168402284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1696202936}, "language": "english", "review": "test your time management skills in this game", "timestamp_created": 1662455818, "timestamp_updated": 1662455818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121814501": {"recommendationid": "121814501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970276756", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2248, "last_played": 1662139914}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es cine", "timestamp_created": 1662427546, "timestamp_updated": 1662427546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586801052093505859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121732659": {"recommendationid": "121732659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402645562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 35707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35451, "last_played": 1686775827}, "language": "english", "review": "I like Lightning, her hair is pink", "timestamp_created": 1662296337, "timestamp_updated": 1662296337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463748782873153687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121612560": {"recommendationid": "121612560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027538368", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3777, "last_played": 1670963043}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing game.

Sin embargo fue un juego muy entretenido con mec\u00e1nicas nuevas que nunca hab\u00eda probando antes y aunque no este del todo pulido fue una experiencia que valio la pena, y se puede ver en todas las horas que le dedique hasta el momento.\n\nComenzando por un analisis general: Es una idea MUY buena pero no se le puso el esfuerzo y cari\u00f1o que deber\u00eda, pudo ser mucho mucho mejor. \n\nJugabilidad de batalla: \nLo primero a resaltar es que cambia casi toda la jugabilidad con respecto a los otros 2 juegos, esto es algo negativo teniendo en cuenta que todos est\u00e1bamos acostumbrados al sistema de combate anterior y cuesta acostumbrarse. Los roles desaparecen y solo podemos equipar 4 habilidades, eso no me gusta ya que con acciones tan limitadas hace que las batallas sean poco divertidas. Muchas de las habilidades magicas de da\u00f1o como la ruina estan muy nerfeadas y no causan casi nada de da\u00f1o por mas mejoradas que esten. Por otro lado, no tiene sentido que nos castiguen por escapar de una pelea. Y por ultimo, los controles para el teclado son muy malos, al menos pude arreglarlo configurando los botones de habilidades y acciones en el pad numerico para un manejo comodo. \nHubiera preferido mucho mas que se mantuviera el sistema de combate que se nos mostr\u00f3 en el capitulo extra de Lightning vs Caius al final de XIII-2, ese sistema era Excelente.\n\nJugabilidad por el mundo: \nAlgo muy bueno es que esta mucho mejor optimizado que antes y tenemos mas libertad para movernos por casi cualquier lugar con muy pocas paredes invisibles. El poder subir escaleras, bajar por tubos, saltar desde lugares altos, deslizarse por la arena, toda esa libertad de movimiento es muy agradable.\n\nAmbientaci\u00f3n, mapeado y detalles:\nEl apartado gr\u00e1fico como siempre es precioso considerando los pocos requisitos que pide. Ademas el nivel de detalles tanto en ambientaci\u00f3n como en el comportamiento de la gente es mucho mas vivo, complejo y llamativo que antes. Y banda sonora es hermosa. El \u00fanico problema es que el mundo se me hizo peque\u00f1o, hacia falta una regi\u00f3n mas en Nova Chrysalia de preferencia con nieve.\n\nHistoria y desarrollo: Es buena y a la vez no\nComo dije antes la idea es muy buena pero el desarrollo es muy vaci\u00f3. Empieza bien, pero a medida que avanzamos se torna muy simplona hasta casi llegando al final. Tambien considero que hacia falta un nuevo personaje secundario o mas participaci\u00f3n de los que ya conocemos (la cual es muy escasa). Si bien es interesante pudo ser mucho mejor.\nPor otra parte la idea de salvar almas es algo que me encant\u00f3, pero hubiera sido mejor que las misiones sean mas complejas de completar, la mayor\u00eda son muy sencillas. \n\nSinceramente no era lo que esperaba, pero a pesar de todos los puntos malos pasando el Dia 3 ya estaba enganchado y decidido a pas\u00e1rmelo.\nEl primer FFXIII lo destaco por su buena historia y XIII-2 es mi favorito tanto por historia como jugabilidad. Este destaca por su modo desafiante (en todo sentido), ya que el principal enemigo no es ning\u00fan villano ni monstruos, es el tiempo. La constante lucha contra el reloj y el objetivo de salvar todas las almas posibles hace que a medida que voy avanzando se vuelve adictivo, entretenido y hasta satisfactorio. Ademas poder personalizar los trajes le da un toque mas personal a la partida. \nAunque le hizo falta mas desarollo a la historia, pulir el sistema de combate, mas variedad de monstruos, un mundo un poco mas grande y cosas como la toma de decisiones, actividades extra y dem\u00e1s no hay muchos juegos de este estilo y no esta de mas darle la oportunidad para concluir esta saga. \n\nPuntuaci\u00f3n general: 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1658986108, "timestamp_updated": 1659145684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119521380": {"recommendationid": "119521380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142439941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1664077558}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved playing this when it came out and think its the perfect end to the 13 series.", "timestamp_created": 1658856978, "timestamp_updated": 1658856978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119486095": {"recommendationid": "119486095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053313026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1449955157}, "language": "english", "review": "Played for like almost an hour was the most boring thing Ive ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1658809218, "timestamp_updated": 1658809218, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439706861972808838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119397165": {"recommendationid": "119397165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040535777", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 7750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5579, "last_played": 1659140457}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean, come on, dawg.

It can further alleviate some occasional frame stutters.\n\nAnd I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this game.\nBecause of awful experience I had with XIII-2, and some of my friends take a dim view of this game, I came in expected to dislike this game too.\nAs I played, it gradually became my most favourite in FF XIII Trilogy. And it is the only game in trilogy that I bothered to played a new game plus after I finished the game.\n\nHere are what I like about this game:\n[list]\n [*] I like that the game run relatively well on PC. Load time is fast.\n [*] Character control and movement, both in-combat and over world, are much better than previous 2 games. And that makes the game feels fluid and fast.\n [*] Character growth is not tied to fighting enemies.\n [*] Enemies spawn much quicker than previous games; less time wasting running around when you need to kill them.\n [*] Enemies are easier to avoid. I can just breeze through from one objective to the next and only fight when necessary.\n [*] This new style of action-based combat is very quick. Attack damage and defense are also based on timing, similar to Fromsoft games where you can do extra damage or perfect block by pressing button at the right time. It works like that in Lightning Returns too. And if you memorised enemies' opening moves and their weaknesses, you can counter those and finish the fight in seconds.\n[/list]\n\nThinking back, I just realised that I played Lightning Returns like how I've played Saga series; run pass enemies to reach items/objectives.\n\nHaving said that, I don't think most players would like this game.\nJust look at Steam achievement stat, at the time of writing, only ~29% of players managed to killed 100 enemies.\n100 enemies are not that many by RPG standard. Normal encounters have, like, 2 - 4 enemies. So, it actually pretty fast and easy to earn that achievement without even trying.\nThis shows that Lightning Returns cannot hold interest of ~70% of players, and they quit playing at early game.\n\nLightning Returns gameplay is a far departure from any previous traditional Final Fantasy games.\nThe main mechanic of this game, time management, can be off-putting. This game has a countdown clock, and you have to complete 5 main quests within that time limit, or it will be game over.\nWhen you play this game blind for the first time, it can be anything but fun, because you would have no clue what you should do or where you should go.\nMany events, such as, shops, NPCs, quest availability, item spawn, enemy spawn, they all happen only at specific time based on in-game clock. And in-game clock moves fast; 2.5 minutes real time = 1 hour in-game. It's easy to miss deadlines for events if you are not careful.\n\nCharacter growth is not based on EXP like in previous games. Killing enemies do not make you stronger. You will only gain stat increase by completing quests. And they are often fetch quests. If you don't like these type of quests, It's very likely that you will not like this game.\n\nThe game graphic is closer to FF12 than FF13. With exception of some main characters, most textures are low quality and pixelated.\n\nIn my opinion, Lightning Returns feels more like a spin-off than a sequel to a mainline Final Fantasy. So, it's understandable that many players would drop the game, since it might not be what they expected.\nPersonally, I would put Lightning Returns in the same category as Final Fantasy Type-0.", "timestamp_created": 1656298806, "timestamp_updated": 1656298806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117686546": {"recommendationid": "117686546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005010963", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2809, "last_played": 1489695954}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't care what the majority said, I love the story of the FF13 series, especially Lightnting Returns, gives a good conclusion to the series.

To get the bad out of the way, this is the ugliest game of the XIII trilogy. It has many unused and unpolished assets, and two of the main locations you visit are 50% empty (desert and plains). One of the five main story segments (the one I was looking forward to the most) has that type of ending where you realize that nothing of significance was accomplished. The combat also needs some polish. It took me roughly 5 hours of trial and error to understand it let alone use it well.\n\nWith that said, this is my favorite game of the trilogy. Despite the lackluster graphics, the two main cities you visit are my favorite locations of the trilogy. They have a lot of personality and culture to them. Despite my gripes with some of the story beats, Lightning Returns has what I think is a very satisfying conclusion. I believe the developers once said they wanted an ending where Lightning could finally smile. Let's just say they pulled it off. However the side stories also deserve some praise as they give you a lot of insight to the NPCs who have been stuck in basically limbo for centuries. They were surprisingly emotional and satisfying. Finally, while the combat is way too different from the previous XIII games I became addicted to finding good combinations of fighting styles that you can equip. While I've never cared much of customizing characters it was satisfying to find battle attire that not only was effective in battle, but looked good in combat. Also worth mentioning is that the time limit is not as bad as you would initially suspect, and even becomes fun after you better understand it and the mechanics used to freeze time.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the game, but I understand that it will be a frustrating experience for many.

I was planning to give it a negative review mostly because I thought the story was terrible but they managed to pull it together at the end. \n\n[b]Things I disliked: [/b]\n- The story (I loved 13, was annoyed by 13-2, and hated this game's story until the end). This was my #1 biggest gripe about this. I play RPGs for the stories, and this... barely had one. \n- Garbs. Hated it in 10-2, hate it here. While the customization [i]should[/i] be good, the UI and the minutia of switching it just sucks. I played most of the game on the same set-up because changing it was just too much of a pain. \n- Hope constantly speaking into your ear. There are no other characters so I see why they did it, because it's what passes for character interaction, but I have a ticking time and I don't wanna stand around waiting for you to be done talking in case you say something important. \n- The pace of the game. There is a time limit. While at first it stressed me out, in the end I had 5 days to spare and then felt guilt for sleeping the days away just so I could get to the end of the game. It leaves you feeling a bit confused and bored as you run around looking for things to do. \n- The keyboard setup. A controller is probably nice, but man is it the shittiest of the trilogy on keyboard. You can assign keys, so that's nice, but there are a total of 14 keys you need to regularly press including movement, camera controls, the 4 ability buttons, and then interaction keys. And then some menus you can navigate with WASD and others you need to use the arrow keys. Ugh. \n\n[b]Things I liked:[/b]\n- It's the only one in the trilogy that just works without having to download and install fan-made patches. \n- They did pull the story in at the end, and gave a conslusion to all the characters from the 1st game. They also fleshed out the mythology that was only hinted at in the 1st game.\n- There are a couple of side quests (few and far between) that do give a deeper feeling of the depression of living for 500 years in a slowly decaying world.\n\n[b]Neutral: [/b]\n- The battle system. Most people seem to think it's the best of the trilogy, and yeah, I can see that... But... It's not actually that good? I miss the old commando/ravager/sentinel/etc setup. It does feel good when you learn an enemy's moves and time your blocks well, and battles (especially in the last chapter) can feel frenetic, but there is just so much chaos on the battlefield a lot of the time, and especially if there are multiple enemies, the best strategy is usually just to mash your attack buttons. (to be fair, you have to pay a lot more attention on normal, but I played on easy and would suggest everyone else does too unless they want to pull out their hair).\n\nMy Final Fantasy rankings, best to worst: FF10, FF13, FF12, FF13-2, FF13-LR, FF10-2.", "timestamp_created": 1655452605, "timestamp_updated": 1655452882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116997317": {"recommendationid": "116997317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048881088", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2072, "last_played": 1655216545}, "language": "english", "review": "\nThe last game of the trilogy the grand finale.\n(this is a direct sequel to FF13 1 and FF13 2 so play the first two games before this one)\nTechnical this is the best port you can run it out of the box.

You are now solo in your adventure, you lost your full party from 1. Your team mate and your pet from 2, and they delivered almost the best solo combat system you can wish for.\nThe new system has depth and a skill expression on one hand the Schemata system with garbs and skills you can upgrade the skills and skills also can have different passiv effects. On the other hand skill expression with parries to reduce dmg or negate it.\nThey cut the big skill board shit and also cut the exp from monster, now you are the saviour, you can get stats from helping people and bring their souls to salvation. \nThe also cut the healing after combat/vita, vitra out. You need to manage your potion or you are doomed. \nThe doom factor brings me to the biggest factor in the game the time mechanic, the game is bind to a timer and the timer will tick and if you are to slow you can actually fail the game and send back to a NewGame+ from start.\nIn my opinion this decision is brilliant. \nMany games have a big upcoming end as a story point but you can basically play 100 days and nothing happens. In FF13 3 you need to play smart and efficient you have a tiny rush in the back of your mind, because the clock ticks, the world will come to an end. (But it is still kind of easy to do EVERY not only main story quest in the game in 13 days). \n\nTo the story, can this game concluded the mess that FF13 1 has opened and 13 2 was trying to repair?\nYes.\nThis game is not the smartest written conclusion but it works, it is like an anime ending little bit to clich\u00e9 but you will probably be liked it, if you liked the characters in the past 2 games.\nThings that are don\u2019t like about FF13 3 some characters are way to short written, they are build up but you will conclude their story in 3 dialogues. \n\nTo the conclusion I have played the 3 games over a span of 1 year. And I can say they are really playable in 2021-2022 the graphic is still good. The combat has aged really well. Menu layouts are still fresh enough for 2022 standards. If you are tired of big open world games with a lot of fetch quest. Play the 13 trilogy the bad reputation the game got was a mistake of the time, every game needed to be open world. Or more pressice you wish to be a open world game in 2009. Many new open world games are more generic than this series. \n\n7.5-10 for the entire the series, hard underrated, if you like teen drama, action anime with a twist of 2010 melodramatic this will be your thing. \n\n-Tipps from me, do a mimimum of 45 side quest and in the end do all of the trial gates and go to the shiny orb in the middle.\n", "timestamp_created": 1655249815, "timestamp_updated": 1655249815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116837902": {"recommendationid": "116837902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025522562", "num_games_owned": 1486, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 1639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1639, "last_played": 1648761714}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, I'm never going to finish this game.

I'd say money well spent.[/h1]\n\n\nLightning Returns finishes the FF 13 trilogy with a bang in the form of a race against the clock to save as many souls as you can before the chaos that was unleashed in FFXIII-2 destroys the world completely.\n\nBut don't worry, it's not nearly as stressful as it sounds. If you can't do it, you get to go back to the beginning and try again, with any items and gear and stats you may have earned previously.\n\nIt's a pretty neat mechanic - not my favourite, but that doesn't mean it's not worth your time. You start out with a few days to go before the end of the world, but as you progress through main quests, and even side quests, you can extend the life of the world and give yourself more time. Considering I could get most all quests done in 4 days in my speedrun videos, leaving 9 days free to do whatever you want, it's quite forgiving.\n\nSome quests can be found early on, while others might only open up after a few days, or after main quests are completed. The reward is usually increased stats - a bonus to HP, Strength and/or Magic. There are a decent number of quests, but I do sometimes feel like it needed more minigames, something commonly found in other FF titles. \n\nIt does have a few things to keep us glued to the screen. A unique system of extinction comes into play in this title that is perhaps not seen at all in Final Fantasy titles thusfar, where there are only a finite number of (most) enemies in the game. Ergo, it is possible to exterminate whole species of monsters, almost like a No Encounters reward, but the game makes you work for it. It *would* be a nice reward, but there are some minor exceptions to the rule that cannot be extinctified. No, that is not a word. But you get what I mean.\n\nThere are four distinct maps, and some familiar faces to encounter from past FF 13 titles. One strange thing I couldn't get my head around was the fact that they talk about the chaos being released 500 years ago, but in the last game it looked like it covered the world in an instant. Anyway, in this strange limbo existence, people don't age, which is why all your old friends are lounging around getting on the beers. \n\nPlot holes aside, the graphics are good in some parts, but lacklustre in other areas. Main characters tend to be passable (some even get new clothing!), while NPCs can be a bit on the cloned side. City environs have more detail, but things like the Dunes, or the open grasslands just seem like wasted space to make the game seem big. Even the cinematics are on the mild side, mostly all at the start and end of the game. Past titles, and I mean all the way back to FFVII, VIII and IX, there would be more, signifying significant plot developments.\n\nGriping aside, perhaps one of the better parts of the game is what they did with the Lumina character. The way she keeps popping up to taunt Lightning is cute, and her similarity to Serah may throw the player into confusion, wondering if she is a friend, or foe, or just a psycho escaped from a loony bin (which was my initial reaction, seeing her prance around in a chaos infusion before summoning a Zaltys).\n\nOne factor that I've capitalised on is New Game+, which I'm sure I've done at least 20 times. After completing the game, replays are possible, as is changing the difficulty. This is really useful for things like farming more abilities, which can then be used for ability fusions, needed to make them stronger. Looking for missing garbs to buy, new weapons and shields to buy, not to mention upgrading both of those too. With so much customisation, all sorts of new tactics become available, allowing for lots of replayability.\n\nMost garbs can be colour customised as well. And there are lots of pretty adornments too. There. I said it.\n\nI must say though, not all of the outfits suit Lightning. There are a lot of skimpy, underwear-showing things that just don't make any sense given her disposition. Thankfully you don't have to use them. The Soldier garb from FFVII, together with special garbs from other titles are a nice addition and good fan service.\n\n\nDespite all its little flaws that could have been improved on, I obviously still really enjoyed the game. I've made animated gifs of my waifu Lighty, video guides of some of the tougher monsters, and put in a lot of hours. I'm not a fan of gimmicky combat that requires things like perfect timing, but I got through the whole game, and hard mode, without having to worry too much about it. I think I just enjoyed the concept of turning Lighty into a goddess, getting to the point where she kicked everything's butt. \n\nDo you want to be a saviour?

The basic and many premise is Lightning needs to rescue her sister Serah. She saves souls for God who is supposed to create a new world for everyone. At least that is what was \"promised to lightning\". You meet a ton of familiar faces and only 2 or so characters are brand new to the series. This game kept me feeling empty with what more they could've added lore wise for the story.\n\nGameplay 7/10\n\nAlthough you have more control over your fights, the games overall time mechanic ruins a ton of sections as it dictates how you progress the game and even whether you can complete some quests to get stronger. This game also doesnt give any exp over fights won. The growth system revolves around saving souls which in turn gives you stat increases and other abilities and so on.\n\n\nOverall this isn't a terrible game but the time mechanic ( although its easy to get around it) may turn off many newcomers to the series and or game.

I want to point out that this game has very positive points, but also very negative ones.\nIn my opinion I found the game very confusing at first making you run behind time, not allowing me to enjoy the game as a whole and get used to the world. Another extremely negative point was the NPCs and their depth, I found the concept of the game very interesting, after 500 years of FFXIII-2 people should be wiser, more depressed and with much more depth, however the NPCs of this game are very taken out of context, making me feel like the world wasn't credible.\nSpeaking now about the positive points of this game, I must mention the amount of builds and strategies the game offered me, I felt that after 100+ hours, I didn't even use 10% of the strategies that the game provides and that's amazing. The battle system positively surprised me, I thought it was very basic, where you have your set and you don't go beyond that, however as I progressed through the game, I discovered that the secret is to make the 3 schemata work as a whole, bringing a lot of depth to the battle system.\nFinally, I really liked the concept of the game, a doomed world without salvation, where humanity has to prove to god that even without people to be born it will survive after 500 years and thus pass to a new world. However, I felt that the story could have been better used while mentioning that the main characters like Snow, Vanille, Fang, Sazh and Hope were very poorly used, leaving me with a sense that the characters no longer had a soul.\nFinally, I want to leave a note for Square Enix, if you want to make a Final Fantasy title, don't do it with a low budget, this franchise has too much history behind it and deserves much more than this.

Combat is almost completely different, it is only Lightning with up to 3 garbs which can equip whatever 4 abilities chosen and remove 1 slot for a guard ability because there is no healing spells other than what is called mediguard so consumables which are limited to 5 at first with some room for expansion later making having a guard ability pretty much mandatory so 9 abilities in total. Each garb has a stamina bar that will recover faster when it is not the currently equipped garb or very slowly if no action is taken when it is equipped so huh yeah it is something very different than any other FF I've played at least. The only mechanic that remained from the previous games is the stagger and it has the same role/importance. I'll say it's kind of fun to play with given that I never really felt much about FF XIII/XIII-2 combat in the first place, at least It made me learn a new combat but obviously it is not turn-based or active/action turn-based so much less strategic planning and more muscle memory. \n\nPretty sure I read the game was in part inspired by Skyrim and it shows, it is 4 big areas with their own theme/environment and 1 character to save which are Lightning's friends that have their own issues making you do leg work in order to save their soul so she can take them to a new world god is building for them because reasons and this is the same concept for every side quest done btw. I'm a bit bias when it comes to Skyrim because I enjoy exploration a lot and can overlook poorly written quests just because they make me go places and let me lose myself in the game world so this side of the game was some alright fun while I would not place it above the aforementioned game I did get some level of enjoyment. The problem has yet to be talked about however, the game is time limited and so the relaxing exploration that could be is not really there but partially since sometimes some of the quests tend to be a bit obscure and require some unusual steps to complete therefore taking a lot more time than they should unless you follow a guide which I strongly advise for once. There is a point system that allow the player to name the most important ones freeze time, teleport and freeze time during combat and only by killing monsters will the bar fill and eventually grant access to these powers with various costs but to be honest freezing time is not much of a solution it is still annoying to have to deal with a time limit and some quest objectives pretty much rely on the freeze time power otherwise it is quite the most annoying and strict quest design I have seen in my life. Everyday at 6 am Lightning is teleported at a hub to give the souls she collected and that for 13 days, with a guide it's easy to do most if not everything in half the time but at that point is it really fun? Personally I do not think so, the game has NG+ and it seems intentional to do multiple playthroughs (you retain almost everything you gain) and I do not think it is a good design if it so. It is not to say I hated the experience but it is definitely not something I will remember as great but only decent.\n\nLastly is the story or whatever this mess is, I can't say I loved the story of the trilogy so far especially after FF XIII-2 but I kept an open-mind and hoped for the best but I was not prepared for that. Most of the characters felt like they went backward with progression as if they forgot most of what they have done in the previous games. The dialog in some of the cutscenes actually managed to make me cringe maybe because I got frustrated with how dumb the characters became or something rather similar, it could also be about how the story kept pulling things out of nowhere to justify some plot points a high schooler could come up with. I was glad to finish it only because I could get a conclusion as unsatisfying as it was to see the ending which was on par with the quality of everything else in the story. I'm disappointed but I don't know what I expected with XIII-2 using time travel so poorly everything was already tangled up so Lightning returns had to deal with this mess and somehow finish the story in some fashion. The biggest argument against this game is easily the story so if you are like me and prioritise story first in FF games just don't play this, it was already obvious with XIII-2 that the writing went out of the window in quality but this is even worst. \n\nThe quality of the port is good at least for me performance was good and I didn't experience crashes or bugs so at least there is that. Unfortunately my opinion about about how it should have stopped at FF XIII remains unchanged, it is a shame because some ideas are interesting but going through the game with the story and the time limit made it a slog for a considerable portion of my experience. Unless you are that much of a completionist and really need an actual ending and made the mistake of going through XIII-2 or perhaps you have the capabilities of completely turn off your brain when listening to the story I cannot recommend this game, it is not worth the time invested especially if you have not played the previous games in the trilogy. 6/10 average", "timestamp_created": 1638339869, "timestamp_updated": 1638340015, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553550541400909424", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104697436": {"recommendationid": "104697436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028860067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1308, "last_played": 1638191760}, "language": "english", "review": "Lightning does not need a god, she is just awesome! :) Lovely soundtrack, great visuals and lots of Lightning!", "timestamp_created": 1638192131, "timestamp_updated": 1638216737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104603067": {"recommendationid": "104603067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107190037", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1639342455}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1638130091, "timestamp_updated": 1638130091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104544556": {"recommendationid": "104544556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848919006", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 6225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6225, "last_played": 1638107373}, "language": "english", "review": "The FF13 trilogy was for me very satisfying to play as each game improved on the last and added/removed mechanics to make it play fundementally different. Most of the characters in the trilogy are memorable, some are weaker and shilled out more, such as Snow. Not to say Snow is a weak character, he is just poorly executed and honestly comes off as a one dimensional love sick buffoon in this game while a cooler character like Sazh, just exists. \n\nThis game does try and for the most part succeed in addressing its plot holes. Attempts to give its main characters from prior games some screentime. I miss the battle system of 13-2 where you have an additional creature as a party member or just having the option to have a party member as the game feels rather lonely just playing lightning all the time. And I say this as someone who's favourite character was Hope. \n\n9/10. I would recommend anyone interested to play the trilogy to appreciate how Square really took some risks on this title and tried to flesh out the Nova Crystallis.\n\nThe 1 thing for this game I really liked was the extinction mechanic and how over-killing enemies will permamently remove them from the game. I felt like a dick sometimes doing so but hey, the world is over-populated anyway and natural selection is too slow for my liking XD.\n\nAlso dressing up Lightning was fun but some dress costumes are clearly more overpowered than the rest such as Cloud and Yuna's costumes.

Don't worry about running out of time in your first run. The way Lightning Returns works is the more resets the more powerful you get through repeating and doing quests. Eventually you might be able to pull off a run where you clear all quests and last ones. It is possible but I wouldn't worry too much about doing so.Just to note if your running oui of time for certain things you can always use your chronostasis.

Lightning is back one last time as the main protagonist. In this game, she returns as the savior whose job is to guide souls out from the dying world and into the new one. The more quests you complete the stronger you get and the more souls you save. You're given a max of 14 days to complete all main quests if you cannot within the time limit then it\u2019s GAME OVER. \n\nThere will be a clock ticking at the top right corner of the screen pressuring you. At first, I thought this was a horrible mechanic because I\u2019m the type that likes to explore and I absolutely hate being rushed but surprisingly the time limit gave me little trouble as I was able to complete all main quests with 3 days to spare. I used the remaining days to finish up some side quests. Looking back on it now I realize that the sense of urgency made the game all the more enjoyable and immersive.\n\nPeople complain about this game being too linear but having a massive open world and a time limit is like giving someone wings and chaining them down at the same time. It just wouldn\u2019t work so I could see why they went for a more linear path. There are a lot of returning characters which is always nice to see. Playing the previous two games is a must otherwise the story would be a confusing mess. Yes, the story is kinda out there and sometimes overdramatic I\u2019ll admit, but I\u2019d rather have that than a boring unambitious story. \n\nUnlike other Final Fantasy games, you don\u2019t gain experience from defeating enemies. You can get occasional drops from them but you really have to focus on those quests rather than just mindlessly looking for battles in hopes of getting stronger. \n\nLightning Returns was a hit or miss for some but I can applaud them for wanting to do something different rather than follow the same mechanic.

It's unfortunate that the previous two entries had enough technical problems that this point merited a callout,,.\n\nStory: I was satisfied with how the story was concluded. Along those lines, I enjoyed the foreshadowing and questions raised throughout the side quests. There is a third quest mechanism that acts as a bulletin board of quests with just snippets. These (almost) all felt like fetch quests, and I didn't think added much story or enjoyment wise. In the grand scheme of things the story feels much shorter compared to the previous two entires.\n\nGraphics: It kept the same design quality of the prior games, so I personally thought it looked great throughout.\n\nSoundtrack: Part II's OST is still my favorite of the three, but it was definitely still a strong and fitting soundtrack.\n\nGame Mechanics: All the cons I can think of fall into this category, so I will make a list.\n- While the time mechanic was fitting story-wise, I was simply not a fan of it. You get a time freeze ability which is fueled by a resource dropped by monsters, so I was constantly fighting mobs simply to replenish this resource and keep time frozen as much as I could. In hindsight, it clearly feels like the game is designed so you end up doing multiple playthroughs to fully explore and succeed but oh well.\n- The combat system from the previous game was was messily molded into an real time battle system instead of a turned based system. I honestly don't know why since I thought the system in the previous entries was unique and worked quite well. I would describe it as acceptable but it definitely felt like an unnecessary change and a downgrade from the system used in prior entries of the trilogy.\n- Who thought it was a good idea to have equipment lock abilities to a specific key?! Having abilities tied to equipment isn't unheard of, but in this game it's locked to a specific slot (which in turn is tied to a specific key). This \"feature\" is incredibly annoying when switching between different setups since ability key mappings will get rearranged. In some cases the same ability on two different pieces of equipment might happen to be locked to different slots/keys... On that note, I thought the overall equipment / ability system didn't encourage too much experimentation. I quickly funneled onto certain builds / abilities early on and didn't have many changes thereafter as the game progressed. The only exception is the superbosses for which I used a more customized setup. \n- There were various other small game mechanic details that I similarly thought felt flawed but I won't go through listing them all.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and how it ended the trilogy, but I felt like I was fighting the game mechanics at times.", "timestamp_created": 1635070070, "timestamp_updated": 1635070070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101319214": {"recommendationid": "101319214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280654142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1648384435}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome", "timestamp_created": 1634689668, "timestamp_updated": 1634689668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101230262": {"recommendationid": "101230262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198936128725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 645, "last_played": 1635829397}, "language": "spanish", "review": "este juego es una pasada, me encanta sobre todo por la protagonista,\nno dura mucho, ni poco. si no has jugado otro final fantasy como quiera te va a encantar.\nlightning es la besto waifu de final fantasy.xd\nno dudes en comprarlo y disfrutarlo.\nsaludos desde nuevo leon, mexico.\n", "timestamp_created": 1634524311, "timestamp_updated": 1634524311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581237256526947021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101138571": {"recommendationid": "101138571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879028002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10109, "last_played": 1634387381}, "language": "english", "review": "excellent combat system. nice open world concept. good replay value. definitely one of my favorite final fantasies.", "timestamp_created": 1634387568, "timestamp_updated": 1634387568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100825602": {"recommendationid": "100825602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157543664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 20859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14252, "last_played": 1677393493}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me gusta el estilo de pelea", "timestamp_created": 1633849050, "timestamp_updated": 1633849050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100652227": {"recommendationid": "100652227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198423263687", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 911, "last_played": 1699981687}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics - A mixed bag sometimes this game can look just as good as at least FFXIII-2 but a lot of other times the areas look like a PS2 game and even some NPC just look terrible the art direction is great though but again this is a huge step back - 70 out of 100 \n\nSound - One of the best in the series and it's a shame most wont ever get to hear it voice acting here however is the worst in any final fantasy game - 95 out of 100\n\nGameplay - Feels great and I hope to see this battle system again in another FF game 85 out of 100\n\nStory - Yeah this story sucks!

It absolutely is a good story I'm not insinuating that it isn't but it was nowhere close to needing three whole games to tell it, I feel like two would have been perfectly capable of the task; The way they did it ended up exhausting me, I just wanted to see the god damn story by the third game's start let alone its end. And that's a TLDR on this review.[/i]\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nLike I said above the story is good, at some points even great; I'd say that XIII-3 certainly does a better job in the story department than XIII-2 does but it still has to deal with a lot of crap because of all the \"time stuff\" that its predecessor got up to. \nI also feel that the way they handled character development and story in the 500 years interim was done well and allows them to subvert player expectations and pull a \"protagonists are antagonists\" move pretty well without it feeling forced.\nThe only issues I have with the story would be that it gets pretty damn confusing a lot of the time and to enjoy it you really have to shut your brain off, also like I stated in the TLDR a trilogy wasn't necessary and it leads to the game being somewhat tiresome when played back to back with it's progenitors.\n\nSo I liked and hated the ending. It's a good and solid ending to the story of the world of XIII but sucked as an ending for the characters we care about; It was no where CLOSE to as comprehensive as it should have been, In fact I know exactly how it could have perfect and the answer was simple, Include everything they did but steal a page from Gurren Lagann's book and end with [spoiler]Snow and Serah's wedding, showing everyone reunited in the process. (of course without you know what happening)[/spoiler] Instead what we got was just implications that they'll all reunite. and WE DIDN'T GET TO SEE THE FUCKING WEDDING THIS REALLY AGGRAVATED ME!.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nSo I'm not very fond of the gameplay this time around, I liked it in XIII and started to love it in XIII-2 but was surprised to see that XIII-3 wasn't using an ATB system but a completely new real time combat system; and not a particularly good one, In there attempt to create a \"Final Fantasy\" real time combat system I feel they sort of gutted a lot that could have made this great. The end result is slow and at times clunky battles that get really repetitive really quickly, Strategies almost always consist of [Identify elemental weakness] --> [Spam said element 'till stagger] --> [wack with heavy swing 'till stagger ends] rinse and repeat until done, notable exceptions are enemies that need to be hit within a certain time frame but a comatose monkey can do that. Actually the combat loop annoyingly reminds me of how almost every fight in FFX could be beaten with the same strategy, fuck that. They really should have just continued improving on the high quality ATB system they had in XIII and XIII-2 as I feel that would have improved the experience vastly.\n\nThe transition to an open world proper was well done and I have no complaints other than the performance while better than the abysmal frame rates of XIII-2 still chugs HARD whenever you move faster than a snails pace inside a city, at worst it puts strain on your eyes because of the inconsistency and at best can be ignored so whatever.\n\nNow a big thing in the game, the Majoras Mask like timer system; This the game absolutely could have done without, It isn't that it prevents you from completing the game as I was able to do everything I could find with four whole days to spare. The problem is that it pushes this artificial sense of urgency that without context of how much time you REALLY have will make you just run through the game and never just take anything in like one tends to do with not just these titles but video games in general. but that's heavily opinionated so I'll just leave it there.\n\n[b]Graphics and Soundtrack[/b]\nLike XIII and XIII-2 this game looks absolutely incredible, from the texture work to art style it's all just so god damn beautiful and awe-inspiring. One of my favourite things (though this could have gone in gameplay) is the character customisation, While at times perverted and/or repetitious the vast majority of the available outfits (and there's A LOT) are incredible and allow tons of player choice, I would have really liked the option to wear a cosmetic outfit over your used one though as by the end the outfits with the best stats weren't the ones I liked.\n\nThe soundtrack is good... don't really know what I can say here, It isn't as good as XIII-2's soundtrack or XIII's for that matter and its best songs are re-used from the prior two games. I, having just beat the game can't for the life of me think of a single memorable original song from the game. just that I didn't \"dislike\" any of the tracks per se.\n\n[b]Fin~[/b]\nSo yeah, I guess I liked the game, I recommend it but you have to really like the story of XIII and XIII-2 to not get bored by this point, try to grab it on sale and expect performance issues on average hardware.\n\n[There's also a small novella that takes place just prior to the ending proper called Final Fantasy XIII: Reminiscence -tracer of memories- that you can read about online but it's not particularly important as all it really does is cement that everyone is in fact okay in the new world.]\n\n[b]some last points from my notes I didn't fit in the review[/b]\n- Levelling being substituted for stat gains from quest completion is neat but I would have rather the game kept a traditional exp system.\n- Hope never shuts the fuck up \n- So was hope reborn in his child body!? what the fuck square, Hope was a grown man by this point are they trying to say he just became a kid again? (i'm talking about the real hope here not the puppet thing (or whatever the hell was happening there I'm so confused))\n- story seems to have some weird plot hole things (that it actually makes light of itself) example being Odin gets reborn as the chocobo and that one side quest with the woman who continued ageing. \n\n[i]Probably never playing these games again.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1633216976, "timestamp_updated": 1633216976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100149127": {"recommendationid": "100149127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067652263", "num_games_owned": 666, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2676, "last_played": 1632848681}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was fun to play, until the final dungeon/boss.

FFXIII had its own satisfying and conclusive ending that didn't need to be expanded upon. That's largely why I disliked FFXIII-2 so much. It tinkered with an already good ending and made it more convoluted. And while the combat in FFXIII-2 was faster, I don't think it was better. XIII-2 tended to pigeonhole you into one or two specific combat styles; largely either because the fights were so easy they didn't require strategy, OR, they were so hard they forced you to be very specific about strategy. There was no in between and it didn't encourage expirementation. \n\nLightning Returns on the other hand is probably one of the best combat systems in the entire FF franchise, and one of the best combat systems in an RPG period. It allows for a huge variety in playstyles and the combat is quite in depth with tons of different strategies to employ. The use of different schematas allows you to play with builds and assemble a set that all compliment each other. The only instance in which I felt a very specific strategy was required, was for the game's two superbosses, which are entirely optional. \n\nStory-wise it redeems the less-than-stellar XIII-2 plot and provides another satisfying conclusion to the series. Which again, I felt it didn't need to exist, but if you tasted sour grapes from XIII-2's story, this title fixes it in spades.\n\nOverall, I actually really enjoyed this entry and it earned a place as one of my favorite Final Fantasy games.", "timestamp_created": 1631724091, "timestamp_updated": 1631724091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99180862": {"recommendationid": "99180862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338418489", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 3248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3024, "last_played": 1654046791}, "language": "english", "review": "BEING A SAVIOUR DURING THE END TIMES IS AWESOME\n\nJust found out that normal mode is actually hard difficulty. I'm not afraid to admit that this is the first time I did not have fun of a game because of the difficulty. I rage quitted on every boss, made multiple saves to undo whatever I did wrong, and overall just not having a good time. And also my lack of knowledge in the game's combat system contributes to me not having a good time. 20 hours in, and I just want to stop. I thought, maybe I will never end this game in the future. But I kept on moving forward. Kept on pushing.\n\nI broke my most sacred rule when playing a video game; searching up a guide on the internet. I usually gave this rule a pass on final bosses only. But I immediately open up a guide on the very first boss encounter (not the tutorial one) Oh how terrible of a sin I have committed. This game really drained the soul out of me. Immediate uninstall after reaching the credits. Feeling glad, I put down my controller. Sigh of relief. I have finally finished the Final Fantasy XIII Trilogy.\n\nDespite being one of the most stressful game I have ever played, weirdly enough, I kinda LIKE this game. And planning on coming back to achieve 100% completion in the future. \n\nLightning Returns: FFXIII is one of the most unique game I have ever played. Mechanics like the timer really pairs well with the overall narrative. In this game, you play as Lightning, the protagonist from Final Fantasy XIII, and also basically a saviour and prophet sent down by God to save souls from a dying world. You have thirteen days to save everyones' soul. And also the dying world have their time frozen, making everyone unable to repopulate, grow up, and basically become an immortal. A 5 year old will stay being a five year old no matter how much time, days, years, passed. Unable to grow up. Unable to die,\n\nI love the premise of the game. Going down to the world of Nova Chrysalia every day and doing sidequests to save people is really fun. The aspect of how different people cope with the end times, or how it is being unable to die, is really very well thought out and crafted. All of the sidequests are fun to explore and never felt dull and fetch-questy like in Final Fantasy XV. The sidequests in this game are the core of the narrative and also gameplay. You won't level up and gain stat increase by killing monsters like other JRPGs do. You have to do sidequests, and each of them are very entertaining and memorable. \n\nThe main quests are splitted in each region of the world. You can start whenever parts you want. Maybe start the one in the desert first? Or maybe the woods? (I maybe wrong in this) Basically there is freedom in exploring the main campaign although theres a time limit. (I'm lookin at you, Deadrising). Not linear and on rails like the first game. The downside of the main quests are you have to play the past games in order to get invested in the characters. Some character changes will leave you leaving kinda 'meh' because not knowing them. Well, this is the third installment in a trilogy. Make sense when putted that way.\n\nThe combat although I do not enjoy is very customisable and can provide various playstyle. Instead of doing the Paradigm System like the first two games, This game made a whole new combat system where you control Lightning and her three Schematas. Schematas are basically jobs and roles Lightning can turn into in battle. You can have Schemata that focuses on physical damage, one on magic damage, one on debuffing, and more. In line with customisable jobs, you can also decorate her with adornments and colours. Basically kinda like a waifu simulator. \n\nThe enemies, mob encounters, are very threatening if not equipped with the right schematas. This where I falter when it comes to combat. You have to know what enemy you're facing and its weaknesses before encountering them. Preparation is key in this game. If unequipped with the wrong schematas, well bad luck. You either have to; A) brute force your way through, or B) flee from battle that will penalised your time adding an hour to the clock, or C) just reload a past save so you won't get penalised. This where I wasn't having a good time in the game. The real normal mode won't penalised you if you flee.\n\nThe soundtrack is spectacular. The ambience while travelling is kinda lit ngl. The graphics are also gorgeous this game had a low budget compare to the first game. \n\nOverall, looks like I'm gushing the hell outta this game. I was not having a good time and ended up loving the game. Wait, what?\n\n5/5\n\nP.S: Alternate title: IF YAKUZA AND FINAL FANTASY HAD A BABY, IT WOULD BE THIS.\n\nEdit: Altered the score since I'm just loving this game more and more.

This is the last game in a trilogy of games including Final Fantasy 13 and Final Fantasy 13-2. Unlike 13-2, this game was ported fine with some minor bugs. It basically ends the Nova Crystal series. Note that the story for the while series is very convuluted. If you have trouble understanding it like me, i suggest finding a youtube video online that tries to unconvulute the storyline. In this game you play as lightning solo and do missions to save people's souls before the end of the world. There are only 4 areas in the game that are semi open world, but because of the mechanic of limited time in the game, you will be very busy going back and forth to these 4 areas. Anyways, here is my pro/cons list:\n\nPROS:\n\n- You get to play as lightning sololy. This takes alot of strategy. \n- You can change clothing as much as a movie star as each clothing has different skills built into them and stats. This is similiar to the X-2 dress sphere system.\n- There is a time limit, but once you figure out how to cheese it with a skill, it is not that bad. Still, you always have a ticking clock to watch.\n- The game area's are gorgeous and great graphics.\n- The ability to change dress colors to whatever you want.\n- Lots of side quests and Canvas of Prayers quests.\n- Defeating secret monsters.\n\nCONS:\n\n- There is clipping using some of the dresses and weapons different combos. This is a minor bug, but can be annoying.\n- You cannont change the color of weapons. Some of them are ugly and really need this as a feature.\n- Weird graphical issues when in cutscenes. For example, some of lightning clothing turns black and then back to normal.\n- Although i like alot of the music, it has been recycled from previous games in the series. Alot of the music will be the same with some new tracks thrown in.\n\nRecommended. If you liked the rest of the series, you will like this game. The difficulty is semi steep. The first time i played the game, i ran out of time until i found that using a skill helps you alot. Also, lots of things to do in the game before beating it. So if your a fan of the rest of the series, i suggest picking up the final game in this series.", "timestamp_created": 1630259495, "timestamp_updated": 1630259594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714379847049713135", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98428561": {"recommendationid": "98428561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309341124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1618042740}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, Ganbate...", "timestamp_created": 1630220444, "timestamp_updated": 1630220444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98421463": {"recommendationid": "98421463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218758943", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 713, "last_played": 1539805805}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful Game. \nSuch a good story telling and Characters.

I finished this game on PS3 before getting into PC Gaming. This game redeemed the XIII series. The setting is the end of the world, the apocalypse, and your job is to save people before the clock runs out. And yes, the clock is literally running because the game plays like Majora's Mask, but on crack. Worry not, because fighting enemies restores EP, and for small amounts of EP you can use Chronostatis, which freezes the clock so you can actually save souls with \"infinite\" time. I finished the game using that ability up until the final day, so the concept of \"running out of time\" was a non-issue if I kept my EP levels up. Running into Chaos nets you extra EP, so it's a good idea to run into a patch of Chaos if you really need to use Chronostatis and are low on EP.\nNow, onto the gameplay. The R1 to change outfits is amazing. Outfits, known as Schemata, all do something completely different and allow you to junction different attacks and abilities to them. The potion system reminds me of KH1 because the potions do not auto-fill and you need to go buy more if you are low. Yes, there are only 6 slots for potions, and that's a concern. However, to combat that, the game has a guarding mechanic that severely reduces damage taken, ontop of any buffs you have due to items or schemata.\nThis MUSIC in this game is among the best in the XIII trilogy. The Dead Dunes area features Gabe McNair, the drummer from Green Day, as the vocalist to the game area. The last area before the final battle has some extremely somber music that's catchy and fits the game's current mood.\nI LOOOOVE the lore in this game as well. It expands upon XIII-2 in such a way, and the \"End Of The World\" vibe to this game is shown in the NPCs walking past to even the world design. Even looking out the window in certain areas really give off the apocalypse vibe.\nThis game is an underrated gem that gets thrown under the rug because it's associated with one of the most abhorrent titles in the entire FF franchise.", "timestamp_created": 1627495248, "timestamp_updated": 1627495248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96350792": {"recommendationid": "96350792", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994410542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1658596715}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly don't get the hate for this game.

It concludes the whole saga in a very different yet satisfying way. \n\nTechnically this game is quite different than its predecessors. The battle system is completely different than the previous two as in this game you can play only as Lightning but there is the catch. Lightning can swtich garbs in between the battle to give her variety of moves and versatility. Garbs is something similar to Final Fantasy X-2's dressspheres. If that doesn't gives an idea then simply consider a garb as a job. In essence its a job system for Lightnng alone.\n\nThe overall playing experience of this game is very unique than tradional Final Fantasy where you spend time in your characters. You farm experience and items to improve your characters. That is not the case over here. Design wise the game has limited time which means that to finish the main story you have limited in-game time hence to improve your character you need to complete side quests. Sidequests provide you with improved items and stats upgrade you need to make Lightning stronger. Initially the timer system creates pressure but once you get a hang of it then you realize that the whole game has been designed around timer to make it playable.\n\nI personally enjoyed the story a lot and specially the ending as it made the whole trilogy experience worthwhile to me. I think the end is fitting to the whole trilogy and it made sense to me.\n\nThe steam port is well made compared to the last two game. After installing the game and before starting the game just make sure to change the graphics settings to Advanced.

I am not an FF13 fan and have not played the other 2 games, but I have read summaries about them and to be honest, the story wasn't that bad, as some might have led me to believe, it's perfectly fine, so I won't be going into detail about that in this review.\n\nWhile small, part of the appeal that this game has garnered is due to the claim that the combat is as good as DMC, and can stand top and shoulders with some of the best this medium offers. I really wish that was the case. Most damming of all, is that the game fails at communicating its elements in gameplay clearly. In this game you have 3 different schemata which you can equip abilities and switch to on the fly. Since you will be constantly switching abilities, you'd think the game would go out of its way to make it as easy as possible to see what abilities you have at the moment. Unfortunately, the game just displays text of the name of the skill and calls it a day. This means that it is very hard to see what you have equipped on the midst of battle. You might be reading this and thinking that it can't be too hard reading a piece of text to determine what skill you have, but let me show you alternative ways they game could have displayed the skills.\n\nThe game could have used coloured symbols of the attacks you currently have so that it is easy to glance at your skill list and know what you have equipped. Seeing a symbol is much easier to interpret than reading because you don't have to focus on seeing it perfectly to decipher it's meaning. Just seeing a general outline of a distinct shape and colour would be enough, where as with text, you got to focus on each skill name clearly to discern what you got. Again, this might not have been an issue, if the game wasn't an action game or didn't have you switching between so many different skill sets, yet the game fails to make gauging what is going on more difficult than it needed to be. Another method they could have used is to flash the skill of abilities in front of lightning for a second or two after switching schemata, so that players would not have to look to the corner of the screen away from the midst of the battle. It's like the game is going out of its way to make things difficult for you.\n\nThe visibility problems don't end there, otherwise my gripe with reading skill names would have been a minor one, but it is because it gets added on to so much more messy visual design that it does become a detriment. Numbers are so freaking large they take up too much of the screen, look at Nioh to see how big your numbers should be. Magic attacks have so many layers of glow and bloom that they completely obscure the battle field, which is why I never use them at close range cause otherwise I am completely blind to an attack. The camera is either too close to lighting making spacial awareness difficult or so far away enemies start to cover lighting, and since she moves so slowly it's hard to correct, but there is even more! When you get a stagger, the game zooms in in the enemy you got it on, making you completely blind to whatever other enemy is coming to get you, you'd think they would give you i frames at least so you don't get tagged after doing a properly timed guard and shifting the view so you see nothing, but nope. Some attacks are also too hard to see, like aero which is almost a semi transparent wind orb that is so small you got to be actively looking out for it when the game signals to you the enemies are doing \"Aero\" and in a battlefield with this much clutter you just end up spamming guard and hoping for the best. Speaking of attack signals, they are too inconsistent. Usually, the game will signal what attack an enemy is doing in classic FF fashion but sometimes that very same attack is not signaled and the enemy does it anyways. Like why have a textbox that announces the attack if it only appears whenever the game feels like it.\n\nThe polish isn't great as you can see, and this applies to the enemy design. There was one enemy that only did \"rush\" as it's only attack making you have to chase it up and down as it proceeds to do its only move, great enemy design. Or, enemies are barely disctint and none of their attack animations are interesting or pose an interesting challenge with a few exceptions. Also some enemies cast magic in such an unconvincing way, that if I hadn't seen the fireball coming out of their hands, I wouldn't have guessed they were casting magic. Enemy polish was not this game's priority. Yet what irks me most about the combat system is how passive enemies can be sometimes, feeling like you are just hacking away till they swing. Sometimes they stay still for so long it gets kind of awkward, and since there is so much cluttler you will end up pulling your attacks so that the attack particles don't obscure the enemies attack since sometimes their attack indicators don't happen and what ends up occuring is that the enemy does nothing and you stand still like idiots.\n\nIt's obvious that there's a lot of baggage with creating an action game with the assets from two other games that were meant to be more traditional jrpg's but the hype, albeit small, that this game has conjured up is way overblown. The gameplay is super mediocre due to lack of polish even though there are some great mechanics to elevate one's play.", "timestamp_created": 1625571855, "timestamp_updated": 1625571855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95130480": {"recommendationid": "95130480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305900710", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1686337000}, "language": "english", "review": "NC build Weapon Effect -95% Max Health and Shield Effect -95% Max Health with Perferct Guard :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1625514604, "timestamp_updated": 1625514604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95126900": {"recommendationid": "95126900", "author": {"steamid": "76561199107001308", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1636916905}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego por si solo es hermoso y bastante bueno pero el port que hicieron para pc es asta ofensivo  ya que tiene unos controles horribles y creo que no se pueden cambiar pareciera casi obligatorio usar control, otro punto es que no esta optimizado mi pc no es de la Nasa ni nada pero es bastante buena y el echo de que el juego me valla con unos fps tan bajos me dice que no esta optimizado, la verdad me decepciono ya que es uno de mis juegos favoritos y verlo as\u00ed de mal en pc me hizo enojar", "timestamp_created": 1625511177, "timestamp_updated": 1625511177, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95028008": {"recommendationid": "95028008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363909543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 998, "last_played": 1679528518}, "language": "english", "review": "it's fun", "timestamp_created": 1625399101, "timestamp_updated": 1625399101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94906884": {"recommendationid": "94906884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305655018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14022, "last_played": 1670909397}, "language": "english", "review": "Music: 8/10, lots of enjoyable things that I never got tired of hearing.\nCombat: 10/10, This games combat is the absolute pinnacle of combat for me.

I highly recommend starting on easy mode which is something I almost never do.  But this game's battle system is incredibly difficult and takes some practice.  It is the weakest story of the FFXIII series.  Most of your time is spent \"saving souls\" i.e. running around everywhere and completing side quests for random characters you don't care about which is how you level up.  And once the side quest is complete, you most likely will never speak to them again.  There is no grinding enemies.  You can fight 10,000 battles, and if you never completed a quest, you won't be leveled up at all.  That made New Game + really boring in my opinion.  I love the idea of leveling Lightning up to a ridiculous level since she fights solo in this game, but I do not want to be the people's errand boy anymore, completing the same mostly un-interesting side quests over and over again.  \n\nAll your old friends from XIII & XIII-2 do make appearances.  And some briefly (and I do mean briefly) join you for a few fights.  But mostly, you are solo for the whole experience.  The battle mechanics and the desire to know how the story ends carry the game.  And after all the issues with XIII and XIII-2's ports to PC, it is nice that this title works straight \"out of the box\" and doesn't constantly freeze and crash like its predecessors.  I'm glad I played the whole trilogy and think all three are well worth playing.  But I wouldn't buy this game if you've never played the first two.  The story is convoluted enough as it is.  You'll at least want the context from the first two games.  And those... you should probably play on a console rather than PC.  The ports are awful and Square Enix apparently does not care.  \n\nThe game itself I give a B- for your first playthrough.  As for replay-ability afterward... D-.

Yet, you cannot also say that the story allows many non-linear plot as the open world is not too massive vs. Final Fantasy 13. \n\n2) Character\n- Well, you get to play Lightning and Lightning only, what is there to complain? You can even change her clothes and customize her schemata (skill sets) which is cool. You will also get to meet characters from the past prequel which completes and add to the story.\n\n3) Battle System\n- While I would say that the battle system is similar to that of the past Final Fantasy 13 series, honestly i feel that Lightning Return is lacking compared to its' predecessor. \n- They are more or less the same battle system in the series, but with the added feature of the schemata to change from (3 schemata). But compare this to its predecessors, because there are no other characters to participate in the battle, the flexibility of battle is that much reduced, which also means that there are less customization and strategies in battle (when you compare to the variety of paradigms in FF13 that is). I will not go that far to say that the battle system ruined the game, but when you compare to it's predecessors, it pales slightly.\n- However, i have to say that the sacrificed in flexibility in battle gives the added feature of schemata which allow Lightning to change clothes is pretty damn cool if you ask me. And this only makes me want to play Lightning Return more.\n\nOverall, i cannot say that i like the curfew in the game, but overall I totally love playing this game (as you can see I've clocked over 250 hours in this game).

While the entire series is not exactly the most polished game series out there, Lightning Returns takes what we know about the XIII series and turns it on its head.\n\nThe story is unlike the previous two in that Lightning is solo (for the most part) through her journey. Your job as part time Savior / Demigod, is to help people accept their fate, help them with their issues and give their souls to you for safe passage to the new world. (Spoiler alert: The world is ending in 13 days [max])\n\nThe big kicker with LR is that Lightning fights by herself in this game (besides temporary companions). The battle system is no longer preselected Auto-fighting, but instead a very robust Schemata system. Similar to the paradigm system of the previous games, you get to switch between 3 separate garbs all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each of these Schemata can have up to 4 abilities of your choosing, while some offer unique strengths with their \"baked in\" abilities. A great example of this is an early game garb you can obtain called the Mi'qote Dress. It provides you with excellent healing capability via removing debuff or ailments you might get hit with.\n\nEach of these 3 Schemata you equip before battle can be swapped to at will in said battles as well. However, their is a caveat to doing so. Each of these separate fighting garbs/paradigms/etc have their own independent ATBs attached to them. So using them wisely in encouraged and mandatory. You'll find yourself switching often as each garb/paradigm that is on cooldown with regenerate ATB over time. While in one of your schemata, using abilities will drain the ATB gauge. Some moves drain more than others as is dictacted by their ATB cost (usually found attached to the ability itself.)\n\nThe game is based around a limited time / end of the world style exploration system. You have a finite amount of time to complete the main story line / do side quests, but don't fret. With each major main quest completed you extend and push out the remaining time you have by large portions. So, I wouldn't be too concerned with your time management / minmaxing every little thing you can do at every moment.\n\nAnother thing I should mention that is fun is this game offers what I like to refer to as an \"extinction system\". Because the end of the world is drawing close, there is little time for populations of monster to repopulate. This game actually functions on a dead and gone system. If you continously hunt the same enemy over and over, eventually they will become endangered and finally you will hunt them to extinction. Normally this might sound bad, but there are often huge ebenfits to hunting baddies to extinction. Namely, when you kill all of them, one final enhanced version of that enemy will spawn to desperately fight back. If you manage to kill this one, you will net (usually) an enhanced ability drop that they normally wouldnt have. Materials to upgrade your abilities to make them stronger, as well as a unique item on their grave. This could be anything from an accessory to a weapon. These are often some of the strongest one off items you will find in the game. So experimenting with what enemy to cause extinction on is very fun! (I recommend Behemoths, Skeletons, and Cyclops).\n\nWell to wrap up this review, as I'm sure I'm rambling, the overall story and battle system are decent. There are four major areas you can explore all with their own major story lines, a ton of side quests, an effectively great battle system, and tons of NPC interaction (which the previous games lacked)\n\nWhile I know people tend to shit on the FFXIII game series as a whole, this is definitely the prize of the bunch. Not to mention their are a couple uber bosses and a final dungeon hidden in the game that requires unlocking a secret day. \n\nGet it on sale, try it out, if you were on the fence you might find yourself enjoying the battle system to the point where you can make it through the entire game, and strangely enough Lightning actually gains a personality the more the story progresses. (A huge improvement from her previous games)\n\nGood luck hunting those monsters to extinction! Also there is a fantastic Cheat Engine table if you would like a more relax playthrough that can freeze time, give you max stats, etc. (As someone who played the game originally and wanted to 100% this puppy, it was a godsend for certain materials I didn't want to farm!)", "timestamp_created": 1619765872, "timestamp_updated": 1619765872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91071778": {"recommendationid": "91071778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847208823", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2060, "last_played": 1689785859}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun gameplay.

The ending of this game is what really makes it special.

You only play as Lightning, which might seem disappointing, but it's actually very fun. Whereas the first two games focused on shifting your paradigm based on how the battle is going, Lightning Returns is all about shifting your schemata. This means your armor, weapon, and spells all change based on which of your three equipped schemata you use. It is very satisfying to create and use different types of schemata and destroy enemies.\nThis port is the best of the trilogy by far. It was nearly always running at 60 fps for me, but it did sometimes drop down to the high 40s or low 50s if a lot was happening. After finishing XIII - 2 and then immediately starting this game up, the first thing I exclaimed was \"60 FPS! It looks so smooth!\" One gripe I do have with the graphics of this game is that the lighting can look a little strange sometimes. Like its clearly night, and there should be shadows and stuff, but for some reason everything is bright. This was not a huge deal breaker for me because the rest of the game was so fun.\nOverall, if you liked XIII and XIII-2, or even if you only liked XIII, I would highly recommend playing this game.

Well worth a look for RGP fans and those who like the Final Fantasy series.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nIf you played this entry without playing the previous game you would be missing vast amounts of backstory (it\u2019s more forced on the events of the second game than the first, however it does try to explain past events). The story continues on 500 years after the end of Final Fantasy XIII-2. Chaos has slowly eaten away at the entire world until 4 bastions remain. Within those area\u2019s humanity is slowly dwindling away, with individuals who remain left burdened with guilt at the last 500 years of failures and regrets. Everyone lives in a depressive half-life, no longer aging, but not being able to start a family and still being able to perish by monster attacks and disease. Lightning is awoken by Bhunivelze, the god of light to free the burdens from those she can and carry forth their souls to the new world he is creating, with the promise of resurrecting Serah if she performs this task. The game heavily focusses on wrapping up events for the main protagonists in the previous games, and acts a redemption game for Lightning, though it is the darkest entry out of the 3 games. I found all of the major plot points were well thought out, and there\u2019s lots of little scenes that have been added to the game as nice touches, like how Hope and Lightning reminisce if you start a new game plus mode.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nGameplay has been significantly changed again, and there even less in common with this entry to the previous two games. I thought a lot of the changes were great, much like the previous game really transformed how you tackle enemies and quests. You are on a countdown much like Zelda: Majora's Mask with a full day/night cycle. Completing main story missions extends your available day count, while side quests extends the time fractionally and acts as your XP though some can only be progressed at set times. Each quest completion rewards you with additional health, strength and magic, making quests the primary path for upgrading Lightning\u2019s stats. While you do have an option of freezing the countdown it isn\u2019t infinite unless you keep fighting enemies, which only reward you with drops for quests or skills, and eventually run out - you can make majority of the in game enemies go extinct! You are given the freedom to explore any of the world\u2019s 4 areas in any order, and the game itself is very non-linier, allowing you to progress as you see fit, though some areas are harder than others.\n\nAs stats are increased by completing side quests you don\u2019t have to worry about how you are going to upgrade Lightning\u2019s skill tree as its been removed (there\u2019s no end game strategy to work towards). Costumes you purchase and find change some of your base stats (health, magic or strength, extend the ATB gauge or add other effects), along with the sword and shield she equips. There are accessories you can apply that add further buffs or immunities, as well one category that is for purely cosmetic changes. Physical and magic skills (offensive and defensive) are assigned to each costume setup, for a total of four attacks for each of the 3 interchangeable costumes you wear into battle. Each setup has its own ATB gauge that fills up when not in use, and each attack drains it by the used skills cost. It\u2019s quite an inventive system, allowing for lots of customisation and experimentation.\n\nThe game is now a single player ARPG, with a few very limited team battles. Like the previous game enemies are shown on the screen in real time (there\u2019s no random battles), and you can now easily engage or run away as needed. Battles are similar to how they were previously, however they usually require the correct setup otherwise can be very difficult to beat. The available enemy types have been drastically reduced to sub 50 types, and this fits into making that type of enemy extinct (it\u2019s harder than it sounds to fight an enemy type enough to make this happen without purposely farming them). For maximum effects in combat you still need to stagger enemies to weaken them (which uses a different method now) then hammer home attacks while they are down. Fortunately, you can purchase their data before you encounter most of them making pre fight setup much easier and which advises their stagger conditions.\n\nCrafting and upgrading has been changed again, with you merging skills that are dropped from enemies. This usually increases damage and can be well worth it for performing stronger attacks with the same move cost. Accessories are upgraded by collecting multiples (new game plus mode), and weapons and armour are available to upgrade late game with item pickups.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe graphics are the same as the previous two entries, and each area is its own self-contained biome, with a desert filled with tombs, 2 cities and open field & mountainous area as the games primary setting. Most of the enemies are reused assets from the previous game, though the landscapes do look good. Lightning now boasts increased customisation via the outfit system. If you want her to rock a cool pair of sunnies, party hat, or some other item you can - these follow through into combat and are only missing from the movie sequences. There are plenty of in game cut scenes, especially when finishing guests.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\nThe voice acting was outstanding, just as it was in the previous games. Many of the NPC\u2019s have quite depressing stories, however their lines are delivered with feeling and a sense of acceptance that nothing is going to change but nothing is over the top. More focus is on the main characters of the previous games, who show a lot more emotion and expression, but remain true to the characters they were in previous entries. The music score is great, featuring more percussion and having lots of the songs being tweaks of Lightning\u2019s previous track or using it as a base.\n\n[b]DLC[/b]\nThe included DLC features a host of different costumes, weapons and shields that can give you an early game boost. Nothing that\u2019s going to break the game, but it\u2019s nice its included for free.\n\n[b]Achievements[/b] \nThe game is easy to get 100% achievements if you know which quests to tackle, otherwise will require a few reruns to mop up.\n\nFor more reviews please visit https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31327216/", "timestamp_created": 1617519939, "timestamp_updated": 1617519999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571949422359466553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89629596": {"recommendationid": "89629596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083210526", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 2775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1618065019}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Historia 8,5/10\nSonido: 8/10\nJugabilidad: 8/10\nRendimiento: 8,5/10 (existe stutter al transicionar de zona)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1617451637, "timestamp_updated": 1617451637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89546222": {"recommendationid": "89546222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047275302", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1165, "last_played": 1617285968}, "language": "english", "review": "The finding item part in a limited amount of time is so tiring but chilling for some reason", "timestamp_created": 1617347428, "timestamp_updated": 1617347428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489466488361358643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89509841": {"recommendationid": "89509841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091120792", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7540, "last_played": 1618020202}, "language": "english", "review": "<3 lightning", "timestamp_created": 1617299430, "timestamp_updated": 1617299430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89479082": {"recommendationid": "89479082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091837731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6163, "last_played": 1692342176}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is great and features one of if not my favorite battle system from any game I've played.

The option to scale the display area would've been nice to have in XIII-2 as well. Oddly enough, when setting Lightning Returns to 1080p windowed, the window still almost spans the entire screen.\n\nAs for odd quirks and issues:\n[list]\n[*]The game stutters often when traveling through areas, supposedly from NPCs being loaded in. They can also be seen awkwardly speed-walking for brief moments. When completing quests, their souls tend to float towards Lightning before they perform their arm-lifting animation. In Luxerion, several NPCs can be seen standing inside the clock tower pedestal.\n[*]Interacting with various objects at 60 FPS can be buggy. I eventually lost access to a Gysahl Green spot when planting, and others say harvesting them caused the same result (unsure if it happens with Tantal and Sylkis Greens). The Cactuar statues in the Dead Dunes may teleport Lightning to a different location even when cancel is selected, but that only happened once too. Aeronite also attacks twice as often after the 4th stagger with 60 FPS.\n[*]About half of all character dialogue is out of sync with their lip movements. This wasn't an issue on console or in the other PC ports. Locking the framerate to 30 FPS and trying different resolutions and graphics settings as well as windowed display didn't help.\n[*]Character and enemy models seem to stutter when moving and multiple footstep sounds can be heard.\n[*]Some textures/objects can be seen flickering, and the screen sometimes flashes when striking an enemy on the field.\n[*]The lighting at Canopus Farms sometimes gets a little weird, causing the ground to be shiny.\n[*]A brief static sound can be heard occasionally, probably from the game loading audio. \n[*]The music that plays when enemies are on the field doesn\u2019t loop properly after a while.\n[*]There were a couple of instances of the Angel of Valhalla squawking despite not being anywhere around.\n[*]When doing Morris's quest in Yusnaan, he didn't ever whip out his trumpet, instead standing awkwardly on his soapbox (even during the cutscene where he\u2019s supposed to play Miracles). This seemed to resolve itself as time went on.\n[*]When reading Ranulph\u2019s journal, the text scrolls by very quickly. Seems to be a framerate issue, and it might also happen for the other couple instances of scrolling text.\n[*]In Yusnaan, I was able to talk to the pyrotechnician near the train station and obtain fireworks twice, cutscene and quest marker and all.\n[*]Probably not a technical issue, but the Yusnaan loudspeaker constantly repeats itself without pause, even overlapping itself when running through areas, which gets grating really quickly. The citizens of Yusnaan must have an attention span of a few seconds if it has to repeat that often, especially when Lightning sticks out like a sore thumb. The same goes with Hope interrupting dialogue, sometimes even his own. Likewise, the people in Poltae constantly enter and exit the buildings there.\n[*]Dogs and cats are scattered across the game, presumably leftovers from the Outerworld services.\n[*]Battle quotes stop playing as of a Windows 10 update.\n[/list]\n\nIssues others claim to have had:\n[list]\n[*]In Yusnaan, the Deep-fried Niblet quest loops, the Miqo\u2019te Dress garb isn\u2019t rewarded properly, and Pickett doesn\u2019t appear until reloading save (also a console issue).\n[*]Examining glyphs in the Wildlands temple doesn't work.\n[*]Picking up or launching fireworks crashes the game.\n[*]The Ultimate Lair doesn\u2019t unlock.\n[/list]\n\nAside from all that, the game only crashed once 130 hours in (including idle time).", "timestamp_created": 1615825642, "timestamp_updated": 1615888433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509090900421142578", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87906725": {"recommendationid": "87906725", "author": {"steamid": "76561199022288108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3966, "last_played": 1668715910}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this game a lot because I already played it on 360 and knew what I was getting into. Since you have only limited time of gameplay, as there are only a couple of days ingame that you have to finish the story, you need to learn it and embrace its mechanics. The point of the game is to replay it several times, so there's no need to get frustrated (new game plus is a given). If you learn to play properly, you can freeze time very often and extend the gameplay time up to 13 days, which is more than enough. I was done with everything way before that limit and that included defeating all the superbosses and sidequests.\nThat being said, if you can tolerate a JPRG, you'll like this game. Lightning's personality is horrible as usual but at least she's pretty enough to look at and the emotional atmosphere is what you'd expect of Final Fantasy.

It took me a half hour or so but I was up to speed again very quickly.\n\nIt's not a bad game, just lighter and simpler than it appears on first glance, and definitely leaning into being a Lightning fan-service entry. Basically, the combat(which like every FF, is where all the strategy is) has a lot of abilities and equipment, but it boils down to rotating between three configurations(schemata) and using the abilities among them that the enemy is weak to, plus blocking as necessary. It's a bit on the challenging side to start, and then as you gain some power and learn the patterns it becomes much easier. Likewise, the game has four different regions, but they're all pretty small and densely packed, so it isn't really a \"grand adventure\". Any feeling of being lost passes quickly, as do any illusions of plot substance.

But, let's face it, if you are on part 3 of FFXIII, you aren't a typical gamer. The combat is actually very similar to the worst parts of Elder Scrolls Online's combat (weapon switching, animation canceling, very limited spell/attack pool). Then, tack on blocking (it's a \"spell\", ugh), timing, and a bunch of resistances to discover and take advantage of and you have FFXIII-3. Oh, and there is essentially no magic based healing - it's very strange for a FF game.\n\nWay too many particle effects, makes perfect blocking/attacking difficult (magic attacks have a cheese, physical do not). Forced camera angles during attacks exacerbate the issue. Very limited graphics options (most are on/off, no level of control).\n\nThe window is a wrapper for the game and the game doesn't have a built-in exit/quit. You must use the mouse to hover to the top of the window, this shows the menu, then you can go to File > Quit. It's a pretty pathetic port - absolute minimum effort on their part. If you are going to release a PC game, maybe play at least one or two - ya know, do some market research so your product isn't obviously below par.\n\nFrom what I've read and observed, the game is pretty much meant to be played on easy first. The difficulty setting isn't so much about your skill as a player (you must have decent skill to even play), but it is more about your character's level. Although, this game doesn't have character \"levels\", so \"stats and equipment\" is probably more accurate. You may not even beat it on your first play through, if you go in blind. That's fine, just start again and keep going - it's a fun game and you will get another chance at understanding the story. You will get stronger and eventually beat it. Then, you can go up to Normal, NG+, etc and try for 100%.\n\nThe time of day stuff can be annoying at times, but isn't really a problem, even for a slow player such as myself. It fits into the story very well, does not feel tacked on, and doing side quests does not feel like I am going against the spirit of the main quest (looking at you, Cyberpunk 2077) - in fact, it actually enhances it, imagine that! It's also used to time-gate free drops at the start of each day, higher quality shop items, quests (of which there are 3 types: main, side, and canvas of prayers [which are basically fetch quests]), and such.\n\nWhen you kill enough of certain enemy types, a \"Last One\"/Omega version of it will spawn in their place. Once killed, that enemy will never spawn again, anywhere - it has been extincted. I find this intriguing and it works fairly well. Most, but not all, of the enemies can be extincted. If you sell some monster parts, then 3 days later the canvas has a quest...you may not be able to complete it. So, be careful when selling items if you have extincted the enemy that drops it. The number of enemies you have to kill before their Omega spawns varies, but for some of them it felt WAY too low, in the range of 25 or 30.", "timestamp_created": 1611903283, "timestamp_updated": 1611903283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85373644": {"recommendationid": "85373644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017595364", "num_games_owned": 765, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3655, "last_played": 1611652945}, "language": "english", "review": "Weird departure from the other two games in the series.

It seems like, oh crap I might fail this on my first playthrough but it's honestly not that bad. I can equate it to the timers in Persona. As long as you don't dick around, the game gives you plenty of time to finish, and if somehow you do fail, you end up starting again with all your levels and equipment. Thankfully I didn't need to. \n\nHonestly, I think the ending to FF13-1 is good enough on it's own and doesn't need to be messed with, but they messed with it, then ended 13-2 on the cliffhanger, and 13-3 feels like it came out of left field because they had to do something.

Lightning Returns: FFXIII is brimming with an almost-idyllic, yet apocalyptic atmosphere, that I have never seen replicated in any other game, even FFXIII-2, which obviously shares some themes with this one. I have never seen a game embrace this feeling of a looming threat of an apocalypse, mixed in with an eerie, beautiful acceptance of it, permeating throughout it's many hours of gameplay. It's almost like it's biblical, the player taking the role of mankind's savior, tasked with saving as many souls as she can before an inevitable rapture-like end of the world. \n\nThe story of this game is fairly minimalistic, though grand in scope. It's the perfect closure to a pretty epic series, which, although had its' share of ups and downs when it comes to plot (among other things), remains as a very ambitious and emotional story. Better than XIII-2, but due to it's openness, way less focused than XIII. That being said, it's great to see how the old characters have changed in time, though I found the new ones a little lacking.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's definitely the best of the three - you have lots of freedom to experiment and settle on your preferred brand of combat. Though at certain points the game tends to be extremely hard (pro-tip: avoid fighting the boss of the main-quest of The Wildlands early unless you are REALLY looking for a challenge), and sometimes it funnels you to building your schematas in a way the game wants you to build, overall it's satisfying.\n\nThe music is absolutely perfect. Of course, being part of a trilogy, it will re-use some music from the previous games, but knowing the fact that the entire trilogy has an absolutely stellar soundtrack, this one does not disappoint in any capacity. The new songs (like the previously mentioned The Ark theme) are just as amazing. \n\nThe thing I've seen people criticize the most is the time-management part of it, but I've never had much trouble with it, especially once you get Chronostasis and enough monster encounters to refill your EP bar all the time. In fact, going through the Yusnaan quest, I barely finished it with only several minutes of the day remaining, which was heart-pounding. However, in time, it's no longer a problem, and I completed pretty much everything one can complete upon first playthrough and had lots of time remaining to spare on grinding gil, so take that how you will.\n\nAnyway, it's great, definitely worth a try, and don't let the crappy reputation of XIII stop you from trying LR. This game alone has made me appreciate the entire trilogy with new eyes, and I will be replaying it again. Solid stuff.\n\nTL;DR - Lightning is Jesus with a giant sword, can't go wrong with that", "timestamp_created": 1608210784, "timestamp_updated": 1608210784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82517345": {"recommendationid": "82517345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217842921", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 5246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5246, "last_played": 1608140508}, "language": "english", "review": "In my opinion the best one in the trilogy, but I am biased for Lightning. I am going to assume you've played the other 2 games, because if not, you'll get lost in the references and characters of past events.\n\nHere, you play as Lightning and Lightning exclusively, if that's good or bad, that's up to you.\n\nShe is on a quest to save as many souls as possible before the world ends. This is done by completing fetch quests for them. Also Light gets stronger the more quests she completes, literally, her stats go up. Unfortunate thing is that these quests are not optional, because 1) you have to complete a certain amount to see the ending, and 2) some of them block you from going to important main story places.\n\nThere are actually several main stories, each returning character from previous two games gets their own, and again, you have to complete all of these to get the ending, where they all converge, and through power of friendship help you reach the final boss and end the trilogy. Overall, the story is not bad, but some side quests do have more interesting premise than the main ones...\n\nCombat is a curious mix based on the previous two games' ATB system. Since Lightning is alone for most of the game, she has to fill all party roles by herself. For that reason she has three simultaneously runnnig ATB bars, each with their own moveset, that you are in a complete control of. And since there is no party, all buttons on the controller are assigned to one of Light's attacks, not to a menu. This makes for much more natural and interactive flow of battle. 11/10\n\nThe world you get to explore is the best of the three, in my opinion. It pictures the dying fantasy world swallowed by great void perfectly, and while you are limited to few locations, because of the great void, those locations are quite open to exploration. (Exploration is mandatory because of the quests, but who caaaaares.) Also it's set in completely new places.\n\nOne massive downside however. The time limit. According to the LORE, you have 1-2 weeks before the world dies. So there is a ticking clock, on your screen, all the time, to tell you what time of the day it is. And it even has affects what quests and locations are available.\nIf you don't finish the game in the given time, you have to restart. You keep your stats, but otherwise no progress. So all those quests you'll have to do again.\n\nThe game is very clearly meant to be replayed this way few times, before getting the ending, but there's nothing new in the new playthrough, it's just a waste of time. This is a misstep, no matter how you look at it. The only redeeming factor is that Easy Mode makes managing the clock significantly easier, so pick that if you need to relieve your anxiety.\n\nIf you've played FFXIII-2, you kinda have to play this too or live knowing you never reached the true happy ending. If you've only played the first game, and are somehow reading this, you have a choice. FFXIII is a more or less self-contained thing. It's only in the second game that things go way off track.

Time-gated EVERYTHING? Give me a fucking break. This trash was like ff13 the reunion that no one wanted where everyone only came back because they're hooked on something and need a stimulus bigger than the US economy. Every chapter was just \"meet old ff13 cast member > overcome adversity/talk about past > team up and move on\" times 5. Honestly shameful. I'm mad sitting here writing this realizing how much more time i'm wasting when it comes to this game.\n\nEverything was hammed up to the point that it was physically painful to experience.

It took me roughly 40 hours to complete my first playthrough on NORMAL difficulty with a help from a guide.\n\nThe main premise of the game is to reach the 13th day when the final boss appears. Each day has a day and night cycle along with a ticking clock. Each day you must do as many main quests and side quests in order to raise your stats and to extent time in order to reach the 13th day. Do almost all of them and you will unlock a bonus 14th day with a special dungeon with the hardest monsters in the game up to a hard boss. \n\nThe base mechanic of the game is time management. You have a special ability that can freeze time and you can replenish it by hunting monsters. Monsters in this game can go extinct with harder monsters giving more  EP which is the resource you need to freeze time or use other special abilities.\n\nIn terms of graphics, this game is old and the environments in my opinion have not aged well. Lightning's model and her ridiculous amounts of outfits are well made and still look nice. As a port this is bare bones. Its not up to any standards but hey it runs.\n\nThe story of the game is fine, to be honest i played the game because i like Lightning and her journey. She does feel like a savior and the sadness that the role has.  \n\nIn terms of gameplay, the combat is fast, strategic and can punish you. If you go blind and fight a monster you are not prepared you will die again and again.\n\nYou can replay the game as many times as you want and gain new outfits, weapons and grind your stats until cap in HARD difficulty. To note you can also raise your stats in EASY difficulty if you feel like it. This is a game that rewards those that know it, rather than going in completely blind. \n\nSince this review is in 2020 i hope Square Enix makes a REMASTER or a REMAKE at some point. This trilogy should get the graphics it deserves and the PORT IT DESERVES (sorry for caps, all the budget went to Lightning's wardrobe).

If you hate Final Fantasy XIII don't play this game, if you love Final Fantasy XIII don't play this game. It's amazing how one simple change manage to completely destroy this game. Some lunatic at square enix decided is was a good idea to make Fetch Quests the only way to increase your stats. When I first started playing this game, I didn't like this change, but I thought it was fine, because they are side quests and side quests are optional right? right? WRONG. I finished all 5 Main Quests by day 7 (5th Quest was a boring fetch quest, 4th quest had boring fetch quest elements, 3rd quest was really boring because it consisted of alot of useless waiting, 1st quest sucks because it consisted alot of boring running around the city, 2nd quest sucked the least but was still cringe). So you think if I finished all 5 main quests we would be getting to end game, no you are wrong. This game instead decided that I need to unlock the 13th day, which means getting 100 points. The only way to get points is doing side quests (1 star side quest = 2 points, 2 star side quest = 4 points, 3 star side quest = 8 points). The funny thing is though is that literally all the side quests are boring fetch quests, and if they aren't fetch quests they are still boring, 3 star quests being the longest and most boring. This game is forcing me to do several fetch quests and boring side quests just to finish it, good combat and great customization will not make up for this. This game is painful to play, I played the previous two FFXIII games, and I didn't think they were good but they were like 5/10, this one is really bad, this probably one of the worst triple A games I've ever played, it's a 1/10.

juegue en 360 y jugarlo ahora en pc es mucho mejor ya que no tiene los bajones que si tenia en xbox 360, ademas de traer todos los dlc ya incluidos lo hace mejor aun, sin duda lo recomiendo, la jugabilidad es interesante y modelo del jugar contra tiempo puede ser imponente y abrumador la primara vez que lo pasas, pero cuando le encuentras el manejo pasa a segundo plano, yo adoro este juego y lo recomiendo ampliamnte para aquellos interesados en final fantasy que no le hayan dado la oportunidad, repito es por mucho el mejor port para pc asi que la experiencia de juego debe ser buena por ese lado, me parece que esta topado a 30 fps pero despues de haber jugado esto en 360 donde se sentia una cantidad muy constante de tirones puedo decir que la experiencia mejora mucho",

The true reason for fully recommending this one is the combat system, which is very different than the other two entries in the trilogy. In this game you play a one woman party the entire game with a few guests throughout. This time around, you have the four buttons of the gamepad that you attach an ability to use in real time combat. You have three different attires that you customize, and switch between them throughout the battle. It still follows the theme of the other games in terms of the class system that existed in the other two, but they are in the form of abilities. As a person who enjoys deep customization, this was a very welcomed change to find in this game. While this game varied from most of the final fantasy series, it was likely one of my favorites of all time in terms of the combat system in the game.\n\nThe complaint would be the rushing feel to the game, you are on the clock the entire game and have to be at certain areas at certain times to further quests and side quests, and that can become tedious. I would urge you not to be so concerned, as it offers new game cycles to allow you to explore any quests and areas that you missed in a previous run.\n\nAll in all the story, quests and overall rush feel to the game could be frustrating trying to manage your time, but the combat was really fun and made it a very exciting game for me.

BUT it errs on the side of positive. \nI originally thought with the fixed time mechanic that I was going to hate it, but the game really has enough time to get everything done.  \nAnd surprisingly it is the least linear game in the FFXIII trilogy...  despite the 2nd one literally involving time-travel.   You can pretty much do whatever you like in whatever order you like in this game, and it can vary a little if you do things early or late in the allotted timespan (though mostly just in terms of gameplay mechanics). \n\nStill, I think I preferred the first FFXIII over this, let alone the 2nd.  The first was a standard Final Fantasy game through and through, the second was a depleted cast and a messed up plot due to bungled time-travel shenanigans.  \nLightning is the only playable character this time.  The game world feels tiny for all its non-linear nature.  And the entire game really is just cleaning up loose ends (without fixing any of the glaring plot-holes from XIII-2).\n\nStill... it is fun enough playing dress-up with Lightning.  That is probably the biggest draw of this game, honestly.   It is kinda like if FFXIII and FFX-2 had a weirdly quiet baby together... and that isn't as bad as it sounds. \nI'm genuinely surprised I've sunk more time into this installment than either of the other two and I'm not even done yet...  but I'm a collector, and I have to collect.  When the game isn't linear, it isn't always easy to find everything in a short space of time. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1603212117, "timestamp_updated": 1603212117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77747427": {"recommendationid": "77747427", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968146544", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1669674358}, "language": "english", "review": "Played 3 hours but i don't think i'll play more.

With composers Naoshi Mizuta, Mitsuto Suzuki, Masashi Hamauzu. Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is the last game to finish off the Lightning saga. In the final installment, you play as Lightning Farron, who has awakened from her slumber by the mighty god Bhunivelze. Due to the events of Final Fantasy XIII-2. The world has been swept by chaos, and only a small set of islands remain of the last surviving humans. With chaos gone. Humans can now live forever without fear of dying from old age. Bhunivelze has tasked Lightning must save, as many souls as she can to whisk them away to a new world Bhunivelze has created for them. In the context of \u2018saving\u2019 as freeing them from whatever burdens they have. Lightning agrees as long as Bhunivelze holds his end of the bargain of reviving Serah\u2019s soul. Her beloved sister. But, hold on. There\u2019s a catch. The world has a time limit. And Lightning must save as many souls as she can within 13 days. What awaits Lightning on her journey to save as many souls as she can?\n\n[h1] Far Beyond a Lightning Dress Simulator [/h1]\nUnique Gameplay\n\nYou mainly play as Lightning. And while some may consider this to be a weak point. I think it\u2019s also one of the game\u2019s strengths where you have full control in her actions when in battle. The main battle system is the style-change active time battle system. Where you can change schemata on the fly during combat. Schemata are preset load-outs Lightning can change into up to 3 mid-way instantly during combat. \n\nOne moment you may be rocking physical schemata filled out to the deck with heavy physical attacks. Then the next moment, you switch to a different schemata. This time a magic one. Weapons, garbs(the main outfit Lightning wears), accessories, shields, and four different abilities you can customize. The amount of flexibility is quite honestly very refreshing to switch different schemata on the fly. Considering each schemata has its separate ATB bar. A resource from which you can activate any of the four-button prompts for your abilities. \n\nThe time limit the game operates can be quite stressful early on. And was one of the main reasons why I never finished the game after Final Fantasy XIII-2. However, after a couple of hours with the time limit constraints. It wasn't stressful at all. The game operates under 24 hours. You must complete the game by the thirteenth day. However, a nifty feature the game has is \u201cChronostasis\u201d allowing players to stop time temporarily at the cost of another resource called EP. Or energy points. You can increase your maximum EP capacity by completing main quests. By the end, I had eight total EP I could use. And \u201cChronostasis\u201d only needed 1 EP to halt the time. You can recover some EP by fighting enemies. Of course, fighting tough enemies rewards more than 1 EP sometimes. The game is pretty balanced in giving the player enough free time to handle the main quests and side quests. By the time, I finished 90% of the main quest and a great majority of the sidequests. And only six days had passed. So I still had seven days remaining. \n\n[h1] On the Edge of Crystal Freedom  [/h1]\nThe Graphics\n\nGraphically, I found the graphics to hold up quite well considering it's one of the last generation games before the move to Xbox One and Playstation 4. The game ran very well on PC. And I found it to be very well optimized. The areas you visit and traverse in Lightning Returns are gorgeous. The different islands offering new environments and freedom to explore. You can enjoy the hustle and bustle of city life in the 1st area. Enjoy a more festival city on the 2nd. And embrace the wild open plains of the third with many flora and forests to tread. Or brave through the harsh desert dunes and rocky terrain on the fourth island. Visiting different towns and cities is densely full of people and NPCs to talk to. While not as detailed as Lightning\u2019s model, they do a decent job in filling the world. It\u2019s also worthy of note that certain people only show up at different times of the day. So you don\u2019t see the same amount of individuals you come across 24/7. I love the different garbs you can collect and buy for Lightning as well as the large assortment of adornments you can try out. \n\n[h1]Different Shades of Lightning [/h1]\nThe Sound Design\n\nThe soundtrack for Lightning Returns is honestly incredible and diverse. You can hear random unique music from NPCs on the streets. A rich collection of instruments tackling different genres in the musical spectrum. Consists of a morning, afternoon, evening, and nighttime tracks for every island. They\u2019re strangely soothing occupying different tones and backgrounds throughout each main island theme depending on the time of day. The soundtrack also has different variations of battle themes according to the islands you enter. The soundtrack has great variance in battle themes. Based on the location of Lightning as well as the time of day. \n\n[h1]No More Burdens[/h1]\nFinal thoughts/Ruminations\n\nOverall, I found Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII to be a fitting end for the Lightning Saga. It\u2019s been a long road. Yet, in the end, I am very well content with finishing it. Enough, to even complete 100% achievements on my first playthrough as well. \n\nThe world-building and how it connects to Lightning. I loved the way sidequests are handled here besides doing the obvious fetch quests and killing \u2018x\u2019 monsters. The struggles the NPC's face here is pretty reasonably sound, even when the world is about to end. There are different walks of life in the people Lightning meets and everyone has their share of burdens, she needs to tackle to save their souls. In some cases, these sidequests offer insight into Lightning\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and character development while offering some foresight into her character. Even when you reload the game sometimes the in-game summary will change after you complete the main quest segment or a notable side quest that monologues Lightning\u2019s thoughts. Granting the player insight into Lightning\u2019s character. \n\nNPC's also talk about their daily lives when undergoing a sidequest giving context and how they need help from Lightning. In some cases, the quests may even unlock subsequent quests that are connected. And in other cases, two different side quests that have nothing to do with one another can converge creating a new branch of side quests to complete. Making it a multiple sidequest chain to undergo. I found each of these sidequests to be noteworthy to complete among other miscellaneous quests. Which gave me a good chuckle. While others dealt with harsher topics which I won\u2019t spoil in this review. But, it's interesting with the world about to end in 13 days. The people Lightning meets have different priorities and burdens they need to be lifted. \n\n[i]\nThe last game in the Lightning trilogy reaches for the crystal zenith and achieves it. The combat system is one of the series best by far. Addicting, fast, and very enjoyable. The soundtrack is fantastic. It reaches the scope of different classic instruments then hits you in ways you didn\u2019t expect with genres flying by that fit the game setting and atmosphere. The graphics I found to be well-done. Concerning the world design, animations, monster designs and Lightning's garbs. Ali Hillis's voice actor of Lightning deserves similar praise among other returning voice actors. The story by the end made me feel extremely satisfied to conclude the trilogy. Overall, I would wholeheartedly recommend this game only to fans of the genre or to others who have played the previous installments in the trilogy. A worthy finale. \n[/i]\n\nTotal Times Beaten: 1 \nScore: 9/10 \nDate Finished: 10-16-20 \nDate Reviewed: 10-16-20\nDate Edited: Many par", "timestamp_created": 1602916573, "timestamp_updated": 1603497736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77580252": {"recommendationid": "77580252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079644549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3132, "last_played": 1602726623}, "language": "english", "review": "My first review, and probably a pointless one since the game is so old, but I still feel obligated to write it. I loved FFXIII, even though I know a lot of people didn't. I thought the combat was absolutely perfect, and learning and mastering the system felt more rewarding than any other game I'd ever played, except maybe Rocket League. The story and characters were also great. I also really liked FFXIII-2, despite the combat changes, and found myself really caring about Serah by the end of it. Which is why (SPOILER) when she died at the end of the game, I had to play Lightning Returns to find out what happened. I got into it, and found out Lightning made a deal with God to bring Serah back. Great, that's exactly the type of thing I was hoping for. And then I find out the game has a time limit. And it killed it for me. I hate time limits. Especially because this game promotes exploration more than either of the other games in the series. I decided to give it a try, for Serah, but I just couldn't do it. I was way too stressed out all the time because of the limit, second guessing every single thing I did, wanting to reload previous saves if I took too long finding something. So I gave up on the game. I set it down for five years, and it was constantly hanging over me. I wanted to go back and finish it, but I just couldn't do it because of the time limit. Recently I decided to try it again and finally get it over with to find out what happened, and I'm glad I did. The time limit isn't a big problem. If you balance the side quests out with the main quests and manage your time well, you should easily have enough time. I had all of the main quests done by day 7, and did all the side quests I wanted to do by day 10, and just stayed at an inn for the last couple days because I had nothing else I wanted to do. The story was pretty good. There isn't a lot of plot, but what's there is good. Most of it is told through the stories of minor characters during their side quests. Some of them are really interesting and heart warming, and some are pretty pointless. In almost all of them though, there's way too much talking. It gets pretty irritating after about 30 or so. Hope also talks way too much the entire game, and none of what he says is useful. It's always just telling you things you already know over and over and over. If he actually said things that helped me out I wouldn't mind, but he doesn't. And nearly every conversation he has with Lightning is cut off by the start of a battle anyways. The combat system is okay. It's my least favorite of the XIII series, and definitely a big step down from XIII's. The schemata thing is pretty cool though, but confusing to new players. I never really knew what I should use. I didn't like the way you level up your attacks either. You get new attacks as loot, and then you synthesize them with identical attacks to power them up, then you use a stone to level them up. It was also confusing, and I didn't do anything with it until the final boss. It probably made the game harder for me in the long run, but sitting there trying to equip new attacks, looking through a list of like 75 things, with half of them being identical was just a headache. The final boss was also super hard, but I wasn't surprised based on how hard Orphan was in XIII. If you did enough side quests to power up, do the trials before facing it, and customize your schemata based on the fight, you should be able to get through it. As far as the port goes, it was just about perfect. It runs very smoothly, and I encountered no performance issues. Play on a controller though, it clearly was not made for KBM.

Badly-written? Nah man, it's easy to follow. It might be too complex or convoluted for those haters who is not that good in comprehending what's happening in the game but I'm telling you the plot is really great. Maybe Toriyama should've just simplified the storytelling for them. These pricks probably wanted the story to be spoon fed. Well, for those who wants to play this game that is not that good with deep stories and lores, I recommend reading Episode Zero. There's a translated pdf somewhere in the internet, read that to learn the backstories of the characters and the story will be a walk in the park to follow (though there's a datalog in the game but once you started the game you wouldn't want to be always interrupted by it as you progress so reading the pdf before playing will be a better idea).\n\nCharacters are lame? WTF? They are the most realistic in terms of personalities in my opinion! I'd say they were brave. If some god randomly chose me to f*ck me up and toy with me for no good reason I'd probably lose my mind and give up to my fate and I'll probably just sit and wait for myself to become a C'eith. But they didn't and they defied any twisted gods that come their way (especially that frickin' Bhunivelze) which is impressive.\n\nFor me, I don't mind changes. This might be a lot different from the older ones but I absolutely loved it. This is worthy of the Final Fantasy title, worth every cent and it definitely ascended up there into my top favorite FF's. I'm not ashamed to admit it and no one can change my feelings towards this series. I say hugely recommended.\n\nI was very sad that the story ended with Lightning Returns. I want to see more of waifu Lightning! (Note: I won't mind if you show up on our date just for the steak. I'll gladly buy you how many steaks you want lol) But at least they finally got the good ending they all deserved.\n\nThanks to Square Enix, I had a blast playing the trilogy. I am always left speechless with mixed feelings, most of it are bliss, bittersweet and emptiness (because I can't hardly pull myself back to reality in an instant as I stare into the ending credits lmao), but great memories nonetheless whenever I finished a Final Fantasy game. And the XIII series surely gave it to me, as expected from an FF title. Soundtrack always delivers its job - breathtakingly beautiful as expected!\n\nTo the haters, it's 2020 already.

I love this game so much, and dear almighty Bhunivelze, help me give this game some sort of salvation with this review.\n\n\nThe final frontier of this derisive trilogy of games I have an odd affection for. Unlike the first game's insouciance to being explicit with its world-building or the second game's confusing timeline that somewhat falls apart under scrupulous scrutiny, this game's narrative is streamlined and focuses on providing a--in my possibly controversial opinion--rapt conclusion to the trilogy with themes that I've come to appreciate upon revisit.\n\nThe world these characters live in has always been an endless cycle of schism, classism, false gods, family, religious cults, sacrifice, changing fates (and way more than I can mention), and each game explored these core ideas in very fascinating ways.\n\n\nIt feels oppressive when the player and characters realize how unpropitious their efforts are. As depressing as that is, part of what I like about the trilogy--especially this game in particular--is no matter how hopeless everything can be, they empower themselves from familial love to heal from their past wounds and sinful scars to quell the Fal'cie who wants to perpetuate a world with worthless slaves by gifting them supernatural powers in exchange of eternal suffering. In the end, they create a new world, free from the binds of these false gods, and this game does an admirable job at coming to that conclusion.\n\n \n\nThe focus of the game isn't entirely on Lightning's desire to reunite with her beloved, deceased sister, Serah; it's the side quests and how it relates to Lightning's wish to reconcile with her sister. \n\nAnd this is where my love for this game starts to be apparent.\n\n\n\nI love how this game allows me to explore and understand the people of this world who have to survive with the nightmare of being immortal, becoming apathetic, and scrounging for any sense of worth in what is perceived as a meaningless world. Some people, with asinine intentions, risk their lives for a sense of livelihood. They kill, act selfish, erase their memories to ease pain, and commit truly despicable things. Seeing all this through the lens of Lightning, who has lived a very depressing life, as she reflects on all the experiences she had before in tandem with every NPC's own struggles, followed by their saved soul to extend humanity's hope is such a visceral feeling.\n\nThe way she monologues to herself about how others cope with grief, loss, despondency, and hope for a better world, and sharing her own life experiences to fill people with hope is the main reason why this game resonates with me so much.\n\nIt threads Lightning's own struggles with her own poignant life as a mechanical and narrative progression in such an enrapturing way that I can't describe perfectly. I just have so much fun vibing with this game--none like any other. And it made me really like Lightning as a character, whom I feel is a misunderstood, excellent character.\n\n\nMost side quests fall under fetch quests, and people can be impertinent about it, but that's not problematic to me. It provides more immersion to this world. People comment on your outfits/garbs, Lightning is hilariously aware of how ridiculous you dress her, and not all people are going to be kindhearted. This world feels very believable to me, and since half of the side quests are optional (unless you don't want to fight Ereshkigal by extending to the 13th day), it enriches the experience so much upon new playthroughs. The game executes these sombre, doleful underlying themes well enough, and it supplements the main characters of the trilogy.\n\n\nNow Let's address the elephant in the room--the most polarizing, aggravating (or so they say) aspect of the game: Time management. \n\nIn this game, you're against the clock, racing to bring salvation to remaining remnants of humanity and deliver them into the new world through the might of their god. At first, the clock felt pressurizing to complete quests and defeat enemies to increase your vitality, strength, stamina, magic, etc., and often, I found myself running amok clumsily through all of this instead of exploring the world. It... wasn't a good first impression.\n\nBut take my word for it; there's no need to panic. I learnt to cave out from my antisocial self and spoke to citizens to understand how the locations I'm in worked, discovering knowledge on how to find requested items. You have more than enough time to complete the game, and side quests are lenient if you make a mistake or miss an opportunity to complete it. On top of that, you can use chronostasis to save yourself time as much as you need to. I don't find the timer to be a detriment. It's all about being perspicacious and efficient. Not everyone can be saved, so you have to be astute with your decisions on the first playthrough. \n\nI love the sense of urgency the game evokes, but simultaneously, the game feels idyllic. The game never suffers from ludonarrative dissonance since your purpose as saviour is to complete those side quests and save souls. It makes new playthroughs replayable and interesting because you're constantly planning different strategies and schedules to complete this game's non-linear progression. \n\n\nThe combat in this game is unbelievably satisfying--better than the first two games, even. Exploring a wardrobe of garbs and customizing an ideal set of schematas to stagger, obliterate enemies, and hunting ultimate versions of monsters called \"Last Ones\" for extremely helpful and powerful items is always an absolute joy. It's so enthralling how seamless it weaves into story progression and side quests because the more you fight, the more Eradia Points (EP) you earn, which helps you extend time as long as possible to complete as many side quests as possible. \n\nOn higher difficulties, it's even more satisfying to preserve your usage of EP because you earn less and have to spend more for powerful attacks, such as, Army For One. There's always a risk and reward system, and it makes battles very tense, as you need to decide carefully on how you use your EP; otherwise, you'll be punished by losing one hour of your time on those higher difficulties. My only problem is how underutilized some of these garbs are. Some garbs that are supposed to be powerful don't feel nearly effective as other standard or weaker garbs (same applies for certain magical attacks you acquire late in the game), and it's disappointing that you can't keep the Ultima weapon and shield in NG+, making the altars feel like a pointless endeavour.\n\nAnd as always, if there's one thing I cannot praise enough about this trilogy is the music. God damn does this game have a killer soundtrack. Crimson Blitz x Blinded by Light is such a banger.\n\nDespite my praise, I will not forgive this game for not allowing me to listen to Bluesy Chocobo (the first track you hear when you ride the Angel of Valhalla during your steed's first stage of recovery) after nursing him. Once full recovery is complete, you're greeted with a lame af track that has no eargasmic jazzy vibe to it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI take back what I said. \n0/10\nWorst game ever", "timestamp_created": 1599509079, "timestamp_updated": 1633794750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762336432933807373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75568969": {"recommendationid": "75568969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067557835", "num_games_owned": 697, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2180, "last_played": 1538503867}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game but I wasnt able to finish it bc I suck :(", "timestamp_created": 1599434769, "timestamp_updated": 1599434769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482758641242980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75565852": {"recommendationid": "75565852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159842856", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3682, "last_played": 1599417843}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy entretenido, con una gran diversidad de habilidades y un combate mucho m\u00e1s activo que en sus anteriores entregas, el limite de d\u00edas que te otorga el juego para completarlo puede dar estr\u00e9s al principio, pero con el tiempo acabas dominando todos los aspectos y trucos.", "timestamp_created": 1599428932, "timestamp_updated": 1599428932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75369064": {"recommendationid": "75369064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869000180", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 678, "last_played": 1663704688}, "language": "english", "review": "Final Fantasy game series is one of the best anime, hack and slash games and fantasy style.

The gameplay is the best fusion between action and the ATB system. The OST is the best of the franchise and if you don't believe just listen to \"Sunset Path\". This is a game with many things to do and you have a plenty of ways to customize you character and playstyle.\n\nDetailed: LRFFXIII is my favorite game of trilogy and the franchise, and i'm gonna tell you why. The 3rd episode of the Lightning saga comes to give her (as Toriyama said) a satisfatory ending however the story is not the best thing in this game, being honest is not bad but is not good but you'll enjoying seeing Lightning acting in so many funny situations and some serious things.\nGraphics: The graphics are incredible even for today standards, is not that pretty like the original XIII but tdamn they are good (better than many games nowadays). The level of details is something that made open a smile everytime, like her hair falling into her face.\nGameplay: The Gameplay is where this game Shines, you can play the way you like here. You like using magic? You can do it. Like being a tank of physical attacks? you can do it. In LRFFXIII you have many, many options to customize your  playstyle, here we have may outfits to choose from and each one of them has unique abilities to choose from, and that's not all, you can choose from a variety of swords and shields and some of them are very nostalgic and will make you feel happy using them.\nOST: As i said  this is the best OST of the franchise, all the songs here were made to please the player becaus they are so damn good, i know it's a matter of opinion but as i said just listen to \"sunset path\" and you'll see. The OST combines the muic of the its predecessors (XIII and XIII-2) in new arrangements alongside the new songs. Each one of them is played in the exact moment, so when you need a calm song to behold the landscape, there'll be one, when you need some intense song for fighting, there are many (yes, this game has more than one battle music), it's just perfect.\nYou MUST play this. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1596988081, "timestamp_updated": 1596988081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539958000183105469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73931065": {"recommendationid": "73931065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119400535", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 3013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3013, "last_played": 1600170755}, "language": "english", "review": "FFXIII-3: LR is the best port out of the trilogy and most likely the best game out of the three.\n\n+ The race against the time, while worrying at first can become a decent pacekeeper after getting the hang of it.\n+ The ending is satisfying and conclusive.\n+ The Schemata system is a great way to consolidate the other characters into the singular playable character.", "timestamp_created": 1596826424, "timestamp_updated": 1596826424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73724507": {"recommendationid": "73724507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012326015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3025, "last_played": 1679883825}, "language": "english", "review": "in spite of the various issues surrounding the other games in the 13 series, this game is a home run. fantastic, unique gameplay, great music, and a quite introspective and grief-focused story that is very rare in this style of JRPG. one of my all time favorite FF games.", "timestamp_created": 1596500088, "timestamp_updated": 1596500088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73676831": {"recommendationid": "73676831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057932254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1596427225}, "language": "english", "review": "Runs like $$$$$$H!!!T.

I'm trying it for the first time on PC. I recommend playing the game, but if you want to use a controller, it's more of a remembering game. I tried a PS4 and a Switch controller, which both work. But the buttons are not always matching with the buttons seen on screen. So as long as you have a great memory, you can use a controller. The buttons are not programmable, so you just have to play and learn the controls. To see if keyboard was any better, I tried out that option too. For me, I'm having a more difficult time with a keyboard than other players who have reviewed. So far I like the story. Lightning in the savior role is interesting. The combat is fun, even though I haven't gotten down the controls yet. I haven't had any crashes happen on my PC. Playing with headphones picks up a lot of the sound design that you wouldn't hear if you didn't have headphones, but they are not absolutely necessary to use in order to enjoy the game. I'm planning to play the game to completion, and I can learn the controls over time. I just have to remember more quickly, and I'll be fine. The $20 price tag is very reasonable. The game is all about TIME, so my first playthrough will be my worst. This game allows you to help other people get to a better place, so if you like helping people in real life, I think this game will appeal to you in that manner too.\n\nEDIT: I'm afraid that because I get confused about the controls rather easily, I'm having a difficult time playing the game on PC, even with a controller. Maybe if I got another controller, it would work better. But since I can't get one right now, I can't play through the game on PC. I still recommend that people play the game, because other people aren't having as much problem as I am with the controls. The game looks really great on the PC, and I hope that other players can get used to the controls, because the game is fun to play.\n\nEDIT X 2: Okay, I now have realized that Steam has a PS4 controller setup that I didn't see before, which has allowed me to download a Lightning Returns setup for my PS4 controller configuration. So now, I am happy to report that the controls are no longer a problem for me on PC! I am very happy that I found out about the PS4 configuration option in Steam. So thanks to everybody for making this possible for me. An interesting development is that I decided to go back and start on my PS3 playthrough of the game, too. And now that the PC option is available for me, I'm actually playing both versions of the game at the same time.

If you managed to have fun and got invested in the characters: This one is worth your money. Also play this game on easy for the first playthrough.\n\n[h1] Was the trilogy necessary? (rant time) [/h1] \nThe first FFXIII game was universally declared the worst Final Fantasy after it\u2019s release (which is somewhat true. Only FF2 is worse to play through). And then we got a sequel that fixed a lot of mistakes which also had a plot that needed another sequel. And that is Lightning Returns.\nAnd well\u2026 nobody really cared about this game. Nowadays I would compare the trilogy with the Star Wars sequels that did not manage to find an uniformly tone which disappointed the audience. The Final Fantasy XIII trilogy on the other hand suffered from a very bad first game wthat managed to destroy most of the audience interest.\nSo the trilogy was necessary from a narrative standpoint, but failed to live up to the expectations of the audience. If you want closure or just a fun game to play: this one is pretty enjoyable.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nYou have 3 slots for garbs (=clothing) and each slot can contain up to 4 abilities. You can and have to switch within battle to different garbs as every ability you use consumes points and they are regenerating the fastest when you are using another garb. So you will be constantly rotating through garbs trying to deal damage, block attacks and casting magic so that your enemy gets staggered (=vulnerable) to inflict even more damage.\nThis gameplay is very satisfying as you are constantly engaged and there are no down times fighting. It can become repetitive if you are fighting the same species of enemies over and over again, but finding out how to optimize your pattern is pretty enjoyable. The garb themselves also have a lot of impact in terms of customization if you really want to use everything the game has to offer. On the other hand: On any difficulty that is not hard you can use pretty much any garb.\nThe game can get quite challenging at times and managing your time is really important.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nThis game is beyond throwing terms at you that make any sense. In short: World is going to end soon, god will wake up and create a new world for you and he promises Serah (Lightning\u2019s sister) for your cooperation. \nEven shorter: You son of your mother, I am in ~ Lightning\n(Bhunivelze didn\u2019t like this).\nOh and after the events of XIII-2 500 years have passed and nobody ages, but people still die.\nYou have some episodic main quests that are somewhat interesting and reunite you with actually beloved characters of this trilogy that needed to adapt with the world around them and lived for 500 years too. There is some sincere heart to this.\nBut the best part are the side quests:\nWhile often somewhat predictable, they are very wholesome and show how humans can deal with various problems of life. This is when the game really shines and Lightning actually develops something of a personality and relationships to other persons than the main cast. It is always more or less superficial, but Lightning now has bonds to treasure and reasons to be interested in the well being of the world. \nIn short: Call me a rat, but I like some of these cheesy aspects.\n\n[h1] Atmosphere and Worldbuilding [/h1] \nNot aging and dying for 500 years changed society and the population started to ask the big question:\nWhat is the sense of living?\nLightning Returns portrays this beautifully. Starting to believe in a god, hunting monsters and adapting to the wild or just pure hedonism. There are many answers to that question and every person that lived for 500 years has developed an own answer which is really interesting to explore.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nThe game is passable and not ugly, but at times I was disappointed, especially if you compare it to other titles of it\u2019s time like The Last of US. The amount of pre-rendered cutscenes has drastically decreased and there are more in game rendered cutscenes. I actually like the more integrated approach and moving your camera while cutscenes are playing is a nice gimmick.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1] \nAt the worst of times the music is a little above average and just quiet in the background. At the best of times it reminded me of Nier:Automata which is a compliment I can not make often. The soundtrack is excessive and around 6 hours long. Every place of importance has it\u2019s own theme and manages to encapsulate feelings and rarely a track overstays it\u2019s welcome. The music and the sidequests are by far the best content of the game and listening to the soundtrack is recommended even if you decide against playing the game.\nWhen you are finally facing the Final Boss\u2026 I like his theme even more than One Winged Angel which tells you a lot about the quality of the track. \nNot on the level of Dancing Mad but pretty similar.\n\n[h1] The quality of the port [/h1] \nThe port itself is fine, but can occasionally fail you. I had around 2 total failures and some mild annoyances within my playtime of around 60 hours.\nLR also is a port from the PS3 era which means:\nYou will have performance issues despite having a high-end pc. Just bad optimization and trust me:\nSquare will not fix that.\nIt is really playable but it could be better.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1] \nIf you played through the first two games and enjoyed them, you will probably enjoy this a lot more than FFXIII. I had a good time and while the mistakes and misdesigns are existent, the fighting can become tedious and some storylines could appear on cheese.com, but you are going to find something enjoyable. Even if it is only the dress-up game.\nA well made ending for a not so well received trilogy.\n\n[quote=author]\nIf you liked this review, make sure to check out my curator page at \n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/31884377-If-It-Is-Insane/\nThanks for reading\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1594132864, "timestamp_updated": 1594285139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51546931266784668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72226620": {"recommendationid": "72226620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312878530", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 9907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1524, "last_played": 1664189548}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] The last of the FFXIII trilogy but its mostly about...[/h1]\nLightning getting a fanservice game. 10/10 \nLightning with 80+ different outfits that could be customized?

Some garb have locked skills that are low level, you want to use the same skill but with a higher level that you have but this makes you use 2 skill slots which is redundant. [spoiler] An example of this case is Martial Monk Garb [/spoiler]\n- We need more slots for adornment. Some NPC can use 2 adornments (some NPC quest giver can use more than that) so why can't Lightning be like that too?!? I want to use animal ear and tail adornment together\n- [spoiler] The game epilogue is too \"open\" for interpretation. And it seems they deliberately did this. I had to search the internet to know what happened. If you want to know what happened, you can look for it in Final Fantasy XIII: Reminiscence-tracer of memories-novels [/spoiler].\n\nOh and also for those of you who want to buy / play this game but be afraid of the time limit don't be afraid, it's only difficult at the beginning.

This weird, biblical dumpster fire made an even harder left turn than FFXIII-2 did with the whole time paradox. At least they made that concept work(sometimes with brute force), as strange and out of left field as it was from the original game. This game, however, you cannot take seriously after about 5 minutes of dialogue. The intro is reminiscent of some cheesy 80s films, the gameplay is some weird adaptation to mobile-friendly interactive combat, and the writing is bordering on cringe edginess that you would expect from Judge Dredd, not Final Fantasy.\n\nI don't know what to make of this really, I wanted to know where this trilogy ended really badly.

I'd been playing through the 13 series lately, and having just finished FFXIII-2 and seen the \"true ending\" in the included DLC, it seems they also gave a preview of the battle system in this game in that last fight, where you control only Lightning, and she has no Cure spells and a limited number of recovery items.\n\nThis is less faceroll/outlevel content FF, and more reminiscent of monster hunter/dark souls in terms of the kinds of timing skills one has to employ to kill even basic mobs.  Trash monsters from the previous games come back as real killers in this game for those not prepared to at least look at the Libra information on how to stagger each mob.\n\nI like hard games, and this is definitely hard.  I think I'm about halfway through my first playthrough, and I'm enjoying it.

It was quite a change from the previous two 13's combat style. Having only one character under your control is different and makes for more challenging combat, as no one can bail you out. I wish you could walk around a bit quicker to create gaps as necessary, but you can move with abilities like in previous games, so a minor gripe. The garb system is really interesting. I like how many there were, that they had unique innate abilities, some high level obtainable abilities for early on, and that you constantly were changing the way your character looked as the game progressed. There are also many unique weapons to collect and stronger versions with new models available later.\n\nAt first I found the concept of limited time/days stressful. As I learned to manage the game a bit, it was not a huge deal, but it's a mechanic I could do without. I also found the limited time window for certain quest givers frustrating. By 60 hours and 8 in game days, having completed all but a handful of quests, I had my fill of the game and skipped ahead to the end to beat it.\n\nOne thing I found really irritating about this game were the timeframes. Hey, do this on FOUR different days, but you can't do it until 4pm. Or, sorry, this zone doesn't open until midnight, why don't you go do some other stuff and come back here. Or, this quest phase is at 10am, next quest phase, midnight.  It just seemed unnecessary.

I was excited when they first came out; it was something new that wasn't on the GameBoy. The thing about these guys is that they have their own gimmicks. They all follow the active time battle archetype the company has created, however, it seems that with each iteration of the series, there is too much tweaking. Lightning Returns, in addition to being named poorly and unlike the rest of the 13s, changed too much. The voice acting is terrible, the emotion is terrible, the stereotypical storyline is predictable, and its exactly what you would expect. \n\nHowever, the biggest issue I had with it was the battle system. Maybe it's not for me, but I did not like it. Until about halfway into the game, I didn't feel as though I had an trouble. Then I got to the 3rd boss and had to start googing to get answers. The way they built up different paradigms in the past games have no relevance anymore. The stagger meter is gone and seems like an extra bonus. The perfect timing on attacks and guards was something I could never master and with hardly any feedback, will probably be something that most people won't. But the fact that the difficulty curve in this game goes from nothing to, \"you won't win this fight even with max items\" and there is really no reason, is disappointing. \n\nFrom having to grind the superbosses in 13-1 to needing to resort to 100% damage resistance to get past mini bosses in 13-3 here is incredibly unwelcome. But with that, I felt the game was either too hard or too easy. Not to mention the quests really seemed like gimmes; lackluster writing, basic fetch quests, and no substance. \n\nI wanted to play this game because I sunk time in the others and understood the story. I felt that this was easily the worst of the trilogy, which as a whole, set a pretty low bar. If you played the others and found them interesting for one aspect or another, then give this a go. It won't be the best, and you probably won't enjoy it too much, but it is an interesting take on the battle system and does its job.

Haciendo as\u00ed uno de los sistemas mas adictivos que he encontrado en un JRPG ya que combina en Action RPG con estrategia pura y dura. Puedes llevar encima 3 builds distintas seg\u00fan tu manera de jugar o depende de la zona en la que est\u00e9s, es un juego complicado que hay que entender como funciona a la perfecci\u00f3n de lo contrario hay combates que te van a resultad un dolor de cabeza terrible. Si tuviera que decir puntos negativos serian que a lo mejor el tutorial sobre el aturdimiento no esta del todo claro (puesto que hay bichos que hay que aturdir hasta 3 veces seguidas para poder hacer da\u00f1o verdadero y eso no lo explican), tambi\u00e9n que el dise\u00f1o de las mazmorras es id\u00e9ntico, son pasillos con muchas curvas con 4 texturas encima, me explico, las mazmorras de las dunas de la purgaci\u00f3n son pasillos de arena mientras que a lo mejor la mazmorra del castillo de Valhalla son los mismos pasillos solo que en ved de tener texturas de arena tiene caos por encima por el lore del juego, se podr\u00edan haber esmerado mas.

Bought it on a sale and gave up after 4 hours. This may not be a long playtime for a RPG game, but those 4 hours felt like a chore.\n\nFirst, the good things:\n- Music is quite good\n- Artstyle is good\n\nNegative aspects:\n- The combat is always only 1 on 1 and takes place in real time. You need to attack, cast magic and block  attacks almost like in a fighting game but slightly slower, all while watching different gauges deplete while you perform those attacks. In order for these gauges to fill up again, you need to change costumes with different abilities. With each costume the attacks, magic and the button-layout change. Sounds like there is a good strategic portion to the combat, but it's actually more confusing and boring than anything else. It takes quite some time to kill even regular enemies, too.\n\n- You're constantly recieving directions, orders, background info and reminders from a boy called Hope via remote communications. Since this game has a timelimit, he CONSTANTLY reminds you to hurry up and finish the mission. Literally like every minute! Annoying beyond belief.\n\n- The doomsday premise and time-limit aren't a bad idea actually (I also didn't mind such mechanics in Majoras Mask). The story (at least at the beginning of the game) doesn't give me the feeling I'm doing anything important in that world though! Lightnings orders are to save as many souls as possible. How do you save them? By completing sidequests of course! Like: get some medicine for a girls dying father (you need to get those rare ingredients one by one of course), or investigate a murder-scene. I never had the impression of doing anything meaningful while the world in this game was nearing it's end. Under the premise of a dying in-game world, those quests felt shallow more than ever.\n\nAnd that's it. I tried to enjoy this game and even though my journey lasted only about 4 hours at review time,  those 4 hours felt like work. You're constantly in a rush. You need to learn the games mechanics, combat, lore, characters etc. as fast as possible. You need to explore and memorize the environments as fast as possible. You need to finish as many sidequests as fast as possible.

So what's this game about? \nIn short, you follow-up on the open end of 13-2, now controlling Lightning again, trying to save part of humanity from the end of the world.\n\n13-1 was criticized for its linear gameplay. While I can relate to that criticism I still found that it was a good game (4 of 5 stars) and it was true to the aspects that I enjoy about the FF series in general (good combat system mechanics, semi-turn-based combat, controlling a party of 1-3 heroes, lots of side quests, weird story, good music, well-balanced leveling of chars).\nI didn\u2019t recommend 13-2 (see my review for more details), because the game left me empty and because it fell behind 13-1 in many aspects.\n\n\nMoving to 13-3, let's just summarize the facts:\n- the combat system is reworked again when compared to 13-1 and 13-2\n- you play a party of one char for most of the time\n- the general gaming mechanics have been reworked again \u2013 e.g. there is no leveling up your character with experience points\n- there is a time limit imposed on you from the very beginning of the game, if you don\u2019t make it in time, you cannot finish the game properly\n\nWhile each individual point of the ones above could have been excused, the combination of all these aspects made me uninstall this game very soon (now switching to my subjective view on this):\nFrom the very start, 13-3 feels like nothing fits together. 13-2 already didn\u2019t really integrate its storyline very well with 13-1, but this one is worse: It doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. It felt like three different people were in charge of each of the three parts. In the end, somebody was ordered to put all the pieces together, but totally failed his mission.\n\nThe paradigm and leveling system of 13-1 and its experience system was OK for me \u2013it gave me the chance to develop my party in a direction I could influence and switching the paradigms during a fight \u201cfelt just about right\u201d. This was worse in 13-2, beginning from the fact that there were no espers, you control only a party of 2 chars and your \u201cpet\u201d. \n\nIn 13-3 even those aspects are taken away, leaving you to fight alone (most of the time) \u2013 this choice of the devs, I cannot understand.\n\nThen there is the way the game throws its new mechanics at the unsuspecting user: From the very start you get bombarded with the full extension of the combat mechanics - which are quite complex. Granted, this was always the case (at least to some extend) for the FF series, but the game simply doesn\u2019t give the player the time he or she needs in order to adjust to the third combat / gaming system in a row of the third part of the series: Staggering, (lots of) Garbs, Weapons, Items, Synthesis, Libra Lore, EP, special abilities \u2013 it all goes way too fast for my taste.\n\n\nThere is a saying that if something isn\u2019t broken, one should not try to fix it. Why the devs chose to re-invent the combat / leveling system again is beyond my comprehension. \n\nAll that would not have prevented me from playing and finishing the game I daresay. But the time limit does.\n\nWhoever came up with the idea of imposing a time limit on the player in an RPG series where grinding is an essential step and it was never an issue before to rush the player, entirely missed the point.\n\nFF is about story, taking in the details, exploring, looking around, searching for easter eggs / non-obvious content / side-quests and (an acceptable amount of) grinding for better stats / equipment. \n\nEnforcing a time limit takes all that away and puts the player under constant stress before he even has understood (much less mastered) the complex basics of the gameplay. I know, there are ways (and guides on the internet) telling you how to extend the time limit \u2013 theoretically indefinitely if you know how \u2013 but honestly: Does this really result in a benefit for the gameplay? \n\nApart from that, it isn\u2019t even logical when considering the story \u2013 why sleep for an eternity, then wake up and have only 13 days left until the world ends?\n\nI stopped playing after less than 2 hours. Never did that with any FF title before and I really love the series and wanted to have a worthy finale for the trilogy.\nThat speaks for itself.\n\nIt also really makes me wonder if I ever want to buy another FF title, if the devs obviously have such a different understanding of what the series should be like compared to what I expect.", "timestamp_created": 1589402270, "timestamp_updated": 1589627262, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619218170642852783", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69058611": {"recommendationid": "69058611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047154851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1219, "last_played": 1594367348}, "language": "english", "review": "2134", "timestamp_created": 1589366701, "timestamp_updated": 1589366701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524972677230834961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69002448": {"recommendationid": "69002448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198866261199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1588315730}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game!

A lot of the visuals lacking that the console version came out with were improved along with the new rendering and resolution options. With these add ons came all but one DLC.  You get to dress Lightning in a wide arsenal of lethal Garbs.\n\nThis worlds enemies have no idea of what is in-store for them! When it comes down to the numbers this version sells for a great price, it received several improvements and comes with a variety of extra settings. Best of all it comes with so many DLC\u2019s that you do not need to buy separately.\n\nThe list of that content alone is worth more than this games price. \n\nScore 8\nBy: MGRza \nDate: 18 December 2015\n\nAdditional info:\n\nPlatforms: PC\nGenre: Final Fantasy: RPG: JRPG: Open World: Female Protagonist: Anime: Atmospheric \nCensor Rating: Mature\nAge Rating: 16\nDeveloper: Square Enix\nPublisher: Square Enix\nRelease Date: 10 December 2015 \n\nMGR Gaming Steam Curator:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32364038/\nMGR Gaming:\nhttps://www.mgrgaming.co.za", "timestamp_created": 1588415824, "timestamp_updated": 1588416755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562142133712768555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68340759": {"recommendationid": "68340759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857975378", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1586462552}, "language": "english", "review": "As a devoted Final Fantasy fan since Day 1 (my pre-teen years) it's very hard for me to give these games a thumbs down, but this one I reluctantly have to. This is the 3rd and last game in the Final Fantasy 13 series, and basically extreme flip-flops the story from the first two: The world's end is near, Serah apparently is gone (again), Snow is now the big bad guy and anti-hero Lightning is the hero again. Oh, and Hope's back to being a kid.\nThe game makes it obvious from the start that it's the PS3 version copied to PC, but you do get all the DLC (costumes from 7 through X-2)  for free with one exception (you have to make a little progress in the game first). Like the first two games it looks and sounds fantastic, including in HD, with top-notch voice work and soundtrack. Where the game goes wrong for me is gameplay-you only get to play as Lightning (very rarely in FF fo you ever control only one character, which is part of the series' appeal), there is a totally new (and too complex despite its potential) battle system, and the worst part of all-the timer.  Basically game time moves at 8 times real time and you only have so many days-once all the days are used up, you go right to the end of the game. So you'd better enjoy being in a rush all the time. In an RPG I personally do not. Trying to complete all the optional side quests also gets tedious fast and is not fun. And if you just let the timer run out your game will be over in as little as 3-4 hours.\nIf you can get this on a good sale (preferably $10 or less) and want/need every FF title, think about taking a flyer on this, ditto if you want to see the 13 storyline through to the end. It's not a bad game on it's own, but as the final chapter in the 13 story arc, with each game radically different than the prior entry, this one tries too hard to be unique and it doesn't work. At least there don't seem to be any of the game-breaking glitches that plagued 13-2. In the end, I just can't recommend it except to devoted FF faithful.", "timestamp_created": 1588306072, "timestamp_updated": 1588306072, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544451653957366943", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68113933": {"recommendationid": "68113933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066009424", "num_games_owned": 1109, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 3832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3832, "last_played": 1587891510}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd say that Lightning Returns is probably the best of the FFXIII games.  That's not to say it's good, it still has issues, it's just not as bad as the other two.\n\nAs usual with the XIII games on PC, starting the game is a  fight against the idiocy of the port itself. The game defaulted to Japanese for voice.  Switching to English (which is labelled default while clearly not being the default) required a restart.\n\nDo not turn off the Playstation(R)3 system while the save icon is being displayed.\n\nI'm using a controller, so I set the prompts to display controller buttons before I start a game.  Prompts are shown in KB+M anyway.  Press backspace to attack. Press M to guard.  Press full-stop for Thunder. Presumably the entire KB+M button configuration was chosen by throwing a dart at a picture of a keyboard, since there is no logic to it.\n\nChange the settings again.  Attack by pressing the 'blank placeholder icon we forgot to replace' button.  That's RB by the way.\n\nThe game begins.\n\nThe premise is that the world is ending, and it has been for 500 years, ever since the end of XIII-2.  Lightning has been chosen by God to save the souls of the doomed world so that they can be reborn in the new one that God has just put in the oven at gas mark 5 for 13 days.\n\nYou save souls by completing quests for people, only people who you complete quests for have their souls saved, so the new worlds population will be 66.  Good luck with the inbreeding on the new world.\n\nYou have 13 days to do your job, and the clock is always ticking.  At the end of each day, you give the souls to the tree of life, and you extend the end of the world by a bit.  The ticking clock puts pressure on you to do things quickly, and wasn't something I enjoyed about the game.  You can temporarily pause time by using an ability called \"Chronostasis\".  This ability costs 1EP to use. You have a cap of EP that can be extended by completing main quests, and you get EP as a reward for beating monsters.  \n\nSmall monsters will get you ~ 0.05 EP, a medium monster 0.2 to 0.5 EP and a big monster 2 EP.  Monsters can be driven to extinction, each has a cap of encounters, and once you kill them off you'll spawn a stronger \"omega\" version, glowing bright pink. Kill that one and they're gone for good.  This comes into play mid-game, where you're strong enough to kill the large monsters to farm EP and keep time paused with chronostasis, but don't want to kill so many of them that you can't do that anymore. You can't make everything extinct, a few of the mid size enemies will always spawn at certain times or places to keep the world populated with things to hit with your sword.\n\nBy managing use (spamming) chronostasis, the time limit never really encroaches on your game.  I had all of the main quests finished by day 5 or 6.  And by day 9 I had finished everything else I could do with the game, including killing the two superbosses and killing all the omega enemies.\n\nOutside of main quests with returning heroes Noel, Snow, Sazh and Fang, you can do side quests for NPCs, and complete bulletin board fetch quests on the Canvas of Prayers.  Completing quests is the only way Lightning gets stronger.  Each completed quest will give you strength, magic and HP increases, or an extra healing item slot, or an extra EP. There's no XP, there's no crystarium this time, just incremental stat gifts as rewards.\n\nYou're on your own with combat in this game, Lightning gets no companions and has forgotten how to cast cure without using EP. So to mitigate damage you have a guard ability (and mediguard is the only free healing in the game).  Press it at the right time and you'll take less damage and maybe stagger your opponent.  The timing is tight, and the battle camera being total garbage hinders this to no end.  It's quite difficult to block attacks you can't see through effects and hidden behind Lightning's character model. You can press R3 to zoom out, and I'd recommend you change the camera settings to have this as the default view.\n\nYou can have 3 outfits (schemata) in combat, and each scheme can have 4 abilities.  All of them have Lightning wearing her battle panties. This is a drawback for me (the abilities, not the panties).  Having only 12 abilities at one time limits your options. One outfit will be your debuff one, one magic, one physical damage.  Late on I got fed up with blocking and specced my debuff gear with enough damage reduction that I was immune to physical or magic damage depending on which accessories I equipped on it. This kind of cheese is mandatory for some stronger enemies.  At least you aren't just mindlessly pressing auto attack all the time though, and you can do bonus damage by casting at the right moment to dissuade you from just holding a button to attack.\n\nSeveral abilities I never tried because I just didn't have the space on my outfits for them. Most outfits even lock some slots to specific abilities (which you may have stronger versions of but cannot use). You can make abilities stronger, but in your first play through this is limited somewhat by the availability of the upgrade materials.\n\nStaggering is a bit different compared to the other games. The gauge is now a wavy line that goes from blue to red to stagger, and the amplitude of the wave says how close to the next bit you are. It's much less intuitive. I do not like it.  Instead of I am at 60% stagger I am now at mid sized blue line stagger. Here's how to win in the game. Cast de-shell and de-protect.  Spam -ra spells.  That's it. -aga spells cost too much ATB to use enough, tier 1 spells are too weak. Once staggered, use strongest physical attacks.\n\nSo there it is, it's the best of a trilogy of totally mediocre/bad games.  It's inhabits the not available \"meh\" recommendation zone. In that case I've went for no rather than yes simply because I was pleased to have finally finished it so I could move on, and I never intend to play it again on new game +.", "timestamp_created": 1587987560, "timestamp_updated": 1587987588, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 103, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618416547775268555", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68070783": {"recommendationid": "68070783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117965306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2971, "last_played": 1587920693}, "language": "english", "review": "I love everything just when fighting some boss or monster u the stagger doesnt make sense. and some monster if u dont stagger might take u about 2 hours to beat them. other than that epic.", "timestamp_created": 1587921510, "timestamp_updated": 1587921510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68026423": {"recommendationid": "68026423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218458060", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 3511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3511, "last_played": 1571017263}, "language": "english", "review": "Terrible, absolutely terrible.\n\nThe game was depressing as hell, they made Lightning an emotionless mary sue and the story was just boring.

I love it and hate it at the same time. I'm not gonna go into too much details but I will try to outline its main features.\nFirst of all, its good aspects: the story is beautifully well-written, with dialogues as if straight out of novel. They give in depth background info for almost every character you come across, even the most insignificant side quest is gonna have a rich backstory dealing with issues concerning interpersonal relations in a world on the brink of extinction. In that way, it motivated me to complete as many side quests as possible and enjoy the wonderful interactions of Lightning with the people she came across on her journey. The voice actors (Japanese) gave life to the characters with impeccable performances and Lightning was just wonderful with a beautiful mature, serious sounding voice, fitting perfectly the character. The game is all about Lightning and I thoroughly enjoyed that part, from her looks, her voice, her performance, her character development, the numerous dressing options. I loved the details like how people commented on her wearing the Miqo'te outfit (\u98df\u3079\u3061\u3083\u3046\u30cb\u30e3\u30fc). (Chocolina also deserves a thumbs up :P)    \nWhen it comes to combat, it is similar to the previous FF:XIII games and it forces the player to pay attention to the tactics as each enemy has its unique weaknesses. Even on easy mode certain foes will still be OP but I think to a reasonable extent.\nAnd now for my pet peeves: the CLOCK! When I play a game I want to forget about the stressful everyday life and just relax for a while. Unfortunately, you cannot do that in this game as you'll always be running around the clock, quite literally, since everything in the game world is taking place at a particular time and as such every hour is valuable. I spent most of the time just running from one quest giver to the other to get there in time without a second to lose. Although this is in line with the general concept of the game, I simply cannot enjoy a game that makes me feel as stressed as in real everyday life. This has been the only \"game\" that I had to make notes to remember to complete quests because of the specific times. \nAs a consequence of the time issue, I felt that I couldn't finish the game without a game guide to help me save time by pointing me directly to the quest objectives as you are given practically no markers for the side quests and you don't really have... time to leisurely look for them. \nAll in all, it would make a great movie with memorable characters, outstanding performances and intriguing stories to tell but as a game the stressful clock ticking constantly makes it hard to properly enjoy it but it is worth a try nonetheless especially for fans of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1587400657, "timestamp_updated": 1587400657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618176877498626709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67669168": {"recommendationid": "67669168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169185016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2991, "last_played": 1587363271}, "language": "english", "review": "Its ok, slight stutters here and there.", "timestamp_created": 1587363353, "timestamp_updated": 1587363353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67663525": {"recommendationid": "67663525", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993833683", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1196, "last_played": 1599794546}, "language": "english", "review": "Different combat system than traditional Final Fantasy games.

Where to begin.\n\nI'll start with performance. Its better than the FF13/13-2, but its still not where it should be. This game should easily be running at 60fps stable on even mid-range parts, yet performance jumps around on HIGH END parts. It doesn't seem to fully utilize my GPU or CPU at all. \n\nGameplay. Well, its not bad. Its definitely strategic. But the thing that really holds it back is the time limit. I know, it can be extended. And its the point of the game. You have x amount of days to save as many souls as possible, blah blah. The problem is that so much of the game is \"go here, watch this cutscene, BATTLE TIME, now go there. Talk to this person. Do this boring quest.\" rinse repeat. It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't feel like I were being rushed all the time. Trains only run at certain times of the day, so if you finish one thing and want to do something else, you'd better make sure its at the right time. Some quests only activate at certain times of day, so you have to wait around until the quests start. If you get into another quest and get stuck doing that, you might have to wait for the next day before you can attempt again. Yes you have opportunities to slow down time, but its temporary. And I don't usually have issues with this type of thing. I love majora's mask, for instance. But in that, you could slow down time permanently. And you repeat that 3 day cycle over and over again. In this, if you run out of days, you have to start from the beginning. the very beginning. Yes you can carry over your stuff, but still. Its a pain having to go through all of the same crap again, just because the game forced you to.\n\nvisuals. Its a downgrade from the previous games. Makes sense, since this is much more open than previous ff13 games. But you think on PC they would have tried to do more. \n\nAudio is great, no complaints there beyond the voice acting being kinda cringy sometimes. But that's standard JRPG affair.\n\nWould I recommend the game? I mean yea if you like being on a time limit and don't care about the performance, go for it. But I expect better from a PC port. I don't expect the game to look like doom eternal or something, it was built for 360/ps3. But still, i expect a bit more effort, especially since this game came out years after its original console release. And to perform this poorly on some high end hardware? I mean it does run at 60fps, but it jumps around for no reason and at random. I look at performance statistics while playing a game, and this game just isn't fully utilizing my hardware. \n\nYea its cheap, but this is normal squeenix port crap. They rush out a port to cash in. And sadly everyone just buys it and lives with the crappy port job they do. We really shouldn't have to deal with this type of thing, so I would say overall if you want this game, buy it on the ps3 or 360. Yea it won't hit the same fps the pc version can, but at least there the performance is somewhat consistent and it makes sense it runs that way. Here on PC though, it'll make you second guess whether you're running the game on some crazy high end hardware or a potato.", "timestamp_created": 1585178652, "timestamp_updated": 1585178652, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65804496": {"recommendationid": "65804496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337068725", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 845, "last_played": 1661744624}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the concluding story as well as the concept of duty and helping people and their wishes.

She's failed to protect her sister, Serah twice and Etro has died, causing the world to fall into chaos. However, she is given one final chance to carry out a mission by the God Bhunivelze; In seven days, the world will end and she must save as many souls as she can. If she can do enough, she can meet her Serah. With the aid of Hope Estheim, Lightning sets off with renewed determination. \n\n[h1]The Review[/h1] \nAnd so, we come to the end of SquareEnix's attempt at a Final Fantasy trilogy (having done a duology with Final Fantasy X and X-2) and It ends not with a bang but with a \u201csigh.\u201d\n\nAnd its call because of the damn time limit imposed on you. You see you only (initially) have seven days to complete your mission. You have 24 hours to do as much as you can in each day. Sounds fine right? Well a) the time goes pretty fast to the point it can be a shock to the system b) Some quests force you to grind for items c) you will struggle if you don't get use to time management quickly. \n\nThe time limit pressures you to be as fast as you can, not being able to go at your own pace, miss out on the sites and dialogue of the world and make you feel you're not part of the world but speedrunning a game and the trial and error compound the issue. Yes you can skip almost all cutscenes, but having to see the same locations again and again because you have to restart the game is maddening. \n\nThe battle system feels less fun and more of an exercise on brain training and muscle memory and until you become one with the game, most battles feel tedious, especially boss battles afterthought. Many of the Outfits (via the Schemata system) will be unused due to a few being more than enough to get to end-game (which is a shame, because many have great designs. It would have been excellent if you could choose who the Schemata looks based on what you've collected.) \n\nThe story of the game is okay. There are some nice moments but it tends to be very eye-rolling, with a ton of quests ending in the same tired-way, Aesops aplenty to the point it can feel like a lecture from a spiritual guru and it's quite hammy. Still the familiar faces are nice to see and hear and Lumina is a very strong character. \n\nSame goes for music, with a few catchy tunes but many of it falling flat or being unmemorable. \nDespite the huge criticisms though, there are some neat ideas in Lightning Returns and credit have to be given to SquareEnix to try something ambitious and different. Lightning Returns does run smoothly and there are lots of variation in terms of NPC design (compared to Final Fantasy XV, a graphically superior game) and  replayability is heavily promoted, with one achievement not available until you've done so. \n\nBut it doesn't pay off. Again the replayability is a bit forced, some features aren't even available until you've completed the game (Want to upgrade your weapons and armour? Better finish the game!) and the tedium increases. \n\nIs this the worst Final Fantasy game? Well that's always debatable but there is a strong argument. But it's not the worst JRPG. It's a huge let down but there is fun to be had, and for those who love to be challenged and pressured into finding the best way to finish a JRPG, this maybe for you. But for those who just like to do so at their own pace with gameplay that isn't mediocre, you're better off looking elsewhere. \n\n[b][h1]Rating: 5/10[/h1][/b]\n\nNote: Dear Steam.

Not FF13-Lightning Returns as you'd expect and the reason why I think this was done is that this is not a Final Fantasy game. \n\nAt their core there are very common themes and style which thread all of the FF games together. Strategic team combat, complex character driven narratives, varied enemy types, frequent boss battles, world exploration and plenty of choices to make ranging from what quest to take on first and what characters to have in my team, to where should I go next and what kind build I want for my characters so they work well together. Now I'd expect some of these things to survive even the most poorly designed FF game, but somehow they lost ALL of these things and I suspect they knew this due to the FF13 moniker being a sub-title.\n\nThis can be a plus for some players who don't like the FF formula and it would have been a smart move had Square actually made a genuine effort to come up with something fresh for the studio. But LR-FF13 falls flat on it's face in many, many areas. The time limitation itself isn't a major problem, but it isn't an appealing feature at all and doesn't add anything to the game. It also becomes a hindrance as you're motivated to skip through dialogue and cut-scenes due to time constraints. This is the start of the anti-FF formula features as any narrative becomes secondary to just getting the quest done. It also discourages exploration of your environment but since the game consists of only medium sized 4 regions you're not missing out on much. You'll spend more than 6 hours in one city running fetch quests and facing a very small selection of the same enemies over and over again. The grind is very real.\n\nThe team building is completely absent since you control only Lightning herself who has somehow gained the ability to instantly swap between 3 costumes. You put these builds together yourself using a mixture of garb, sword, shield and 2 accessories along with 4 abilities but that is it. The limitation to 4 abilities per costume feels more like Pokemon than it does FF.  The game makes you feel like you're struggling to deal with Lightning's limitations rather than playing the 'saviour' of reality. Choice in progression is also gone entirely as quests decide what stats are boosted rather than you choosing this yourself.\n\nThe story and the visuals arent much better. LR-FF13 dangles only 1 carrot to act as motivation to continue - the identity of the girl who looks like Lightning's dead sister. This is not a spoiler as this character appears in the opening moments of the game. This is your singular motivation to keep pushing forwards and frankly it isn't appealing. Square has slipped back into the uninspired and tedious storytelling of the original FF13.\n\nVisuals are a dire patchwork of amazing and horrendous. Stand Lightning next to any NPC and you'll see a dramatic difference in the quality of the character detail. With the exception of the main characters all of the enemies and NPCs look like they were recycled from whatever Square had in their archives from the PS2 days. The world itself has blurry textures on one surface and then detailed on something nearby giving the world an unfinished look that is distracting enough to ruin the experience of playing the game. \n\nSquare cut corners or were on such a tight budget that they had to settle for 'good enough' so many times that it resulted in one of the worst games they have produced.

The world is actually really great. 4 main areas for the story-line and the game doesn't take too long to play.\n\nCONS -\n  -  Many complain about the protagonist and the general story-line. \n  -  New players may struggle understanding the time constraint concept on the first playthrough. Especially when trying to get objectives completed. (Isn't much of a hassle for seasoned players to this game). Due to this newer players may get frustrated when forced to New Game+ (don't worry, you keep most of everything you've acquired).\n  -  Some might hate the new battle system of this game\n  -  Some hints of repetition on later points (primarily for 100% playthrough's)\n  -  Due to being a direct port of the PS3 version of the game, the game can run horribly on some systems. Even one's that should be able to handle Lightning Returns 3 times at a single moment. But bad ports is something Square is sort of known for *coughs* FF13-2 *coughs*.\n\nPROS - \n  -  World/maps are very large, helps waste some of the time you have in the game going from place to place.\n  -  I feel that the battle system is really in-depth despite seeming simple.\n  -  I personally feel the story-line is good, however a few of the main characters in the game could've used some improvement.\n  -  The Steam version comes included with ALL of the DLC that the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions had minus the Aerith DLC. For some reason that was removed. The DLC equipment can be helpful for new players to get a foot in the world.\n\nCONCLUSION -\nI personally like this game, I have bought it on the PS3, XBOX 360 and as well as Steam (I've had it for years but am now reviewing it). Are there things that could've been better with the game? Definitely, just like any other game, there could be improvements. Some of which include the characters and the framerate issues from the port. These are the most common issues I see addressed by the community. I personally would be happy with just a port fix! If you're looking for a Final Fantasy game that is different from others, this would definitely be one you should try. I rate it as a 9/10. My only negative comment is the port. Fix the port, and I would label the game a 10/10. \n\nThank you for reading this review.", "timestamp_created": 1580006000, "timestamp_updated": 1580006000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62416474": {"recommendationid": "62416474", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005751502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 775, "last_played": 1695496044}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lighting come back", "timestamp_created": 1579999749, "timestamp_updated": 1579999749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62308147": {"recommendationid": "62308147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198415188830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2519, "last_played": 1579840660}, "language": "english", "review": "A great end to a great trilogy.

While I can understand the hate that the XIII series got, I don't feel Lightning as a protagonist deserved the hate she got. It was the other XIII characters who were annoying to me. XIII-2 probably was the most annoying to me because I found Sera and Noel unlikeable in every possible way, but the plot of XIII-2 did a lot to make me like other ancillary characters to the XIII, and Lightning Returns is something that builds on that. Regardless of how you felt about Snow, after seeing his story for 3 games, and knowing what he's been through, makes it hard to NOT CRY at the conclusion of his story in this game. \n\nLightning Returns gets the atmosphere of a world on the edge of death right, and for that it will always have a special place in my heart when it comes to the atmosphere of the game (the towns, the people, the events). Its really honestly a shame that more haven't played it. While playing Shadowbringers I felt so much of the first was reminiscent to how Lightning Returns felt, and yet no one got it, because no one played the game due to some \"perceived lack of quality\" due to being tied to XIII.\n\nJust like Star Wars and Star Trek, no one hates Final Fantasy more than Final Fantasy fans, and I think the lack of people I know who played LIghtning Returns really reflects that.

Soy el primer sorprendido, y es que esta \u00faltima aventura de la trilog\u00eda de Final Fantasy XIII la protagoniza de nuevo la hermana mayor. Vemos como va evolucionando a medida que completa secundarias y avanza por la historia principal, sinti\u00e9ndose muy satisfactorio la forma de finalizar los hilos argumentales que hab\u00eda ido dejando la saga. Puede que no sea a gusto de todos, pero a m\u00ed me ha parecido una excelente forma de acabar lo que desarrollaron en XIII-2. Creo que consiguen con acierto hacerte sentir que est\u00e1s viviendo el fin de su mundo, mediante la evoluci\u00f3n, los di\u00e1logos y el temporizador, lo cual es muy positivo. Eso s\u00ed, tampoco tiene que alarmarse nadie, hay tiempo de sobra para completar el juego y hay opci\u00f3n de new game+ para acabarlo al 100% para quien quiera hacerlo superando los mayores retos que ofrece.\n\nEn lo jugable, es sorprendentemente divertido el a\u00f1adido adicional de acci\u00f3n al sistema de combate de FFXIII. Pese a manejar solo a Lightning, no se siente escaso pues podemos personalizarla much\u00edsimo. Tiene infinidad de \"trajes\" de los cuales hay que seleccionar tres  que llevar activos con diferentes bonos y la posibilidad de cambiar entre ellos en combate. Puedes asignar cuatro habilidades a cada uno, lo que otorga gran variedad de estrategias para todo momento. \nEste t\u00edtulo tiene enfrentamientos muy desafiantes, y la \u00fanica forma de prepararnos para ellos es equiparnos de manera inteligente y formular una estrategia adecuada para los combates seg\u00fan las debilidades de los enemigos. Aqu\u00ed no se puede \"farmear\" para subir nivel, y para desarrollar las estad\u00edsticas de Lightning es obligatorio completar misiones, cuya recompensa son dichos aumentos. Hay much\u00edsimas tareas secundarias, algunas con mejores historias y otras m\u00e1s simples, pero la mayor\u00eda son interesantes de vivir y la protagonista suele sacar conclusiones sobre cada experiencia relacionadas con su propia actitud y conflicto.

You don't rotate between classes but simply \"dresses\"; each has some specific abilities, but you can personalise each dress with abilities, armour, weapons and items, allowing you a great deal of flexbility and potentially hundreds of personalised combinations\n\nCons:\n- impossible to complete without a strategic guide: if you run out of time, it's game over\n- only one main (i.e. playable) character, which is abnormal for a FF and greatly limits characters' dynamics, which have always been one of FF's strongest suits\n- occasionally confusing (especially if you have not played its prequels, but that is to be expected)\n\nI would say that the pros outweight the cons, so I would recommend everyone to give it a try!", "timestamp_created": 1578691223, "timestamp_updated": 1578691223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470588237047195435", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61628679": {"recommendationid": "61628679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037205854", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 2152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2060, "last_played": 1578688469}, "language": "english", "review": "Terrible story (as it was 13 and 13-2).

Se le a\u00f1ade el sistema de Arquetipos, que es muy parecido a las vestiferas del FFX-2 o muy por encima a los oficios de los juegos antiguos, donde cada uno tiene sus fortalezas, debilidades y habilidades exclusivas, tambi\u00e9n hay una gran variedad de armas y equipamiento donde se nota mucho la diferencia con su uso. Algo que no me convenci\u00f3 es que no mejoramos mientras combatimos sino completando misiones. \n\nLos mapas ahora son mas mundo abierto, con tiendas y asentamientos, aunque siguen sin ser muy grandes sigue siendo infinitamente mejor que los pasillos de la primera entrega. Solo hay 4 zonas y dos de ellas son ciudades y las dos aceptablemente grandes donde tienes que ir usando viaje r\u00e1pido o el choboco para poder explorarlo sin que se te acabe el tiempo. \n\nRespecto al tema del tiempo contrarreloj, aunque en principio puede echar para atr\u00e1s, no es ning\u00fan problema, cada dia dura aproximadamente una hora de juego, pero usando la Cronoestasis puedes alargarlo sin problemas, empiezas con 6 dias que son ampliables hasta 14, pero yo he completado casi todo el juego al dia 7 llevando mas de 30 horas. \nGr\u00e1ficamente es el peor de la trilogia, las escenas CGI est\u00e1n geniales, pero el modelado de personajes se ven muy anticuados, los entornos las texturas se ven feas si te fijas bien e incluso algunos detalles de los arquetipos cuando hay escenas. Y el \u00e1ngulo de c\u00e1mara durante las conversaciones es un desastre, la mitad de las veces ni enfocan la cara del personaje ni de Lightning. \n\nEl lore sigue siendo interesante, aporta bastante y se conoce al dios creador de todo, pero no meten ning\u00fan personaje nuevo, algunas misiones principales son algo sosas. Y algunas misiones tienen horario especifico, algo que a mas de uno no le va a agradar. \n\nRespecto a lo t\u00e9cnico, el port est\u00e1 bastante bien, mucho mejor que el XIII-2, va a 60 fps estables en casi todas las zonas, no hay tirones y se ha eliminado el launcher. \n\nEn mi opini\u00f3n un gran juego, contin\u00faa con la fant\u00e1stica historia que tiene el XIII pese a tener la lacra de la jugabilidad de la primera entrega.

Like at all. So here's a spoiler-filled review of the game.\n\nPros:\n\n_Basically everyone has their character arcs reset back to the beginning of 13. Most often I hear this as a complaint, but in this case I think it works. Sazh is still trying to save Dajh but this time he lost his heart when his dad got depressed. Snow wants to rescue Serah and is a dumbass while doing it. Fang wants to save Vanille. Vanille still wants to save everyone. Lightning is still Cloud Strife, but with a vagina. Serah is still the driving force behind Lightning's motivations. And Hope is a robot puppet chosen as the Avatar of God himself. The plot is messy you basically rehash every story beat of the first two games, but this time as Lightning and you see the events through a different set of eyes. It takes my biggest complaint of the first two (that the viewpoint wasn't from the main character it was a 3rd party observing them) and makes the story about Lightning's reactions to the situations. It's like that time you found your old GameBoy and played Pokemon Yellow all over again with the knowledge of how to crush your enemies. You enjoy solving the old problems from a different perspective.\n\n_I'm like one of 6 people who really liked the dressphere system in FFX-2 so I really enjoyed that they streamlined it and brought it back. Kinda disappointed that the two female led FF games entire battle system revolved around clothes, but that's another discussion for another day. Each of the equipment parts give you stat bonuses. You have three different parts: your clothes, your weapon, and your shield. I really enjoyed that the sets were varied enough to allow me to go with the raw power of a set bonus or mix and match for a general boost to all stats. In this game there is an ultima weapon (as per usual) and it pairs with your starter armor, which up until that point was the weakest and worst armor and it's the sword you break in the opening scene. Once repaired it gives you a cheaty +2000 stat bonus to all your stats. It makes the final boss (God) go from impossible to manageable.\n\n_I thought the timer was interesting. It made me flashback to the days of Majora's mask and frantically run around collecting everything and doing things for people to save as many of them as possible. In the mode I played I was able to finish everything in the story, and collect 100 souls to get the secret ending, in like 7 days on my first try. It took me doing several quests at once for 2 in-game days to get them all done. Unlike other games I've played with day/night cycles, the clock always ticks. \n\n_Getting to know people in this game felt really good. I liked the NPCs in this game. Most of the time I just fast forward through fetch quest dialogue boxes and go do what the mission summary says, but in this game the NPCs had this charm. Maybe it's the fact that you have to save everyone and those who you don't save just disappear from the universe forever. So you kind of feel a responsibility to these people.\n\n_Small plus here. Everyone still has their old Paradigm system and uses it in battles against you, but Lightning has a whole different system. If you look close enough you'll see above their heads the old modes like Ravager, Commando, Synergist, etc.\n\nCons:\n\n_As I said earlier in the story section. The plot is a mess. Sometimes actions don't make sense. Like Noel for some reason decides to team up with the bad guys despite secretly being a good guy, tricks everyone into thinking he's hunting her, just so he could later go on to lure Lightning into their hiding place, and not help her destroy the bad guys. Snow tries to hold the Chaos inside him to prevent it escaping into the city, despite learning that relying on others is a good thing in both of the previous games. Vanille is tricked into being the mouthpiece of a group that wants to destroy all of the Chaos, which is dead souls unable to pass. Her character was never really setup to be the gullible one. In context the game breaks so many prior established rules and just kinda handwaves it away with the lukewarm explanation that it's because they've been suffering for the last 500 years. Like cool story bro, but I've never had that experience so I'm not sure if that's a believable reaction to that much life.\n\n_The entire desert area was just so mind numbingly boring that I don't really remember much except that it was stupid that Fang wanted Lightning's help to get Vanille away from the group mentioned in the last section. So what does Fang do? Immediately send you on a series of fetch quests that end in you meeting her face to face. What's her explanation? She had to prove that it was really Lightning when all it took was them meeting face to face. I Just wanted to mention this in its own section because I found it to be the worst example of this game's plot.\n\n_There was a lot of fan service from the other two games in the form of characters. Even Chocolina made a comeback, but I like her story so I kind of give that a pass despite her sudden appearance in the second game.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game has a lot of flaws, but it's fun. That's about all I had to say about it. So if you have read this far, you're an awesome person.

Following guides or knowing what you're doing (Stop time strat) you'll be able to complete everything with some extra days to do whatever you want. Even if you don't manage to, there's new game plus which doesn't make you lose all your progress (minus quests/story obviously) so there's that.\n\nThe combat is quite good, it's almost action combat but with abilities spending your ATB bar. On top of that, you have 3 \"classes\" that you can customise however you please. You could essentially have 3 damage dealers (tough I'd highly go against that). Following the trend of the previous games where you switch classes mid fight, for this game I opted for a Debuffer, Physical Attacker and Magic Attacker/Stagger as my classes.\n\nMonsters can be quite a bit of a challenge at first, but with time you'll get the hang of it! I've seen numerous suggestions on people to start the game on Easy to familiarise yourself and not be annoyed by the time. An advice I would give is try and don't kill as many monsters (if any) as possible in the earlier stages once you max the lvl 1 abilities you desire. After a certain amount of days, the monsters will become tougher BUT start dropping the same abilities at a higher level (i.e lvl 2 for instance). Monsters have a limit on how many times they can be killed, with a final stronger version that is all purple called \"omega\". These drop items that one should try and get as some are quite good. With that said, a small hint is for 2 specific creatures in the Wildlands. \n\n1 - The slimes after a certain amount of days will start dropping Blizzara. Try not to exterminate early on or you won't have options on upgrading said spell.\n2 - There's a monkey like creature which shares the total amount of lives with another monkey that is further in the map. This other monkey is the only one that drops Thundara and it's one of the fastest spells you want.\n\nBesides that, overall I think it's a fantastic game and I think you should give it a try!\n\nIf I had to rank them I'd be:\n\n1 - Lightning Returns\n2 - FF13-2 (Although it has it's own flaws)\n3 - FF13 (I really hated not getting any money from monsters which in turn made upgrading your gear so much more frustrating) \n\nAnd that's it!", "timestamp_created": 1572249509, "timestamp_updated": 1572249509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494311511516571045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55837832": {"recommendationid": "55837832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074988896", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 312, "last_played": 1481150350}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is GARBAGE!

The final entry of the most bestest Final Fantasy trilogy, took way too long to reach PC, around a year-ish after XIII-2, in fact.\n \nThat turned out to be a relatively good thing, as the last part of the trilogy finally got a competent port. Not great, but it actually runs smoothly at the advertised 60fps, and not the weird framerate carousel that the last 2 entries had. Options are relatively sparse, and the ones that do exist are brought up in a row menu on the top of the game window, which is a bit weird, and rather unwieldy if you're rolling with a controller.\n \nStorywise, it's pretty much XIII, so you better have retained the lore knowledge, because there's more of it, with certain things mentioned in passing on previous entries becoming important or even pivotal to the story. The writing in general ranges from ok to utterly stupid , with special mentions for the sidequest with the girl and her missing father, and the ending. Actually, I'll just say this about the ending: [spoiler]I hated it, and it's [b]France's[/b] fault![/spoiler] ... and [spoiler]Kitase's[/spoiler].\n\nGameplay wise, you play as the one true goddess who must never be forgotten, Lightning, and as no one else. The world is, again, free-roam, mostly similar to XIII-2, but without the time travel shenanigans. The real shtick this time though is that you can configure sets of costumes that work as a sort of classes, which you can switch 3 of freely during battle. Most of the rest of the battle mechanics are pretty much taken from the rest of the series.\n \nLastly, sound & graphics: BGM is, once again, pretty good, with a decent number of mainstay tracks. No Heavy Metal Chocobo, though.\nGFX though....I already talked about the options, but the graphical design in this game is just so ugly.

It's only best to farm enemies when you are in day 9 or day 10, more of them spawn and the more likely you get more rare abilities.\nthe cheapest thing i did to beat the boss is basically just use Martial monk + forsaken tie + Locket pendant, final boss ded in 2 minutes.\n\nHARD MODE DIFFICULTY\n\nAfter finishing the game i went to Hard mode directly instead of starting new game+ on normal because i won't get demonic forge fire and holy forge fire materials.

Story wise, it attempts to make sense of everything that happened up to this point and wraps up the cliffhanger that was FF XIII-2. It also has a nice feel-good ending that left me satisfied although a little sad that it was coming to an end. However, for people that didn't care for the story in either FF XIII or XIII-2, the story here will not impress you.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I believe this is the best version of the Schemata system yet. It's much faster paced and plays more like an action game than it does a RPG. It's how the system should've been from the beginning! Unfortunately, besides the open areas where you can run around and accept quests, that's all the gameplay you'll get. There's no mini-games and little variety in the quest types. It basically boils down to \"go here, talk to this person, fight this, go back and talk to this person, fight again, etc.\" I don't want to downplay the effort that went into making these quests though as mostly all of them are voice-acted and come with their own stories.\n\nAs for loot, every armor and weapon has its own unique model which does make it fun to play dress up with lightning sometimes. Each armor comes with it's own abilities and aren't interchangeable so some armor will be practically useless from the get-go and some others are pretty ugly. It would've been nice to be able to put the stats of one armor onto another but alas, it is not possible. I will also mention that certain armor pieces are vastly superior to the rest in terms of potential defense and offense. I won't spoil which ones are, but if decide to play keep an eye out in armor shops and play around with the various outfits, abilities, and accessories and you'll find some pretty OP stuff.\n\nLastly, I'd like to address the time mechanic in the game that puts most people off from the game and is understandable. In this day and age where a lot of us struggle with managing our own time in reality, having to time-manage in game is stressful. But I can assure you that the game gives you more than ample amount of time to beat every quest. If you use the Chronostasis ability in game which pauses time for a short while, you can beat all main quests and a majority of all side quests within 4 in-game days. Depending on how many quests you bother to do, that will leave you 9-10 extra days to do whatever. Unfortunately, like I mentioned earlier, there's no mini-games so you'll be spending those extra days doing a whole lotta nothing except fight monsters to extinction, literally. So take your time through the game and don't stress about the time. As long as you aren't standing around doing nothing letting time burn, you'll easily beat the game.\n\nTL;DR: Decent ending to the FFXIII trilogy.

It would be nice if Lightning could run around during battle but her slow calculating walk sort of makes sense for her as a character.\n\nThe Garb system is both fun to play around with and wildly customisable, if a little frustrating in some ways (discussed in the cons).\n\nThe world is interesting even when the story sort of falls apart.\n\nLumina's just awful and campy and I love her.\n\nThe game in general is just campy fun. It knows it's not a masterpiece and it isn't trying, it just wants to be fun for you.\n\nThere's something ridiculously fun about killing the Last One's. Why are they that ugly, terrible shade of pink? Who knows, who cares?\n\nCons;\n\nThe biggest flaw of this game is the limited number of Days. You're given a certain number of days to complete the game and you can extend this by completing side quests. That's good and fun. However the issue comes when some quests are only available at certain times and some quests require you to go through multiple days to complete them and there is absolutely no inclination towards this in game.\n\nThe Abilities in this game are generally obtained by farming them from enemies. You can combine multiple abilities of the same level to make them stronger. This is a great idea that sadly just doesn't work very well in conjunction with the Last One system. Some abilities only drop from one or two enemies and the level of ability you get depends on the current Day. Meaning you could get a level 1 ability in the first couple days and a level 4 ability later on. This is fine in theory but if you're new to the game and get caught up in farming the hell out of these creatures you can accidentally drive them to extinction before you get the chance to get better abilities. It's antifun.\n\nThe story is bad. If you're looking for an RPG with a fantastic story to get lost in and enjoy this isn't it. It has all the campiness and fun you can expect from a Final Fantasy without any of the depth.\n\nHope is a main character. Of all the characters they could've picked... Hope. Why? In which alternate hell dimension is that the choice? We all makes choices but girl that was a choice.\n\nWhether or not you'll enjoy this game depends entirely on what you expect from your games. If you can let loose and just enjoy a game with fun gameplay and campy bullshit this is maybe it.

That said,\nStory : 6.5/10\nThe story isn't bad per say, and as the finale to the XIII series it ties up a lot of loose ends, but it has too many things that don't make sense for it to be a solid narrative. As with any other final fantasy game though, you play it for the visual spectacles and grand quest story which it doesn't disappoint, so long as you don't think about it too much.\n\nCharacters are basically the same cast and stay consistent as per previous titles without much development so not much to comment.\n\nGameplay : 7/10\nThe battle system is a huge overhaul in a good direction in my opinion, as it gives the player more freedom in movement during combat and ability to defend themselves during combat rather than simply switching paradigms to sentinel like the previous games. The mechanic of there being only 24 hours in the day may pressure the player into rushing, but as long as you complete the main quests there's more than enough time to complete everything you can in one playthrough.\n\nOverall : 7/10\nI personally enjoyed Lightning returns , maybe more so because it gave closure to the story in an acceptable way and had a fun battle system. The game will probably get you very little hours though if you only plan on completing the main quests and doing one playthrough as the game is somewhat built for replays on harder difficulties without additional story content.

Tampoco aportan nada a la historia, b\u00e1sicamente el mundo es un lugar gris y sin esperanza, hasta que llega Lighting y les da esperanza completando esas misiones y les \"salva el alma\" para que puedan reencarnar en un mundo nuevo.

Lightning Returns serves as the final chapter of Lightning's story and possesses some of the most experimental gameplay of the franchise. While adding a time-limit within the game has been a controversial aspect, it's done extremely well and while many call for it to be removed. Doing so would completely ruin the type of experience offered. \n\nEvery aspect of Lightning Returns is built around its 13-day system. From side-quests only appearing at certain times to all enemies in the game having finite numbers and slowly getting stronger the longer they stay alive. What could have been a creative mess has been fleshed out in such a way that I didn't think Square would be capable of. Making it easily the most open and well made in the trilogy. Players are given so much agency to complete tasks in the order they would like that everyone's play-through will be slightly different.\n\nCombat is much tougher than the previous entries; but due to the customisation options each attack and spell is far more useful. This is true for side-quests and optional tasks as well, as each completed task improves Lightning's capabilities. Which becomes important for beating the more difficult main quest missions. While time management may seem daunting at first, there is more than enough time to complete every quest if you're careful. \n\nThe soundtrack and art-style are sublime as always. While the world of Lightning Returns is a broken one, the atmosphere is just as captivating. NPC's going about their daily schedules such as: Going to shops at various times, heading back to their homes during the night, etc. Makes each moment just that bit more engaging. \n\nBut the plot at times is just awful.\n\nStory beats are confusing and given little explanation. Many cut-scenes are littered with nonsensical dialogue and a barrage of bewildering twists. By the end of this game you will know what has happened, but barely have a reason why. Even some previously established rules set in the other games are arbitrarily ruined in this sequel. While certainly not everything, it must be noted how far the narrative has declined since the first game. \n\nBut, overall. If you have kept up with the 13 saga up till this point, this game is absolutely worth your time. Even if it can be a little stressful and difficult at first.

And i must say it's probably the best one but still far away from older Final Fantasies.\n\nSo as you already understood from the title, Lightning returns to save the world. It has a pretty good story but sometimes it feels too serious. You meet characters from the past games, one of them (Hope) being your helper who gives you guidance from another dimension. Lighning this time travels in time to prevent the end of the world.\n\nGameplay and the world is where this game differs from other two.\nFirst, this is probably the first FF game where you don't have any party. Lightning is alone through most the game. Although you can have a non-human companion. Can't say i liked it, but to my surprise it was better than i expected. I still would've liked having a full party consisting of other human characters.\nCombat is much more action oriented and is almost hack'n'slash type of combat. You need some reaction to block enemy attacks and attacks and other actions are very fast. It makes the combat more intense but sacrifices some tactical elements like using magic, potions and skills. They're still there but combat is nowhere as deep as it was in FFIX for example.\nYou'r companion is a Chocobo you meet later in the game. He joins you when you take care of him and become friends with him. This whole quest was really great. speaking about quests. There are lots of them, i think no previous FF game had so many side quests. There are not only hunts, but traditional rpg quests (yes fetch quests too) where some person asks you to do something. It was a nice addition and most of those quests where pretty good and fun to do. You'll need to explore every inch of cities and villages to complete them.\nWhat i liked more about this game compared to FFXIII is its openness. It's a semi-open world game and there are cities and villages finally. There's a lot of explore and uncover, you'll probably spend most of the time doing side quests.\nThe world is pretty big and locations are beautifully crafted. From a big alive city full of people living their lives to plains to a desert. It has everything. I really liked the world, it's so much better than previous two game, a huge improvement.\nThere's also weapon crafting. You get materials from doing quests and can craft/enhance new weapons to fight stronger enemies to get better materials etc.\n\nNow what i didn't like. Time limit! Why? For what reason? It's Final Fantasy for fuck's sake. I hated that and i turned it off. Without the time limit game became so much better. I get it, Lightning has limited time to save world but i rather prefer that time would advance after you finish the chapter and you could take as much time doing quests in a chapter as you like.\n\nGraphically the game is a real beauty (considered it's a PS3 game released in 2014). Locations look stunning, cities are big and full of little details and npc's. Be it forest, desert, ravine, dungeon, everything looks great and there's no feeling of reused assets again and again. I hate that. In some other games wherever you go you see same textures, same color palette, same assets, you can't even tell one dungeon from another and if not the different layouts you couldn't tell. Fortunately this is not the case in Lightning Returns.\nPerformance for me personally was good although it could've had more graphical options. But considering the price, that it's a PS3 port and it's made by SE i was very satisfied.\n\nMusic is good as always in Final Fantasy games. Can't it was something exceptional but music never got old and some songs were really great.\n\nOverall a very solid jRPG (although it's very westernized so is suitable for any rpg lover). It's still not a full-fledged Final Fantasy game but it's a huge improvement over past two games. If you love rpg's, beautiful worlds, nice stories, strong characters you should definitely buy it.

Only downside is that it doesn't show untraveled areas unlike the 2nd game.\n\n+ The atmosphere of the cities and locations (aside from the boring desert) is well done with the locals talking about the latest events or interesting thoughts as you run past.\n\n+ As mentioned before most of the side-quests themes and objectives are interesting due to them revolving around being alive for 500 years unable to age or die.  There's still your usual notice board fetch quests, but the interactive ones are best.  It's also interesting you only gain stats from completing quests instead of defeating enemies. It was fun planning out the 'day' in order to maximize my time.\n\n+ Time mechanic (where you only have at most 13 in-game days to get everything done) was interesting but overall shouldn't turn you off from the game.  It's manageable.  I fast-forwarded through the last 5 days because I was done early.\n\n+The story is far better than the second game's.\n\nCons\n- While the story is good, the dialogue to deliver it can be cringe-inducing at times. \n- There's also the usual characters gaining abilities/powers out of nowhere, but that's JRPGs for you.\n\nOverall really enjoyed this game.

Alternate titles: Stagger Fantasy 3, Lightning Returns. Referred to as P3 for the purpose of this review.\n\n\nOpening comments:\n\nP1 had things about it which made it unique among FF games, so much that I didn't feel like it was a true FF game. P3 has even more about it which is unique among FF games, so much so that I dare to call the entire FFXIII trilogy the Stagger Fantasy trilogy. \n\nIn P3, we play a hybrid combination of an action RPG, and Rogue-like game. The result is something very alien to playstation FF players, but it's still a good game. It's challenging and I hope this game inspires greater games in the future.\n\n\nBasics:\n\nOnly one character is controlled in P3, which can lightning-fast alternate between 3 different combat patterns(like switching classes in FFX-2), each equipping a mandatory weapon and shield, invisible headwear and armwear, and inconsequential cosmetic. The base form of a combat pattern is a garb, and the garbs' colors may be edited with a palette of up to 12 user-defined colors and 12 preset colors. Editing the palette doesn't ruin saved garbs. Each garb can only use up to 4 commands(sometimes replacement commands appear during combat).\n\nAlthough there are some commands that emulate those from P1 and P2, there are no class bonuses in P3, so bonuses mostly come from enemies getting staggered which are then afflicted by special ailments(sometimes stacking with regular ailments) such as 'stagger-deprotect' and 'stagger-deshell' which gives incentive to stagger often. Getting the enemy to stagger in the first place was reworked significantly to better fit the style of an action RPG.\n\nThere are 3 types of quests: Main Quests(necessary to complete the story), Side Quests(necessary to expand the story), and Canvas of Prayers Quests(have no effect on the story but add morsels of stats and data). All MQ have no way to time out unless you game over. SQ are the tricky ones. Innkeepers and hotel staff are your best friends when it comes to finishing them. CoPQ are just loot turn-ins and they increase in number both as the number of days increases and as quests are finished.\n\nThere are 3 kinds of enemies in P3: regular monsters which have an Omega form[to find out more about that, visit the Lighthouse in Dead Dunes], unique opponents which might transform as they level up, and the traditional RPG monsters. All kinds of enemies can level up by both difficulty level and day number. Loot tables change depending on the level of the enemies.\n\nEnemies are encountered in much the same way as in P2, but the ability to ignore enemies is more like the ability to ignore them in P1. Elemental weaknesses give incentive to take advantage of manual sorting of both garbs and commands for quicker changes to combat patterns.\n\n\nConcluding thoughts:\n\nI'm glad that the game offers the choice of Easy and Normal at the start. Worth mentioning that there is a Hard mode also. I chose Normal at first and I was exhilerated when I first arrived at Dead Dunes as I was doing quite a lot of exploring there and almost had to skip to curfew(the kind of thing that would feel like a game over but wouldn't be unless ran out of days), but I made it back to the recovery items seller eventually and continued with my expedition. \n\nI was confused for why getting the Carbuncle Doll was a 1 star difficulty SQ because I was under the impression it was loot earned from slaying a dangerous enemy, when actually it  was just sitting on some boxes in plain sight but only at a certain time of night. Don't believe everything a non-player character tells you.\n\nLuxerion's quests were very annoying because they had too many hidden time-based conditions to complete them. The Ghosts quest in particular felt like it should have been easier and a mandatory quest because it tells so much of the story. I'm pretty sure they rushed through this zone's quest code to finish the game. There's even a series of dialogues that implies I could access a certain area outside of the regular rules by means of some sort of quest which isn't offered.\n\nLumina was great. I liked her part in the story, and am pleased with how they brought her into the game. They could have done more with her character however, such as making NG+ grant different/additional Lumina treasure quests.

Hope is also very annoying becase he doesn't stop talking!! The time system was also a bad thing in my opinion forcing the player to return to the Ark every day to see the same animations over and over again, or having to wait until a certain time to progress to new areas/quests wasn't very fun either.\nThere is also no leveling system, that means there is no reason to fight monsters in this game and no sense of accomplishment, like getting more powerful. You get nothing but some quite useless items for fighting enemies. The only way to improve your stats is doing side quests that aren't very fun or rewarding....\nThere's a lot of walking a backtracking too. You spend a lot of time just walking forward and going back multiple times just to devliver some item.\n\nI also have several performance issues with this game in my system. No matter what settings or resolution I choose, the frame rate is super unstable with lots of stuttering specially in the cities. It is impossible to mantain constant 60fps and I'm pretty sure it's a very bad port because both CPU and GPU are under 40% usage and it still stutters/drop frames to lower 30s. Locking the game at 30fps helps a bit, but there is still stuttering and even some drops. My guess is poor memory management of the game engine because I noticed this game uses very low ammounts of RAM and VRAM, probably because it was originally made for a 256MB system like the PS3 and they didn't even care to fix it for the PC port.\n\nI'm certainly disappointed with this game. FFXIII was one of my favorite PS3 games and I also enjoyed XIII-2, but Lightning Returns wasn't enjoyable for me.

Lightning Returns is one of my favorite games of all time, and I'll try to explain why it is. Everything is a matter of opinion so I'll try to explain the strong points (for me) and my preferences, so perhaps it's easier to see if it can fit your preferences or not.\n\nFirst of all, I'm 99% about gameplay. That\u2019s my preference. I'm not saying that Lightning Returns has terrible story, but it probably falls flat compared with other FF's. But honestly, it depends on how you approach it. If what you care about is an amazingly deep plot that's all connected and all that, maybe this isn't for you. BUT, if you enjoy a 'moment-to-moment' experience in which little side quests, moments, surprises, etc, can be more important or just as fun as the 'whole package', I believe this game delivers even on story. Some of the side quests are simply amazing, some very bitter to varying levels and others quite light and with a happy ending. This game does an amazing job at displaying what humanity would do at the 'end of the world', even if some side quests might feel like the characters don't feel the weight of the hundreds of years of suffering, others do this REALLY well.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk gameplay: Combat is like an action rpg, with a twist: The schemata. You have 3 \u201cclasses\u201d that you can switch to anytime during battle at the press of a button. Each have their own ATB bar (works like a Stamina bar really) that dictates how much you can use your abilities. Abilities that YOU pick. Each Schemata has a garb (armor), weapon, shield and 2 extra equips, one affecting just that Schema, and another that affects all 3. Other than that you can pick your 4 abilities that you get from quests, monsters, chests, etc. Each ability has it\u2019s cost, power, element, and garbs can have their own locked abilities, and equipment can have passive skills (even abilities/active skills can have passive skills) that can change how you play. Spend ATB of one Schema to boost ATB of another, switch out at the last second to gain buffs, all sorts of fun stuff you can imagine. Experiment and make your OWN setup, it\u2019s fun and nearly any enemy can be taken down different ways, and yet every enemy has it\u2019s own \u201cstagger\u201d mechanics returning from other FF 13 games. It\u2019s not that complicated once you experiment with it a bit.\n\nNow these are some recommendations on how to 'approach' this game, or at least more or less how I did so.\n\n[b] Play the game without a guide, at your own pace. [/b] The game is full of moments in which you're going to do something and then something amazing happens that you didn't know. Stuff like me going to hunt some monsters for abilities then suddenly I hear this phone ringing and then someone says they are being kidnapped, and I actually have an unknown time limit to save that person. I go after them and suddenly some OTHER person showed up in the way with a new quest, and I also happen to find something I was looking for before from another quest. This can only happen if you don't look up quests online. [u] If you're confused about the game's mechanics, look up how ability synthesis works, but NOT what abilities you can find/make [/u], it's the most confusing mechanic and if you're playing on your own, on Normal instead of Easy, and enjoying the journey, that can help and it won't spoil much/anything. Don't look up boss strats or quest lists. [b] EXPERIMENT with the game. It's one of it's strongest qualities. [/b]\n\n[b] Play on Normal at first. [/b] This game can be hard at times, but Easy takes off most of the urgency, fun and challenge. Think of every day at this world as a bit of a challenge. You gotta define what you'll do, at what moments you're willing to stop and go explore, and how much time you can waste. I love this. There's are many things that help you MANAGE this, and it's fun: EP abilities that can cure, stop time, teleport, and healing items that can also buff you in key moments. I specially enjoy that some of the best items are first avaliable only at the Ark, and later at 'hard to get' places. So your ITEMS MATTER. Are you going to waste that Phoenix Wing (powerful Phoenix Down) in this battle that you just messed up at the start of the day but finally finish off that powerful enemy, or redo everything? Or avoid that enemy entirely? On NORMAL and HARD, those situations DO happen and matter, but they kind of don't on Easy.\n\n[b] Read the in-game bestiary and datalog, and don't worry about messing up or being efficient all the time. [/b] If you game over (out of time) you can try again with all the stats progress you had before from completing quests. Or if you just can't have the patience to do it all over again, trust me: It's better to have like 40 hours of FUN and playing as you see fit, than trying to look up online how to be efficient. This game mechanics and customization allow you to tackle things your own way. No \"spam quick hit on the arms and hit the body while using very specific equipment as well as Rikku, Wakka and Tidus THE BOSS\" in here. Seriously. Even the superbosses can be defeated in multiple ways in a mix of skill and strategy.\n\n[b] Don't expect a \"FINAL FANTASY EXPERIENCE\" here. [/b] I'm no FF mega expert, (I beat 10, played lots of 12, and a bit of 8, 4, 10-2, and 13. I saw lots of playthroughts and videos on the other ones like 6, 7, 9...) but I think I know enough to confirm: This game is not very \"Final Fantasy-y\". I mean, the \"pretty much action-rpg gameplay that we call ATB regardless\" should be your big hint. My friends, this game has positioning, timed blocks, evades, and combo-ing. EVEN AERIAL combos, sorta. And let me tell you, the combat and customization makes 15 look like a baby's edition of this game's combat for all I know. BUT I haven't played 15 yet, so I won't judge, just simply repeating what I heard others say, at least the ones that enjoyed this or both games.\n\nNow a bit of the bad. Beware of minor gameplay spoilers\n\n[b] The BAD: [/b] Nothing's perfect and I'll try to be devil's advocate here and stab this game (that I love) where it might hurt a bit. But I'll probably do a bad job, bias.\n\n[u] Some Textures [/u]: Some textures are blurry and terrible, specially on the terrain. Characters, weapons, etc still look good, and some places are indeed beautiful. Just don\u2019t look too hard into it.\n\n[u] Guard, then Smash buttons to win fake impression [/u]: This one here requires a few 'unlucky set of events' to happen and give this fake impression. Certain enemies ARE fodder. Some abilities ARE powerful. A few setups are borderline OP. So if you somehow stumble upon all of this at once repeated times, you'll be given the impression you just need to mash buttons and Guard and you win. But trust me, things get really hard later on. The moment you run into your first \"Omega\" enemy, you'll understand that this game doesn't mess around when it get serious. Hard mode is insane too. The superbossess will not let you PASS if you don't have a powerful setup. And trust me, this game will make you fear Chocobo Eaters like no other Final Fantasy did. Yet, all enemies have their weak points and exploitable mechanics that are really fun. Maybe that enemy you hate buffed himself at a specific moment, and maybe you can prepare for it. Or even STEAL the buffs. Maybe negate them? EXPERIMENT. It's the heart of this game.\n\n[u]Performance[/u]: This game likes to choke on itself, SPECIALLY on big cities with loads of NPCs. Apparently this PC port is 'alright', nothing magical. It gets stable 60fps during combat, which is impressive (console versions of this were 30 fps or less all the time I believe) and sometimes it stays at 60 on the overworld. But on crowded areas it will lag hard without warning. I have a i5-4440 and a GTX 1060, and even though my CPU isn't anything special, I'm not sure a better CPU will solve the stutter issues. It's playable tho.\n\nWould write more, but ran out of space. But this should give you all an idea.

Developers should add more variations to this element if possible.\n\n- Great variety of musics and epically composed, you would be listening to different tunes during day and night in each city. \n\n- Story characters are fun, you can feel each of their personalities.\n\n- Able to dye some of the garb parts.\n\n- Customizable equipment set to your needs/taste (it's called \"schemata\" in game).\n\n- Open World design, combat is instance based though.\n\n- Fluid character movement and actions.\n\n- Lightning is very beautiful (yes!).\n\n\nCons:\n- Gameplay controls could be complicated for PC mode players, I had hard time to re-map my keyboard.\n\n- Doomsday Countdown makes you panic all the times as a beginner. Rest assured that you are given ample of time to finish everything. I ended with skipping 3 days in total in first playthrough (with some Internet guides though).\n\n- Unable to dye anything else other than garbs\n\n- Limited variations to NPC faces. Most of them are based on 6~7 types of model to my impression. Please design/randomize their faces more Square Enix. Similarly to enemies.\n\n- Most of the strong garbs are exposing thighs too much, I guess they like it.\n\n- Some schemata sets are not obtainable in PC mode.\n\n- Casting \"strong\" magic spells that ends with -\"ga\"makes Lightning to backflip and thus increases next action waiting time.

It frustrated me and I complained a lot about it to others. But it didn't stop me from playing. I just decided to do more side quests and come back later. What I didn\u2019t know is that after an X amount of days, the bosses get more HP and stronger powers as the developers probably assumed it would be too easy if you level up but the enemy doesn't.\n\n[h1] Ok, so here are some pros and cons. [/h1]\n\u2764You can decide when to do what.\n\u2764The game got several items to chance the way Lightning looks and how she fights.\n\u2764The game and its cut scenes look beautiful\n\u2764You can put markers on both the mini and large map so you won\u2019t get lost all the time.\n\u2764You are able to save the game at nearly every point\n\u2764If you got enough EP left you can teleport without losing time or money\n\u2764There are enough quests to keep you busy\n\u2764The game contains quite a set of monsters to fight against\n\n\n\u25cfEvery in game day at 06:00 you automatically teleport to The Ark.\nWhich can be quite annoying if you are in the middle or on your way to a quest.\n\u25cfThe dialogue in the cut scene and the mouth \nMimic aren't corresponding properly.\n(Didn't bother me much)\n\u25cfMany places and people in the game can only be visited between specific hours, which sometimes prevents you from continuing/finishing a quest.\n\u25cfSometimes the cut scenes take a bit too long.\nBut if you aren't into the story of some people you helped and just want to continue playing you can press ESCAPE and then F1 to skip it.\n\n[b] As I was playing this pretty looking game, I felt it was worth more than just a laptop screen.\nSo I went to a local store to get an HDMI cable to connect it the tv so I would be able to have a better look at the game and while doing so have my family get a glimpse of the game that I was enjoying so much that I hardly got out of my room when there was nothing else to do. [/b] \n\n[h1] All in all I would give this game a 9 out of 10! [/h1]\n\nAnd a 10+ to the friend who gave me this game and is always around to help, have fun with and looked over this review to make sure it is not full or grammar mistakes.\n\n[i] I could actually say a whole lot more about the game, but I don't want to spoil it all. [/i]\n[b] So if you get the chance get it on sale and enjoy yourself for the coming days!

Even better you have a clock ticking behind your @ss telling you that you cannot spend too much time on exploring or finding clues.\n\nI got a lot of frustration playing this game, the only reason which can make it up for me is the combat system - building your character right is one of the keys to win the battle.

NO\n\nBOTTOM-LINE UP FRONT:\n\nI'm a huge fan of FF games, but the forced time limit on this game was a completely stupid idea. For that reason, I will not be playing this game all the way through. I even made the first community configuration so this game could be played from a controller, but that isn't enough to inspire me to keep playing.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\n\nSo I am a huge Final Fantasy fan, and when I learned about FFXIII Lightning Returns I was intrigued by the \"open world\" aspects of the game. I figured this would be kind of like FFXV, but different where I would be free to explore large cities, which FFXV didn't really have. So the \"open world\" concept of this game drew me in.\n\nOVERALL DESIGN:\n\nThe gameplay system was great. The character customization was awesome. With all of the different types of attire I could customize my gear sets, and it even let me customize the colors with CUSTOM COLORS. That was awesome. All of the weapons were cool, and my downloadable content was available. Graphics were great, and I didn't have any issues with lag. I really felt these graphics were close to FFXV's high level of detail.\n\nREASON FOR NOT RECOMMENDING:\n\nAfter I began to play a little, I quickly learned that there is a time limit to the game. I found out that if I let the time limit lapse the game would end and I would be forced to play against stronger monsters will less adequate gear. There is no way to stop the time limit, unless you keep your EP level high and constantly spam chronostasis.\n\nSo let me get this straight... I was drown to the \"open world\" concept, which promised to let me roam and explore this graphically appealing Final Fantasy futuristic world... but under the heavy restriction of having a time constraint with dire consequences if I'm not always \"on the edge\" to complete missions on a set time.\n\nTo be clear - I am not a speedrunner, and I find it horrible that there would be an adventure game with a time limit. Whoever at Square ENIX thought this would be a good idea should be fired, or rather not giving the player the option to remove the time restriction should be fired.\n\nFor all of the fanboys out there that say \"stop whining and stop playing RPGs\", because they are in favor of a time limit.... I have this to say. I've probably played a lot more RPGs than most of you - so STFU and screw off. The fact that there would be a time limit in an open world RPG is CONTRADICTORY to the meaning and purpose of having an open world, which is ADVENTURING.\n\nStop being jerk wads on forums criticizing others for having their own damn opinions. People that attempt to demean others for being upset about an inadequate game are the lowest end of the gene pool on the Internet. For examples of some of dumbest people on the Internet that have this horrible character trait - you can look here:\n\nhttps://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/681990-lightning-returns-final-fantasy-xiii/68673558?page=1", "timestamp_created": 1546399040, "timestamp_updated": 1546399306, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.320117771625518799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48002839": {"recommendationid": "48002839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086319026", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2245, "last_played": 1546307725}, "language": "spanish", "review": "3\u00ba y \u00faltimo cap\u00edtulo de la Saga Fabula Nova Christalis.\n-HISTORIA\nLa historia se sit\u00faa 500 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de XIII-2 y nos trae de vuelta a Lighting, la cual debe salvar las almas del mundo para poder llevarlas al nuevo, que est\u00e1 siendo creado por el Dios supremo.\nSi venias del XIII-2 con los viajes en el tiempo, ahora resulta que todo va de dioses arriba y abajo, complacer al Dios supremo y rogar porque todo vaya bien.\nLas conversaciones son TEDIOSAS, te explican lo mismo 50 veces, primero se entera Lighting, luego lo comenta con X, luego con Y, se le cruza un conocido y le cuenta lo mismo, este lo reflexiona y la otra lo corrobora, no sin antes asegurarse de que lo has entendido. En serio, no exagero, es cargante explicando lo que pasa una y otra y otra vez.\nDicho esto, NO hay m\u00e1s historia, el juego es un 90% misiones secundarias con las cuales podremos alargar los d\u00edas de juego y a su vez, cada mision superada nos subir\u00e1 las estad\u00edsticas de VIT, Ataque Fisico, M\u00e1gico... . En otras palabras, no se sube niveles por experiencia vs bichos, si no superando misiones.\nNos encontraremos con los protagonistas de los otros juegos, pero b\u00e1sicamente se basa en completar su misi\u00f3n para salvar su alma y poco m\u00e1s, con el objetivo de llegar al BOSS final que no explicar\u00e9 aqu\u00ed.\nEn cuanto al resto, las hay m\u00e1s y menos entretenidas, pero hacedme caso que en algunas vais a estar paseando m\u00e1s que jugando, parece un walking simulator.\n-MECANICAS\nLa jugabilidad est\u00e1 basada en Action RPG, de modo que nos encontraremos enemigos por el escenario que podremos decidir si pegar o no, y una vez iniciada la batalla dispondremos de 3 vestidos al mas puro estilo X-2 que puedes configurar como te plazca, cada uno con 4 habilidades a personalizar. Las batallas son entretenidas pero hay mejores JARPGs.\nAhora bien, est\u00e1 el tema del TIEMPO. El juego empieza con 6 d\u00edas para el final, tras esos 6 d\u00edas el juego se acaba y volverias a empezar de 0 pero con los stats que hubieras ganado. En dificultad NORMAL el juego ya es bien JODIDO, el reloj no se para en ning\u00fan momento, y no va precisamente despacio, de modo que si es la primera vez que juegas preparate para estresarte o bien mentalizate de que vas a tener que empezar el juego 2 o 3 veces, porque no vas a llegar al ultimo d\u00eda (13) ni de co\u00f1a.Tendr\u00e1s que ir a las tiendas o a las posadas para recuperar salud, con lo que perder\u00e1s tiempo. En las luchas el reloj no para, y si te matan, cosa bastante probable, el reloj avanza un trecho. El sistema es complejo ya que tienes que tener presente que las misiones te pueden aparecer de D\u00edA, TARDE o NOCHE, y que no las puedes canjear si se te ha pasado la hora, y cuando empiezas a tener X misiones activas a la vez te recomiendo apuntarte en que momento del d\u00eda aceptaste a una misi\u00f3n, porque es es probable que no lo recuerdes y cuando vuelvas el t\u00edo que te la dio ya no est\u00e9 all\u00ed.\nEL MODO NORMAL NO EST\u00c1 PENSANDO PARA PASARTE EL JUEGO LA PRIMERA VEZ.\nSi lo que quieres es pasartelo sin mas, entonces juegalo en FACIL, la vida se te recupera tras las batallas, el reloj se para en el inventario, no usaras posadas ni restaurantes, las magias para parar el tiempo las tendr\u00e1s MUY amenudo, los enemigos son ma\u00e1s sencillos y no hay pensalizaci\u00f3n por morir y en definitiva, se puede llegar comodamente al \u00faltimo d\u00eda y sin utilizar gu\u00edas, de hecho, deber\u00eda sobrarte mucho tiempo.\nPor si tienes ganas de m\u00e1s tras pasartelo en el nuevo juego + puedes empezar en modo dificil, que no me quiero imaginar el festival que debe ser eso.\n-Apartado visual\nEl juego est\u00e1 muy detallado y con bastantes gui\u00f3s a otros Final Fantasy, sin embargo tengo que destacar que no tiene CGIs m\u00e1s que en la introducci\u00f3n y en el final del juego, viniendo de jugar del XIII y XIII-2 esto resulta chocante.\nLos gr\u00e1ficos no son malos pero tampoco es READ DEAD REDEMPTION2, pasables para hoy en d\u00eda.\n-Valoraci\u00f3n\nLighting Returns no es mal juego, pero tampoco es bueno. Entretenido en lo jugable pero sin enganchar, con una historia degenerada al m\u00e1ximo y estresante si entras de nuevo en el modo Normal.

There is as well some really annoying bugs like sometimes some quests  dialogues glitches and you end up stuck in a dialogue loop without being possible to finish or start the quest forcing you tor estart the game to retry a second attempt, game also suffers from radom crashes they don't have a reason or a certain area to happen(for me they happens more frequently in the Wildlands) so I recommend you to save the game constantly to avoid losing progress.\n  Another issue is related to game content, Hard mode and some of the games content like upgrading equipment and max leveling the skills are locked inNG+ mode so you need to at least finish the game one on Medium or Easy and do a NG+ run to unlock it, some archievments need you to upgrade equipments so if you pretend to get all of them you gonna need to do a NG+ run.\n\nGame doesnt have a leveling system instead you increase your status by finishing quests, I highly recommend you to finish at least some side quests so you wont strugle later on the game as the mosnters get stronger with each passing day, the 5 main quests give a huge boosts and some unique improvements like more slots on consumables itens, more EP points, more ATB bar boost.\n\n And yes the most unique caracteristic that you gonna find in this game(and the most annoying) is the time limit system, you have a total of max 13~14 days(assuming you gonna do a lot of side quests otherwise you gonna end up of even less time)  a new day starts at 6 a.m so you have till next day 6a.m to get everything done before getting pulled back to the Ark, but don't worry a lot of quests are easy to get done by, some of them can be quite annoying and time consuming but depending how efficiently you manage your time you can get by just fine, I myself, finished the 5 main quests by day 7 and around day 12 had almost all side quests done( yes some quest were annoying and I had to use some help to pass by them), it all falls down to abusing the chronostasis skill, as long you can manage your EP to keep it up you will be able to save a lot of time and get all you need done before the final day.\n\n  As I said before Monsters become stronger with the passing days, but they also drop better loot, also they have a limited fixed quantity available for a whole playthrough, something around 100 for the weakest and 30 for the strongest, once you have wiped out this quantity tehy will spawn an Omega(Last One, it will be a purple colored one) version of the monster wich basically is according to the game a reincarnation of all those mosnters soul into a single being, pay attention that tehy will be stronger than the Avarage mosnter and will count as a boss battle, once you have finished the Omega the entire species of that particular mosnter will be considered extinct and will no more spawn, I highly recommend you to save the Omega hunt for the last days as they drop better loot. Now heres a tip to save you some time, some monster DO NOT HAVE AN OMEGA SPAWN so don't waste your time grinding then(Anubis, Gertrude, Desdemonda, the soldiers and fanatics and the Flam in Yusnaan) like I did.\n\nSkills can be combined with the same type to strengthen then, there will be a certain threshold that you gonna hit(an arrow will show on its name), once it happens you gonna need to Lvl then up to keep combining then(they can go up to lvl 5 if I remmeber but dont botther with it on your first play as you gonna be able to only hit max lvl3 or 4, only playing NG+ will make the materials to lvling then available), Leveling skills will become available around day 6 or 7 so start doing it asap when you get down the Ark.\n\n\n Overall Lightning Returns is quite nice I recommend anyone interested to get it on sale if you have played both previous game, in case you didnt get them before them buy Lightning returns in case you liked them, otherwise, don't bother with it.", "timestamp_created": 1543941814, "timestamp_updated": 1543941823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47282285": {"recommendationid": "47282285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389776942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6675, "last_played": 1583127169}, "language": "english", "review": "All good . better than xiii-2 , it was crash every 10 mins", "timestamp_created": 1543873893, "timestamp_updated": 1543873893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47240660": {"recommendationid": "47240660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051961563", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 4890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "playtime_at_review": 2104, "last_played": 1700590579}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don't like the 13 trilogy i wouldn't buy it but being a diehard fan of it i had to.

Waiting for 6p.m to do this, do that before 9p.m. etc etc.\n2) Much less strategic battle system: you setup your classes, and then do the rotation. Yes there is some strat but it's underwhelming.\n3) Only one playable character: this was already one of FFXIII-2 main con, and now it's worst... \n\nOverall, sadly, SE continued its strategy post FFXIII / FFXIV, try to develop games in a more western oriented way, and don't care so much about their fan base... Most of the magic of FFXIII was lost in this game. Sure FFXIII had many flaws, but this was mainly because it was unfinished, and not so much because the game was bad.

All these games have different game mechanics from each other. Also, I'm playing the NG+ because I want to buy the rest of the garbs and upgrade my equipment. So, in the next paragraphs I will talk about the positives and negatives from this game.\n\nFor the positives, I liked a lot how you can prepare different strategies by choosing three garbs, equipment (sword, shield and two accesories) and abilities. Addionally, it's great how you can become more powerful by completing quests, improving your strength, magic and HP. Talking about quests, you can choose then by speaking to NPCs or Chocobocolina, giving you freedom on how you progress during the videogame. Also, the bosses are fairly difficult and you can beat them by using different strategies. Finally, the story is pretty good, but if you want to undertand it, you must play the previous two games (FFXIII-2 more than FFXIII). However, you can play it as a standalone videogame for its game mechanics.\n\nFor the negatives, I didn't like the clock, much more at the beginning. It was a lot of pressure while doing quests and fighting monsters. Although, there is plenty of time to complete almost all the quests. Moreover, it was difficult to fight some monsters early in the game, so I had to choose wisely when to fight them. Nevertheless, it was rewarding when i could beat them.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game, even as a standalone. It has many pros and little cons.

Don\u2019t buy it, don\u2019t rent it and wait for a very deep sale (75%+), but only if you\u2019re a completionist of Final Fantasy games. Also the PC port quality is horrendous for 13 and 13-2. Less so for Lightning Returns.\n\nLet\u2019s make it quick and dirty, shall we? I\u2019m a big fan of JRPGs and of the FF series in general, and I have to say that this game is BAD. It pains me to admit it, but after playing the first 2 games and \u00bd of the third I had to force myself and rush to the ending of Lightning Returns, just for the sake of ticking the damn box and getting over with it. I definitely could not bother with New Game+.\n\nThe most egregious fault by Square Enix was to try and shoehorn an abomination of hybrid action combat system in place of the traditional ATB-based (or turn-based) system of the previous 12 chapters. With the aggravating factor that you mostly control only 1 character at any time, while the other 2 in the party are controlled by the AI and just follow generic patterns (if they are ever present at all, see below), with frustrating results.\nThe second and absolutely horrendous decision was to dramatically reduce the number of spells and actions that each character could theoretically execute in battle (because console controllers have only four buttons to mash, amirite guyses? Did anyone ever mention these weird things called \u201cscrolling menus\u201d????). Forget the classic ATTACK - MAGIC - ITEM - SUMMON - SKILL - WHATEVER list, you now have either a variation of \u201cMash A to Auto select skills\u201d or \u201cPress A for Slash, B for Fire, X for Cure, Y for Potion\u201d. That\u2019s it. And trust me, it is even worse in the first two games since you only choose the classes/jobs you characters are, and then the fight basically plays by itself on auto.\n\nBut hey, at least FF games have epic stories with strong characters, many plot twists and memorable villains? Right? RIGHT? \n\nWRONG\n\nHere is a summary of the shitshow that is this trilogy (SPOILER SAFE):\n\n[b]FF XIII[/b]\nThe first chapter of the trilogy is definitely the worst, considering also the overly-long development time. It is a glorified tutorial at best, and the player is forced through long linear corridor map sections with absolutely no clue of what is going on, without being given even a small hint to understand the plot of the game. For hours and hours. Sometimes the player controls 1 character, sometimes a different couple, sometimes 3 completely different guys, with the only task to move from one mob group to the other, from one cutscene to the next. Oh, and there is no character advancement system whatsoever, up to at least mid-game. Because who needs it in an RPG? That's preposterous!\nThe most insulting thing of them all? Once the corridors end and the first true \u201copen area\u201d is reached, when you are finally given the option to rearrange your party and properly equip it, the final mission starts and THE EFFIN\u2019 GAME ENDS. I had to read a walkthrough guide to be sure that I did not skip most of the game by accident by entering the final dungeon prematurely (\u00e0 la Chrono Trigger). Sadly, I did not make any mistake: the game was really over at that point.\n\n[b]FF XIII-2[/b]\nTake the convoluted and obscure plot of the 1st chapter, throw time travel paradoxes in, remove all the characters you barely knew from FF13, add the most annoying protagonist teen couple ever in the mix and reduce the max number of party members down to 2. And you still get a better game than FF XIII-2! Seriously, they could have done worse only if Square was so lazy to recycle most of the assets again and again from the 1st game on every map\u2026 oh wait\u2026 they actually did it! FF XIII-2 is basically just an asset flip of XIII...\nBut hey, you can collect Pok\u00e9mon in this game! Isn\u2019t it cool?\nAlso, the character advancement system in 13-2 (yes, Square remembered to add one since the beginning this time!) is the worst thing I have experienced in any RPG, ever. You need several external guides just to get a grasp of it, since it is THAT badly documented in-game. It would have been better if Square simply did like in the 1st chapter or forget to implement it at all.\n\n[b]Lightning Returns: FF XIII[/b]\nI must admit this is the most solid game of the trilogy. Or at least the most solid turd of the 3. On the positive side, this time the plot is explained to the player, somehow. The efforts put in to fix the dumpster fires that were 13 and 13-2 are pretty evident the more you progress (although several core game mechanics are still undocumented and oblivious af, which frustrates the player) but Square Enix in his almighty wisdom decided that it was a brilliant idea after the backlash of 13-2 to reduce the max number of party members even further. That\u2019s right! In this game you can control only 1 playable character during the whole story! But you can dress her up and play Barbie Fashion Wheel! Isn\u2019t it wonderful?\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, the whole game is on a death timer: once the 13th in-game day ends, unless you have completed the 5 main plot quests this results in an immediate GAME OVER. Even though you\u2019ll soon learn that the time limit is absurdly lenient (I completed each quest in the game, including optional and secrets, in 7-8 days of in-game time) it is still a very bad design choice, because it puts undue urge on the player and pushes you to skip everything just to get to the objective and save time.

It\u2019s true that I shared a plenty of screenshots and I looked fairly satisfied with the game but that was only icing on the cake. Final fantasy lightning returns is packed with plenty of outfits for lightning, a totally different battle system, 4 interesting locations and tons of sidequests. But, I was fairly disappointed because of this ridiculous time limit placed upon an RPG game. Yes, so in this game you have like 13 days for the game to continue and if you fail to fulfil the tasks its game over. Time is ticking and it was unfair. In the world of this game, 1 second = 1 minute. Eventually you could use special abilities to stop time- most users I have noticed says to use that ability to prolong time (which is like for 2 freaking minutes). Every time I use that ability and after 2 mins I have to use it again. The repetition of the game is way too high and the developer lack of motivation compared to other games is shown here. But, nevertheless the game is well ported, less crashing and smooth FPS. \n\nPros\n\n*Tons of different outfits with special abilities embarked on them. The weapons and garbs in shops may become powerful when you get closer to the judgement day. \n\n*In 2nd playthrough you can use a crystal and replay the game all over again regardless the story line- super effective in gathering ethers and turbo ethers which are needed for the hard bosses. \n\n* Really awesome battle system - shifting from schemata, staggering conditions are really enjoyable. \n\n*4 different locations and tons of sidequests which would make you gather eradia power (EP) which can be used to extend days (max for like 14 days). \n\n*Interesting story line but quite depressing / beautiful artwork and cutscenes. \n\n*With the presence of time, sidequests seems kinda natural.\n\n*Hard monsters and powerful weapons - has Bhunivelze + (Chaos mode) which is considered to be one of the hardest bosses to beat in Final Fantasy - nearly 103 million HP in hard mode. \n\n*Justice was given to Noel (whom i thought would be cast aside in this sequel) \n\n\nCons\n\n*Time limited / you will be transported to the arc everyday at 6 am regardless of whatever you do- literally I defeated Ereshekigal in hard mode in ultimate lair and could NOT pick the drop because OOPS got transported back into the arc -_- \n\n*Spamming choronostasis requires you to kill monsters every second and it\u2019s ridiculous to use it again and again after a short time. \n\n* Zero mouse camera functionality \u2013 requires a controller (mouse cant be used at all) \n\n*After being game over you can keep your stuff and stats, but sidequests would be have to done from the beginning. This make the game very repetitive and it made me bored. \n\n* Lightning is alone most of the time \u2013 having a party of people was more fun. \n\n* Lack of places compared to previous games and a lack of monsters. \n\n*Main quests are way too short. \n\nIt\u2019s important to note that, it\u2019s ridiculous itself to play the game first time in normal mode which would give you a fairly different headache. In the normal mode you have an option to run away from battle if the enemy is hard (which is like 75% of the case) but if you do, you would lose 1 HOUR of your time. This does not apply to the easy mode. But eventually, you would strengthen up and it would be fine. It is a must that you play the game twice at least. The soundtracks are ok- not something to fancy like FFXIII, FFXIII-2 or FF Type 0. For me those games are tons of better than this, more fun and enjoyable. The artwork and cutscenes are flawless as usual. The story has a dark twist, but it leaves you empty.\n\n [h1]Overall, at least after you have beaten the main boss, an opportunity should have been given to play the game without the time limit- with all the side characters in different locations [/h1] \n\nThat is what you call a finale- but in this case, it was a bad finale for FFXIII series.", "timestamp_created": 1537820708, "timestamp_updated": 1559856019, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607027232646942139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44899513": {"recommendationid": "44899513", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975581866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 1296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1296, "last_played": 1538013962}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n-Finally a pretty open world\n-Good mix of side quests\n-Interesting art direction\n-More of an action combat system\n-Enjoyable environments, like the Dead Dunes' temples\n\nCons:\n-Poor story", "timestamp_created": 1537730297, "timestamp_updated": 1537730297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44850931": {"recommendationid": "44850931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328096851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 48792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15272, "last_played": 1569539031}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of my favourite Final Fantasy games, right along side 7 and 3 (Ironic I know). the combat isn't as deep and complex as I'd like but it's satisfying, the story payoff is really nice, and all the customization is GODLY in this game and I love it.

The first game was an utter mess of hallways and handholdy tutorials. The sequel was a massive upgrade from the first game that took fan feedback to heart but had a nonsensical time travelling plot that goes nowhere. LR in the meanwhile is a completely different beast, sporting a new battle system, a time mechanic and only one playable character. Fans hoping for a great final act to the trilogy will be severely disappointed. LR delivers a story so out of left field that it even experiencing the ending left me scratching my head on what exactly happened. Fortunately if you can completely ignore the story and dull characters, you can enjoy some of the finest gameplay yet in the entire Final Fantasy franchise.\n\nThe best part of LR is the gameplay. The auto-battle system in the previous games is completely scrapped in favor of an action game. In LR, you only play and control the protagonist Lightning. Each face button represents a command which drains the stamina or active time bar (ATB). Once out of stamina, Lightning can change wardrobes or garbs which have their own separate commands and ATBs. While Lightning is wearing the active garb, the other two inactive garbs recover ATB. The key to combat is to use commands while cycling from garb to garb to setup some insane hit combos. The combat is snappy, precise and has a high skill ceiling. Part of the combat is knowing which garb commands to use to stagger the enemy and which garbs to use when defending. Players who perfectly time guard and attack commands can block all damage or deal bonus damage respectfully. Defeating the strongest bosses in the game requires an intense focus and mastery of combat almost equivalent to playing a Souls game.\n\nThe garb system is interesting but ultimately not worthwhile. Each garb the Lightning collects can have special commands and attributes thus enticing the player to collect every garb possible. While it sounds great on paper, Lightning can only equip 3 garbs at a time and some of the best garbs are automatically earned by playing through the main storyline or purchased in stores. Most of the garbs in the optional quests and DLC are worse than the garbs you get normally so there is never a chance to wear them unless you want to see Lightning fight in those outfits.\n\nSome of the garbs that Lightning wears are skimpy and revealing. They make zero sense as combat attire and are purely fan service. One specific garb makes Lightning do a sexy pose in the victory screen: Lightning bends down revealing her cleavage and smiles at the player. Also players can choose to add adornments for Lightning such as having her wear a hat, don a mustache or brand a tattoo. This isn\u2019t the first time Square Enix let players \u201cdoll up\u201d a female protagonist, they did the same thing for Yuna with the dress spheres in FFX-2. I\u2019m not against these sexy garbs, but I feel like it\u2019s a sleazy way of getting people to play the game.\n\nThe time system in LR is controversial because the game ends in 7 in-game days. Each gameday lasts exactly 1 real-time hour. After the 7 days have passed, Lightning must face the final boss or can choose to rewind back to the beginning and keeping most of the garbs and stats gained in her journey similar to a rogue-like. However I don\u2019t think LR is meant to be a rogue-like. Completing main story quests extends the game by a day, up to a maximum of 13 days. Time freezes while in menus or in battles. There is also an ability that Lightning can use to freeze time temporarily. With proper time management, I believe most players can complete every single main and side quest and have days to spare. But this is coming from someone who loves optimization and speed running, so your mileage may vary.\n\nThe production value of LR is arguably worse than the other two games. With the exception of Lightning, her garments and some main characters, LR recycles assets from the other two games. Character designs are the same. There is no new memorable music tracks. FMVs recycle scenes from the prior games. There are no new monster designs. Lip syncing is poorly done (which was a similar issue in FFXIII-2). Two of the main areas the Wild Lands and the Dead Dunes are boring open sandboxes. The only bright spot is that the PC port is great, with zero bugs/crashes and offers multiple graphical/display options.\n\nI\u2019ve been avoiding it for most of this review, but it is finally time to talk about the story.\n\nRemember the L\u2019Cie and Fal\u2019Cie from FFXIII? How about all the time paradoxes in FFXIII-2? Well forget about all that because now the FFXIII world is about to end in 7 days because of the Chaos. God has tasked Lightning to save the souls of the remaining humans and bring them into a new world that God will create. Square Enix has gone straight biblical and created their most ridiculous story yet. The story seems wave away everything nonsensical with either the Chaos or God. Why is Hope back and in his younger self? Why is this character back when they were killed/sacrificed in the previous games? Why does Lightning have to take the train to travel from area to area when Hope can warp her out from anywhere?\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that Lightning and Hope are the least likeable characters in the trilogy. Lightning never really displayed any emotion in either of the past two games, but now it becomes exaggerated because she is the only character you play. Hope in the meantime serves as the oracle to Lightning and constantly comments on things that you should pay attention to. This isn\u2019t Bastion-level of narration however, Hope\u2019s comments will drive you crazy and you will eventually be relieved when he finally shuts up. Lumina the antagonist, is the only likeable character in LR. Her appearances add energy to the scenes and actually makes the plot somewhat palatable. She is basically the Joker to Lightning\u2019s Batman. But even Lumina could not buoy this sinking ship of a story.\n\nThe gameplay is the only reason to play LR. Square Enix made the right step with FFXIII-2 only to bungle most of its\u2019 gains with LR. Instead of refining on what made FFXIII-2 great, Square Enix decided to make an action game and completely abandon most of the plot in the previous games. While the action of this game is probably the best in the Final Fantasy series as a whole, everything else about LR feels hastily put together. The story is nonsensical. The characters are not likeable. The dialog is half-baked. Ultimately if you are onboard with the gameplay, I recommend seeing LR to the end, otherwise avoid this game at all costs and just look up the ending if you\u2019re curious about the conclusion to this trilogy.", "timestamp_created": 1537410315, "timestamp_updated": 1537410315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44813530": {"recommendationid": "44813530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280074427", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 8416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8381, "last_played": 1595737295}, "language": "english", "review": "\"This game feels like it was designed to trick weebs into attending church.\"", "timestamp_created": 1537378205, "timestamp_updated": 1579900858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534041821956634521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44774278": {"recommendationid": "44774278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028044564", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 5386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5349, "last_played": 1516308030}, "language": "english", "review": "8.6", "timestamp_created": 1537137888, "timestamp_updated": 1537137888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44756607": {"recommendationid": "44756607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084984043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5606, "last_played": 1689841168}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Final Fantasy Game in A long time.", "timestamp_created": 1537058284, "timestamp_updated": 1537058284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44675231": {"recommendationid": "44675231", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965313675", "num_games_owned": 662, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 12292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11214, "last_played": 1572732428}, "language": "english", "review": "at least no Denuvo, but no mouse support.", "timestamp_created": 1536620864, "timestamp_updated": 1536620864, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445543497800827026", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44674595": {"recommendationid": "44674595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191671602", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3371, "last_played": 1674589839}, "language": "english", "review": "Lightning Returns was probably my most favourite in the Trilogy because I feel like it found a good balance between Exploring the world (or what's left of it) and telling the story, and actually makes side quests feel more rewarding than just \"Hey you did something for me... have a shield\" or something like that, since completing the side quests buffs your stats, only by a small amount buy over time you'll see it add up.

The combat is amazing. It's the best out of any of the Final Fantasy games with the ability to have 3 different combat ready outfits, as well as having the area around the player for them to experiment with.\n\n2. The time requirement is great. Though many people complain that the system has a time requirement, there is more than enough time to be able to do a large portion of the side quests. With there being clock, it also makes the player take an extra step to figure out the timing to get the most out of the time they have.\n\n3. The story is good. While the story is hot for debate on if its 'good' or not, I loved it from Lumina to Fang, the characters have unique characteristics that make me look forward to advancing the story.\n\nAll in all, Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII was a fantastic game that I would recommend, even if you have haven't played XIII or XIII-2.

The FFXIII trilogy is probably the most polarizing game in all of FF; a lot of people hate it and call it the worse than WW2 and that it's a sin to humanity and has contributed to the de-evolution of mankind and never should have been brought into existance, while other people defend it and say that it's not that bad. I went into the trilogy fully aware of the prejudice that faced it and walked away from it pleasently surprised. The second game however was a mess(not to mention the constant crashes and game freezes on PC) that I struggled to keep up with, and the cliffhanger ending only made me more worried for the final game in this 100+ hour trilogy. After numerous failures and successes, can FFXIII finally redeem itself and prove it as a worthwhile investment?\n\nYes. \nOh my god yes.\nI love this game to death and dare I say it's one of the best games I've played in a long time. The combat has recieved a complete overhaul, whereas before the only method of strategy was shifting paradigms and then mashing A until you need to heal or buff, the combat mechanics in LR feel so natural and satisfying. I was thrown off by it at first and it took a good 5-10 hours to get used to, but it feels so intuitive once you understand it. I was uncertain whether I liked only having control of one character, as opposed to in previous games where you could control up to five characters at once. However as I went through the game, Lightning's interesting variety in the moves and techniques she can pull of made her encompassing enough and any more controllable characters would've resulted in a mess.\nA small side note to many but also a relieving factor to others, the soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. Skip this paragraph if soundtrack isn't a make or break desicion for you. The first game had a very orchestrated and what I like to refer to as a \"light vocal\" OST, not really focusing much on melodies and rather just trying to accomplish a certain mood. 90% of the songs from the first soundtrack are just either remixes of \"Blinded by Light\" and \"The Promise,\" which gets very old after a while. The themes that departed from these main two were very catchy and it only made me dissapointed that it played it safe with the melodies they regarded as \"catchy.\" FFXIII-2 on the other hand is a lot more experimental with it's soundtrack, adding a lot of lyrics, synths, and elements from metal, \"Limit Break\" in particular just being straight up screamo-type material. Despite the description, I actually like this soundtrack way more than the first game. It's a lot more unique and unorthidox and it gives the game a very distinguished feel. While yes, a good chunk of the tracks are remixes of the main theme, \"A Wish,\" that's just to be expected from FF. That being said, this soundtrack still struggles a lot with identity, and being experimental by nature some of the tracks are just going to sound noticably lower quality. A lot of songs from the first game are also reused in this one, and whenever your fighting a giant robot from the future with techno music blaring in the background and then it cuts to an orchestrated field theme, the shift is very noticable and awkward. FINALLY after getting that out of the way I can talk about LR's soundtrack. This game has finally found a proper tone for it's soundtrack. It's the best out of the three(obviously my opinion). It mixes the two previous styles together in a way that feels natural; heavy violin pieces are complemented with a prominent, almost-metalic sounding percussion. There are still pieces that are fully orchestrated, like \"Divine Love,\" but they still feel like they fit because the rest of the soundtrack doesn't ostracize them. Even ones that I didn't like when first listening too, like \"High Voltage,\" grew on me quickly after I sat down and noticed all the piano elements in this otherwise fully synth song. In summary: it's good.\nNow the part that the FFXIII series is known in infamy for: plot and linearity. The first game had an absolutely confusing first few chapters which bombared the player with unknown terms and lore without really explaining what any of them all, after that though, I felt the game was fairly standard, the only issue being the writing and dialogue was god awful. None of the characters can convey the seriousness of the situation, and plot points that are vital to the story aren't translated with proper intensity. While I defend the first game's story, I can't really say the same for XIII-2. The story is an absolute mess and all it does is unnecessarily further complicate the first game's story. They could've just made a game about life on Pulse and having to live with the fal'Cie there, but nooooo they just had to add their OCs Noel and Caius into the game and make a completely different story which has basically nothing to do with the first game outside of characters. Finally we arrive at Lightning Returns once again, and thank god it's a breath of fresh air after the second game. The story- get this- actually makes sense this time. I didn't need to constantly read some stupid datalog to understand what was happening in the game, and the progression feels natural which is especially noteworthy because of the game's nonlinear gameplay(more on that later). The writing feels forceful and there's enough gameplay between major plotpoints to actually make it feel like this is *your* story, not you witnessing someone elses.\nFinally the last point, and probably the most imfamous. I'm sure you've heard the memes about FFXIII's \"hallway simulator,\" and the devs took note of those complaints and made XIII-2 less linear, but it still felt like you were stuck on a certain path with very little variation through playthroughs. Lighting Returns abandons all sense of linearity by dropping you into a world and giving you complete control of where you want to go. It's amazing. There are four main continents and you can go to any of them right off the bat. Each one has it's own main story quest which again, you can choose which ones you want to do first, and then one final story quest which takes place in all 4 continents, followed by the scripted ending sequence and final boss. The game no longer feels like a half-assed adventure game with limited movement options and uninteresting environments. The four main continents of LR are super detailed and filled with things to do and your movement feels very natural and actually fits the gameplay. There's so much freedom it's almost overwhelming at the beginning of the game, and it's up to you to ease yourself in and learn how things work. Lightning Returns also features an in-game real time clock of limited time, similar to that of Majora's Mask, meaning that you have a certain amount of time to complete all the story quests or else it's back to the beginning for you. While this may sound like a negative aspect, a raincloud always looking over your head, after a while you realize how semi-easy it is to gain more time and control the little you have left and make the most of it. That's probably what I love the most about this game: no two playthroughs are ever the same. There are over 100 sidequests to do as well as the many different paths you can take to complete each story mission. It makes the player feel involved as a character in this world, exploring it at their own pace and deciding the path they want to go down.\nTL;DR\nI'm assuming most of you jumped here so I'll keep it short like I promised\n+In-depth and diverse combat system(easy to learn, hard to master)\n+Nonlinear story and exploration\n+Amazing and atmospheric soundtrack\n-Still a FFXIII game(semi-confusing plot and characters that can feel dry at times)\nbuy this game with money", "timestamp_created": 1527510711, "timestamp_updated": 1527510711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42173736": {"recommendationid": "42173736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048623723", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 170, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1526977037}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]If you don't own a controller...

There should be one stating \"A controller is [i]absolutely neccessary[/i] to play.\"\n\nImagine the worst pc-port from a console game you have ever seen. Assuming that's something disgustingly awful, make it two times worse and you'll get Lightning Returns.

In Lightning Returns, it's just impossible. You'd need one hand to move, one hand to control the camera (can't do it with mouse) and one more hand to fight -- and that's if you rebind most of the commands to your \"liking,\" while also moving one or two hands to different areas of your keyboard every few seconds.\n\nThis is so stupid... when will they learn? If they wanna sell this stuff to PC players, they should adapt it to PC. I had my eyes on Nier: Automata, now I'm just gonna skip over it. Console games on PC, never again.\n\nIt's sad, because FFXIII 1 and 2 were the worst two FF games I've ever played, and the third (according to reviews) promised to be better. But the saddest thing is I bought the entire trilogy more than a year ago, played the first two, left the third game for later, and now I can't refund it.\n\n100% wasted money on this one.\n\n\n(P.S: In Lightning Returns your mouse-pointer shows during the game, and if you move it to the top of the screen you even get an action bar with some nonsensical options in it.

The fact that the combat system completely relied on the idea of breaking your foe before you did any significant damage to them was also a major hinderance and made even the most minor of battles a chore to complete.\n\n\nThe story:\n\nAt the very least, 13-2 connected itself to the previous game, albit with a VERY LOOSE plot device. \n\nLightning Returns caused me to feel lost from the very beginning. I had no idea why Lightning was suddenly the god of this game's errand girl outside of the fact that it apprently claimed that if Lightning did what it asked that it would give her sister's soul back to her. Beyond that, there was absolutely no connection to the previous games.\n\nWhat little story there was both made me go \"What the actul fuck is going on here?!\" While simaltaniously ticking me off by throwing out any and all character development the characters had from the past two games.\n\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nI could dub this game \"Final Fantasy 13-Sidequest Edition\" and anyone who played this game would immedately get the joke but I'll be more detailed.\n\nYou start out of the gate with a time limit, okay not a great start but not horrid but then you find out that the way to \"save\" people is by accepting their quest and completing mundane after mundane quest. Occasionaly you'd have to fight your way to collect a Key Item for a quest but for the most part it was running from NPC A to NPC B or go to this location here for item.\n\nHowever this is only the tip of the iceberg...\n\nRemember that time limit I meationed? Yeah, you have a very limited time to complete these mundane sidequests and there is no quick travel system for the most part so time gets drained fast doing even one of these quests. You would need a FAQ with detailed information if you want to make the most effective use of your daily time limit and get the best ending.\n\nOh the the kicker? You start off with only 6 days until the game litterally ends and if you don't collect enough etro(currancy for more time in this game basically) and do the 4 core storylines, you get the bad ending by default. You can eventually extend this time limit up to 13 days but without a detailed FAQ, you're definately not gonna accomplish this.\n\nOverall, the gameplay in Lightning Returns is boring if not frustrating to deal with at times.\n\nGraphics:\n\nHow do I put this?\n\nIt felt like they were downgraded? Like, the only true detail is in the multiple garments you can collect and everything else looks like it was fresh out a of PS2 era game.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nLightning Returns plays, looks, and feels like the developers gave up on making this game half-way through and tossed it to their B-Team to finish while they went off to make Final Fantasy XV. If you enjoy this style of gameplay and combat then you probaly won't hate this game that much but if you're like me:\n\nYou'll feel disappointed if not appalled that a game like this is tied to the \"Final Fantasy\" name.", "timestamp_created": 1526320930, "timestamp_updated": 1526321041, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49328044056892395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42024509": {"recommendationid": "42024509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044455910", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1519590079}, "language": "english", "review": "combat system is nothing like the previous 2 games in the trilogy.  you play one character instead of a party of 3", "timestamp_created": 1526241013, "timestamp_updated": 1526241013, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399038463830947876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41877710": {"recommendationid": "41877710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133980596", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1692492119}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1525568790, "timestamp_updated": 1525568790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41844319": {"recommendationid": "41844319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128171276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1523411193}, "language": "english", "review": "Final Fantasy Fo Life XD", "timestamp_created": 1525431548, "timestamp_updated": 1525431548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490969151258468628", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41780673": {"recommendationid": "41780673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055320714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1522700142}, "language": "english", "review": "So the story's going where?

Sure i could google it and figure out what to do next, but it shouldnt be that hard to figure out.\n\nWithin the year that i put the game down, i started moving away from using a controller in pc gaming and went to mouse/keyboard controls. The m/k controls for this game a are a joke. it removes the use of a mouse and wants you to play the game with both hands on the keyboard. never played a game with controls like that, and wasnt going to start with this game.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed XII-1 and XII-2, but this falls way short.

Literally for some reason all the other main quests are nice and interesting, but somehow the dialogue and cutscenes in this one questline are just super bad. They just say the most awkward things and the angles are way too zoomed in for some reason. It is also one of the most boring ones: you have to just walk around a city and find a bunch of people. \nLiterally all the other quests are pretty good.\n\n- How to turn the time limit into something fun:\n\nDo all the other stuff you want while SPAMMING Chronostasis. The game is meant to be played with that on, and you can get infinite Chronostasis as long as you know where the big dudes are. Kill big dudes, look up how to easily do so, and pause time until you're happy with what you accomplished in the day. I did this without much thinking and had like 3 days remaining with basically nothing to do. Once you get in the rhythm you'll feel motivated to do as much stuff as you can instead of feel like it is forced on you (since it's really not, we just feel like that because we usually play JRPGs in a certain way).\n\nOverall, great game if you don't go in expecting the traditional JRPG. The ending is epic as all hell and makes up a lot of wrong that FF13 and FF13-2 brought. (FF13-2's taint still seeped through though. Some dumb stuff happens that is connected to that game's lore but oh well.)\nRewarding combat, interesting mechanics, ok story, lots of armor and skills to try. Gameplay wise very good actually. Suffers a bit in other aspects but hell, it is a lot of fun.\n\nOh and consider using JP voices if you are very distracted by bad dialogue scripts.

But I found it to be really fun. Maybe not what you expect from a Final Fantasy, but it is a worthwhile game.\n\nMy only dislike for LR was the small feeling world, while it's not super tiny, it just felt lacking to me, as did the previous 2 games. There isn't much to explore and while they explain that in the story I feel like that's still a bit of an excuse. The time manipulation was at first difficult to work with but after you learn which enemies give the greatest boost its almost a pointless and slightly annoying feature. \n\nMy favorite part is the combat. It is engaging and interesting, you get outfits and equipables much like old school Final Fantasy that determine your abilities and spells. It's a good mix of new and old. \n\nThe story is very interesting, the old main cast makes appearances and are part of the story.

Despite being an epilogue, this game stands on its own, and giving closure to the FF13 trilogy isn't the actual point of the game.\n\nThis game's true value lies in 2 things - its absolutely amazing combat system, and its side quests. Yes, those things you need to do to get stronger in any way, shape, or form. If you're the kind of gamer to skip dialogue, why in the hell are you buying an RPG? Dialogue is everything in RPGs, especially in this game. I got more enjoyment out of discovering the tragic backstories of random NPCs in this game than I did watching any blockbuster film released nowadays.\n\nSpeaking of the combat system, it's completely tight. This is THE combat system that should have stayed in the series. It's even better than KH combat, and that's saying something. While it's unfortunate that the game doesn't recognize mouse controls, using the numpad works perfectly well.\n\nGet this game while it's on sale - and you won't regret it.

In this installment, a few hundred years have passed since then, although people have stopped aging.\n2.\tSeveral Characters from the Past Two Games in the Series Will Appear\nYoshinori Kitase spoke about who may appear this time around and what happened beforehand during their Final Fantasy XIII adventures.\n\n3.\t The In-Game Clock is Constantly Running\nSince the in-game world is slowly reaching its end, a clock is constantly counting down while you play. As you run around and navigate each locale you venture into, this \u201cDoomsday Clock\u201d continues to ticker down until it hits its final time and signals the end of the world and Lightning. The timer starts out at seven in-game days, but it can be upgraded to feature a maximum of 13 days.\n\n4.\tLightning is the Only Playable Character\nLightning is going to take up the bulk of this end-of-the-world journey that\u2019s been thrown her way. She\u2019s the sole character that gamers will control and take into battle.\n\n5.\tLightning Can Change Into Different Costumes in Battle to Change Her Fighting Style and Stats.\nOne of the newest features of this entry in Lightning\u2019s ability to change into different costumes in battle. These costumes not only offer players a cosmetic change to their customized version of Lightning, they offer different weapon/ability setups.\n\n6.\tLightning\u2019s Stats are Increased Through the Completion of Quests\nBy completing the long list of main game story missions and side quests that players will take on, Lightning\u2019s overall statistics will grow and improve over time. This direct effect on Lightning means finishing man quests gives her the best upgrades while side quests provide her with minimal but substantial stat boosts.\n\n7.\tThe Battle System is Being Dubbed the \u201cStyle-Change Active Time Battle System\u201d\nThe enemies that Lightning will encounter can be seen as players journey around the open field in each world. These creatures and other types of enemies can be attacked before battle, buy they can also directly attack her. Either the enemy you attacked loses a portion of their health or Lightning will lose some of her\u2019s.\n\n8.\tA New In-Game Feature Called Outworld Communication is Making Its Debut\nOne of the newer features that\u2019s being introduced in Lightning Returns is something referred to as Outworld Communication. Players can take in-game photos and share them on their social networks (Facebook and Twitter). They can also share their customized Lightning\u2019s personal stats and battle scores.\n", "timestamp_created": 1521676272, "timestamp_updated": 1521676272, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.368425607681274414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40948426": {"recommendationid": "40948426", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976296273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 3035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1635629811}, "language": "english", "review": "Kind of the worst bits of Majora's Mask and Dark Souls.

It's fluid, engaging, challenging and skillful but retains many of the tropes that come with the series - like the elemental magic attacks with silly names. It's totally different from anything they've done in the past and the game is [i][b]totally carried by it.[/b][/i]\n\nYou can also play dress up with Lightning in a manner that recalls the old Job system from FF:Tactics, minus the extended grind. Good times.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\nThe story is ludicrous, melodramatic and at times downright nonsensical, and the world they've created is kind of bland and dull. It's a testiment to the power of cinema that the cutscenes combined with the fantastic soundtrack can still draw a tear to the eye over such complete and utter garbage.\n\nAnd the English voice acting, as has been standard for the XIII trilogy, is distractingly bad. (JP audio is available)\n\n[h1]The Unusual[/h1]\n\nLightning Returns should have been titled Lightning Returns: Majora's Mask. Your entire playthrough is on a clock (which there are ways to temporarily stop), the time for which can be extended by completing quests.\n\nThe entire game is totally non-linear.

XIII-2 is a complete waste of time and Lightning Returns is only really notable for having better gameplay. These games take upwards of 40 hours to complete and for most people are simply a waste of time.\n\nThe nostalgia is real, but FF6 through to 10 are all much better, much more charming games, and the series has gone downhill since (not including XV which I haven't played yet).\n\nIf, on the other hand, you're a hardcore Final Fantasy Fanatic or are dying of curiosity and jonesing for some hot chocobo action, then go for it!", "timestamp_created": 1519901500, "timestamp_updated": 1519904707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802712500095367432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40367791": {"recommendationid": "40367791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320822250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1054, "last_played": 1638532041}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a JRPG released by Sqaure Enix and it's Final Fantasy, need I say more??\n\n    LIGHTNING RETURNS\u2122: FINAL FANTASY\u00ae XIII, is the next *real* installemnt after Final Fantasy XII (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcXII Fainaru Fantaj\u012b Tuerubu), the Final Fantasy game that was released in 2006. For years on end now, the FINAL FANTASY games have seemingly stood at the pinnacle of all JRPG's making this series even a MoRe fav of mine. BUT, it is a drastic change from Final Fantasy XII, since it abandons a number of well-loved game mechanics, in order to see to a more \"straight-forward\" approach. I myself know multiple people that aren't happy with the changes in XIII, but for me, I actually quite enjoyed the entirety of the game, since it was a little less complicated. Even with all the changes, the game is still FINAL FANTASY, with the battle system and narrative still remaining stunning as it always has. \"In Final Fantasy XIII, players take control of six different characters with the sharp-eyed Lightning taking the \"lead role.\" Although the game does tend to stress Lightning as the primary heroine, Final Fantasy XIII is reminiscent of Final Fantasy VI in that you control all the characters at different times and you jump between the groups frequently. This multi-story approach, as well as a clever use of flashbacks, makes Final Fantasy XIII's story quite enjoyable, at least in terms of its structure.\"-(IGN)\n\nWithout wasting TOO much of your time, the final verdict from IGN is: Final Fantasy XIII is a great JRPG and sports a fast-paced, challenging, satisfying battle system. The game also boasts an intricate story, a likeable cast of characters and the best visuals in the series yet (of course).\n\nBut hardcore Final Fantasy fans might be disappointed by the game's abandonment of franchise traditions like open worlds, town exploration and complex mini-games.

The storyline it follows is as excellent as the previous two XIII titles, however here there is a timer of about one week and if the story is not completed within the timer, it resets back at the beginning but with the same stats Lightning obtained during that time, which means with each reset the story becomes easier, at the end all of the characters from the whole storyline meet again together.", "timestamp_created": 1518862889, "timestamp_updated": 1673860524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485822916030883789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40144568": {"recommendationid": "40144568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052374086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2271, "last_played": 1591767198}, "language": "english", "review": "- - -[ Audience: ] - - -\n\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2610 Pro players\n\n- - - [ Graphics/Animation: ] - - -\n\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Really bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 OK\n\u2611 Good \n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n- - - [ Price/quality: ] - - -\n\n\u2610 Free\n\u2610 Full price\n\u2611 Wait for sale\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Don't do it\n\n- - - [ Requirments: ] - - -\n\n\u2610 90' PC\n\u2610 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium \n\u2611 Fast\n\u2610 High end \n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [ Difficulty: ] - - -\n\n\u2610 You just need 2 arms \n\u2610 Ez\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master \n\u2611 Hard\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n- - - [ Game time/length ] - - -\n\n\u2610 Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n\u2610 Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n\u2610 Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n\u2611 Long ( 12+ hours)\n\u2610 Endless\n\n- - - [ Story] - - -\n\n\u2610 It doesn't have\n\u2610 Still better than Twilight\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n- - - [ Bugs ] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Bugs destroying the game\n\u2610 Lot of bugs\n\u2610 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2611 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n- - - [ Others: ] - - -\nMultiplayer: No\nSingleplayer: Yes", "timestamp_created": 1518839203, "timestamp_updated": 1518839203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 360, "votes_funny": 50, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843790054321289063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40123028": {"recommendationid": "40123028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119459437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1510362125}, "language": "english", "review": "Terrible", "timestamp_created": 1518778744, "timestamp_updated": 1518778744, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.202850490808486938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40113703": {"recommendationid": "40113703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073711594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1884, "last_played": 1517109529}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it on Xbox360.

[spoiler]Serah is dead[/spoiler], and chaos is rampant. Everyone, including old friends and enemies, have stopped aging, however they are still able to die, but not reproduce. Not only has this lead to the population decreasing drastically, the chaos running rampant has also lead to the end of the world, which will take place in only a matter of days. Bhunivelze is planning to create a new world, and it is your job as his servant to save as many souls as possible before time runs out, so that they can pass over safely  into the new world. If Lightning succeeds, Bhunivelze has promised that as a reward [spoiler] Serah will be brought back to life[/spoiler]. However, when the mysterious character Lumina (who bears a striking resemblance to Serah) appears, Lightning starts to realize that (as usual) things aren't quite as simple as they seem.\n\n\n Gameplay:\nThe old paradgim (party) system has been thrown out the window, and has been replaced with a fighting system where you only control Lightning. You are able to have three active schemas (equipment setups) at a time, that you can switch between freely during combat. In addition to weapons and equipment you can also assign up to four abilities to each schema. For example you might have one schema with equipment and abilities focused mainly on dealing damage, another one that focuses on tanking, and a third one focusing on buffing/debuffing. The medic class (and its abilities) has been completely removed, and in this time healing is mainly done by using items.\n\nThe fighting this time around is much more action oriented, since you have to switch between schemas and use the correct abilities in real-time whenever your action (energy) bars has full. You also have the ability to move around on the battlefield, however there was only one boss fight where I actually had to move (away from the boss), so you can pretty much just ignore this feature.\n\nThe only way to level up is to complete quests, so unlike the previous two games there is no penalty for avoiding fights. Monsters often drop abilities (which can be leveled up if you find duplicates), so there is [i]something[/i] to gain from fighting them, but if you don't want to fight random mobs then you don't have to.\n\nAs the world is about to end you are on a timer, and if you don't finish all the main quests (and a decent amount of side quests if you are going for the best ending) within the time limit, you will get a game over. Losing a fight will deduct an hour from your remaining time (unless you're playing on easy), however there are ways to extend the time limit, and also a way to freeze time (temporarily), so the timer was never really an issue for me. However, some NPCs that you have to talk to during a quest only appear during specific times of the day, which eventually got [b]very[/b] annoying, as you would have to return to the same place at different times of the day just so you could hand in quests to all the time-specific NPCs.\n\nGraphics:\nIt might just be because the port is not very good, or because the world in Lightning Returns is very open with many NPCs walking around, but the game looked way worse than the previous two games. However the CG cut-scenes look as beautiful as ever.\n\nLength:\nAnother complaint I have is regarding the length of the game. I'm sort of glad that I didn't have to grind as much this time around, but even after extending the time limited to the max the game still felt a bit short, especially compared to the first game of the trilogy. Apparently you're suppose to do multiple playthroughs, but there really is no reason to play through the game more than once (other than upgrading your equipment)...\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, while Lightning Returns is in my opinion the weakest FFXIII game, I still enjoyed it, and if you have already finished the first two then you should also finish the third one, just to see how Lightning's story ends.", "timestamp_created": 1518224430, "timestamp_updated": 1518225238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39877299": {"recommendationid": "39877299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048202411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1541, "last_played": 1539697637}, "language": "english", "review": "truth is i only play this ,because of Lightning and i have been playing the cracked version so many times that i went on buying it on steam .\n\n\nanywho amazing game and storyline .", "timestamp_created": 1517875114, "timestamp_updated": 1517875114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453774631023406982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39842195": {"recommendationid": "39842195", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985946815", "num_games_owned": 1362, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 8205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6809, "last_played": 1518880536}, "language": "english", "review": "A great ending for the trilogy, it would be nice to see more like these in the future. The game is very fun and it runs flawlessly on non-gaming laptop.\n\nAlmost permanent 30fps (I'm fine with that), dropping to 15-20 in intense battle with lots of spells going on at once, but it recovers fast. 0 crashes, freezes or any other kind of issue at all, and works perfectly with my PS4 controller (and thanks to some very kind people, you can download a patch to see PS controller icons in the game). This is definitely a lesson in how to port a game (I'm looking at you Bandai-Namco).\n\nThe story is great, combat is awesome and it has a deep crafting system, very rewarding to engage in. About the clock... on the one hand it's very well designed the fact that many quests are timed and you need to plan ahead to use time efficiently. On the other... the fact that there's a limited amount of time to play punishes the player for exploring. I like to take my time and enjoy the desing of the different locations, how the atmosphere is different as you explore the world, and finding the many detail and fan service gimmicks scattered all over the world. And yet there is a clock permanently running forward and urging me not to stop to enjoy the view, and rather just ignore everything and push forward. \nOn the bright side if you use your time well you will have plenty of time to spare at the end to do all the exploring you want (I certainly did), but it's not the same if you have already seen it.\n\nIt also has great replay value, by adding a Hard mode and NG+ where you keep most of your stuff.

LIGHTNING RETURNS set out to fix the main issues people had with XIII and XIII-2, namely the linearity. And what it attained came at a great cost. You see, XIII was a beautiful game with an interesting cast of characters, decent to good customization and an incomprehensible storyline plagued by linearity. XIII-2 was a beautiful, less linear game with an interesting cast of characters, decent to good customization, pretty good gameplay features (the time-travel thing was quite cool) and a still incomprehensible storyline that barely worked to keep the game together.\n\nLIGHTNING RETURNS throws most of this off the window from the get-go by being the ugliest Final Fantasy game in existence. While the main character models (reused from previous games) are beautiful, there's not a single location that could be considered pleasing to the eye, something I believe comes from a severely limited graphical engine that wasn't made for open environments. And they did create open environments in a failed attempt to get rid of linearity: The game is lousy with sidequests and huge, open areas that are full of nothing. Every single task in the game consists of traversing one huge place or another, all of them full of monsters and none of them visually pleasing or interesting at all. To rub salt on the wound, the sidequest system is pretty bad, since sidequests are tied directly to character advancement (thus making them basically mandatory), most make little sense, and their design is lacking - you get either fetch quests that involve running from an end to the world to the other to somewhere else while the clock ticks against you (there's a time limit on this game, yay!), kill quests that are pretty much \"kill ten rats,\" and annoying, time-sensitive quests that require you to be at a certain place at a certain time, sometimes three days in a row. In some cases, the side-quest are a mixture of all three for added fun.\n\nOn top of the botched sidequest system, there's the fact that there's no character progression system at all besides it, and the sidequests offer no customization whatsoever - so your stats are basically set, except for what you equip. And while equipment does make a huge impact on your stats (most of your stats will come from equipment,) there's something hollow to changing jobs so quickly and easily and not having a chance whatsoever to build your own character as you see fit on an RPG. Sure, Final Fantasy has often had this - FFVII got by on materia alone, for example - but all the other system felt more impactful than this. LIGHTNING RETURNS's customization consists basically of hunting the clothes you want, the weapons you want, and praying that you get enough drops of a magic item to be able to upgrade it. It feels shallow, severely limited, and it's not at all satisfying. And then, of course, monsters become stronger as you do so even if you complete every single task you'll still face annoying enemies with far too much health to be fun by the end of the game.\n\nAnd then, after the horrible graphics, horrible sidequests, no customization and the lack of a likable protagonist (Lightning is as dull a character as they come, and easily the worst main character in FFXIII), there's the storyline. The writers of FFXIII, who you likely remember were on crack all through the process of writing FFXIII and FFXIII-2, come back for thirds, this time doing krokodil! The storyline is, as we've come to expect from such a talented group of storytellers, absolutely impossible to understand (although I'll give them kudos in that it's a bit easier to grasp than the previous two,) completely uninteresting, and told mostly in a series of endless expository conversations that would have any writer worth their salt shaking in disgust. In the end you're given no reason to care about anything of what's going on, turning the game into a series of uninteresting missions in an ugly, uninteresting world.\n\nI played through this whole game because I didn't want to abandon it as I generally love Final Fantasy. But you? You don't have to even begin it. Stay away from this - I know the ending of FFXIII-2 was a cliffhanger but, trust me, you're better off making up your own resolution to the story than spending dozens of hours going through this. There's nothing redeemable here.\n\nOh, wait, there IS one redeeming quality: Of the trilogy, this one has the best PC port.

I have mixed feelings but I also enjoyed the journey. \n\nLR XIII is tottally different than the prequels. It's more like an ARPG. But I've liked that and the combat system too (kinda similar to the dresspheres in X-2). There is enough room for customization even tho I mostly played the whole game with the same 3-5 garbs. \n\nThe DLC garbs are all included with this release and it's up to you to use them or not. 2 of them are really really strong. The SOLDIER 1st Class (Cloud from FFVII) garb has Heavy Slash Lv. 2 locked from the beginning. Really good up until to around 10-15 hours or so when you can buy the Hunter of the Wild which has Lv. 3 of the same ability. Much better.\nThe other one is the Spira's Summoner (Yuna from FFX) which has Elementa Lv. \u2605 locked from the beginning. This is incredibly strong, like pretty much game breaking I used this through the whole game. Once again it's up to your decision to use it or not.\n\nWell the story is... it didn't really help to make the whole XIII trilogy clear and better but that was kinda expected after XIII-2. There is a nice closure which actually reminded me to both FFVII and FFVIII. And the after credits cutscene is one of the best in the whole franchise. It's like how a good book ends. Wish I can tell it but that would be too much spoiler.\n\nSo yeah this is it. It was a good ride and once again I actually enjoyed all the games. The story is the only problem as it is not as clear as it could have been, there are too many twists and turns, plotholes etc. But in the end the FF feeling is there. After finishing this game and watching the ending movie I've felt the same FF \"epicness\" as before. And this is good. I didn't feel this after XIII or XIII-2 but that's because the story was not over when you finished those game. For that alone I recommend to play this game.\n\nAnd last: you can get the games for so cheap (at least on PC) that I highly recommend a total playthrough. I mean it's a good 150 hours or so to beat the 3 games.

The end of the series. Alright let's get started.\n\nFirst off I want to mention I played all 3. 13 and 13-2 I played on PS3 so don't go checking my profile for them. Second I want to say FF13 is a series for a \"aquired taste\". Meaning it's story is heavily realistic in terms of the information you have and what you learn through the game. There is puzzle fitting because they don't just show cutscenes of what the villian is doing all the time or flat out explain things. I don't suggest this game to people who want a deep story and no effort to uncover.\n\nPros:\n>Great Combat system(like White Knight Chronicles and FFCrysisCore had a baby). Stagger rework is abit annoying but it's nice melee and magic can stand on their own without stagger. The fights don't focus on stagger.\n>So far I have seen only one waste of a skill slot, however I'm not post game so what do I know. Tons of skills and outfits to shuffle through. The DLC outfits are nice too though imo Summoner and Cloud is broken early game(until you meet element obsorbing enemies atleast).\n>New game+ exists(this is a pro for the fact that the game has a time limit).\n>Controls feel nice and very responsive\n>Story is fairly light on details and doesn't require as much digging(for those who complained about 13-1).\n>Time doesn't continue as you fight, talk to NPC or while in your menu. There are options to save time as well.\n>EXP was eliminated and you get stat bonuses from completing missions. Mobs drop items frequently as well as skills.\n>Item pouch limitation doesn't feel too drastic(I'm on normal mode). I heard alot of bad about it however you get Guard early and have the tools to sustain as Medic Guard drops pretty early as well as you get the EP Skill Curaga(2 slots).\n>EP system basically lets you build a special bar that transfers over fights and out of them. You can use it to stop time, full heal yourself, teleport places or even to give you a edge in fights by slowing time or refill your ATB on all 3 outfits.\n>Time doesn't move too fast and not too slow.\n>Story has retained it's mystery as even the people you talk to have interesting things to say about their history and time being immortal.\n>SPRINT BUTTON!!!\n\nCons:\n>Subpar graphics even on the max settings. I know it's a 2015 game however many textures(particularly walls) could have looked better(many cases the props stick out because they look better than the ground/walls). Blending is important.\n>Mistakes can lead to punishment even I find brutal. You'll probably be playing through a few times as missing a day without doing a good amount of a Main Quest can hurt. The main quest in Yusaan took me 3days because I made a mistake on the first day. With this out the way it's suggested you work on 2 places at once.\n>EP meter building requires strong enemies. Some enemies (Like Dryad) are kinda cancerous and give nothing for EP building. However minibosses give 2-3 bars. This leads to skipping most small mobs as their rewards are only good for quests and money drops outside afew Skills. However I've only been to 3/5 places. Maybe it'll change for the last 2.\n>Lightning moves slow in combat only walking, making it fairly easy to be cornered. You can't control the Evade direction and sometimes it makes things worse. I know why they did it, however it's annoying.\n>The camera can work against you in close combat.\n>Mouse support is a meme at this point isn't it?\n\nPersonal gripes\n>Some quests are insanely vague and easy to fail. One quest told me to come back tomorrow. I came back for 2 days and he told me to return tomorrow. I skipped one day and failed the quest. He should have said \"returned on the forth day\" not \"return tomorrow\" until I didn't. Unless that's the quest. If it is I'm sorry. Same for getting alcohol for the guy for fireworks quest. They tell you what the place is called but it's not a marked location so you have to search around until you find the NPC who will sell it. It would be easier if there was a sign on the place or something. I don't even need a way point.\n>Sometimes mobs spawn inside Lightning and get a surprised attack without you being able to react.\n>ATB management is a chore when trying to attack and defend against multiple(4+) mobs at the same time. I get stuck at like 5%-20% with all 3 in some fights.\n>Randomly resets your graphic settings to default when closing the game.\n>graphic settings are on the top of the window like a Emulator.\n\nOverall I think it's a great game. If you like FF13 story give it a shot. If you really enjoy combat systems similar to Crysis Core, why not? The game is fairly well done even though as a port it could be better.

Having replayed FFXIII (even though in the past, I absolutely loved it) I can see why FFXIII series is flawed. Very flawed. But if you\u2019ve never played any FFXIII game, I suggest this out of the whole series. The only bad part is story-wise you\u2019d be confused, but I\u2019m still lost myself as I played the first 2 anyway. (This review will contain some spoilers but I\u2019ll put a warning.) \n\nBut this game is honestly the best out of the series. The combat has evolved so much and it\u2019s way better than the first two. (Way better than the first one for sure where you can just press auto-Battle 30 times.) You can do a mini-riposte once you guard at the right time and stagger the enemy, a key element to the FFXIII combat. Also, it seems a lot more fluid and a lot more strategic. Of course, it\u2019s not perfect, but the battle system for a turn-based combat is probably one of the best. \n\nAlso one of the cooler things in this game is that there\u2019s so much customization. It\u2019s nifty and cute. I love a lot of Lightning\u2019s accessories and outfits. Makes the game even more interesting to play. \n\n~Spoiler-ish warning~\n\nI haven\u2019t finished the game yet but I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun with the story. Mostly the side-quest mission stories. It seems like this game was put with way more effort into the quest system since they heard that the first game lacked any. I\u2019m not one to even like side/fetch quests, but they all have a nice story to them that it\u2019s worth it. Also, it kinda even plays into your gameplay too, so it\u2019s RECOMMENDED to do the quests. If it not for that, I probably would have never done them at all. I\u2019m just not that into side quests, but LR:FFXII does a fantastic job on that. My only gripe is that a lot of these quests are at certain times to complete and it gets kinda annoying when I finish one quest and I can\u2019t even find the person because they\u2019re not there at that certain time. \n\nAs for the story, it\u2019s so damn confusing. It\u2019s not super friendly to those who joined in even with the Datalog in the game to keep you updated, but there\u2019s also a lot of plot holes that still aren\u2019t explained. The first game was about the characters turning into a L\u2019Cie (human[{?} I use this lightly because they are kinda immortal] who are able to wield Magic as many the humans weren\u2019t able to.)  They had a Focus and once they completed that focus, L\u2019Cie would then turn into Crystal. (Which happened to Serah, Vanille, and Fang in the first game as she fulfilled her prophesy.) but the weird part is Vanille and Fang woke up from their crystal state in the beginning of FFXIII and then they were crystallized at the end and THEN AGAIN they were woken up in the 3rd game. It\u2019s so confusing. So what is the purpose of the L\u2019Cie branding anymore? Do they have different focuses now? It\u2019s because in the end of the first game too, Lightning, Hope, Sazh, and Snow has L\u2019Cie branding. And if they didn\u2019t complete their focus, they\u2019d turn into these monsters called \u201cC\u2019ieths\u201d. They pretty look like an ugly crystallized monster with no soul/mind. But then once they finished in the first game, their branding were gone but in this game SNOW HAS IT AGAIN. But Lightning and Hope don\u2019t. I\u2019m so confused! There\u2019s so much more too but it just makes this world so much more confusing that I kinda don\u2019t follow the main story so much anymore. The side quests have a better way of telling their own story that I follow that instead. \n\nAnyway, if anyone out there can explain it better to me, I\u2019d much appreciate it because I actually liked the story of the first game. The second kinda ruined it for me but I know what happened. \n\n\nAs a TL;DR, here\u2019s the break down:\nPros:\nCombat\nCustomization \nSide quests\nCharacters (kinda. I love the English voice actor for Lightning [unpopular opinion that\u2019s just me] but sometimes the delivery in the lines are kinda dead. But it\u2019s expected since it\u2019s in the story.)\nMusic (some are reused from the previous games but some of the music here is great.)\n\nCons:\nTimed quests (especially when you finish and you have to meet up with the person aren't always there)\nHorrendous backgrounds (I\u2019m not one for bad textures because I revisit old games, but this looks more like PS2 background than the PS3 era. Sadly.) \nDialogue can be weird\nMain story is convoluted\nNot many of that beautiful FF cutscenes like you usually see before. (The rendered CGI ones) \n\nI still very much love this game so I give it a 7/10. I\u2019d give it an 8 or 9 if it weren\u2019t the messed up plot holes and horrendous scenery. But it makes me miss the FFXIII franchise despite it\u2019s criticism.\n\nEDIT: fixed this review with better grammar. I'll also edit with an update when I finish the game.

Even thought they've re-use a few previous soundtracks from the prequels and some new ones, but i think they were still fitting in this new game.  \n\n\nTook me 74 hours to complete main quest and 95% percent of sidequest\nRate :  8.5/10 !", "timestamp_created": 1514601949, "timestamp_updated": 1514601949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546191215515136719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38817179": {"recommendationid": "38817179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201046871", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2258, "last_played": 1514639684}, "language": "english", "review": "another good single player game to play :)", "timestamp_created": 1514551249, "timestamp_updated": 1514551249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458847135305404663", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38725353": {"recommendationid": "38725353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248459324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 26563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 25258, "last_played": 1700195049}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego, entretenido y rejugable.

(Winter Sale 2017) The reason I rebought was because I have totally just stopped using my Playstation 3 and nor do I plan to. This was easily one of my favorite games of all time.  I have around 400+ hours invested into my PS3 copy, and let me assure you, you CAN lose track of real life time while playing this game. (PS3) You will want to do every side quest and explore every nook and crany. The worlds are beautifully crafted. But, Here came the bad stuff. First second I booted it up on PC, I saw a settings over top the game. (This is common in emulators and by the way settings are applied and the way the game behaves just smells of an \"in-house emulator.\" What I meant by that is, Instead of Square Enix developing a fully fledged port, they just made an emulator to run it on PC.) To access some settings, You have to use the emulator's bar instead of configuring them in game. The control settings are literally \"Control Setting 1\" and Control Setting 2.\" There are two modes, Combat Mode and Free-Roam Mode. In Free-Roam Mode, If you try to move as Lightning with a keyboard, You will move but Lightning will become a studdery mess. The Combat Mode controls, and controls in general, are TERRIBLE and it feels like my first time having sex all over again. Messy, Confusing, Awkward, and I don't know if I put it in the right hole. Scratch that last one. But the gameplay is addicting. The story is a 7.6/10. Enjoyable. But the game in total is just fun!  MY VERDICT (for the skippers) I would reccommend this game to almost anyone on a CONSOLE. If you have an old Xbox 360 or Ps3 just lying around, buy a physical copy of this game. It's around $10 - $20 Mainland USD ( I said Mainland because Hawaii and Alaska is SO GODDAMN expensive. Sidenote: Never live in Alaska. Sucks.) Play it on console.

There are tons of outfits to try on, and each looks good. Seriously there are cool looking outfits and sexy looking outfits, its up to you what you wear. There is also a lot of cool weapons to choose from. The battle system is real time so that is interesting and keeps you on your toes. There are some rather sad moments throughout the game and alot of the game is based on your choices. You can save someones soul or you could literally be the cause of their eternal damnation so make wise choices. Also it is noteworthy that all of the DLC for this game comes with the steam purchase absoutely free! And there are some great DLC items! (As a side note if you intend to play Final Fantasy XIII-2, do not buy it on PC. I repeat do not buy Final Fantasy XIII-2 on PC. It is a horrible port. Get the game on console. Trust me. If you do not have a console and you buy it on PC anyways then I recommend you turn cloud save sync off, run the game as administrator, and if you are on windows 10, run the windows 8 compatibility) As for Lightning Returns the port is fine.

Most enemies and all bosses are damage sponge that can kill you in 4 to 5 hits, your attack barely hurt them that much and your healing is very limited. Battle in the game is more action oriented and but you can\u2019t really control Lightning\u2019s movement which I think is a big turn off. Furthermore, you have a clock on your ass which make thing even more uncomfortable. Some people may enjoy these challenges but I don\u2019t.\n\n\nSince I like Lightning and have finished the previous 2 games, I was determined to finish this one but this was such a drag, the plot is just getting worse and worse and is completely different to what I was expecting, you are now moving 1000 year forward since the first game, all of the game\u2019s worlds in XIII and XII-2 which I really enjoyed are discarded, some side characters like the 3 friends of Snow, Allyisa are never seen again which I think is a big waste. Everything related to the plot is just so vague and so hard to believe. The game gives a somewhat happy ending to the series but to me it was not satisfying enough after spending all that effort playing.\n\n\nOn the other hand, game is very smooth, runs well and looks good visually. Scenery in Wildland and the final boss are a highlight. You get to dress Lightning in all kind of dresses and although some are very cool, some are just plain ridiculous and don\u2019t fit the mood of the game at all during cut scenes.\n", "timestamp_created": 1512325538, "timestamp_updated": 1512325538, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467302709817886353", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38029840": {"recommendationid": "38029840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261414614", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2436, "last_played": 1572942097}, "language": "english", "review": "i know theres a lot hate for this game but i find this game really good!!", "timestamp_created": 1512299425, "timestamp_updated": 1512299425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490894675254821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37977134": {"recommendationid": "37977134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052599101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 5196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5076, "last_played": 1511208073}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics are all right, not as good as the first two games.\nRuns really smoothly.\nFun combat, really in depth and rewards timing.\nStory is okay, kind of a mess as it's a sequel to XIII-2.\nCharacters feel kind of like theme park versions of themselves, but they're still fine.\nVoice acting is pretty good.\nMusic isn't as good as the previous games, but still fine.\nNo issues with controls.\nGameplay is difficult and quite unforgiving.\nNot much replayability, but some.", "timestamp_created": 1512137244, "timestamp_updated": 1512137244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37902051": {"recommendationid": "37902051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077919995", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6219, "last_played": 1516057462}, "language": "english", "review": "Snow is edgier than ever.", "timestamp_created": 1511889406, "timestamp_updated": 1511889406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474820137023925781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37854347": {"recommendationid": "37854347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392524104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 692, "last_played": 1665470269}, "language": "english", "review": "Lightning is badass 9/10 (not really into the time mechanic but other than that great)", "timestamp_created": 1511848207, "timestamp_updated": 1511848207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37683532": {"recommendationid": "37683532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151829808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1573627321}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Genial, la Fabula Nova Crystalis es genial.", "timestamp_created": 1511710574, "timestamp_updated": 1511710574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37595948": {"recommendationid": "37595948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012615679", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9893, "last_played": 1607379475}, "language": "english", "review": "205 hours of gameplay and I don't regret it!\n\nSome things like the narrative and charachters can be indeed as lame as the previous games (lol), but everything else just kept me going, and I loved doing it!

Your first playthrough will be difficult and slightly frustrating. The game doesn't hold your hand. It throws you into the world giving you five days to complete the five main quests and tells you to Have Fun!\n\nDiscovery is up to the player. After the initial quest tutorial, the game opens up and allows you to go where you please. You can begin anyone of the main quests in any order. This game offers so much freedom. It's not linear. Take on any challenge when you feel ready. Because the game doesn't hold your hand, I'd recommend studying a LR: XIII Guide or YouTube if you get stuck. If you're the type of player who wants to figure out things through discovery, you'll love this game. It tells you nothing. So, it's up to the player to find answers. \n\nLighting Return is fully customizable. Complete quests in any order you like. Customize Lighting's attack & defense skill as you like. You can even customize Lighting's look and color scheme to fit you individual liking. Change her outfits, colors, and/or add adornments. She is 'your' Lighting. Make her look how you want her to look. You can also customize Lighting to your playstyle. You can build Lighting as a Mage, Melee, Tank, or anything in-between.\n\nThe world is beautiful. Each area is filled with detail and immersive. Lots of NPCs to talk with and each area is filled with quests. There is always something to do when not doing the main missions. Unfortunately, Side Quests are somewhat required if you want to increase your attack/defensive levels. On this note, the game gets much harder as time continues.\n\nLighting Returns is the best PS4 to PC port I've seen to date. Much better than Final Fantasy XIII-2 port. FF XIII-2 is a train wreck on PC. So, if you're coming off the sequel, Lighting Returns will run like a dream PC rig. My rig can comfortably play Lighting Returns at 60 fps. On another side note: the game doesn't offer a full range of pc customization option. I'd say most players with decent pc specs will be able to run this game at full settings, 60 fps. The game run really well and doesn't hog any system resources.\n\nLighting Returns story is a Hot Mess. You'll need to have played Final Fantasy XIII-2 to \"somewhat\" understand what the hell is going on. The only thing holding the story together are the voice acting and presentation. Character Development and narrative are the strongest points of the game.\n\nTL; DR Overall: Great game. Great Characters. Wonderful narrative, horrible story. Great combat. Lots of customization. Lots to do in the way of side quests & upgrade system. Best PC port in the FF XIII series. Lighting is best waifu.  The most OVERLOOKED Final Fantasy.  10/10\n\nEdit: Over 200+ hours in \u2026 I still believe this is the best JRPG to date.\nEdit2: Years and several dozen RPGs later, this is still the best JRPG to date.\nEdit3: 2020 and it's STILL my absolute favorite game.\nEdit4: 2021 ... continues to be my most Favorite JRPG/Favorite Game.\nEdit5: 2023 -- Not to anyone's surprise, LR: FFXIII is still my most beloved game in my library.", "timestamp_created": 1511619279, "timestamp_updated": 1700753795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496774196624755859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37446424": {"recommendationid": "37446424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377943409", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1499297418}, "language": "english", "review": "What is there to say, you either love final fantasy or you don't.\nIf you do, you will ofcourse love this one aswell.", "timestamp_created": 1511574270, "timestamp_updated": 1511574270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37425203": {"recommendationid": "37425203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324728305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1616651979}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad no puedo entender por qu\u00e9 a algunas personas les parece malo este juego, es simplemente muy bueno.", "timestamp_created": 1511561331, "timestamp_updated": 1511561331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37422551": {"recommendationid": "37422551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024414686", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1511559987}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this back on the Xbox360 and have to say it was a nice take on the Fabula Nova Crystalis series but the addition of a timer to an open world setting placed un-needed pressure to the game meaning you couldn't enjoy the world but had to micro manage it.", "timestamp_created": 1511560087, "timestamp_updated": 1511560087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37283002": {"recommendationid": "37283002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157868686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1813, "last_played": 1558800016}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics is so good.

At any time you are able to equip three outfits for Lightning, which substitute as your party members in traditional RPG games (and from FF13 and 13-2). With the wide variety of outfits available, it's very likely that no two players will have the exact same three outfit setup which really allows you to tailor to your playstyle(s).\n+ Story is at times dark but overall provides a satisfactory ending to the FF13 series (at least in my opinion); this can be highly subjective but personally I found the game explored many themes (especially philosophically) quite well (life and death being a prominent one, it also plays with the notion of pseudo-immortality and the effect that would have on humanity). Perhaps the game was never meant to invoke these kinds of thoughts of themes, but it did for me and I can say I enjoyed the story very much. \n+ Cutscenes were well done and generally a treat but too few far and in between for me personally.\n+ Open world element was great for the first 20 hours but gradually became repetitive (a small nitpick).\n+ The time limit; an aspect of the game that many dread (at times I also did, I'll touch on that in the cons section), but it provides a sense of urgency as it should in this game's environment. \n+ You get to equip Lightning in whatever outfit you please (some to me are over-the-top but it also serves as fanservice).\n+ Good optimization and controller support (running on a 960m was no problem at a steady 60fps).\n\nCONS\n- Fighting enemies eventually feels dragged out and repetitive; there will be times when you look to avoid engaging enemies altogether. While the combat system is fresh, enemies appear quite often and the sequence is always the same (look for weak points, hit them with combos to stagger, finish them off). This becomes more of a problem on side quests when you're tasked with retrieving items or delivering a message from one place to another, which for a large chunk don't require combat at all.\n- Completing side quests and main quests is the only way to \"level up\" Lightning; there is no experience point system in LR and fighting monsters only nets you gil (gold) and items/abilities. As mentioned already above, this will at times lead one to wish to avoid combat altogether. Side quests include some interesting stories and are varied enough, but for the most part you'll be doing the same things (fighting monsters to collect x items, finding items, delivering messages).\n- Character development is on the weak side (Snow, Fang, Vanille and Sazh all have their own sub-stories but these could have been much further developed).\n- Hope constantly being in your ear can be quite annoying, to the point where his dialogue constantly gets cut off as you enter into combat or talk to people.\n- The time limit, while effective at times, can simply be abused by using an ability to freeze time; while abilities cost an alternate point system called EP, this can be recharged insanely fast by fighting monsters (though it charges slower with weaker monsters). \n\nOTHER COMMENTS\n- Characters, their development and impact may not be as strong as in some previous FF games (FFX comes to mind) but is satisfactory and enjoyable overall.\n- Moderate replayability as there are a few features that are only unlocked after starting a New Game+.\n\nTL;DR - Overall, the story seems to be hit-or-miss with people (it was a hit for me), but due to that and a fresh combat system, I would definitely recommend this game.

You save souls by completing quests, which convieniently also rewards you with money, stats, and cosmetic items.\n\nThe world is divided up into four major areas, and there are 5 main questlines you need to complete in order to buy the world the time it needs. There are also around 60 sidequests and 80 \"MMO-type quests\" (basically bringing items back to a billboard) to help you get stronger. It is worth noting that the only way to get stronger is through completing quests.

Each in-game day lasts 24 real-time minutes. The timer stops during battle, cutscenes and menus, and you start the game with 7 days, and can earn up to 14 by completing quests. You only need to earn 13 days to complete the game. Yet my first playthough took me about 40 hours.\nIf you're wondering why the math doesn't check out, it's because of a nifty ability called Chronostasis. This ability allows you to stop the doomsday timer for around 90 seconds at the cost of 1 EP, which is a resource you earn by fighting monsters. The cost of chronostasis is so low that you can abuse it to no end. I had completed pretty much every quest in the game, except for a few super-boss related ones by day 5 thanks to Chronostasis, to give you an idea on how generous the game is with it's time limit.\n \nThe global timer is a poorly implemented mechanic, simply because the only way Square found to make it tolerable was to add another mechanic which entirely circumvents it.\n\nNow let's talk about the other thing that sets Lightning Returns apart from the ordinary JRPG : The battle system.\nYou have three \"schematas\" at your disposition, each schemata being a loadout of 1 armor(called \"garbs\" by the game,  some garbs are more on the swimsuit than armor side), 2 accessories, 1 weapon, 1 shield and 4 abilities. Abilities are dropped by monsters, or found in chests, and can be upgraded by fusing abilities of the same type together. You can freely switch between your three schematas during battle, and each schemata has it's own ATB bar, independant from the other two's. This gives you an apparent lot of strategic freedom, unfortunately the majority of abilities, garbs and even weapons are garbage, which limits your options. This system also allows you to play dress-up, if that's your thing.\n\nFor the actual battle side of things, the combat is extremely action-focused. You control Lightning's every move, have no party members (except at one point in the game, and for a very short time) and must parry enemy attacks with precise timing to avoid being beaten into the ground. Overall I found this system quite enjoyable, although it is a bit of a trudge before you unlock certain abilities, and sometimes an overuse of visual effects and animations by the game makes it hard to tell what's going on, and in turn, hard to parry/time your attacks correctly.\n\n\nThe first game of the trilogy was heavily criticized for it's lack of player freedom and overwhelming linearity. This is not the case in Lightning Returns. You can do any main quest you want first, although some are easier than others, go to any area whenever you want, and generally do things in the order you please. The only task the game asks of you, is to complete the 5 main quests and enough sidequests before your time is up.\n\n\nThis game also features an extinction mechanic for the monsters. For nearly all monsters, after enough of them have been killed, a Last One, basically a way more powerful version of that monster will spawn. After defeating it, that monster type will no longer appear for this playthrough. This can be a bit of a problem since enemy drops get better after day 7 and day 10. If you exterminated a monster which dropped an ability you  wanted the more powerful version of  before day 7 or 10, you're out of luck for this playthrough. Likewise, the amount of gil the the game has a soft limit because of this extinction system (the vas majority of your income will come from monsters, specifically from Cactuars), and buying a weapon on day 9 when the store begins selling a straight upgrade by day 10 for just a bit more gil is a huge slap in the face.\n\n\nThe plot is a mess. There is no other way to put it. You need to have played the first two games in the series to even have a remote chance at understanding what's going on, and even if you have, the plot is very confused and full of inconcistencies. It's not really interesting either, and this is coming from someone who had no trouble understanding the plot of the first two games and found them serviceable. Still, Lightning gets some funny lines here and there, so it's not all bad.\n\nThe music is alright. It reuses a lot of tracks from the previous two games, and the new tracks aren't remarkable, except for one or two.\n\nGraphically, the game looks great in some areas, and pretty mediocre in others. It's nothing eye-scorching, but it is a downgrade from the first game, and feels like a downgrade from the second game, tough I'm not certain about that.\n\n\nOverall, I'd rate this game a 6/10. If you liked the previous two games, and can get past the doomsday timer (which isn't that big of a deal) and monster extinction stuff, you could be in for a fun time, but don't expect anything amazing. The 16\u20ac pricetag isn't too redihibitory either, which works in the game's favor.", "timestamp_created": 1510536155, "timestamp_updated": 1510536608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.88261115550994873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36472995": {"recommendationid": "36472995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296564267", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1671528463}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

No buscaba grandes escenarios que explorar, sino una historia memorable, y en ese juego la encontr\u00e9. Encontr\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n a uno de los protagonistas m\u00e1s carism\u00e1ticos de la historia de FF; junto a Cloud y Terra, Lightning representa unos valores que son dignos de encumbrar. Este juego ha supuesto una enorme decepci\u00f3n para m\u00ed en todos sus aspectos:\n\n- Historia: su mayor fallo. Est\u00e1 forzada hasta el extremo, no me incita para nada a descubrir qu\u00e9 hay m\u00e1s all\u00e1, recicla a ciertos personajes que a todas luces sobran como Hope que, sinceramente, no logro entender qu\u00e9 hacen ah\u00ed. Es un desprop\u00f3sito. Aprovecho aqu\u00ed para decir que en mi opini\u00f3n la historia de FF XIII acaba genial, y no deber\u00eda haber tenido m\u00e1s recorrido. \n\n- Gr\u00e1ficos y sonido: el sonido cumple, el aspecto gr\u00e1fico no. Al margen del nivel de detalle de los personajes, la cantidad bestial de bugs visuales, principalmente de los NPCs, te saca completamente de la historia. Me refiero a estar hablando con un NPC y tener a tu alrededor a cuatro o cinco dando pasos y par\u00e1ndose, cruz\u00e1ndose en medio de la conversaci\u00f3n, o desapareciendo y apareciendo a placer.\n\n- Jugabilidad: esto es algo m\u00e1s subjetivo, pero particularmente el sistema de combate a m\u00ed no me ha gustado en absoluto. La progresi\u00f3n no depende de la cantidad de combates que hagas, lo que te desincentiva a luchar. Adem\u00e1s te pueden matar de un toque hasta los enemigos m\u00e1s d\u00e9biles. Un sinsentido. \n\n- El detalle: el colmo, y esto vuelve a ser subjetivo, es el car\u00e1cter horario del juego. Tienes un l\u00edmite para el fin del mundo, hay misiones que solo se pueden completar a ciertas horas, y cada d\u00eda debes volver a un lugar a una hora. Esto te limita bastante y lo odio mucho en un videojuego. Lo aguant\u00e9 refunfu\u00f1ando en Majora`s Mask, pero por ser una obra maestra.

TERRIBLE, but it's not actually. the combat is done where you have certain amount of attack points for each garb you use and you can change between 3 on the fly making this game very fast paced. you will find yourself using different outfits to support a well balanced character. for instance, I fould myself having one garb for magic, one for physical and one for healing debuff. i did find Yuna's and Cloud's outfits just slightly OP for the majority of the game. which i honestly didn't have much of a problem with besides the fact i couldn't use any outfit i might want since the skills attached to yuna's and clouds gear are awesome in my opinion. \n\nthe story in this game is... i want to say bad and absolute nonsense but i honestly didn't stay for this aspect of the game. i was rolling my eyes by credits. i did however LOVE the combat so much i spent 60 hours on a final fantasy with a really crappy story.\n\nlast thing worth mentioning is how they set up the monsters. you can kill all of them. since the story has humanity in a time stop all of monsters are in this as well. so you can gain awesome weapons and gear by killing off all of a certain species and fighting it's last survivor. just fyi, behemoth is really worth killing for the weapon it drops. can't remember the name of the zone but it's the one with the chocobos on it. think it's like 50 kills. worth the time.", "timestamp_created": 1507773753, "timestamp_updated": 1507773789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591928362846374512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35600917": {"recommendationid": "35600917", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981656660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3832, "last_played": 1479834564}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily my favourite game in the FFXIII trilogy.

presentation. \n\n+ The combat system has been overhauled from previous entries. Combat now plays out in real-time. You can equip up to 3 outfits. Within each outfit you can equip a weapon, shield, accessories and abilities. Within combat you can freely switch between outfits. Like previous entries, how you setup before battle is more important than the actual battle. \n\n+ This is a very non-linear game as you can tackle any main/side quests in any order you prefer.  \n\n+ Among the F13 trilogy this is the best optimized game, it does have some problems but compared to the nightmare that was FF13-2 this is a massive improvement. \n\n\nThe Average:\n\n+/- The game features a time limit in which you must accomplish as many main/side quests as possible before the day ends. You are originally given 6 days to complete everything however you can extend this by completing as many quests as you can. You are also given the ability to freeze time for a few short minutes, however you are only given a limited number of uses and must kill enemies to restore how often you can use the ability. Given that the story is about the world ending, it makes sense from a gameplay perspective but the mechanic becomes a bit tiresome after a while. \n\n+/-The story, to no surprise is a convoluted mess. You must play FF13-2 and to a lesser degree FF13 to have any understanding of what is happening. I got the impression the developers had no idea where to take the story after FF13 so they started making things up on the go. The story is held together by strong presentation and voice acting.\n\n+/- You are presented with two difficulty options, easy and normal. Normal is too difficult especially for a first playthrough and easy is very easy outside of optional bosses.    \n\n+/- Killing enemies doesn\u2019t reward you with anything other than recharging your meter so that you can use certain abilities and granting you skills to customize your character. Once you have the skills you want there is little incentive to kill enemies.\n\nThe Bad:\n- You must complete side quests to level up stats. To complete side quests, you must be at the right place at the right time and sometimes meet other conditions. This becomes very problematic because its so easy to miss quests often resulting in using a guide to help you.  Almost every side quest is some variation of a fetch quest and the game gives very little or no helpful advice in how to complete any of them. Given the importance of side quests, a better system really needs to be in place. \n\nConclusion:\nSquare finally made a competent final fantasy port and to their credit, are not afraid to try new ideas rather than rehashing the same old things, sadly not every idea is a winner. This game is completely different from the previous games and given the new mechanics this is one of those games where you either love it or hate it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1506261595, "timestamp_updated": 1506261595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780960023403167725", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35134006": {"recommendationid": "35134006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051757644", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5686, "last_played": 1698436192}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best ways to evolve ff13, the story was by far the best and not confusing like the 1st and the 2nd chapter of the story.

Utterly incomprehensible in its monolothic culmination of three titles of nonsensical stories, Lightning Return continues Final Fantasy 13's grand legacy, yet fails to match the same gameplay and graphical excellence of previous titles. \n\nThe Sidequests are so utterly removed from logic that the stories are frequentably laughable and nigh impossible to even take seriously, but it's difficult to match when watching the idiotic movement patterns of NPCs and the constant clipping of gear. There's often fuel for hilarity during the very cutscenes that contain the sidequests and story when wearing costumes made of Moogles, with mustache, tophats, and countless other ridiculous accenting items and costumes, watching as NPCs are jostled and knocked about by the milling patterns of surrounding NPCS, \n\nThere's a distinct sense that the game didn't have enough time to be developed and that shines through every facet of the design. The very doomsday counter that looms over the player's head is easily ignored when stopping time through a single skill implemented from the start, grinding big  monsters for EP to spend on its usage after abusing gear provided from DLC. This grind continues into the rest of the game, whether it be doing fetch quests, or extincting entire species after felling countless creatures as you traverse an open world. \n\nThis is all despite having a detailed customization system of costumes and large number of skills ranging from debuffing, blocking, physical attacks, and spells, with room for gear and accessories to add stat bonuses and buffs to the gameplay. Each costume and often has its own buffs and debuffs and a specialized use towards what skills would be best to use with them, some even transforming based on the costume or weapon used. The level of detail can, at times, be staggering and overwhelming. \n\nBut even with this and a hybrid real time, command-based battle system involving staggering foes, ultimately one doesn't even need to change strategy and consequently battles don't really amount to much, which is likely why the extinction system even exists. The very rare opportunity to need to change costumes and customization settings only comes from the occasional boss and large-scale monsters, leaving the player with a wealth of time otherwise spent grinding and questing as opposed to having challenging gameplay. \n\nSo, why am I leaving a positive review? In spite of, or perhaps because of these reasons, this game is enthralling. Maybe it's because the game's wonkiness is endearing, whether it be for comedy or for the strangely emotional motivations for the characters. Maybe it's because each costume referencing previous titles, there's always a fun easter egg or two to enjoy while running around and slaying monsters. Maybe it's because playing Final Fantasy 13's game have weakened me. Or maybe it's because it's an absolute joy to play in a Final Fantasy game, customizing, exploring, and operating as I choose in an open world, off the rails that most every Final Fantasy game has kept us on to some extent. In spite of many flaws, I've been enjoying what may easily be the strangest, most unhinged title in the series. So approach with caution and buy on sale.\n\nTLDR: Weird, hilarious, grindy, but unpredictable, with open world, easter eggs, high customization, and player choice for how to utilize their time.

There are many ways to finish this game by using your witts or follow a walkthrough. Its possible to defeat all enemies on the first walkthrough you just have to come up with a good schemata setup for each boss and a lot of trial and error but final boss is quite easy if u can stagger fast enough or get hit pretty hard :) even though you have to defeat him multiple times O_O. I never used ethers for bosses on my first walkthrough :3\n\nGREAT Customization options makes this game really interesting, like some accessories may look like useless or schemeta but when you setup up some insane stagger builds you may think some freaky builds without relying too much on absolute physical resistance or magic resistance for the obvious builds. \n\nSPOILER enhancing equips only comes after beating the game and so is making higher lvl abilities from HARD mode for the replay value and also stack up stats per walkthrough!!!! won't spoil too much heheh :)\n\nNOTE if you think too much of the story of this series gets to you for having plot holes then don't think too much just enjoy the happy ending of this series deserves and awesome BATTLE SYSTEM.

Unlike the PS3 version, all the DLC is included for free in this game, granted there is one Garb set you can't get here but you get everything else. Not as hallway-like compared to 13 which is what most hardcore FF fans complained about. I have pretty low standards when it comes to gaming anyways so disregard my opinion on anything that involves stories XD I'm no hardcore FF fan but I've been around the block for some time, started playing when FF13 came out, I personally enjoy the Nova Crystallis games.\n\nOne of my favourite things about LRFF13 (or as some would refer to it as 13-3), the combat and schemata system. You have 3 primary schemata slots, each with their own outfit, weapons, and attack sets that you choose to your liking. It still uses the attack gauge found in 13/13-2 but when the attack gauge is empty, you simply switch to your other 2 schematas and use those while your primary set recovers its AP. Also you get to dress Lightning up :3\n\nThe game IS TIMED, so you can't exactly take your time exploring. I honestly haven't played both the PC and PS3 version in over a year so I can't remember how many in-game days you need to beat the game in, but I believe its like 11 days? 13 days if you manage to complete everything if I remember correctly. If you're not a fan of timed events in any game, chances are you're not gonna enjoy running around doing quests and killing things within a time limit. Its obviously doable, and say you do fail, it'll let you start a \"New Game+\" which carries over all your garbs, attack moves, weapons, all your Gil(?), character exp/level and you basically get another shot at it, but with everything that you thought you lost.\n\nAll in all, I think most can agree that its a vast improvement over \"Final Hallway 13\" as the hardcore elitist fans would call it. Also because its part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series and Fabula Nova Crystallis sounds awesome as fuck.

If you break it down to the core you basically do a lot of miniquests under time constraints.\n\nThe time limit is prolly one of the major reasons this got shit on so much. Normally im not a fan either but it works for this game. Theres no intricate schedules for everything like in Majoras Mask, but things change and it creates a sense of urgency and impeding doom the game really wouldnt have otherwise if you could just fart around at leisure. Its quite generous anyway (having some practice from having played this on PS3 i ended up having several days with nothing to do anymore) and in the worst case you get to start over and keep your stuff and stats.\n\nThe combat system is different from the usual FF stuff too in that theres no party, you instead can switch anytime between 3 equipment slots with their own ATB Bars. The only thing inherent to Lighting are some special skills otherwise everything from weapons to \"armor\" to magic and physical attack and defense skills can be freely customized with those slots, you got free reign to make the most garbage and most op setups imaginable.\n\nAnother difference is that you dont level, there are no XP Points. You get stat increases from finishing quests. Those can be done more or less anytime in any order you want.  There are the big main ones you have to finish within the time limit to at least not get a game over (Quest chains with a boss and big expensive Final Fantasy cutscene at the end), side quests with either abit of story and background lore attached to em (not all available right away, dependant on which day youre on and somesuch), and plain old dime a dozen Fetch/kill quests from message boards (mostly more unlock the farther youre into the game).\n\nFollowing the \"No XP\", how enemies come into play is abit different too. They drop stuff and money like in any other FF but the most important resource from them is probably replenishing your special magic points. Whats so important about the special magic points? One of the special magic abilities is a limited timestop youll have to rely on if you want to get more than the basic minimum of quests done. At the start you fight monsters to get by - In the later stages of the game youre basically a vampire harvesting them to fuel your time juice addiction. Also Monsters can go extinct - the last of its kind will be a supermook dropping good stuff but that also means you risk having places with nothing to feast on if you kill everything indiscriminately.\n\nThink it also got abit of flak for Lighting being kinda sullen all the time. I dont mind - it fits the character and setting and its not like FF has always had the bestest Protagonists ever (Heyo Squall). Plus its really funny having the dumbest quests making you do the stupidest shit and Lighting delivering a somber monologue about the follies of mankind at the end. Maybe its even intentional at times? :O\n\nThe graphics are abit crusty but imo it still looks pretty good with a nice art style. Its a robust port, except the unlimited fps option breaks things.\n\nSo now the single low point: The parts of the overarching plot revolving around Lightings former party in the first two main chapters. You can deduct Lighting knows them but otherwise these dudes plop up once or twice, mope about their dead girls for abit then leave.\nThen after the bossfight the big expensive cutscenes go into superham FF dramatic mode with sad pianos and Lighting is all like NOOO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF SHE WOULDNT HAVE WANTED THIS all the while im unable to give two shits because the only thing i know about them is Lighting knows them and now theyve been mopey for 500 years because their girls are dead because they died and its Lightings fault. Maybe id care more if i had played the other two games where they got all their development and backstories, my fault i guess.\n\nIn closing, i like this game alot but it might not be for everyone.

The combat system is more fun than that of XIII-2, and on par with that of XIII: while XIII rewards you for good paradigm setups, LR rewards you a bit more for personal mechanics, especially for the final boss fight of the game (perfect guarding oboy). I'm a bit iffy on the doomsday clock - it bothered me a lot during my first playthrough because I'm a completionist but not a confident gamer, but if you just throw away your pride and follow a walkthrough (partially or completely) then you'll have plenty of time left over.\nFor those who wonder about story and characters - if you liked the characters of Lightning Farron, Hope Estheim and Snow Villiers from the first two games, definitely get this game.

For starters, the combat system is fun, fast paced, rewards proper timing and strategy and the time limit mechanics are interesting and well implemented.\n\nSadly the game fails to take advantage of this entirely by reducing 80% of the content to boring fetch quests, most of which either don't involve combat at all (find item X in the field, talk to person Y) or require you to farm X amount of item MMO style, almost none of those involve fighting unique enemies or optional bosses. Even worse, instead of leveling up, you get stat bonuses only from those quests so you get punished for not doing them, so \"just don't do them if you don't like them\" is not really an option.\n\nRewards from combat are only recharging your EP (resource used to stop time, teleport, etc.), gil (which is mostly useless outside of new game+, you get way more than you need and barely ever upgrade your equipment) and skills of a certain level, which is determined by how far in the game you are. However, the game has a mechanic that allows for complete extermination of a monster species, meaning that if you do too much combat early on, you screw yourself out of some higher level skills late in the game. In other words, actually beating up monsters outside of getting quest items or new game+(if you can tolerate the game twice) is mostly a waste of time.\n\nThe remaining 20% of the game are 5 main quests, 1 of those is also nothing but a fetch quest series and 4 with a boss at the end. 2 of those have an extremely linear dungeon after doing fetch quests to access the dungeon, 1 that's basically an open room with a boss inside after a series of more fetch quests and one that actually has a complex layout and could be considered well designed.\n\nIn other words, avoid this game like the plague if you like boss battles or any sort of dungeon exploring - there are only 9 bosses in the whole game, 2 of them are regular enemies fought later on by the dozens, 4 quest bosses, the final boss and 2 superbosses. The rest of the game is spent running around giving items to NPCs or slaughtering weak monsters for quest items to give to NPCs. Pretty much a complete waste of a great combat system, as the game gives you barely any interesting enemies to fight.\n\nThere is also a new game+ options and a hard mode, the issue here is that you can't play hard mode without new game+, which means carrying over almost everything from the previous playthrough to the point where the vast majority of Hard is easier than a 1st playthrough of Normal, which kind of ruins the point of having a Hard mode. Gave up on the game at that point, would honestly rather drink a bottle of drain cleaner than suffer through the game again.\n\nGo ahead and buy this if you like fetch quests, if you want a well designed quality RPG with content that isn't mostly filler, go look elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1500137677, "timestamp_updated": 1500137677, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532736897468566895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33533037": {"recommendationid": "33533037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045443825", "num_games_owned": 1696, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 2107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1143, "last_played": 1535990042}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Dear Lightning,\n\nHow's it going?  Good?  I hope so.  You might not know this, but I've been playing your trilogy for the past seven years if you can believe it.  Yeah, it sounds far-fetched, but I ended up becoming quite attached to this black sheep in a sea of white wool.  As for why, well, that's hard to say.  It could be that I was so enchanted by Hamauzu's themes that guided me down that long hallway, or perhaps it was the various interesting combat systems you had in place.  Ironically, though, and I suppose it's a bit embarrassing as well, but I've never beaten any of your games.  I have several dozen hours in XIII and LR, but for one reason or another I always stopped when I was getting close.\n\nThen Square announced that your games were coming to PC, and with graphical enhancements even, and I was stoked.  And how could I not be?  While they weren't necessarily my favorite games in the series, they were essentially a second chance for me to beat these games that I put on hold back on consoles...\n\n...but I don't think anyone was expecting the ports to be that bad.  Horrid, even.  Poor options menus, frame skipping (even on >recommended specs), crashing and bugs- XIII and XIII-2's ports were nothing short of abysmal and we really only have durante to thank for the fact that people are willing to give them a shot on PC today.  Then Lightning Returns came around.\n\nLR's always been my favorite in the series, Light.  I'm a sucker for Action RPGs after all, and the garb/skill customization was fun as hell.  It was a lot of what I wanted out of ARPGs in a time when none were really willing to the distance, and even now it's pretty easy for me to get sucked back into this game whenever I reinstall and boot it up.  And even better, and shocking even, was that the port of this game blew the other two absolutely out of the water.  Support for Windowless Bordered, 60FPS, built-in options menu (still a bit cheap but leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors)- it wasn't the perfect point, and the right conditions, such as populated areas or strong particle effects can slow down the game.\n\nBut Light, we gotta talk.  We have problems.  And those problems are you.\n\nI liked you in XIII.  Somehow.  That game wasn't exactly written like Shakespeare but I liked it and I liked you.  And in this game, I...tolerated you.  Look, it's neat that your game wants to present these ideas of existentialism, how \"good\" is subjective and can be easily corroded and corrupted, and a fair amount of other subjects that it liked to preach- that it liked [i]you[/i] to preach, but it's done in the least interesting way possible.  Every loading screen is filled with monologs going on about what happened and the nature of why it happened, every happening creates a drawn out ponderance, and while normally I'd just be able to ignore it, this is how the game is supposed to make us bond with you.  You, the one consistent character throughout this entire game outside of Hope, who I can only assume was turned back into a child to fulfill some fan clamoring...somewhere.  There's also Lumina.  She's a thing.\n\nThis might all seem a little harsh and the fact that I'm recommending your game even still probably seems insane, as it should, because a lot of the value that this game tries to create in regards to the viewer is emotional.  Largely, it's meant to build on everything that's happened over the course of the last two games and really bring things to a head for the characters found here.  And it doesn't really work.  Admittedly, people who actually were fans of the first two games will find some investment here, moreso if they liked the characters.  But the problem comes with the fact that you're more of an observer than anything else.   Most scenes play out with you gasping as if you...display emotion?  And your performance overall is rather one-note.  This makes these \"emotional moments\" fall flat because there's no build-up, no climax.  And this really carries over into the side quests, too, despite a fair number of their premises being particularly alright.  Each quest felt like I was doing it because it was there and I gained benefits from it rather than wanting to do it to see the story proceed, even if I was listening to all the dialogue.\n\nThat said, the gameplay's pretty great.  Props to the developers for somehow managing to retool the systems that were in place in the predecessors and turning it into a competent, if a little unique, Action RPG that I'd recommend any day.  For someone like me who's always looking for variety in a genre that has no right to be the same, this certainly scratches an itch.  Being able to create your own character builds and the control you're given with which to do so offers enough option that it can be surprisingly engaging, even on replays.\n\nFor instance, back on console I generally went for 3 builds that covered all the bases while doing as much damage as possible: one for magic, one for physical damage, and one that was a mix of the two.  When I came to PC I decided to play a bit more with the efficiency game, making a build for each elemental weakness.  What made this fun, though, was that they weren't all the same with simply different elements.  My fire build had an emphasis on dealing as much ranged magic as possible, meanwhile my wind build was evasive and only used ranged magic as a means to chain into my dodges, but otherwise it was focused on using wind-based physical attacks.  Because even though the game could most certainly be wider than it is, the amount of freedom that's here is a hell of a lot of fun to play around with.\n\nAnother ball in your court, I actually liked the world here, too.  Some areas were just plain comfy to be in, the scale of others was quite massive and just fun to explore.  While the stories told in these locations weren't always the most interesting, the world and the gameplay made them fun to do, regardless.  And while some may begrudge the time limit, for me it just made it feel as if there was always something to do.  I had zero problems with it myself, I never really felt particularly rushed and finished with all the story content several days ahead of time simply because the timer isn't particularly strict.  And more than that, there are a lot of fun small things here.  Like how, if left unattended, monsters can kill animals/people, and in some cases, people can kill monsters.  And how you can slide on sand (oh I had a field day with that).  And the amount of life that in the more populated parts of the world- but even if you weren't in the city or at a settlement it never really feels lonely because people are always out and about.\n\nIt's just a good time.  I've very select things to say about the story but as a fan of XIII up to this point, despite their being disappointing for the most part, I was nonetheless all the way through.  But there's enough here even if I didn't like the other two games that I could still play this and recommend it to most people.  It's a bizarre mix of FFXIII and Majora's Mask but it works better than any sane combination of these two games should.  But it does, Light, and you've got a good product here.  People should buy this, even at full price it's cheap (and a hell of a lot cheaper than it was at launch), but they should get it on sale if they're undecided since it gets pretty low.\n\nOh, and while you're at it, please tell Square to stop shoving you into every goddamn product.  You're cool and all but I'm pretty sure this counts as abuse.\n\nAnyway, see ya in Dissidia.\"", "timestamp_created": 1500028086, "timestamp_updated": 1502361854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615517497062683105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33461518": {"recommendationid": "33461518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008303595", "num_games_owned": 875, "num_reviews": 553, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1472944884}, "language": "english", "review": "The PC version of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is a good porting that runs smoothly at 1080p/60fps on older PCs.

This is one of my favorite games ever, and though people seem to point out certain mechanics as awful, it's still an opinion and all people don't like the same thing. But as all reviews this is my opinion on this game.\n\nTo start of, the fighting mechanics in this game are interesting, they have basically thrown together hack and slash with some kind of turn based fighting. Many different monsters to fight and items to obtain. Some monsters are more vulnerable to different elements, for example ice is extremely vulnerable to fire and so on. Each enemy has it's own weakness and it's always fun to experiment. Slay all monsters of one species to exterminate those kind of monsters.\n\nThen the overall level design is okay, I mean it's outdated graphics from today but if you don't have any big of an issue with graphics then it shouldn't even matter. The cities are pretty and it's fun running around on open fields and mountains.\n\nThe quests in this game may be a little confusing, though if you make sure to stay in touch with the dialogue then it shouldn't be problem really. There aren't an endless amount of quest, and the explanation will com later.\n\nStory was really good. I haven't felt like following the story and lore of a game before, not on this level anyways. People may think of it as boring, and you and if you're going to play this one you should play XIII and XIII-2 first. If you care about the story, that is.\n\nNow over to the mechanic most people seem to dislike. The timer. Yes, you have a timer to complete the game on, and in most cases I don't have a problem with that. It just makes that game a little more challenging. Complete quests to increase the timer, thus giving you more time to do everything. That's why there aren't millions of side quests, they give you a considerable amount of quests to be able to complete the game in time. As simple as that. This is why people vote it negative, and so I'm going to say DON'T buy the game if you have problems with timers and such. As it will probably stress you out most of the time.\n\nThe difficulty of the game, can be increased or decreased depending on how good you are at games. It can be very easy sometimes, and then dramatically get a lot more difficult. See for yourself.\n\nTechnical difficulties? I don't understand what people are talking about when they say stuttering and such. I didn't have any problem with this game. I don't remember if I played on 30 or 60 fps, but people are seriously angry that they have to play on 30 fps. Like what? It is a port from ps3 what did you expect? Anyways if you have trouble looking on a screen with 30 fps then don't play it. Recommendation: play with a controller. Since it is a port from console don't expect it to work well with keyboard and mouse!\n\nAnything else? Oh yeah! The soundtrack in this game... it's nothing like you will ever come across again! It's amazing! It could be worth buying the soundtrack from a game like this. Seriously, The soundtrack is really good.\n\nThere you have my own personal opinion on this game. As you may have noticed, I love this game and always will. You can put hours in this game and that makes it a longer lasting experience.

I started the game on several occasions but it just can't pull me in. The plot is bland - Lightning is awaken after 500 years and the god has given her new powers - she can even stop time itself now. The world is about to end in a few days and it's up to her to stop that. Unfortunately there is not a single memorable character you'll meet during the game, and every side quest is more boring than the previous one.\n\nYou go fetch some items, or kill random creatures for some drops. For extra irritation - the game has this \"clock is ticking\" feature that constantly pushes you to hurry up even though there's actually enough time. In the beginning, when I didn't know that - I kept skipping over places just because Hope (your helper from up in the sky) keeps calling you every five minutes to remind you to \"Hurry up, the clock is ticking\".\n\nThere are also several occasions where you can't progress because it's \"not the time yet\" since some world parts open/close at specific hours. So after an hour of wandering around the city I finally consulted a guide that literally said \"Wait till 6:00 AM to progress\" even though, like I said already, the game constantly urges you to hurry up.\n\nThe combat is ok-ish, but you'll just end up mashing the buttons and winning every fight in the end anyway.\n\nSound is ok but far from great. Tthe soundtrack is very nice at some parts but some tracks feel very out of place. All this combined - the bland story, forgettable characters and button-mashing combat just can't make me stick long enough to finish the game.\n\nShame...

opini\u00f3n este es un juego infravalorado por sus precuelas, las cuales personalmente no he jugado.\nLightning Returns es un juego que no se parece para nada ni a el XIII ni al XIII-2, tiene un sistema de combate completamente nuevo el cu\u00e1l consiste en un sistema de barras las cuales las acciones desgastan y en ir cambiando entre 3 arquetipos en combate los cuales personalizas tu mismo (uno de da\u00f1o f\u00edsico, otro s\u00f3lo de da\u00f1o m\u00e1gico y otro de aturdimiento por ejemplo) el cu\u00e1l le da una frescura y dinamismo, cada acci\u00f3n que usemos usar\u00e1 un poco de la barra y est\u00e1 se recargar\u00e1 lentamente, pero los arquetipos en reposo se recargan m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido.\n\nEl juego tiene un mont\u00f3n de trajes y armas (las cuales las armas personalmente me parecen horrendas) y cada traje le dar\u00e1 a lightning unas habilidades y unas estad\u00edsticas, tambi\u00e9n hay una cantidad de accesorios alt\u00edsima, pero eso es para vestir a lightning como un payaso o una princesita, a gusto de cada uno.\nTambi\u00e9n carece de un sistema de niveles, por lo que el farmeo se limitar\u00e1 a items y poco m\u00e1s, los \"niveles\" (que en si son mas vida, mas fuerza etc.) se consiguen haciendo misiones secundarias.\n\nEl juego se hace a contrareloj al estilo de Majora's Mask, s\u00f3lo que aqu\u00ed no volvemos al pasado en ning\u00fan momento, si morimos el juego se adelantar\u00e1 una hora y podemos volver al d\u00eda 1 con todas nuestras stats, armas y trajes, pero ser\u00e1 un reinicio completo y tendr\u00e1s que hacer las misiones de nuevo.\nLas misiones secundarias aparte de dar stats tambi\u00e9n dan d\u00edas extra para lighning y as\u00ed poder completar todo, (yo personalmente consegu\u00ed todos los d\u00edas y me sobr\u00f3 1 d\u00eda entero).\nTambi\u00e9n destaco que los eventos cambian seg\u00fan la hora del d\u00eda y algunas misiones s\u00f3lo est\u00e1n disponibles de noche, algunos sitios abren s\u00f3lo de noche, etc.\nEl juego te permite ir a cualquier area desde el principio haciendolo bastante libre a mi parecer, adem\u00e1s tiene New Game +, que en el puedes mejorar armas y armaduras y hay cosas extra.\n\nLa historia no es nada del otro mundo la verdad, sigue los eventos de Final Fantasy XIII-2 si mal no recuerdo, los personajes son aburridos y lo m\u00e1s disfrutable en cuanto a personajes es Lightning la cu\u00e1l actua como le da la gana casi siempre y tiene las mejores frases, mientras que lo m\u00e1s irritante es Hope, que no se calla la puta boca, nunca en mi vida tuve

"review": "[h1]Lightning Recadera Returns...[/h1]\n\n\nQue decir de este juego... pues que es bastante dificil de recomendar porque se aleja mucho de lo que es un Final Fantasy y porque como jrpg no termina de cuajar, para mi gusto.\nLightning returns es el tercer juego de la trilogia XIII que pone punto y final a las aventuras de lightning y compa\u00f1ia. Cierra por fin la historia que se sacaron de la manga en el XIII-2 para darle un final.\n\nDe la historia no hay mucho que contar... simplemente que esta todo tan masticado y estirado que no tiene ni sabor ni color. No sorprende ni engancha y solo dan vueltas a lo mismo. Ademas si nos centramos unicamente en ella, el juego dura bien poco.\n\nSin embargo, donde square enix se ha centrado en la mayor parte del tiempo es en las secundarias. Por motivos argumentales, las misiones secundarias en este juego son bastante importantes, ya que con ellas mejoras tus parametros de vida, fuerza, magia, etc... ademas de recibir otras recompensas. Eso hace, que te pases el 75% del juego completando secundarias al mas puro estilo recadero. Tiene algunas que marcan un poco de variedad pero la mayoria son de matar X bichos o conseguir tal candidad de objetos. Y al final, acabas hasta las narices de tanta secundaria.\n\nOtro de punto negativo el cual para mi es el PEOR de todos, es el tiempo. En este juego, tuvieron la brillante idea de poner un contador con el que tienes 13 dias para pasartelo y hacer todo lo que tengas que hacer. Eso te obliga a tener que ir con prisas a todos lados corriendo porque ademas, hay zonas que solo son accesibles de dia o de noche. El tiempo se pausa en menus, combates y videos pero por lo demas, sigue avanzando. Es cierto que hay una habilidad que sirve para parar el tiempo pero gasta puntos tactico de los cuales se consiguen matando monstruos.\n\nTengo que decir, que da tiempo a hacerlo todo sin muchos problemas pero aun asi, sigue siendo un dolor de cabeza el tema de tener que administrar el tiempo e ir con prisas por miedo a no llegar. Sin duda para mi, es una contra bastante molesta y que no tiene sentido poner en un rpg donde vas mucho a tu aire. Entorpece la experiencia jugable si eres de los que les gusta mirar el paisaje, etc.\n\nEn el sistema de combate, lo han cambiado donde ahora solo llevas a la protagonista que va cambiando de arquetipos que tu mismo personalizas con las habilidades que te gusten y sean eficazes en batalla. La base es parecida a la del XIII pero con un aire diferente con ataques en los 4 botones. Personalmente no me gusta ya que no dejar de ser otro experimento de square en intentar innovar.\n\nY esta vez han decidido por apostar por 4 zonas grandes con su ciclo dia y noche para alejarse de esos pasillos del primero juego de la trilogia. \n\nLa banda sonora resume temas de los dos anteriores juegos y a\u00f1ade otros nuevos bastante variados. No es top y ni se puede comparar con nobuo pero, es pasable con algun tema interesante sin mucho mas que decir.\n\nGraficamente tiene alguna mejora en comparacion con la version de consolas destacando la iluminacion y alguna textura. \nPero el port hace aguas. Si soporta 1080p y mas all\u00e1 pero los 60 fps bailan que dan gusto. En las 2 ciudades se baja a 30 fps... pero en zonas mas deserticas, se mantienen y en los videos y combates tambien. Generalmente es otra chapuza de port en la que podriamos decir que es menos chapuza que la del FFXIII y XIII-2 pero sigue estando lejos de lo esperado en pc.\n\nEn resumen, el juego para mi hace aguas porque tiene puntos muy peculiares que para algunos les puedes parecer un acierto y para otros una contra, como en mi caso. Se nota que lo sacaron para ganarse una pelas extras mientras hacian tiempo para trabajar con el FFXV. El juego se hace muy pesado y la mayoria del tiempo es completar secundarias como un loco con una historia donde no hay mas que contar. Eso si, por lo menos el ending es interesante y bastante largo. \n", "timestamp_created": 1496942015, "timestamp_updated": 1496942015, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515027284622192383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32184407": {"recommendationid": "32184407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049378562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5475, "last_played": 1496983142}, "language": "english", "review": "Redeems the series? ...Maybe.\n\nI played XIII : I liked the combat mechanics but the story bored me.

Content based comments. I'll not refer to the technical side of the game, since I'm not gamer enough to comment on it.\n\nIf you consider buying this game, get them all. All 3 of them. FINAL FANTASY\u00ae XIII, FINAL FANTASY\u00ae XIII-2 and LIGHTNING RETURNS: FINAL FANTASY XIII. And play through them all in this order before you judge the storyline. \nThis set of games has a complicated storyline with lots of details and temporary endings that won't be resolved until the very end. THat's what I really like about this series. I've heard a lot of people saying the main character Lightning is cold. Not only can I not agree with it, it's also resolved at the very end. \n\nFinal Fantasy - as far as I could grasp the concept so far (I'm no expert) with it's games, movies and series - deals with the topics of things coming to some end in some sense (as in \"Final\") and the dreams, hopes, illusions people have (as in \"Fantasy\"). What hope is left and born when you reach the end? So naturally there's a lot of complexity involved. A lot of \"reading between the lines\" is required. And the very best of it: as much as there's \"good\" and \"evil\", in the Final Fantasy stories there's like a TON of \"in-between\". The developers show the light and shades within everyone and everything. \n\nSo, if you are not scared and interested into diving into the complexity of mankind, this game is for you.\nIf you want to learn and see what potentials \"drama\", \"bad luck\" and \"tragedy\" can bring forth, this game is for you.\nIf you like beautiful scenery, music and character design, this game is for you.\nIf you like a bit of fighting (which can be adjusted in difficulty and frequency by personal taste) but mainly enjoy stories, this game is for you.\n\nThis game is probably NOT for you if you ar hardcore gamer loving overly difficult gameplay, grinding and so on. You can dive into the complexity of the game and find out about all of te effect and how to use them best and you can go out for hunting for hours BUT you don't need to.

The lack of effort in this aspect of the port really shows. \n\nThe cut scenes are great - Everyone has silky, flowing hair at all times.  There must have been strategically placed fans everywhere to accomplish this. \n\nThe framerate is good - 60fps was not a problem, happy about that\n\nThe UI is quite poor - some of the HUD elements take up a third of the screen and this looks even worse at high resolutions.  \n\nImmersion is poor - There's a nice environment, a nice game world, which I would have liked to spent time in.  Yet I found that the game was not very immersive; between the time limit which discouraged exploration of the world and the character Hope's constant nagging and prattling, the enjoyment was gone. This was the biggest factor for me.\n\nGear system is interesting - I liked the gear and abilities centered around the garb.  Though there's lots of scope for variety here, in practice there wasn't that much.  The explanations, not just for gear but even things like synthesis, required multiple dialog boxes which indicates very little thought going into UI.  \n\nQuests, combat are dull - There were mostly fetch quests with very little story which failed to keep the pace interesting.   The combat was pretty dull and repetitive as it's always a breakaway into an 'isolated arena' (for lack of a better phrase) and there's a constant need for stars and reporting at the end of it.  I'm surprised I wasn't given an Excel file at the end of each fight so I can datamine it.\n\nOverall it felt like this would only be enjoyed if you're already a fan of the FF series or already know what to do.  \n\nFor newcomers, it's a poor introduction to the Final Fantasy world.

I personally do not have a high ened pc so I can not vouch for this. But even with a decent graphics card, it still drops on my computer.

Jugablemente es el m\u00e1s experimental y diferente de los tres, aunque algunas de las mec\u00e1nicas nuevas no funcionan del todo bien, aun as\u00ed, como conjunto el juego es bastante solido. Si ya jugaste los anteriores y te gustaron, es casi obligatorio que juegues la conclusi\u00f3n.\n\nEs un requisito hablar del port como primer punto si se analiza un juego japon\u00e9s, en este caso con mayor raz\u00f3n, porque tanto el xiii y xiii-2 ten\u00edan ports que dejaban mucho que desear,  lightning returns sin embargo, tiene un port decente, en un principio pensaba que el juego no dispon\u00eda de opciones gr\u00e1ficas, grande fue mi sorpresa al notar que se encontraban en la parte alta de la ventana, como si de un emulador se tratase, fuera de la presentaci\u00f3n algo cutre, las opciones graficas esta vez son bastante amplias, y el port en si funciona excelente, no se libra de bajones en momentos espec\u00edficos, pero en t\u00e9rminos generales, en esta ocasi\u00f3n el port no es para nada un punto negativo.\n\nMec\u00e1nicamente es el juego que m\u00e1s se aleja de las anteriores entregas de la sugsaga XIII, ahora tenemos un mundo abierto a nuestra disposici\u00f3n, dividido en 4 \u00e1reas, con d\u00eda y noche, y un reloj que nos estar\u00e1 indicando siempre la hora en la que nos encontramos, y es sobre el tiempo que gira le mec\u00e1nica principal del juego, tendremos inicialmente 5 d\u00edas para completar las quest principales (tiempo del juego), pero que podremos ampliar haciendo misiones secundarias, que nos dan los NPC que nos encontraremos regados por el mapa, algunos solo aparecer\u00e1n en horas espec\u00edficas, las cuales tienen en varios casos una historia interesante de seguir, pero que se limitan a ser misiones de ve y tr\u00e1eme, por contraparte las quest principales son pocas, pero est\u00e1n mucho m\u00e1s elaboradas. En combate esta ocasi\u00f3n solo usaremos a lightning, aunque podremos cambiar durante las peleas entre tres trajes que tengamos equipados, hay varias decenas de trajes a desbloquear, incluidos los de los DLC, se incluyeron todos en la versi\u00f3n de PC excepto el de aerith, cosa que no entiendo, ya que el personaje es de su autor\u00eda, no hay excusa de licencia, cada uno de estos trajes es completamente personalizable, desde el arma, escudo, y las 4 habilidades, la \u00fanica diferencia entre los trajes es, aparte del aspecto, algunas pasivas especiales, y 1 o 2 habilidades ligadas. Hablando del combate, ahora es m\u00e1s parecido a un hack n slash que a un jrpg tradicional, ya no tienes que elegir la acci\u00f3n que quieras realizar desde una lista, sino que se ejecuta al tiempo que presiones el bot\u00f3n al que est\u00e9 ligada la habilidad, el uso de estas gasta una barra de estamina, cada uno de los tres trajes que llevamos equipados tiene una barra propia, lo cual hace que tengamos que estar alternando entre trajes para que se recargue la barra del traje que acabamos de utilizar, tendremos habilidades ofensivas, tanto f\u00edsicas como m\u00e1gicas y las guardias, que sirven para mitigar el da\u00f1o enemigo, o en caso de hacerlo con un timing perfecto aturdirlos. En general estos cambios pueden llegar a sentirse intimidantes al inicio, sobre todo el l\u00edmite de tiempo, puede llegar a agobiarte, pero si haces una planificaci\u00f3n m\u00ednima de lo que vas a hacer durante los d\u00edas y haces varias secundarias, al final te sobraran d\u00edas, una vez te adaptas a las mec\u00e1nicas nuevas, el juego se vuelve muy divertido. \n\nLa historia se desarrolla 500 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s del final del xiii-2, la gente desde ese entonces dejo de envejecer, aunque si pueden morir de enfermedades o accidentes, algo as\u00ed como una inmortalidad a medias, y ya no nacen nuevos seres humanos, aparte de eso el caos empez\u00f3 a consumir el mundo poco a poco, llev\u00e1ndolo a su inminente final, Lightning es despertada de su sue\u00f1o de cristal por el Dios de la luz, bhunivelze, quien la env\u00eda como su redentor al mundo, d\u00edas antes de que este llegue a su final, para que salve el mayor n\u00famero de almas posibles, para transportarlas a un nuevo mundo que el mismo creara. La inmortalidad es un tema que siempre me ha llamado la atenci\u00f3n, y si bien no est\u00e1 tocado de manera profunda en este juego, s\u00ed que hay cosas interesantes que ver, como lo cansadas que est\u00e1n de vivir muchas personas, o Yusnaan una ciudad que vive de fiesta todo el tiempo esperando el fin del mundo, como si de una celebraci\u00f3n se tratase. Regresan los personajes principales de las entregas previas y se le da un cierre a la historia de cada uno de ellos, casi no se deja ning\u00fan cabo suelto, se siente como un final bonito de ver, y un gran cierre para esta aventura que se extendi\u00f3 a lo largo de tres juegos.\n\nGraficamente es un poco inconsistente, los escenarios son sencillos en cuanto a detalles, pero tienen vistas que son hermosas, los modelados de los personajes principales siguen igual de impresionantes que en el primer t\u00edtulo, pero el de los secundarios deja bastante que desear, y en esta ocasi\u00f3n es m\u00e1s evidente, porque interact\u00faas bastante con ellos. El Ost por otra parte es magn\u00edfico como cabe esperar de cualquier final fantasy, regresan muchas canciones de los dos juegos previos, pero se agregan suficientes novedades como para sentirlo fresco.\n\nPara terminar, empec\u00e9 esta trilog\u00eda con muy pocas expectativas, dado el odio de los fans de la franquicia, y si bien no son juegos perfectos, al terminar de ver la escena post cr\u00e9ditos de Lightning returns, el unico sentimiento que me quedo fue de satisfacci\u00f3n, disfrute mucho de las m\u00e1s de 140 horas que me dieron los tres t\u00edtulos de la subsaga XIII de Final Fantasy, y para m\u00ed con eso es suficiente para recomendarlos.", "timestamp_created": 1493265285, "timestamp_updated": 1493361751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776156604290008545", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31367514": {"recommendationid": "31367514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135143088", "num_games_owned": 630, "num_reviews": 447, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 123, "last_played": 1493095973}, "language": "english", "review": "People told me it would be better than 13-2.\n\nThey're liars.", "timestamp_created": 1493168607, "timestamp_updated": 1493168607, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534277915954589844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31353610": {"recommendationid": "31353610", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990203604", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1493106827}, "language": "english", "review": "SHUT UP HOPE.  STOP TALKING.  IM TIRED OF LISTENING TO YOU.\n\nI loved FFXIII.  I didn't really care for XIII-2, but someone told me Lightning Returns\u2122 was really good.  Great, even. \n\nWell, as it turns out, the only thing I like about the game is playing dress-up.  Didn't see that one coming, that's for sure.  What's there to dislike?  Well, everything.  The combat rewards frantic button mashing and constant role switching to HURRY UP AND STAGGER OH GOD rather than any semblance of planned out, calculated, turn-based combat.  Hit this button (or really, just hold it), then switch, then hit this button, then switch, then hit this button.  And block.  You block sometimes, I guess.  \n\nThe story?  I don't know, HOPE WONT SHUT UP.  Just kidding.  Lightning is literally the messiah sent by god to save everyone.  I know what you're thinking--\"that sounds REALLY stupid\".  Well, it sounds stupid because it is stupid.\n\nIn between Hope's constant babysitting of lightning (seriously Hope, shut up), you get a whole bunch of fetch quests around bland, uninteresting areas, sort of like a MMO.  The only thing that's different here is that there is no one around besides your buddy, your PAL, your BEST FRIEND WHO DOESN'T STOP TALKING EVER, HOPE.  Oh, and there are no quest markers either, and quest instructions are incredibly vague.  Haha, good luck.\n\nDid I mention that you have to complete these quests to \"level up\"?  Yeah, sorry, no actual levels or skill spheres or skill system here.  You've gotta do all of these awful, boring, unintuitive fetch quests while Hope talks about his mom, and if you want new items, or new skills, you have to kill the same boring mobs with the same boring AAAAA-BBBBB-XXXXX combat until you get what you want.\n\nAll of these super fun fetch quests, and, well, the entire game is given a time limit.  Wanna complete that fetch quest so you can get some fancy new stats because uh, reasons?  Well, sorry, that door is shut and won't be open until tomorrow, and who knows when that NPC is going to show back up.  I sure as hell don't, because I uninstalled the game.\n\nWhat was my (short) time spent doing in this game?  About 40% was watching cutscenes, 40% running around trying to find things for npc's I don't care about, 15% listening to Hope whine at me, and maybe 5% actually PLAYING the game--you know, actually in fighting mobs. \n\nI hate this game so much.", "timestamp_created": 1493111227, "timestamp_updated": 1493111227, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569087445735931396", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31350115": {"recommendationid": "31350115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268913101", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3961, "last_played": 1588339885}, "language": "english", "review": "...", "timestamp_created": 1493090417, "timestamp_updated": 1493090417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31347391": {"recommendationid": "31347391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192132631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1372, "last_played": 1494433597}, "language": "english", "review": "Hardest game for me though, can someone cut the yggdrassil cause its annoy af, i need more time like 360 hours :) of course i recommended this game too", "timestamp_created": 1493074859, "timestamp_updated": 1493074859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31304331": {"recommendationid": "31304331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061157558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 3846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3846, "last_played": 1491883426}, "language": "english", "review": "Time management simulator.

I am a huge fan of the FF 13 series - that is a statement that many people would already gut me for, seeing how saying that you like the 13 series is equal to commiting treason. I never found a reason to dislike it though - but this is a review for the third installment in that series, not an autobiography about my (maybe bad?) taste in video games.\n\nAfter the events of 13-2, Lightning awakes out of her crystal slumber and finds out that the world succumbed to chaos. She is then tasked by god to save the remaining souls of the world, so that he may build a new world where all the souls she saved are reborn. From then on, Lightning plays the role of the savior, saving souls and people for the sole reason of guiding them to a new world before the current one dies after the 13th day - and the ultimate hope of God keeping his promise, the resurrection of Lightnings sister Serah in return for her work.\n\nI like the story - it keeps you on your toes, has a few twists and turns and, if you played the old FF 13 games, follows old and working conventions. The side quests of the game are very interesting, in my opinion, as most of them have their own lesson to teach you about life, love and the inevitability of death. Time is important, and how you use it even more so - the game runs on a clock which makes you plan your every move ahead of time.\n\nFrom then on, you run around in 4 open areas, following main quests, meeting old and well-known characters, fulfilling plenty of side quests to save the souls of the inhabitants of the world and battle monsters.\n\nThe battle system of FF 13-3: LR is a pretty unique one. You can switch between 3 garbs (think, classes) in battle, slinging spells and attacking the enemy head-on in an active battle system. Before the battle, you create schematas, consisting of a garb, a weapon, a shield, two accessories and 4 spells/attacks, between which you can then change in battle, depending on your needs.\n\nI wish I could review all elements of the game in depth; since my review can't be THAT long, however, I will list my personal pros and cons of this game here and then drop a quick conclusion and rating.\n\n[b] Pro: [/b]\n- The battle System feels fun and fluid. You constantly guard from enemy attacks and attack when you have an opening\n- Over 80 different garbs with different attributes and basic spells ensure there is a battle style (or three!) for everyone\n- Every enemy has different behaviours, stagger requirements (essentially starting a phase where the enemy can't attack and you deal increased damage) and attacks\n- The game offers the right amount of challenge\n- Beautiful music all throughout the game\n- The time mechanic, while not liked by many, actually makes the game so much better. It is lenient - you will have enough time to do everything in the game as long as you aren't too lazy - but keeps you on your toes and makes you plan ahead, which I personally loved\n- Interesting story, though if you haven't liked the story of the two previous games, chances are this won't change, but it's unconventional for sure\n\n[b] Con: [/b]\n\n- The improvement system for weapons and shields is restricted to New Game +, something I don't really understand. Until then, improving your equipment is not possible.\n- While many of the garbs look and sound cool, not all of them are equally effective and many of them are downright useless and will never be used by anyone. Some garbs are just objectively better than many others\n- Some of the fights require certain stagger strategies; while that is not bad as far as tactics go, it is sometimes unclear why exactly you can't stagger an enemy, even if the enemy menu tells you what you have to do. Some fights rely on staggering too much, which can be annoying (but also makes it a bit more tactical)\n- There aren't many enemy varieties in the game - unlike FF 13 which had tons of different enemy models, there are only a handful found in this game, some even recolored; though the models are still very detailed and a joy to look at\n- While the voice acting of the main characters is fine as usual (in my opinion), the many side characters can't offer the same level of consistency - they are often just bad or average\n- While many quests in the game are at least somewhat interesting, there are also a few that I couldn't bother to care about at all\n- If you haven't played the previous two games, chances are you will miss a lot of references and can't connect to the characters as well\n\nConclusion: If you have played and liked the first two FF 13 games, chances are you will love this as pretty much everything has improved. If you haven't, you should play those first, as otherwise you will miss a lot of connections and references - this game is not a good entry point to the series, even if the datalog tells you information about the history of the characters.\n\nAside from a few annoyances and flaws, the game is very fun and fluid and will keep you on your toes thanks to the (mostly) fun battle system and (largely) interesting time mechanic.\n\nPersonal rating: 9/10 (Amazing)", "timestamp_created": 1492523481, "timestamp_updated": 1494888389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614157199859619141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31161825": {"recommendationid": "31161825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126803076", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 34199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2016, "last_played": 1625672455}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\nInteresting story.\nGreat music\nJapan Audio\n\nCons:\nTIME LIMIT\nTIME LIMIT\nTIME LIMIT\n\nbut still i give 10/10 for this game, and for Lightning\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1492279601, "timestamp_updated": 1492279601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50388801097869873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31131103": {"recommendationid": "31131103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262012210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3633, "last_played": 1494697883}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bien, la historia es complicada de seguir si no has jugado a anteriores FFXIII.

I really like some of the game's\u2019 mechanics. I dig the combat and the timed nature of the game, that forces you to think about what quests to do in what order. The combat is fun, and discovering good builds and combination was imo the best part of the game. However, there are many problems with this game, and I can\u2019t honestly tell if I love or hate it after 120+ hours. I can say I thoroughly enjoyed many hours, and endured some through sheer stubbornness. I\u2019ve only seriously played FF4, FF8 and FF10, so my knowledge about the series as a whole is limited. I played a bit of FF13-1 and FF13-2 but I didn\u2019t at all like their mechanics. Lightning Returns (LR) has better mechanics than both, and I can recommend the game based on that alone, as long as you have low expectations elsewhere. I picked it up because I knew it had majora\u2019s Mask mechanics, which was neat. PC ports are also cheaper than on console! \n\n[b]Slightly Passive-Aggressive Rant about Open World and LR[/b]\nFF to me means a story well told with a casual fun approach to turn-based combat. LR partially succeeds by merging turn based combat with timed \u201cworld time\u201d. I like this idea since it adds urgency to the plot. Speaking of plot,  the story is really poor in its execution, and suffers from its attempt at being open world. As \"The Savior\", Lightning must save souls by helping people in need, as  sh*tty MMO quests. In the Witcher 3, most of the enjoyment I had was the fun I had was side quests, because the dialog entertaining and (sometimes) had real impact on the main story. Additionally, Gerald provides a service not easily substituted. Lightning, Demigod by trade,  does mundane tasks I\u2019m supposed to believe  literally saves soul from the dying world. Imagine someone doing for you such a favor, that your soul leaves your physical body in salvation because I found your f*cking doll that went missing? Also you go to hell when if it\u2019s the wrong one btw.  This idea does not work well with the majority of the side quests, and many of them could easily have been left out. It is not clear how many side quests are required to not fail on the final day, but the game makes it very clear immediately that you must do  as many side quests as possible. I ended up completing most of them, and they were not worth it. \n\n[b]Story[/b]\nHonestly, I skipped all cutscenes that didn\u2019t revolve around the main plot. After the first few hours I realized that the background story pretty much is that people are biologically immortal, and therefore bored. Since the world is nearing its end, you\u2019d think people be panicking, and grow continually more unstable as the plot escalates. It would even make sense as the final installment in the FF13 trilogy.  However, the world is open and casual in its mood which just doesn\u2019t fit the urgency it so desperately tries to instill. LR would work as entry in the series where you discover much grander plot at the end, opening for sequels. Ironically, I think FF13-1 with that counter would work better as the series\u2019 conclusion.  \n\nThis is that one time, where having more grit and sorrow would be useful infuse some humanity into the vacant lot that is my feelings for whatever this game calls a plot. The main story is very short, so while I had little enjoyment, it also didn\u2019t waste much of my time. I wish the LR was more linear and had more playable characters in the party. I didn\u2019t care for any of the characters in the story, because they are so poorly written. I think this is a SE problem rather than LR specifically though. I do appreciate that much of the dialog were voice acted.\n\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe combat is simple and fun, and is where the game shines. 4 abilities can be mapped at once per costume. Lightning can use 3 costumes per battle you can freely switch between. Each costume comes with at least one ability, and some minor stat bonuses. The costumes are class variations that can be collected or bought at in-game stores. The fanservice is pretty obvious, and it doesn\u2019t make much sense that changing to a different bra somehow makes you more tanky and less proficient with weapons. It would be so much simpler if you could switch between 6-8 classes with, where each class has a unique ability. Instead I have to go through minor class variations that only differs slightly.  It's made so you think there is more content than there actually is, and unnecessary since you already have great control over what abilities to use. That said, the best part of the game is making a setup that works for a hard boss, and succeeding with winning combos. This applies to abilities that can be found as monster drops and leveled up my a merchant. He merges your abilities together. While cool in theory, an xp meter would be so much better, as it doesn\u2019t fill your inventory with HUNDREDS of those.\n\n I just went from A to B for the otherwise fun combat and light platforming. As an Jak trilogy player I\u2019m used to platforming, and while it did spice up LR\u2019s gameplay, the platforming elements lacked depth and variety, and was only once or twice the fun of the level.  Besides  missing more unique effects on found equipment, the actual gameplay is rather good, I\u2019m just way to p*ssed off about everything else!\n\n[b]UI[/b]\nSpeaking of p*ssed of, the worst part of LR is how much time you need to spend in the damn menus! About a half the time is spent in menus for the following reasons: \n1) Useful stuff, like planning a route that completes the most side quests, changing gear, and setting abilities. \n2) You\u2019re stuck in poorly thought-out upgrading loop for abilities that you cannot perform in a batch!\n3) Pause to activate the temporary time freeze. \n\nWhile no. 1) works fine, the overly animated menus take a long time to load, even on a SSD, but I can manage it. No. 3) is really annoying since the time freeze is so short, and I wonder why they didn\u2019t increase the cost and the time so you spend less time in the menus or gave me a shortcut, because it really breaks the flow. While you don't have to freeze time to make it to the end, you do feel incentivized to not waste EP that you gain from battles. This is a lesser issue on higher difficulties.  No. 2) is the worst. It can take a long time to fully level-up an ability, since it can only be done one step at a time, and each step requires enough clicks that I question why I bother with the game when I have to do so. Go watch a video that shows how this is done, I don\u2019t want to bother you with it. \n\n[b]Misc[/b]\nI could go on about the other less important mechanics and features, but they\u2019re honestly not that interesting. Completing battles give you EP which is used for spells (time freeze, escape battle, teleport to map  etc.). There is also a Day/Night cycle influence what quests are active, but it\u2019s more annoying than the immersion is worth. The world in LR is really big, and I wish there were more teleport spots, because lots of traveling on foot/chocobo is needed that also takes time. Lastly, I liked the soundtrack, but I did find it to loop too often.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThe end of the world in a finite time as a hard failure state is a nice excuse to force tension, but only if you have a reason  to give a f*ck about the story or the characters, which I don\u2019t, because the characters and plot are boring, predicable and monologuing.  Additionally, LR has an annoying tendency to to force you pause the game to do mundane tasks that I\u2019d wish weren\u2019t to important for my progression to skip.\nI like the combat, and the occasional platforming had its moments.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019d recommend the game on the basis that if you aren\u2019t bothered by menus, and can play a game solely for its mechanics, you might still have a good time. The story isn\u2019t worth the effort, just skip the cutscenes unrelated to the main story which is also rather short compared to the time spent doing sidequests, which is most of the content.", "timestamp_created": 1491269489, "timestamp_updated": 1508021920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30908454": {"recommendationid": "30908454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014088925", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1488162968}, "language": "english", "review": "There is something about this game that just not fit for me.\nI lovd the old turned base fighting, this is a bit to new for me.\nOverall I would say this is an awesome game if you just bare with it.\nI just could not bare it sadly.\nJust asked my money back after playing 15 minutes of it.\nNot my type of coockie anymore.\nThey should just bring back the Final Fantasy 7 style that was THE final fantasy legend with Cloud and Sephiroth they should revamp this story and bring it back.\nDamn I heard they are already I am waiting impatiently.", "timestamp_created": 1491160283, "timestamp_updated": 1491160283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439274460077285767", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30886446": {"recommendationid": "30886446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094502210", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1491775585}, "language": "english", "review": "just dont like it", "timestamp_created": 1491081356, "timestamp_updated": 1491081356, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.276917189359664917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30885446": {"recommendationid": "30885446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030488875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8028, "last_played": 1523124849}, "language": "english", "review": "The combat mechanics are interesting and an improvement over the previous games for the most part. The story is basic and predictable for anyone who played the previous two installments in the FFXIII trilogy, but reads more like a DLC than a full title. I have three main complaints about the gameplay:\n\n1. New Game + (loading the post-credits autosave of a playthrough) is required to unlock equipment upgrading. Hard mode is required in addition to that for tiers 4, 5, and \u2605 of abilities as well as fully upgrading your stuff.\n\n2. Garb-locked, non-upgradeable abilities mean that late game you're likely either burning an ability slot for a useful passive (Equilibrium+) or selecting a sub-par or nonexistent passive to avoid wasting an ability slot (Stone and Sand). I don't like the design of 90% of them either, but I wasn't a fan of costume design in the other titles either so no surprises there.\n\n3. Time only serves as a speed bump to quest completion. Many people only exist for 4 hours every day, and some must be talked to on up to 4 separate days.

FFXIII just did a good job of setting up the characters so I would grow to care about them - which is why FFXIII-LR could have a successful story. I really enjoyed how the game went into a bit of a darker direction, showing how characters would change in a declining world and the characters that were rightous and good suddenly turned out to be disillusioned and either desperate or resigned. I do like the world; in this setting, people never age and never die but also no humans are born. There are characters who have been children for centuries; and those ages old people now await the end of the world in a way thats quite... apathetic, honestly. Cities go on existing like they used to. Most people dont seem to bother with changing their routine. At first t felt out of place but when I remembered those people have been alive for centuries with little changes to their situation, well, it made sense. \nIn some places you team up with other characters - and again, its interesting to see how their lives turned out and what kind of people they became, centuries later after FFXIII and FFXIII-2 - but otherwise you play on your own. I did wish there was at least one character who would join your party permemently though; maybe the white chocobo would be a nice touch since it would save time on transportation.\nSpeaking of time - people complained about time limit and I admit, at first I disliked it. I dont like feeling limited in any way in games I like taking my time but let me assure you, the time you get is plenty. The main quest and the side missions help to add extra days as well so dont worry if at start it seems like too little. You have an ability to stop time as well and if youre farming monsters, thats really useful and lets you go on for hours and hours of farming. I actually grew to enjoy the time limit as it added a time management element to the game and I found it fun to plan what to do when. \nThe different outfits and weapons were a really nice touch but on the downside you could be stuck with an outfit you dislike onlybecause its the strongest.\nAll in all a good conclusion to the FFXIII trilogy and an enjoyable game.

You can block whenever you want but not against all types of attacks, you can roll/evade using barely any or no action points, but you can not evade every types of attacks either, the action points would still be there, but it would only be used when using special attacks, heavy attacks and magic.\nYou'd be fighting more enemies this way, it would be even more challenging (how I imagine it at least)\nI don't really care about the fighting being separated by the rest of the World, it's Final Fantasy after all.\nSo in the end, I am not saying that the gameplay itself should be changed (combos, attacks, etc), but the way how it works, imgine something like The Witcher 3/Dark Souls/The Elder Scrolls perhaps?\n\nIt's still pretty great, but in my opinion, if the gameplay was like how I imagine it, it would be way better.\nThe game seems to have an average amount of content from what I've seen.\nThe DLCs are pretty cool, and they comes with the base game so that's a plus.\nThere could be more outfits and weapons from other Final Fantasy games but anyway, it still is great.\nWould have been cool if they would have bring the characters so they could be playable (only when you replay bosses stages) instead of just having their weapons and costumes for Lightning.\n\nThe graphics are fine considering it's a console port, nothing exceptional for the PC but nothing too disgusting to look at either.\n\nSo here i'll be giving this game 7.5/10 \n\nI would love to see Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy XV on PC/Steam someday!\nA game similar to Final Fantasy XIV but single-player/offline would be great too.\nA new Dissidia game made for the PC would also be pretty neat.\nA new Crisis Core that would also be on the PC would be cool.\nThere's so many Final Fantasy titles that could be bring or made for the PC.\nImagine an open world Final Fantasy game \u00e0 la The Witcher 3 but where you would create your character with some hack & slash gameplay.\nThat would be pretty neat.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489611788, "timestamp_updated": 1489611788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51904749870300293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30525520": {"recommendationid": "30525520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025047553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 139, "playtime_forever": 1652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1652, "last_played": 1489585583}, "language": "english", "review": "Cons:\n- It's the cheesiest of all FF writing when it comes to the main plot\n- Hope never shuts up.\n\nPros:\n- It's a pretty fun game with interesting mechanics\n- The side quests have some good small storylines", "timestamp_created": 1489587087, "timestamp_updated": 1489587087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30495889": {"recommendationid": "30495889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042715298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9446, "last_played": 1659491020}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite of the FF XIII series.

Because i literally finished EVERYTHING else. \nYou have more time then you'll ever need. But you have to plan your day. So before starting a new day, set yourself goals where you wanna be at what time. And if you have \"spare\" time, get  to new areas, and begin quests there.\n\nLightning Returns isn't an easy game, unlike XIII-2. It has hard fights, you can definetly run into \"overpowered\" monsters right from the start. But you'll get stronger. You'll learn the mechanics of the game, which are pretty neat. You'll have hard, yet fun fights, and have to be on your toes even in \"easy\" fights. And once you really get into it, it plays smooth and rewarding. Soon you realize you can kill every enemy, boss, if you play well, even if they are \"overpowered\". \nYou also have to manage a lot- you can't just outlevel enemies. If you don't setup your equipment for a boss, you will have a hard time. It takes thought, and a bit of\" trial and error\". Mashing \"attacks\" without blocking will get you killed in about 5 seconds. Same goes for items: you can't carry endless amount of items to cheese yourself through everything. \n\n And even IF u hit a wall: you can do every \"part\" of the main quest in your order. Can't beat a mid-boss? Go ahead start the MQ in another zone, maybe you'll get a spell that's effective against the boss you are struggleing with.\n\nBut this is what makes this game so great. It's not a walk in the park. It forces you to think about your setup and route you go.  If you like a CHALLENGING game, i'll definetly recommend it. It's not unfair by any means, just .. not easy.

Atleast put in a timestop where you can choose the \"job\" you want.\n\n\nTo be frank, this games remind me a little about FF7:Crisis core. \n\nThis is all just what ive gathered thru 3 hours of gameplay, but this game seems like its just a spin-off just to wringe the last few dollars out the FF13 serie.\n\nI do not recommend this game", "timestamp_created": 1488389303, "timestamp_updated": 1488389303, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483001172542572021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30258521": {"recommendationid": "30258521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006336125", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 2015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2015, "last_played": 1464989147}, "language": "english", "review": "unnecesary sequel if they would have finished the last FF properly, new combat system (better than before), but boring plot, and you are in a countdown the entire game which is very stressfull, so not recommended unless you are very very fan of lightning (yeah you are a godness, but doing some quest like a peasant)", "timestamp_created": 1488368283, "timestamp_updated": 1488374185, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30247579": {"recommendationid": "30247579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034246419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 3472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3472, "last_played": 1488371435}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR  I would recommend it especially as the game (trilogy) seems to go on sale often enough to warrant playing through them for 3 different gaming experiences that are loosely connected together by its characters.  Just remember you should approach this game for the fun/experience rather than the storyline so try your best to do a completely blind play through and ignore that RPG inclination to grind out and play \"perfectly\" using a strategy guide.\n\nGameplay is the game's strongest point and yet it doesn't get as much attention among the critics harping on the downsides of the game.  The overworld isn't a hallway like the first game's first half and feels more like an actual world than the disjointed mess accessed through a hub that was the second game.  As you get to the later part of the game you unlock connections to the areas and see how the world fits together.  Enemies run around the overworld, who can mostly be avoided by jumping or sprinting past them.  You can also use your weapon to smack them for a sizable chunk of their hp before the battle even begins but being ambushed unaware will result in you receiving a penalty instead when entering the battle.  Overall it's easy to constantly fight if you need or choose to avoid battles if you don't (except in very few cases or a few enemies types) so I didn't get that RNG frustration from replaying older FF titles.\n\nLet's talk briefly about the \"doomsday clock\" that people refuse to wrap their head around and immediately toss the game aside.  The Eradia system is the center of the resource management in this game, if you've played other action RPG games like Risen, Witcher or even Dark Souls, then you know how that plays in to the depth.  The battle system doesn't reward any experience for character level ups instead it gives you items/abilities, gil and Eradia points (EP) which you use to freeze the clock. You'll learn quickly that the tougher encounters give more EP and you're hit with a learning curve in either grinding out weaklings until extinct or suck it up and learn the tougher enemies without taking damage (as recovery items are limited) while balancing the tradeoffs of using powerful Eradia abilities in battle. This would be Final Fantasy's take on pushing the Action-RPG aspects in Turnbased combat to its limit with lots of reactions and swapping around.  After the steep learning curve even with its abundance of tutorials will require some practice to get used to and if you're playing on normal or Hard mode (NG+ only), reaction time and keeping track of the enemies' animations play a huge role to success.  Keeping track of where to restock EP and recovery items properly setting up for each battle where even common large enemies feel like minibosses to hunt down EP while staying alert to battle mechanics feels rewarding.  \n\nIf you're looking for a relatively less taxing experience easy mode is there that gives you passive HP regen and tons of EP that you can help finish every side quest and misc quest without the resource management needed to wander around aimlessly.  Remember that no matter what you do - even if you squander all your time away and ignoring Chronofreeze and the clock, you still retain all items, stat increases, gil and starting over from the beginning of the clock.  You can skip all the cinematic and avoid most battles if you don't need them so it's not frustrating rushing through areas you'll be overleveled for by avoiding all the trash enemies and getting extra gil for later. If you're a completionist then you'll be doing a Hard playthrough afterwards where it unlocks an item upgrade/crafting system and more into the spell leveling system and unlocks more items for the added difficulty.  Having many or all the sidequests complete gives you a sizable boost in stats and more equipment so it helps in reaching the different stagger conditions and launching and floating strategies which aren't explained much outside of experimentation.\n\nThe Controls on the PC Steam version is keyboard only as there are no options for using your mouse for moving the camera so you will have to getting used to using both hands on the keyboard for gameplay even after remapping (I would actually recommend a controller with two analog sticks for sure though).  Unfortunately this meant the camera would create some frustrating experiences in a \"Gary\" designed level based around platforming over time duration floating tiles where you can fall back to the beginning of the dungeon while being slowly poisoned by the dungeon and dealing with hard to avoid fire mages in tight corridors (Yes, I hate the Temple of the Goddess as the culmination of the bad things in this game).\n\nThe voice acting is passable (though cringey inducing at times) but there is enough there if you ignore the campy use of Japanese humor and culture.  Lightning Returns is a more than a bit ham-fisted with its religious subtext and the whole Jesus resurrection and Moses leading his people across the Red Sea but I did find myself interested enough in the returning cast to drive on through the narrative even if some events would make me scoff in passing.  The sidequests range from pretty good to extremely pointless drivel with very little inbetween.  The main story arcs don't have any great twists or surprises  which might seem like a negative to others but it was mildly satisfying moving through the light drama without feeling like the rug is being pulled out from beneath you.  It fails to meet expectations if you're here for the story but at least they tried to tie all the loose ends together.\n\nThe ending quickly devolves into a slew of anime tropes - just think Gundam, meets Power Rangers, meets the Dragonball Z yet the very final twist was satisfying for me at least because the uncharacteristic vibe from Lightning.  It didn't feel a need to explain the new game plus mechanic outside of one nod of dialogue which is totally fine with me because reasons I stated above in the gameplay section.  It's not exceptional in anyway and much of it is to justify the gameplay and missions involved but it's a step up from the mess that 2nd game was for sure.\n\nThe  cinematics live up to the beautiful FMVs reputations and the flashy elaborate choreography is nice to look at especially at the end.  Toriyama takes a page from his X-2 book and invests a lot into his costumes or garbs in this game with Lightning being clad in some ridiculous outfits.  Unfortunately everything else from character models, area textures and battle animations are just recycled from the previous two games.  This means some costumes don't fit Lightning's head model at all.  Not to mention adornments that seem to be floating around her body when she is the only controllable character in this game simply because they wanted to use these adornments on a variety of other NPCs to help their looks.  This could be considered fine in cutting costs for the game in reusing the perfectly workable models but with porting a few but creating even fewer new enemies, this creates a very limited set of new enemies that are just reskinned into 2~3 different versions and boss monsters become common enemies to add to only 35 or so variety of enemies.  The tacted on feel doesn't stop there as you see the same attack animations for a large variety of skills even if they have different effects.  The entire \"last ones\" quest and even their rewards are just the assets with their texture stripped so they appear weirdly purple/pink rather than bothering to reskin them or giving them an aura of some sort.  Music is all recycled from the previous two games as well - which might be nostalgic for some but I found myself getting all too familiar of the very limited music and sfx variety as well.  I would say the overall visuals and sounds are below average but still passable", "timestamp_created": 1488313442, "timestamp_updated": 1488313570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30201051": {"recommendationid": "30201051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032822667", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 714, "last_played": 1489012921}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Para mi el peor de todos los final fantasy, pierde toda la esencia llevando un solo personaje, la historia aburrida y adem\u00e1s a contratiempo.", "timestamp_created": 1488128948, "timestamp_updated": 1488128948, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43188178539276123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30177000": {"recommendationid": "30177000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156401018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1488052955}, "language": "english", "review": "Not recomended.

It requires some planning to set up your gear and schemata, to be ready for any situation, as any RPG should require.\nYou have 3 schemeta slots in your arsenal, with seperate ATB bars, you can fill those slots with garps (something like the job system in previous FF games), each having 4 ability slots and the ability to change between them mid-fight, feels like having a 3-man party in one, although I would prefer having 3 physicaly present members in a party. Well you can't blame them for trying someting different.\n- The main story seems interesting enough, feeding you with small bits of information, while hinting you with some potential twists and turns, but since this is Square, great story and big twists are to be expected.\n- The side quests are one of the three cons about this game, they tend to get tedious, sometimes simply boring, very out of place, with no real purpose (although side-quests are not supposed to have any real puprose in an RPG, its worse in FF13:LR).\n- Another bad thing are the controls, when you start playing the game, unaware of the issue, you will most likely start on the keyboard...then it gets tricky...the controls are all over the keyboard, the game is in dire need of a controller and a few hours to set the controls on the Big Picture mode to match the game controls, if you try to bypass the Big Picture controller settings and go blind, you are quaranteed to have the buttons all messed up with the game commands/actions.\n- The biggest con is the time management element, although Final Fantasy 13: Lighting Returns is an open world RPG game, they went and \"narrow\" your choises, not with the \"where\", but with the \"when\". Some may say that there's too much time on your hands, you don't need to worry about the time limit, on the other hand, when you have a clock ticking, while trying to focus on your surroundings for NPCs, that might have side-quests or something to say/give or for treasure boxs or shining things and at the same time Hope pops from time to time to comment on story developments or feelings or whatever bugs him at that current momment...it's more annoying than enjoying. You feel like you want to stop time...guess what, you can, but it's only for 30 in-game minutes and it costs resources.\n- Overall is a decent game, if you get the hang of the time management system is actualy enjoyable, and you can expect magnificent battles that only Square can give you.", "timestamp_created": 1488021421, "timestamp_updated": 1498200955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595620274543762207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30156359": {"recommendationid": "30156359", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960279937", "num_games_owned": 873, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 2331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1623, "last_played": 1487989942}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has more style than substance but don't take that to mean I think the game's bad.\n\nSo, we'll start with the aesthetics because they're top-notch.  I'd say Square pretty much at its best.  Everything looks good, sounds good, and is pretty much just good.  More importantly, Lightning looks good and sounds good and is good.  Sorry, leave your waifu at the door, there's only room for how beautiful, intelligent, and the Best Lightning is.\n\nCore gameplay revolves around dressing up Lightning in clothing that gives her mechanical benefits or penalties and will pretty much decide how you're playing the game.  Lightning can shift between three costumes in battle and they function more or less similarly to the paradigms from previous games.\nStaggering is still around and sometimes the mechanic is not as intuitive as it needs to be considering how important it is towards encounter/monster balance.\nThe Time Limit is not as bad as you'd think.  I literally spent the last 6 days skipping ahead because I'd already accomplished everything I was going to do.  Also, achieving the True Ending is doable on your first playthrough but is Very Difficult without some of the benefits of New Game+ like Upgrading Weapons and Armor (a design decision I disagree with massively).\n\nThe story is batshit insanity.  I'm talking Kingdom Hearts crazy.  It's not that it's complicated, but it's huge in scope and a lot of it is zany.

I bought this game hoping to play a good action JRPG, since buying Tales of Symphonia wasn't enough. After hearing that this game had a more real-time approach to the series' turn-based combat, I jumped in.\n\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is a JRPG that defies as many genre conventions as it possibly can, featuring non-linear exploration, a singular protagonist as opposed to a team of six or more, and a mission-based structure akin to a Western RPG. I enjoyed this free reign over where I could go and what I could do, even if it was all under a time limit. In fact, I do actually like the time limit because it gives the game a sense of urgency, adding stakes to the whole 'saving people's souls' thing.\n\nThe weakest part of Lightning Returns, in my opinion, is the story. I don't have to know anything about the previous games to know that this story is just stupid. The dialogue is convoluted and forced at times, some of the characters make some odd choices over the course of the story, and the story overall lacks a clear sense of focus. I do think Lightning as a protagonist is compelling, if a bit wish-fulfilling. From the very first cutscene, it's pretty clear what kind of story this is supposed to be, and I can't fault it too much if the writers stopped giving a crap halfway through. 'Tis a shame, though. :/\n\nLightning Returns as a game, however, is better than I expected. Exploration and mission-based structure aside, the battle system is akin to an infusion of the Tales series and Valkyrie Profile in some respects. Being able to select moves and pressing a single button to execute them sounds simplistic, but the game rewards you for thinking about when to strike instead of mashing buttons all the time. Granted, 90% of my battles consisted of a specific pattern (mash a button until ATB is gone, switch schemata, rinse and repeat), which made most encounters predictably easy, but there are monsters that require you to think a bit. Staggering enemies is a little finicky when you don't know exactly how to do it, especially since no one enemy gets staggered by the same thing.\n\nThe schemata system is also compelling, not just in how you can optimize your stats but also customize Lightning's apparel. A wide variety of clothing ranging from elegant to skimpy and weapons ranging from swords to spears gives Lightning various stat boosts and abilities. Some are good, some are not so good. If you plan on beating the final boss, you need to figure out what group of schemata works best for you. Lightning can have up to three Schemata at a time, which is pretty much essential to have if you plan on beating any of the bosses in the game. Personally, I made it through most of the game having one schemata for brute force, one for magic and one that balanced the two yet focused on defense more than attack.\n\nThe graphics are top-notch, as expected of Square Enix. The few CG cutscenes in the game are quite well-done, although the in-game engine is not too bad either. Every major character and town has a unique look and feel to it, and although the NPCs get a little samey every now and then, that's to be expected. The music ranges from ambient to bombastic, providing a wide variety of tunes both original and recurring in the series. I didn't really expect the music to be this good, but considering I liked a good deal of XIII-2's soundtrack, it makes sense. My favorite tune in this game is the epic title screen theme (and occasional battle theme), Lightning Returns. It makes a big deal out of her appearing from nowhere after hundreds of years in crystal sleep, doesn't it? :D\n\nSpeaking as a casual fan of Final Fantasy, if you have any interest in this kind of game at all, give it a shot. It's definitely different from the classic FFs, but it's certainly an enjoyable game. If you've never played any part of the FFXIII games, I'd say it's okay to start here. The game provides a bit of backstory and a glossary of characters and locations in case you don't know what's going on, but there will be some disconnect since it still kind of expects you to know who these characters are in order for some scenes to connect emotionally with the player. It's still a compelling game if you can look past that, and I give it my full recommendation.\n\nMaybe I should go buy FFXIII after this...", "timestamp_created": 1487266774, "timestamp_updated": 1487266774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610404670238494873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29961207": {"recommendationid": "29961207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067238803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2600, "last_played": 1484225765}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally everything comes all together in this game.

I had to stop because the story just became too full of itself for me. There are other issues that include the insane amount of fetch quests, the possibly unintended encouragement of massive amounts of saving & loading, and more. The game does have some good parts to it, but they weren\u2019t enough to keep me motivated to push through to the end.\n\nThis game has the worst Final Fantasy story I\u2019ve ever experienced. It comes down to the sub-par writing. They tried very hard to have a grand and epic tale only to utterly fail in keeping me invested in what was happening in the story. The situation is dire and Lightning has only 13 days to save as many souls as she can so that she can guide them into the new world before the old dies. She\u2019s able to do all of this because she made a deal to become the chosen savior of Bhunivelze, also known as God, in order to bring back Serah, her dead sister.\n\nThe story then becomes a pretentious melodrama that made me roll my eyes and sigh often. Over time, I just grew sick of everything. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about the characters anymore due to the awful storytelling. Almost everyone has been tragically suffering for hundreds of years, you\u2019re fighting against fate, the power of love can open doors and save souls inexplicably, Lightning somehow inspires everyone with her eloquence, and frequent conversations take place about God with Hope. It felt like a strange, alternate take on Christianity where Lightning is Jesus and the Chaos that\u2019s killing the world represents Revelations. It could have worked if they just toned down the overdramatic delivery. On the other hand, the regular side-quests had relatively okay writing.\n\nYou can find side-quests by talking to people or interacting with the Canvas of Prayers. While the former can sometimes have some writing and voice acting to back it up, mechanically, they\u2019re mostly uninteresting and forgettable fetch quests. You\u2019re going to be collecting X number of ingredients or items, usually with vague instructions or hints because you\u2019re expected to meander around aimlessly. Rarely will you have quest markers to help you out with these boring activities, making them frustrating too. It doesn\u2019t help when time is a precious and limited resource.\n\nYou have only 13 days to save as many souls as you can and the in-game timer reflects that and gives the player a sense of urgency. It also serves as a great annoyance. I think it\u2019s completely manageable since the game eventually gives you Chronostasis which allows you to stop the clock for a short amount of time. You do have to spend EP to keep casting it from the menu and more EP can be gained by killing monsters. I think it hurts the pacing of the game since I had to keep on casting it repeatedly when I was exploring or questing. I don\u2019t know why they went with this timer mechanic when they let you stop it. It\u2019s just there to inconvenience you with areas that open and close depending on time of day and the pressure it puts on you in general. I\u2019m not too keen on time management in a game that enjoys being vague.\n\nThe timer and the \u201cNormal\u201d difficulty lead to plenty of loading screens since wasted moves or failed battles can lead to a gargantuan loss of time. Being forced to escape from a failed battle means a loss of 1 hour (out of 24) and the game isn\u2019t afraid to throw overwhelming enemies at you from the very beginning. It\u2019s good that the saving and loading process is fairly quick since I would make saves before many encounters depending on health or if I fought it before. I\u2019d also make one before warping to a town at the start of a new day. At least once, I ended up in a town where the quest givers weren\u2019t present yet which meant I couldn\u2019t turn them in, wasting valuable in-game time and real life time (ohoho).\n\nThe outfits and costumes are probably the biggest draw of the game. They make zero sense when thinking about the narrative unless Lightning dressed as Cloud is canon now. I enjoyed them for the aesthetics. They also give you access to different abilities. There\u2019s a humongous collection of different outfits, weapons, shields, and head ornaments to wear (it helps that all the DLC items are unlocked from the start). They all make their way into the cutscenes too so you can have some really weird moments depending on what Lightning is wearing. I guess the game isn\u2019t that serious when the main story isn\u2019t involved.\n \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=858375182\n\nI wasn\u2019t too wild about the combat in this game. It\u2019s completely functional, but I couldn\u2019t perfect guard for the life of me. It\u2019s also not the most entertaining type of combat. You just keep track of weaknesses, hit them with attacks until they stagger, and then deal big damage to kill them. You\u2019d think outfit switching during battle would add much more strategy to the game, but they just allow you to fire off more attacks or tank more attacks depending on your Schemata (the classes you make) arrangement. I\u2019d be fonder of it if I could reliably find abilities, but you have to acquire them through treasure spheres or monster drops. Don\u2019t expect to find any in shops or in a skill tree (there isn\u2019t one). You do gain more EP abilities over time, so at least you have that.\n\nFinally, I just wanted to mention that the framerate frequently dipped down from 60 to as low as 40. It could not stay stable except during battles. For reference, I have Windows 10 64-bit, a GTX 970 (latest drivers), i7 4790K, and 16GB of RAM.\n\nWhile I enjoyed playing dress up with Lightning, the game\u2019s story drove me away. Otherwise I could\u2019ve kept going despite the timer and the lackluster combat, but unfortunately, the outfits and combat were not strong enough to carry the game by themselves. I usually want a good story with my RPGs, but failing that, you need an immersive world or great gameplay which Lightning Returns can\u2019t exactly provide. What it can do is let you wear a cactuar on your shoulder or even little chocobos.

So if you are new I recommend you to play Final Fantasy XIII & Final Fantasy XIII-2 first to be able to understand the Story completly.\n\nI have been struggleing for a while now to do a Review for this Game, simply because it is so amazing and I truly fell in love with it.\n\nTaking a little look back I owned this Game before it came to steam on xbox 360 and did not like it at all. On Console this Game can't even hold 30fps and mostly drops down to 10fps if not lower.\n\nBut 2 years ago this Game arrived as the final part of the trilogy on Steam and although I did not like it before I gave it a try as the FFXIII Series is my favourite for a very long time and I am glad I did because I absolutley fell in love with it!\n\nFirst of all coming over from the other 2 FFXIII Games, this game is not linear at all (which always was a big critic point for FFXIII) but rather open World. You are free to do whatever you would like to do & whenever you would like to do it. \n\nYou will have a Main Story, lots of side quests and a Time Limit to it, whilst this at first rather seems stressing and complicated it is not and you will very quickly get the hang of it just by playing.\n\nOnce you got the hang of the new open world system you will be introduced into the new Fightning System which is a huge upgrade and alot different then it was in the first 2 Games in the Series or in any previous Final Fantasy.\n\nUnlike before where you watch the Action happen and just stand around and take hits. You can now block and be more envolved with it. You once again have different paradigmas but only 3. \n\nRavenger (Magic), Commando (Physical) & Sentiel (Deffensive). For those of you that have played the First 2 Games you should already know these Paradigms. But this time it is different. Each Paradigm has its own equipment, because this time you not only equip rings and braclets.\n\nYou can actually Equip Lightning fully with different Armour Sets, Swords & Shields. But be wise, dont choose looks over abilities. Another huge Bonus Feature in here is that no matter what Armour you equip, you can change different Parts of it in whatever Colour you like. This Way you can create Lightning as uniqe as you like. \n\nWhilst she has Armour she also comes with the standard Braclets and Rings you can equip just like before. But now there is another difference. You can upgrade your Armour and your sword at a Blacksmith if you have the right Materiels for it, making it easier to overcome big Monster and Hard Challenges.\n\nAlso leveling up and becomming Stronger once again has changed from the previous Games. Before you had the Crystarium and had to collect CP (Crystarium Points) to be able to level up. This has been removed now. You can level up by completing Quests (side & main). So if you feel underpowered to do a certain thing in Main Quest, feel free to roam around and do some side Quests to help yourself and others out.\n\nA little Bonus might be that you can change the difficulty from the gat go to easy, previous games only had normal and hard. And you can also replay the Game as they added a New Game Plus (NG+) Mode.\n\nThe Story in this Game is very deep as much as it was in Final Fantasy XIII & Final Fantasy XIII-2 if not even deeper. It made me laugh and cry. Truly a Masterpiece and a great addition to the Series.\n\nAlthough I did not like this Game at first and was very judgmental of it. It surprised me all the way and I fell in love with it. It is honestly one of my favourite Games of all time.\n\nI do recommend this Game to any Final Fantasy, JRPG, RPG & Story Rich Fan. Since it took me 55 Hours on my first Playthrough I do recommend this Game for its full price.", "timestamp_created": 1485568803, "timestamp_updated": 1485568803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754384219646453857", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29479741": {"recommendationid": "29479741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014584502", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3268, "last_played": 1486939172}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, although at first seemed strange and not so fun, it grew on me and currently more than halfway into the game, it is definitely the best game of of the 3 13 games, but also enjoying this even more than Final Fantasy XV that i've played through recently.", "timestamp_created": 1485339737, "timestamp_updated": 1485339737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535545647144317627", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29459573": {"recommendationid": "29459573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010936235", "num_games_owned": 736, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2669, "last_played": 1485421716}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally it is on steam! and much better then the ff 13-2! story is amazing as well as the gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1485254461, "timestamp_updated": 1485254461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481471627950668335", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29436906": {"recommendationid": "29436906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274312425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3510, "last_played": 1498169612}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game and runs great!

Combat is fun, though I don't care for solo combat with just one character; I prefer a full party.\n\n2. Love the costume system, but there's just one problem: Lighting is absolutely the last character who would willingly dress up in goofy or showy costumes, which is a big problem. The thin \"plot\" veneer used to justify this is just annoying. If the main character were Vanille, things would be different (see better). Have costumes that the character would realisticly wear (based on their character).\n\n3. We get to deal with the characters we actually care about again.\n\nBad things in this game:\n\n1. Square added yet more unneeded lore to further confuse the mess they made in XIII-2. Seriously Square, stop doing this! You keep throwing more goofy crap in when you really don't need to do so! Stop making everything as stupidly complicated as you can to hide the fact you don't have a good story to tell. Seriously, stop messing with timelines and time travel; this is not the Chrono-verse and you are bad at using time travel in stories now! FF XIII had a good enough world that throwing all that in just destroyed what could have been a good world and a good story. Not everyhting needs a mystery twist to make a good story. I blame XIII-2 for this crap fest.\n\n2. Character development is shelved or reset, which is the cardinal no-no in story telling. This game isn't really about the characters anymore, it's about a really stupid plot thanks to the 2nd game. Remeber my number 2 good thing up there? It's a great example of how this game is shoehorning the characters to fit the game and story, rather than building the game and story around the characters growth and experience.\n\n3. We don't continue the story, we just jump to the end of time and ignore the previous world altogether now. We don't deal with our heroes going back and dealing with being normal people without a fate, and possbly without purpose. Don't get me wrong, having at a bit at the end of time isn't a terrible idea for immortal characters, but at no point have the characters or the story earned the right to go there. As such it's absolutely anti climactic. \n\nThis game feels self-indulgent and insubstantial due to having disconnected from what FFXIII was trying to create with their character driven story.", "timestamp_created": 1484493611, "timestamp_updated": 1484494159, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549125969409942627", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29262498": {"recommendationid": "29262498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037764814", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6170, "last_played": 1639787314}, "language": "english", "review": "The XIII series seems to get a lot of hate from people I talk to, but this part of the trilogy makes up for all of that, for me.

Everyone is all depressed and shit. All the core characters are spread out over the areas each with their individual quests.

You are literally slapped with a timer that once counts down to 0, its game over. You cant stop to smell the flowers and enjoy wandering. Some areas are accessible at a certain time making that much harder to get quests from there. There is no leveling system. Monsters dont give you exp either. Only completing sidequests allow you character to be upgraded.\nThe schemata system (outfits) is pretty cool. There are definitely some good ones and some so raunchy you have to think twice about their effectiveness in battle :P \nWhile the main story quests are meh, the game does a good job in the side quests section. They arent simple fetch items requests anymore, the quests have actual story involved which makes it feel like the npcs are living their own little lives in the world rather than just being placeholders.

The gameplay can be tricky at first to get down (and becomes trivial with the OP DLC garbs), but once you get the hang of stagger mechanics, it becomes fairly routine.  So routine infact, it gets repetitive after awhile.  Still fairly enjoyable.\n\nI wasn't fan of the clock/timer they put you on, but as you play thru the game (and get the Chronostatis ability), this becomes a non-issue.

I use 1080p on a 1366 monitor using a 5750 which is 1gb but 4k scale to work just low fps.\n\nAt the start of the game you are told that theres 13 days left till the end of the world  but you start with 6 days. Theres 5 areas you can go to and they dont take long to open up. Each area has a main Story quest you have to do but you also have to help npc's and save there souls doing side quests. At 6am you have to go back to your base to hand in your souls to save them so they can start a new life in a new world, i think?? >.< THey also give you the extra days. The first area you start in is a city filled with Npc's and monsters in the same area. You have to buy take aways to get your hp back. Although it might not have the best graphics,  i do really enjoy the city more than i thought i would. Imo its a mix of upper Midgar and FF13. \t\t\t \n\nClouds dlc comes with the buster sword a skill and the ff7 victory music if you win the fight wearing the costume. There is also lots of dlc costumes you get but imo its better to only pick 1 or 2 and get used to how they work before spaming your inventory with stuff. The game Has lot's of costumes evem without the dlc, that are cool. You can customize the colours and get a colour wheel to get the colour you want. Although not all costumes have a lot of options others do. You can buy new costumes at armour shop's! \n\nYou get 3 classes to set up to use in battle and each one has its own stamina and set of skills. Fights seem more rewarding than the last 13 games imo, with all the cool costumes and needing to guard and actually have to pick which skills you use. The game doesn't introduce fighting very well but once you get the hang of it, it is fun. Once enemys are staggered some skills will change, the cloud dlc skill changes to a skill that looks like braver and is fun ending fights with it and getting the ff7 music. The  ui seems a little to large in fights which is a shame. You get skills rewarded as items for winning battles. you can combine skills that are the same to level them up, fire + fire, attack + attack and so on at magic shops around town. You gain cp from fight's thats used to activate special skills like arise, cure and slow down time which can be used as you stagger. At the start of each day you get 5 Cp which is the max at the start of the game but you can spend these to get pheonix downs and x potions.

The timer itself is not an issue, you gain additional time very easily by doing quests. The issue is all of the restrictions that come with it. Numerous zones of the game are locked off at specific times so if you have a quest there then tough luck. You have to report back to HQ everyday at 6AM. Some quests are vague as hell so unless you Youtube it then you will waste valuable time searching every corner. Honestly a lot of the time the game feels like a job and you have to organize each day like you are putting together a college schedule.. it really got under my skin.\n\nI've tried to like the 13 series, I really have. The sad truth is that only original 13 game deserves its Final Fantasy title though even that was one of the weaker entries in the series. 13-2 and Lighting Returns feel like completely different games and do very little to actually improve upon the original with all the potential they had.

THANKS <3\n\n=======\n\nYES YES YES!! OMG YES!!!\nFINALLY SQUAREENIX!!!! You've learned from your mistakes, and improved a lot with your PC port job!\nTechnical wise, this game runs on my current PC, some frame-rate drops on larger place with a lot of polygons, but mostly still on a range of 30~50fps, so that's totally fine (Since FFXIII-2 have the same issues on PS3)\n\nThe story is a little \"Kingdom Hearts\" kind of complicated but not that much, still enjoyable at it's own.\nDon't even get me started with it's audio/visual appeal within this game, it's still SUPERB! Well that goes without saying if we're talking about SquareEnix games.\n\nThe difficulty curve can be described as variative, due to the Side Quests. But the Main Quests, can be a little frustrating without Chronostatis! I have to find a strategy guide just to complete the Main Quests without losing more than 3 days (since Yggdrasil needs more souls from Side Quests to slow down apocalypse)\n\nFor Battle System, is definely better than said FFXIII and XIII-2 but, the DLCs could make it a little overpowered. (Yuna's FFX Schemata and Cloud's Schemata). At least, it's fun nonetheless! =w=)a\n\nWell-designed game, with a better PC port than it's predecessor and full of Graphical and Audio Masterpieces!\n\nScores :\n> Gameplay 4.5/5\n> Fun 4.5/5\n> Content Value 4/5", "timestamp_created": 1483335061, "timestamp_updated": 1575245490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28921889": {"recommendationid": "28921889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029512286", "num_games_owned": 2527, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 3584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3584, "last_played": 1483313990}, "language": "english", "review": "A fitting and eventful conclusion to the FFXIII series. In my eyes, Lightning Returns is the best of the three FFXIII games, especially in terms of gameplay. I was initially put off by the whole timed premise of the game, where you only have a certain amount of days in order to complete your objectives. However, once I got deep in the game, I realized that the timer is extremely generous. By the end, I had plenty of time leftover, despite doing all the quests I could possibly do. Some quests are locked to a certain time or day, which can get annoying at times. Otherwise, I found time management to not be much of an issue. \n\nStorywise, this is the most straightforward plot of the FFXIII series. Lightning is tasked with saving the souls of as many people as she can in a doomed world. I personally did not care too much for the plot on its own. However, my interest in the main cast - especially Lightning - is what made me want to see the story out to its conclusion. \n\nThe bulk of the gameplay takes place through exploration and solo combat encounters. The combat in conjunction with the outfit system, is incredibly fun to partake in. It\u2019s definitely the most active combat system in the FFXIII series, as it requires you to time your attacks, guards, buffs, and debuffs. The act of dressing up Lightning is really enjoyable, as certain outfits have different skills and abilities in combat. The outfits are also visible in the in-game cutscenes, which was a nice touch. Similar to FFXIII-2, the world is much more open than the first game.

The previous entry in the series actually managed to resolve most of these issues and is a legimitely great game in it's own right, but despite the really interesting and unique design choices in this final installment, it felt like it finally collapsed under the weight of a lacking production budget and some recurring issues that you could only see a glimpse of previously.\n\nThe time system although an interesting quirk, left me exhausted and unable to stop and smell the flowers and doesn't serve any interesting purpose, the main story is split down the middle between sorta good and utterly terrible, and even the one consistently positive thing you could describe about the game series - the audio/visual experience - has gotten the sledgehammer.  Music is poorly coordinated throughout, ruining the experience of hearing what is the best soundtrack in the series, and there's a lot of embarassingly rough level designs and re-use of textures and models that really belonged in the N64 era, ruining what crafted visual design and planning there clearly was before their level design interns got their hands on it.  This series if nothing else captured atmosphere and mood really well, and it's now just an infrequent visitor.\n\nIf you're still reading (congrats) and think, \"I don't care, what about the gameplay?\" or are someone that really likes JRPGs generally, then the combat is well designed and consistently enjoyable and although nearly all of the side-quests are of a \"MMO mince meat\" quality, it has content.  You'll probably like it.\n\nThe final entry of the series however took what little I liked from the series when this should have been a great send-off.

All three FF13 games are much harder then the others but I really feel like it makes the story that much better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The following is my review after getting beat by the final boss over and over and over again. Much like the other two games the end gets very very tough.*\n\nFF 13 games are a lie!! they all make you think you're having fun with nice gaphics and pretty locations but the monsters in this game are so inbalanced and many times just plain annoying. Very rarely will you have a fun battle other than in the first few days and maybe some of the later non boss battles. The final boss battles of FF13 games are all too powerful and will take more time than most players are willing and able to spend to defeat.\n\nThe first set of bosses are balanced and they feel rewarding but the end bosses are not just OP but they NEVER STOP ATTACKING!!! This gives you very little ability to fight back or debuff and the debuffs don't stay long enough to be worth while!\n\nPros;\nnice graphics\ndeep storyline\nlots and lots of equipables (weapons, armor, etc)\n\nCons;\nno level system for character\nover complicated battle system\ninbalanced and near imbossible final bosses\nInbalanced common enemies (some will beat you to a pulp before you can move while others you will beat to a pulp before they attack once.)\nThis biggest common eneimies are often the easiest to defeat\nToo much focus on character set up/ too many euipables\n13 days doesn't really mean 13 days, you can have more which is really really lame. Story Breaking!\n\nI score this game a 4 out of 10 and I don't recomend because I don't want anymore FF games to be made like the FF13 games. I want to be able to beat the game after spending 50+ hours to get to end. I don't want to have to start over because I find out there was some important battle tactic or item that would be needed to defeat the final boss!

There are a few things that might cause the player some problems. First the time limit. It's not one that really gets badly in the way it's just always there and it sometimes causes you to have to break off a quest just when you are about to complete it and come back later.

The second thing that can cause some problems till you get used to it, is the style of the combat.

In fact, the information they give in the game is sufficient enough: I can say this as I have not played the previous titles. This game is good and extremely challenging. You reassume the role of Lightning, protagonist of XIII and XIII-2, if she was I'Cie (servants of the gods) in XIII and a Knight of Etro in XIII-2, she is now the saviour chosen by the head God Bhunivelze. Lightning's job is to save the souls of the dying world, Nova Chrysalia, so that Bhunivelze can reincarnate them in the new world that is beind created. The catch is: Lightning has 13 (how eponymous XD) days to do so. Also, Chaos from the realm opf Valhalla (the main background in XIII-2) has seeped into this world thus accelerating the world's demise. Bhunivelze needs exactly 13 days to awaken but the world's destruction and his awakening is not mutually exclusive. Thus the more souls Lightning's saves she can prempt the destruction of the world. You are given a clock that is in countdown and you must finish main quest and side quests to stop the world's demise and wait for Bunivelze to awaken. Your trusted companion is Hope Estheim, from previous titles, who talks to you via telecommunications and stays in the remnants of coccoon, from previous games, called ark. Lightning is promised by Bhunivelze that if she does this she will get her sister Serah back. Sometimes interrupting her travels is a mysterious girl called Lumina, who bears a resemblance to Serah. Well, it is literally a battle against time as Lightning delves into this journey. If you fail you must start New Game + after all you must save the world. \n\nTHIS IS A REALLY GOOD GAME\n\nI mean the schemata system is a great system that fuses X-2's dressphere concepts and new age battle system. Not to mention the PC edition comes with Cloud's and Yuna's garb which are DEFINITELY OP. A friend even said this game was HD redendered especially for PC. \n\nWhat I also loved about this game? The small details it exqusitivelly crafted for each new \"country\" or geographical terrain for Nova Chrysalia. Each city has a different culture, custom, food, people and animals. You get to visit and do side quests and main quests involving all of them! As you do them you get to also see the personal evolution of Lightning, her regrets, her hopes, her emotions and her ambitions. The conversations that Lightning has with Hope are also interesting. They show you how characters can develop and change. \n\nThe gameplay is fused with these story elements, for eg. The Wildlands' culture respect and tend to Chocobo. There are areas where only Chocobos can travel thus you need to get a Chocobo of your own. In Yusnann, which is a pleasure city, people are always partying and it would be in your best interest to do as Romans do. In Luxerion, it is the opposite, it is a beautiful city but the the religious capital, thus the quests involved in this area are based on people engaging with culture and their religions. \n\nYou will see the garb of each location and how people act and behave to differ also differently in each place. For example, expect drunks in Yusnan or people in general to say sometimes strange things when you wear a garb and more insightful things in Luxerion. \n\nThe game can be HARD. One must manage their challenges and effectively solve them. There are parts of many places that are only open at particular times thus to may need to travel in-between areas to solve and do things respectively.\n\nOverall, I am loving this game. The lore is extremely interesting, the story is engaging and so is the gameplay, the characters, both main and side characters, all have histories fleshed out and it is an immersive world. Lightning is what Cloud Strife would have beeb if he came on this journey and what Squall leonhart was at the end of FFVIII. I love how each fragment of the story and gameplay is given details. Each schemata is wonderfully illustrated and allows customization. It is a game that surely will demand your time. \n\nThis is a good game. Well done Square Enix for completing the journey of Lightning aka Claire/Eclair Farron in this way. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1480916858, "timestamp_updated": 1480916858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736288845539093018", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28197056": {"recommendationid": "28197056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196045587", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 832, "last_played": 1656719291}, "language": "english", "review": "Waste your time by learning how to manage in-game time.", "timestamp_created": 1480906561, "timestamp_updated": 1480906742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470317631959915161", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28183200": {"recommendationid": "28183200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153301463", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 5482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5455, "last_played": 1495606965}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]INTRO[/h1]\nLightning Return Final Fantasy XIII is JRPG, Fantasy based game as well as the final chapter of Final Fantasy 13 trilogy. As we know Final Fantasy is always using ATB based game or sometimes they use turn based game, they made this game like that too but it's some kinda different from the other Final Fantasy Series.\nLet's get into the point\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI'd say we need to play all of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy but as we know it will take a long time but i think it's worth it if you like the story and you should probably know that the other Trilogy series battle system isn't as good as this one.\nFinal Fantasy 13 Trilogy has story tend to be like anime story but it's in game. I think for me it felt really like Japan's work the way the character think, the way they act, really remind me alot of anime but i don't know how others felt because it's my personal opinion. Also Trilogy has deep story, might bring your tears out, they really did a great job making the script it's some kinda unexpected. If you are not intested in the other Trilogy series might just watch it on youtube or grab it in sale because i think it's worth it if you're like great story.\n\n[h1]Battle System[/h1]\nLIghtning Return has a quite unique gameplay i'd say. You can't level up here, but you get stronger by doing quest the more you complete the stronger you become. For the battle action there are 4 action you can set in every set, we can have up to 3 set to use in battle and of course you can have as many sets not just 3. In battle you can't dodge unless you use \"Evade\" ability nor you can defend unless you use \"Guard\" abilities so it's the same for magic and attacking, they are limited. We can't do critical hit too here unless we attack the enemies until they \"Staggered\", learn about it when you decided to play it cause it's very important asset to win the game easily and faster.\nLet's talk about the abilities, we can level up our abilities by combining the same abilities with the same level but i don't think that it's that interesting more like i found it boring because it's so limited there's not many feature they put into the abilities upgrade\n\n[h1]PRO[/h1]\n+ Great story\n+ Easy to get used to the battle system\n+ Great Visual\n+ The price is not out of range nor it's cheap\n+ BGM is awesome\n+ Support Eng dub and Japan dub\n+ Character voice is awesome, both in English dub or Japan dub\n+ Monster can be exterminated ([spoiler]After you defeat it over and over again[/spoiler])\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n- Battle is way too simple\n- Kinda too easy even in hard mode\n- Nothing to explore, very limited space\n- Time is limited, but i think it's more than enough\n- Nothing to grind very unlike RPGs \n- Upgrade feature unlock only after you beat the game and start over\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nI think it's worth playing, they improved it so much since the other Trilogy Series is pretty boring. The monster can exterminated though but it's fun in it's own way. If you like great story and simple battle system you should consider playing Lightning Return, Because it also has great soundtrack and great visual.

It looks like a relatively low budget early PS3 title, but had ambitions of a later AAA release.

I would say final fantasy 13 series is a big dissapointment for me, final fantasy X is still the best final fantasy i plated so far (I have high hopes for Final Fantasy XV). Here are a few reasons why I think Lighting Return is not a good FF game:\n\n1. There is a time limitation on completing a mission. Whenever i play RPG games I prefer to think throughly before making decision. Since Final Fantasy implement real time in the battle system, it is still acceptable. But time limitation even when you walk around and explore the map, seriously?\n\n2. For the entire game, you only get to use one character. You only get to use Lighting? I mean Lighting is cool and I have no reason to hate a female protoganist. But still one character is rather boring. I will rather play the 4 boy characters in FF15.\n\n3.  The graphic is average. I did not expect the game to have nice graphic since it was port over from console. But still, other than good FPS, the graphic is totally....average. Imagine if Lighting get to dress all those clothes in high defination pixels, isn't that nice. But that will never happen if FF franchise does not consider to move away from console platform as their primary release platform. Such a waste.\n\n4. The NPCs are stupid. The AI could have been better. I mean, if you going to make those NPCs moving around, at least put more effort to make them look real, if not just make them stand still, I mean all of them.\n\n5. The story is becoming ridiculous. Let's admit it, FF13 story is far less interesting compared with FF7 and FF10. People turning into crystal, Lighting becomes Angel, time machine, good guy turned into bad guy, bad guy turn into good guy, and crystal, crystal, crystal bla bla bla..... It feels like there just simply release the expansion with dull storyline just to ursurp the fans money.\n\nI only spend 3 hours playing this and I do not feel like continuing it anymore. If you are a FF fan, I would recomend you to spend your money on FF15. FF15 should be a better bet.", "timestamp_created": 1480077748, "timestamp_updated": 1480077748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27379009": {"recommendationid": "27379009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066508501", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5735, "last_played": 1480043685}, "language": "english", "review": "As an intro to this review, I will give my experience with the trio of FF13 games. I have played the first 2 twice. Once on xbox, and once on PC. I have completed Lightning Returns on PC only. I personally liked all of them, from story to gameplay. While the previous games in the 13 series have had preformance issues on PC, and the games themselves were very divisive in their gameplay and story, Lightning Returns changes everything. Combat is completely different and the overall experience is so much better.\n\n[b]Preformance[/b]\nThe pervious games had quite a few preformance problems on PC. Terrible frame rates, small resolutions (which was fixed later), and even game breaking bugs. I myself was a victim of one of those bugs, as well as fps issues, but was able to fix and play them both. On the flip side, I am happy to say that Lightning Returns was not plagued by any of these problems. I installed the game and went right to playing it, with absolutely no problems at all. The game can run at 60 FPS, and though it did dip below that sometimes, it was mostly stable. You also have a decent number of options to improve your own preformance by clicking on the options menu at the top left of the screen. Unfortunately, you can't access that menu with a controller, but that, along with the acual quit button (as opposed to the main menu button) are the only things you will need a mouse for if you wish to use a controller.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nCombat from the first two games was very simple, and was mostly just controlling which classes your 3 fightning charaters were at any given time. Switching between these constantly was very important, but otherwise, the only thing you had to do was choose the auto-battle function and let the game choose the abilites to use.\n\nIn Lightning Returns, the system is completely different. There are now things known as \"Schemata\", or outfits with 4 abilities, 2 accessories, and an optional adornment for each. You get to choose every single one of these for youself, and there is a large pool to choose from. \n\nDuring battle, you now control everything. You have access to 3 Schemata to switch between, which are all very important because each Schemata has its own ATB guage, which is basically a stamina bar. These fill up much more quickly when the Schemata is not being used, so it is important to switch between them often. Guarding has also been introduced, which is very important. During combat, you will need to guard in order to drastically reduce damage taken. Timing your guard perfectly will negate almost all damage, while simply guarding without proper timing will reduce damage by around half. If you are worried about timing, don't be! I'm pretty bad at timing stuff like this, but there were only a few places where I struggled. If you are still worried, you can play on easy, which allows you to regenerate health for free between combat.\n\n[b]Other Gameplay[/b]\nThere is now a clock in game, which is very important. You have 13 days to complete your ultimate goal, and if you don't make it in time, you will lose the game. If you do fail, you start a new game, keeping all of your old items, excluding quest items. This mechanic scared me a lot at first. I was sure that I would mess something up because I wasn't going by a guide. My fear, however, was misplaced. By the time i was ready for the end of the game, I still had around 4 or 5 days left, with little left to do. The most important thing to remember is to use the chronostasis ability. This freezes time, but also consumes EP. You start with 5 maximum EP, but gain more throughout the game. Chronostasis costs 1 each use, but you can gain EP through combat very easily, so you can do so much more during a single day in game than you otherwise would. The time limit is not something that you have to be scared of. Just explore, use chronostasis, and don't avoid combat. Also, at the beginning of the game you start with less than 13 days left. Through quests (main and side), you gain additional days, as well as stats and money.\n\nSomething else of note is that the game is now open world. You can now do whatever you want, with the only exception being time. Some NPCs will only be out at certain times, and some areas will only be open at certain times. This can sometimes be annoying, but there is almost always something else to do in the meantime, so just come back later if something isn't accessible.\n\n[b]Story (Spoiler Free)[/b]\nIn Lightning Returns, you have one controllable character, who has been in both previous games: Lightning. She is now also known as \"The Savior\", and has been chosen by God to serve him during the world's final 13 days. Along with her, God also chose Hope, another returning character. He will help Lightning from \"The Arc\", which is a place created by God and unaffected by time. You will meet many different characters throughout the game, some you may recognize if you have played the previous games, while others will be completely new. If you are new to the series, or don't remember everything from the previous 2 games, then don't worry. The cutscenes alone do a decent job of filling you in, but you will also have a datalog with plenty of information to read through, should you wish to know more.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nIn conclusion, I personally believe this game was great. As you can see, I spent a bit more than 90 hours playing it and I enjoyed every minute. There were 0 technical issues, the graphics were beautiful, and I really enjoyed the new and much more interactive combat. The Schemata were also a very nice addition, as they allowed a lot more variety, both in combat as well as for Lightning's appearance. The story was emotional, but action packed. It was also mysterious, but consistant. By the end of it all, I nearly cried, as the final cutscene just wrapped everything up so much more nicely than I could have imaged. This game is a great pick up and if you are looking for a great story with good combat, then you have found it.", "timestamp_created": 1480047925, "timestamp_updated": 1480048656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27375192": {"recommendationid": "27375192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157842387", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1706, "last_played": 1577526924}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice gameplay and story . just like another Final Fantasy series .", "timestamp_created": 1480045786, "timestamp_updated": 1480045786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27367600": {"recommendationid": "27367600", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996682384", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1661284651}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly am not sure why I like this game. I've played a bit of it on 360, and some on PS3. And now I have a Steam copy I'm playing through. I've bought this game four times, for the record. Once on 360, twice on PS3, and this version. It's a mess, but a mess that's greater than the sum of it's messy parts. A sequel to a sequel no-one probably needed or asked for, and one that was pretty much gaffed from day one due to being the third entry in the arguably most maligned entry in the Final Fantasy franchise. With that said, I enjoyed FFXIII, flaws and all (and, let's be clear, there were a lot of flaws).\n\nFFXIII-2 was a weird beast - it introduced more freedom, fixed some problems with the mostly stellar battle-system, gave us a cool cahracter in Noel. Yet it also went off the deep-end even more with its narrative and made us play as Lightning's younger sister who served solely as 'damsel in distress' in the original game. Basically, one step forward, one and a half steps back.\n\nIn continuing the steps analogy, LR:FFXIII steps just enough forward to be equal to FFXIII and then sort of steps to the side and goes off on its own. The story is still nonsense, more so than ever in fact. The battle system seems similar but is also radically different. You meet familiar characters but everything is still weird. But you have a world you can explore, and there's pressure from the whole \"save the world in 13 days!\" stuff.\n\nIf you like your games to be a bit rough around the edges, don't care if the plot makes no sense, and just wanna play as Claire \"Lightning\" Farron again, I think you'll like this?\n\nAlso, I have nominated this for a Steam Award - \"Villain Most in Need of a Hug\".

By thank I mean try not to think about it.\n\nLong story short this is as close as we are going to get to Valkyrie Profile 3 (this and Exist Archive of course).\n\nFace buttons for various attacks that are fully customizable. Attacks, blocks, dodges, all can have various properties (mobility, elemental, de/buffs etc.) together with the schemata i.e. Job system switchable on the fly at the press of a button. Each weapon and shield having its own 3d model (something I feel dumb for pointing out, but it is NOT something that is standard in action rpgs STILL).\n\nIt is easily the best combat system mainline FF has ever seen so far in my humble educated opinion.\n\nKnowing the characters from previous games is helpful but the main story stands on its own almost completely. The setting is easily the most intriguing in recent memory, nihilistic, resigned, and at the twilight of its life, the immortal denizens offer some interesting sub stories and plots to follow.\n\nMusic is as we all should be used to by now, absolutely phenomenal. Themes from all three games, various arranges at key moments, dynamic music and cues during battle, all creating an immersive and exciting atmosphere.\n\nMany people have a preconception when it comes to time limits, rest easy for LR gives you many tools how to work around it and it is not a complicated process at all.

With so many people who disliked the cast of the series to even the mechanics from the first and second, it's no wonder this game is so underrated. But over the next paragraph I'll give my opinion as to why this diamond in the rough is good! \n\nFrom the beggining of the first cinematic I could tell Square Enix had finally decided to fall back to some basics. The opening made me feel like I was getting ready to be a badass which in all honesty is what everyone wants. The tutorial in the game does a quick and effecient job of teaching how to be in fact a badass right from the beggining. Combat is quick and intuitive  and felt completely fluid. Next up is the customization of Lightning. From clothes, to weapons, to even skills the options are practically endless. I can't tell you how many times I've caught myself in the menus customizing or checking out the different styles of outfits and weapons. Side missions seem like less of a hassle than most games considering completeing them just helps you in the long run and keeps you from noticing the possible monotony of running from one side of a map to another. Yet needless to say I'm a little over 6 hours into what I'm assuming will easily be a 30-40 hour experience, and I've not been this excited and intruiged to play a Final Fantasy game in almost 5 years.

It focuses on a central character that has been prominent in Final Fantasy XIII for the last six years, Claire Farron or more commonly referred to as Lightning, Cloud's distant second cousin (I kid, I kid).  It's time that she puts her foot down and save her sister and the people, for this world, or the next.  Nothing will stand in her way.\n\nGraphics: Not bad, basically around XIV graphics regularly.  Funny note though, they basically spent all their CGI budget on the beginning and end of the game. I happen to like it.  15 minutes of beautiful CGI is a rewarding end for some I'd think.\n\nGameplay: Good, final chapter of the class / stagger system.  It takes a little getting used to but it gets rewarding for the most part later on.  The structure of the quests is debatable.  A few main quests here, bunch of menial side quests there, all under that pressing timeline.  Especially when you don't know what will help give you more time. I think it is the uncertainty that can increase that sense of pressure (the game nearly tells you as much). +Game also is almost worth doing even with a full time job.\n\nVoice Acting: Always good, I would shake their hands if I ever recognized them.\n\nConclusion: A solid end to an up and down series that seems to take you everywhere and while some patches are rough, you are glad you could be a part of the ride.  \n\nNow, for my crazy analysis of the story...\n\nThe Plot...\n   The game starts with the premise that there is no reason to save the world but only the people who seek salvation in it.  You assume the role as savior, the chosen one by celestial powers only known to be God by everyone that sleeps below the clouds.  And by the looks of it, with the end of the world coming, you have some of the common tropes.  You have people who desperately seek a sense of security, purpose, and salvation through faith in the same celestial being.  You have other people who seek to protect themselves and the things they care about.  Lastly, you have the people who are lost in all of it.  The irony is that most of time you seek to liberate people from their dispair so that they may find hope.  It becomes their salvation.  It becomes a consistent theme throughout the game in all shapes and sizes.  The powers to be that could help have long surrended their efforts to the inevitability of the nearing end.  \n   \nThroughout the game you task is to save as many people as you can.  Your friends and enemies are the most important souls for you to save.  It's nice to see the familiar faces once more.  I was always a fan of Lightning, but to see Fang was a great pleasure (maybe it was that strong femine touch or that austrailian accent, who knows?).  Snow isn't have bad, he and Hope are like wines, awful if inbibed too soon, palatable if taken with age. Even Caius makes a return, what an ass he still is.  Even death can't seem to shake the stick loose that seemed to be shoved so far up there.  But still, like the undeniable prick we all seem to come across once in our paths, Caius reveals the same undeniable necessities that we all need and a singular truth that we need to recognize.  Good, bad, or strange, we all have a choice, and more importantly, a part to play in this story.  \n   \nAnother great scene in the story is Lightnings interaction with Noel Kriss (my one standing objection to the writing of this series, they seem to take these random objects or famous figures and reapply them to their characters, like codenames maybe...Hope, Snow, Fang, Lightning(was a code name), oddly the more stable characters generally have realistic names, anyway, interaction with Noel...).  Lightning decides to play along with the role of being an evil harbenger of death which shows a depth of character and manipulation I haven't seen before with Lightning.  It was very enticing to see her play the role of the villian to fulfill Noel's perception of destiny.  Throughout this game, Lightning has become incredibly perceptive if not wise in some ways.  Which leads me to the one new character, Lumina.  She is the thorny prick that you can never seem to find but you know you sat on.  But that is also her undeniable charm.  She keeps you guessing to the very end.  \n   \nFast forward through all the minor quests (they offer insights into Lightnings thoughts but overall, there isn't much personal growth except for the few main quests there are).  Final boss (yep, once you are done with the five or so main quests, its the final boss), \n\nGod, no biggy.  \n\n   As Lightning has said and implied (a little 'spark' of glee for me please) over the course of the game, she has been fighting fate for a long time, and she has been getting good at it. She sees through Gods plan and decides humanity should be accepted as a whole for all of its pros and cons.  The new world should be for everyone free from God.  She will take on the roll of death to give people the chance to live.  So, she kills God. To be fair, it was God's failure to empathize but his equal need to be close to human kind that drove him to eventually try to control humanity.  He was an engineer at heart who wanted to understand what love was but since he couldn't he decided to remove it from everyone else, metaphorical downfall.  \n   \n    Love conquers all, yadi ya. But it has a point, one that should resonate with us on some level.  It is through our love for others, our passions, our willingness to coexist, that we contribute and build a future and vision that only we can dream alone.  \n    \n    Back to the story...God is slain. Everyone comes back together, loose ends from 1&2 are wrapped up here as well (it was nice to see actually, considering how depressing XIII-2 was).  Everyone goes towards the light and decides to be reincarnated in the new world, including Lightning.  Caius and the infinite Yuels remain except for the one that loved Noel.  They would watch over the Chaos that doomed the world in the first place, which, let's be fair, they created.  But even so, they did it with effortless humility.  The cycle of life is finally restored.  And the new world is filled with life. \n\nExtra Ending:\nLightning among us?\nThe new world is awfully similar to the one I take for granted and more than I care to admit (not to mention avoid mostly by playing these games).  Lightning leaving a train in a rural area ready to face the peacful new world with unbridled optimism (her face is adorable) is both joyful and sorrowful (at least for me). It joyful because she can finally be happy, and sorrowful because our time with her is at an end.  The life of the tragically mundane and stable has finally ended our drama on the grand stage.\n\nWith that being said, I wonder, her new life is just beginning. Part of me likes to think the possibility exists that Lightning can start a new adventure with this new life.  Hell, why not?  I would like to see what life throws at her next.", "timestamp_created": 1475724448, "timestamp_updated": 1475724821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25858238": {"recommendationid": "25858238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251598212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1839, "last_played": 1485342654}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommended.\nA must if u played and like previous FFXIII games.\n", "timestamp_created": 1475605505, "timestamp_updated": 1475605505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465565681457519531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25845016": {"recommendationid": "25845016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059287253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1475528700}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a pc game, can only be good at PS3 ; not turn based as we were used to have in other FF series;  a poor action based game; defend , do continous attack; defend again; do conti...  , this is whole game; i really want a refund;", "timestamp_created": 1475528928, "timestamp_updated": 1475528928, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.248049333691596985", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25786775": {"recommendationid": "25786775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071269341", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1904, "last_played": 1468703299}, "language": "english", "review": "     I ll be honest I buy this game because Lightning looks hot AF (and she really looks ) ,i ve never played any FF gamne before and i was confuse about all that lore behind it but the explain me slowly step by step and it was awesome,This game has memorable characters ,even Hope(i absolutly hate him at the begining of the game) ,\n     The graphics are awesome and coul be change if you have a poor setting ,it s really good optimize tho so should work on any decent computer.The music is heaven  for your ears.\n     The gameplay is fine even in the first hours i didn t know what in the hell am i doing but you will learn in the progress of the game.\n     Now in more personal way : I love this game was awesome,I played it in a very stressfull period of my life and I can say that help me going throuth that hell and give me a reason to smile when i came home because i d know i ll play it and i m going to feel good even if i was alone and whole world was against me,and i think that is gaming all about,it s an art and like any art it give us a reason to live another day.This game made me feel sorry for people who don t play games and live their ''normal'' boring life. \n", "timestamp_created": 1475262579, "timestamp_updated": 1475262579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509562313556671143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25707117": {"recommendationid": "25707117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004579374", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2087, "last_played": 1537296591}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros.\nEnjoyed the main quest and open world concept.

That being said, while I haven't played much, I have had to restart numerous time, due to time constraints.\n\nNow all you avid gamers who hated XIII to begin with may shoot me when I say I loved XIII.  Heck, I love XIII-2 as well, even though it thoroughly confused me (Going from the fall of cocoon into time jumping with Serah and Noel was really confusing). I was super excited when I heard LR was coming out. Open world, updated graphics, and my favorite character all in one nice little package, I had to have it.  If I had realized how frustrating this game was, I would have bought something else.\n\nDo not get this game unless you're used to have time constraints put on your gameplay, you actually WANT to spend most of your play time looking through guides, and don't mind either restarting certain areas of gameplay or restarting your entire game.\n\nThe time constraints just suck all the fun out of it. You practically rush through the main story, trying to save as much time as possible, and don't really get a feel for what's going on. I suppose if you've played this type of game before (Majora's Mask comes to mind), it's probably not that bad for you. But I like to take my time with a game. Explore every nook and cranny, watch the story unfold, and all that, but this game just doesn't have that element. While I'm sure this game could possibly be played without a guide, in order to get the most out of it, I'd advise using a guide straight off. And that bites, because, I don't know about anyone else, but I don't like to do my first play through with a guide. I save that for later so I can focus on storyline my first time through.\n\nI also feel the battle system isn't.... well... I don't know what to call it. It has facets from the previous games of the same name, but it does't seem as stream lined. Yes, its really customizable and what not, and that's not a bad thing. But I really would have prefered to keep the XIII system (Yeah I know. I call it Auto-Win for a reason. That's why I chose the option to default the cursor to abilities). \n\nThe growth system is also horrendous. Having some growth from quests isn't a bad thing, but having ALL your growth coming from quests is just stupid. At that point, the only thing monster battles are for are to keep your EP up so you can spam Chronostasis and getting items either for synthesis or quests. After that, monster battles are worthless.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT INCOMING***\nAs I've said before, the story is confusing. This could be a wonderful stand-alone story (if you actually get to see any of it) but with the previous  games, the jump is really, and I mean REALLY confusing. You go from failing to save cocoon, to time jumping with completely differnet characters to save the timeline, then back to Lightning acting as the harbinger of the end of the world and trying to save souls. Not only that, but in two of the games you fail, so it kinda makes me wonder if you fail at this one as well (and I don't just mean you fail to make it to the thirteenth day, game over fail).\n\nAll in all, I'd have to say, with how much I've played of it thus far, I would not recommend it to anyone unless they enjoy this kind of thing. I'll admit, the game is beautiful, but the graphics aren't enough to save it. My opinion may change once I get further in, and at that point, I may change my rating, but until then, I wish I'd spent my money on some other game that I might have actually enjoyed playing.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoy slamming your head into a wall and sticking your finger in a pencil sharpener, you might enjoy this game.

It is the ONLY reason to play the game. In fact it\u2019s so good that I spent over 450 hours to understand it thoroughly. However, the game fails miserably on almost everything else especially on the game design and story.\n\nEXCELLENT AMALGAMATION OF ACTION AND RPG: The addition of the timing mechanic officially turns this FF title into an action RPG. However it plays very differently from run of the mill action RPGs because Lightning Returns had evolved from turn based strategy. And strategy is what most action RPGs lack.\n\nBesides limited equipment slots, popular action RPGs such as the Elder Scrolls and Diablo series have no restrictions on unlocked skills, thus leading to ridiculously overpowered characters by end game. This game however, allow only four skills you can use at a time in battle, forcing you to think hard about the most effective setup against each foe. So the most powerful enemies are challenging even if you are maxed out.\n\nI absolutely loved the addition of a timing mechanic because it rewards your investment into mastering this skill. Once you get this down, fighting enemies even on hard difficulty becomes a breeze with the right strategy. If blocks are timed correctly, damage can be reduced or even negated completely. A well timed attack also increases damage. It usually doubles the damage, but some equipment can triple or even quintuple that.\n\nCombat is equally demanding on both your reflexes as well as your brain. I have never seen such an elegant blending of both strategy and action in any game. Even though I was beyond disappointed with almost everything else in the game, this ONE aspect gives me hope for the future of the franchise.\n\nCOMBAT IS REALLY NOT TOO DIFFICULT: A vast majority of the complaints is nothing more than a \u201ctoo difficult\u201d and therefore it\u2019s bad assertion. This complaint certainly has its merit, but it\u2019s really a poor game design issue.\n\nWith the right setup and a basic level of competency on timing blocks and attacks, most enemies are not difficult to defeat, even on hard difficulty. From mid game onwards, it can get really frustrating if you don\u2019t learn how to setup your equipment.\n\nUnfortunately, neither the in-game tutorials nor gameplay scenarios lead you to explore the depth of the thousands of possible customizations on your garbs, equipment and abilities that this game has to offer. Reading a guide to understand combat is almost inevitable.\n\nTHE DESPICABLE END OF WORLD TIMER: This is by far the biggest complaint everywhere. After several playthroughs, I realized that there is way more than enough time to finish the game and it\u2019s really not a big deal. But a new player on their first playthrough will NOT know this. So there is no excuse for the game designers to implement such a silly mechanic.\n\nThe clock just ends up forcing the player to only focus on completing quests and objectives because he is constantly worried about wasting time. It certainly made me feel like my boss was relentlessly watching me. I thought games are supposed to be relaxing and not feel like going to work.\n\nNORMAL DIFFICULTY IS TOO HARD: The \u201cnormal\u201d difficulty is way too hard for a casual gamer. The learning curve climbs way too fast following the combat tutorials in the beginning of the game. It gets frustrating very quickly. My recommendation for a casual gamer is to use the easy setting for the first playthrough. The game designers really should have the current \u201cnormal\u201d difficulty set hard while \u201ceasy\" should be set to normal. Then they should create an even easier difficulty level below that and a nightmare difficulty above hard. This simple design decision alone would have made the game a lot more accessible to casual players.\n\nUNCONVENTIONALY POOR LEVELING MECHANIC: Only completing quests will \u201clevel\u201d your character. This leveling mechanic together with the end of world timer gives the player tremendous pressure to focus only on quests and to avoid combat and exploration. It\u2019s another poor design decision. It is so ironic that the game encourages you to avoid using such a well designed combat system.\n\nREQURING TWO PLAYTHROUGHS TO EXPERIENCE THE COMPLETE GAME IS ABSURD: You have to complete the game at least once before weapons can be upgraded and abilities be leveled beyond three. What casual gamer will play a game twice? Every FF title has allowed the player to unlock everything within a single playthrough without requiring a restart. Yet another ridiculous design decision.\n\nLIGHTNING HAS ZERO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TRILOGY: This is THE colossal failure of the entire FFXIII series. There is no central character to hold the story together. It\u2019s no surprise so many players find Lightning un-relatable. That\u2019s just simply because Lightning doesn\u2019t have any character.\n\nThere is a meager sampling of scenes that would qualify as character \u201cdevelopment\u201d in the first installment of the trilogy. Hope and Lightning briefly traveled together and bonded. She told him she wanted to forget about the past by changing her name from Claire to Lightning. So that\u2019s the reason why she is so cold and distant from other people. That was it. No more information was revealed as to why she made the name change and what she struggled with. These details are necessary for us to connect with Lightning.\n\nThe incessant focus on saving and protecting her younger sister, Serah could have worked had it served as a conduit to develop Lightning\u2019s story. Like many reviewers have already pointed out, the whole trilogy never goes beyond superficial statements from Lightning (and also Snow) about how she needs to be saved and protected. The writers need to illustrate the relationship between the two sisters. Show us bonding moments in the past between Serah and Lightning. Make us care about Serah as much as Lightning does. The same could be said for Snow. Furthermore, the writers could have really used the conflict between Snow and Lightning to add more depth to their characters. The plot contains so many opportunities to develop the main characters. But they really failed to capitalize on it. All that melodrama between the main characters will not work if we don\u2019t care about them.\n\nLIGHTNING RETURNS IS A MESSY HODGEPODGE OF DISJOINT STORIES: Each of the five main quests have little to do with the main plotline. They really made me feel that I am just playing a longer side quest. If the game allows skipping to the final quest, you will not miss anything story-wise.\n\nThe random philosophical ramblings from Lightning at the end of most quests come across as nothing more than platitudes. These monologues need to be interconnected and build up to a central theme or relate to the main characters for them to be meaningful. After wasting two games with no character development, it is too late for that here. Just focus on plot, tie up the loose ends and get it over with.\n\nTHE MUSIC SAVES THE QUESTS FROM BEING A CHORE TO SLUG THROUGH: A lot of these dramatic pieces made this disaster of a story tolerable. The music has stopped me on many occasions from pressing the skip button on the dialogue scenes.\n\nSome of my favorite pieces includes Lightning\u2019s theme that are used throughout the more serious moments in the story. The Ark\u2019s saintly hymn fit me right into my savior role for humanity. Many of the other pieces that included a chorus truly immersed me into my divine undertaking during the final missions.\n\nI care about Final Fantasy a lot. No other game franchise can tell a story better than the early installments released during the previous two decades. Few stories in any medium can match the epic journey of Final Fantasy VII that many of us still revere a dozen or so years later.

Absolutely tons of content, great combat, satisfying story, and replayability after you finish the first playthrough.\n\nFirst, the combat. In the other two, the combat is sort of automated for you, and you don't have any control over your own characters movement which can be frustrating when you watch them walk right into a massive attack. In this game, though, you have full movement over Lightning. You can dodge attacks sometimes by moving around. It really helps in a lot of areas. \n\nThe combat in general has way more control over what you can do, and what actions you want to perform in the Schemata system. In the other two, you choose between 5 different Paradigms that you set up, and the AI sorta takes over from there (At least with your two party members). In this one, you set up 3 different Schematas and chose 4 different moves for each, and they each have their own ATB bars letting you switch on the fly to block attacks or switch to melee/magic when the enemy staggers much more fluently than the other two.\n\nThis game also introduced a new clock system. If you're a completionist like myself, you may not be that thrilled. [spoiler]You only get 13 days[/spoiler], and it can feel very overwhelming trying to complete all the side quests, Canvas of Prayers and monster extinctions within the allotted time. I played about 4 hours before restarting and following a guide just because I wasn't sure I was going to be able to complete everything in time (That was before I decided I was going to give it another playthrough on Hard). You can freeze time, almost as much as you would like, as long as you keep killing monsters. So it isn't all that bad.\n\nYou may have also guessed that, yes, the framerate is all over the place in this game like the others. I can maintain 60 fps throughout the open zones, like the Dead Dunes or the Wildlands, but the two Cities I get constant frame drops. Something I got use to over time, but it is just as bad as FF13-2.\n\nThe last thing to mention is the story. It is a satisfying ending to the trilogy, and I wasn't at all disappointed with the story or how it ended. I've noticed that a lot of games nowadays just kinda end, and don't really give the closure that I was looking for. This game does not have that problem. It gives the right amount of closure as well as keeping it open ended enough [spoiler](Not a sequel bait ending)[/spoiler]\n\nIt does sort of start off weird, I was wondering what the fuck was even happening at the beginning and why [spoiler]all these characters from the other games were still alive[/spoiler], but they slowly explained it over the course of the game.\n\nOverall, a pretty great game that receives a lot of flack just because it's in the 13 trilogy, even though the games in it are pretty good.

The end of it had all the trappings of weirdo cataclysmic killing of gods and universe unravelling and implausible battles, but the story revealed itself in an engaging way, and the characters were interesting and lovable.\n\nPlaying through XIII-2 was less pleasurable. A very interesting character that you wanted to know better in XIII is one of two main protagonists. Alas, with only two characters to follow, it got old. There was little to do in battles, once you had a set-up that worked reasonably well you just mashed a button. Worse, however, was a Chrono Trigger-like wandering through time, messing with cause and effect, but without the multitude of characters' stories being intertwined in an engaging plot. Worst of all, if you did manage to tough it out to the end of the main game, you were rewarded with a most displeasing ending where the end-of-the-world scenario you were trying to avoid all game winds up happening anyway. There's a ton of end-game content that becomes unlocked, but I just couldn't care long enough anymore to bother.\n\nInto that bleak and aimless scenario starts Lightning Returns. Because two characters was deemed to be too many, we've now been reduced to just one, and it's another bloody fashion show - the exact reason I never managed to finish FF X-2, despite having loved FF X. \n\nFurthermore, and worst of all, they have set up a system where you are punished for completing objectives by having a time limit on the game. Yes, time acually ticks away as you progress through the game, and if the timer's up, then you've lost. Yep, all that gameplay down the tube and you have to start over again from the beginning. I'm sorry, when I pick up a mainstream RPG I want to take my time and explore every nook and cranny as I make my way through the game. Here, they attempt to force you to run through the game as fast as possible, to see as little as you can as it goes by. \n\nIt all hinges on Replay Value. Replay Value should be based on how much fun the game was to play the first time. Here and in XIII-2, it seems they are trying to force you to replay the game. \"Didn't like how it ended? Here, try playing it all over again and see if you like it better this time. Still no? Start again from the beginning and make 'different choices' this time.\" Starting over is not just a core mechanic, it's at the center of the plot. For me, this just tells me I'm wasting my time. \n\nIf they want a game to be played and replayed, it has to be interesting. My Skyrim has 1,000 hours in it. FF X probably has around 350.\n\nIn the case of XIII-2, I had seen enough the first play through, and all that extra DLC unlocked at the end was left unplayed. For Lightning Returns, it's been just 3.8 hours so far. I may get a Game Over, I may actually get through to the \"end\" of the game, but I may quit before seeing either ending. Right from the start, I'm told that what I'm going to do doesn't matter because existence is going to end, and I'm having a hard time caring. \n\nI may yet change this review, but so far, not so good. The company that brought us FF Tactics, FF VI and VII and X has lost its way.\n\nUpdate (10 hours): Though a veteran of all things Final Fantasy, I just cannot understand or like this game. After writing the above review, I chose to start over on Easy - which I never do in this series. I also downloaded a few DLC freebies in game. The idea was that by playing in Easy, I could enjoy the story and the game, and not feel like I was just getting kicked in the shins the whole time.\n\nIt worked for a while. Then, I progressed in the story to a point where I go into a graveyard near the end of Day 2. Suddenly, and without explanation, the monsters went from pushovers to \"What just happened?\" Most of the time, I have no idea how I wind up dead.\n\nA few theories: First, I like strategy games (which this series used to be about). I take my time, plan my moves, and dominate the enemy. From what I can tell, this is far more of a game about timing moves - a game style I tend to stay away from. Even worse, you could call this more of a brawler-type game, a style of game I simply can't stand. \n\nAttacks can be blocked, if you get the timing right. However, the screen is usually so cluttered with effects that I usually have no idea what's going on. Additionally, wIth the Stagger system as it has devolved, you are being continually being pushed to full offense, and so even if you see an attack coming, it's too late and you can't get your shield up in time.\n\nAt this point, I think I'm going to save myself the bother and read a synopsis of the story online. For the premium price tag that these FF games take, I feel as though I wasted my money on this one.", "timestamp_created": 1472425103, "timestamp_updated": 1472541711, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58165210485458374", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25197806": {"recommendationid": "25197806", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997382189", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2081, "last_played": 1461353849}, "language": "english", "review": "Sorry if this review is not formatted well, because I haven't written many reviews. ( I think this is my second in the years I've been on Steam) but I felt it had to be written because of the bad rep Final Fantasy 13 has had. I think it's an incredible series and many would agree the ending to Lightning Returns is probably one of the better game endings out there in terms of wrapping things up. \n\nAfter playing 6 of the main Final Fantasies I was sure nothing could top Final Fantasy 7. Final Fantasy 13 alone wouldn't top it but the combination of the trilogy was the first time I actually had to think about it. I can't give a definitive answer but that could be nostalgia. \nBattle System\n    Final Fantasy 13 gives a better more controlled real time action battle system over their previous games. It's not perfect for several reasons imo. It's not really made to hop around like a mad person spamming attacks (in fact you'll probably die fairly quickly if you do). I actually wanted to do this since I prefer to enjoy the story and other elements. You do have to pay attention, the Cloud outfit with its raw power can only get you so far (I'd say like a 1/4-1/3 of the game). Anyway, you can eventually equip a dodge,block,heal and even jump if you want. There are one or two difficulty spikes which are crazy hard and mostly requires you to choose a different path and return later. Also I was surprised to find out there's actually a full on crafting system but it doesn't unlock until after you beat the game. I had no idea. Anyway, technique is much more important that your weapons. At higher difficulties, those improved weapons will be detrimental.\n\nGraphics\n    I've always found Final Fantasy 13 series to be beautiful to look at it and Lightning Returns is no exception. I own the game on both PS3 and PC and I eagerly awaited the pc version when I was 2/3 done with the PS3 version just so I could enjoy 60FPS and I have to say the game delivered. It wasn't perfect at first but after some light patching it is now as far as I know. It runs great on my Laptop with a GeForce 860m (almost max) and of course no problems on my Desktop with a Core i5 and GeForce 980. I never encountered any graphical glitches and I'll say it again, I think the character models are beautiful to look at. The world is not the biggest but PC version does have enhanced textures. I'd say it looks like a smooth PS4 game.\nSound/Music\n    All Dialog is voiced and well at that. Lightning\u2019s dialog is my favorite part of Lightning Returns. She has really insightful monologs and character conversations. I love how she's not naive she may even be border line cynical sometimes but she has a reason to help people so she goes through with it. All the music especially the main FF13 theme, the battle and boss themes are all pretty damm good. I didn't like it at first but it grew on me big time. \nStory\n    The game wraps up the Final Fantasy 13 series incredibly. I'm going to sound crazy fanboyish but it definitely has one of the best ending's I've ever seen in a video game. It's definitely my most favorite Final Fantasy ending by far past the others. It's not even just the main story, the people you help feel like you're actually helping people. It's not always about fetching something for someone (there are grind quests like that too but as rewarding). I was moved a few times hearing some of the NPC's back stories, I couldn't believe they put this effort and so much emotion into side stories. Some are short and some long quest lines. it's kinda crazy because there are some really interesting ones that don't really pop up anywhere, you just have to stumble on them by being curious of your surroundings. Like I mentioned earlier Lightning may be slightly cynical and because of that, the game for the most part is not campy expect some slightly dark stories, death and even questions of morality. It's a very immersive atmosphere and the game feeling very open world helps this. Anyway, every character you can imagine makes an appearance of some kind and the story definitely goes full circle with everyone\u2019s choices over the years. Like I said before, I couldn't think of many games that would wrap up plot points so well.\n\n-Additional notes\nI play the game exclusively with an Xbox 360 controller. I played mostly on my desktop. I own all three games on the ps3 and the first and last on PC. You'll want to spend some time setting up your outfits with their abilities and MAKE SURE you switch outfits at intervals during battles, even short ones.

This game has a timer, just as in Dead Rising, whereby you have to complete the main quests before it runs out. Just as in Dead Rising this game has side quests that are optional and can also be completed within the time frame the game allots you. UNLIKE Dead Rising completing side quests EXTENDS the timer and is integral to the plot. Furthermore you can FREEZE time with an ability that uses EP points (gained from battle). So it's Dead Rising but, generally, easier. Don't let anyone tell you the timer is too harsh; hell if you go ''game the SH1T out of the system'' mode like me you can complete everything in the 4 of the 13 days you are given, so it provides plenty of wiggle room. Granted some sidequests are only open after doing others, and those others might require multiple days past 4, whereas others are opened up in later days. But generally speaking the large ''bulk'' of them can be completed in roughly 4 days (along with mainline quests). The quests afterwards I did without even stopping time since very few 'new ones' showed up.\n\nThe devs thought side quests needed even more of an incentive to go through, so they threw JRPG grinding out the window and decided to innovate. See....there's no actual grinding in LR. It's a JRPG but without any experience gained from battle; there's no point behind them other than drops and money. It's almost an anti-JRPG in that sense. \n\nInstead, quest completion itself boosts your stats. \n\nQuest completed \nrewards: \n+10 strength, +6 magic. \n\nIt's actually one of the more ingenious things this game has come up with and it's really impressive. Rather than grind for an upcoming battle you can go complete story content and plotlines. Granted, these sidequests don't have the branching paths and long, thought out storylines of Fallout sidequests, but it's still impressive how they used it as a replacement for a JRPG element that gets criticized. For it's part I thought the game did a good job of variety and giving each quest character and reason. There's one where a path branches and the reward changes depending on what you pick; more of that would've been great.\n\nThe story itself is better than the previous games, because it makes sense. All open-world games tend to have simpler plots, I feel, because you don't want to interrupt gameplay with constant cut-scenes and the linearity required to constantly interrupt play with story. So if you didn't know wtf was happening in XIII or XIII-2, don't worry. You don't have to. You get the sparknotes version here. \n\nWorth mentioning are garbs: costumes that affect stats and provide abilities as well as auto abilities. They tied cosmetics to customization and made it as important as weapon choice and shields. Nothing new but worth mentioning, as there are an assload of costumes in-game. ASSLOAD.\n\nAs for the battles themselves the ATB system is still here; battles are in real time but most people end up using their ATB gauge in one go and wait for it to refill. They allow you to move during battles which isn't that big a deal, until an ability you can equip comes up; ''ATB Recharge''. The way it works is you recharge ATB quickly for as long as you have ATB recharge pressed, but are vulnerable during and afterwards when you recover from the animation. So it makes positioning in battles actually matter and animations for moves something other than just an animation for a move until your turn is up. Otherwise the game still suffers from some of the constraints of typical RPG turn based battle mechanics in a real time system; waiting for gauge to recharge is really just a slight step up from turn based since you're STILL WAITING; more abilities like ATB recharge would've made it feel more ''real time'' but whatever. Take it or leave it, but it works. So meh.\n\nVerdict? A fantastic end to the XIII series, which had a pathetic start. Love Lightning as a stoic protagonist; really liked how they changed up JRPG elements here, and the ingenuity makes me want to play XV if and when it comes to PC. It's sort of like Majora's Mask in how it did some really cool new things with established formulas, and I wanna see more of it. We finally got to open world, quest based, ingenuity in how levelling up and XP is alloted in FFXIII and it's fan-effin-tastic. I guess the only downside is that if you want to give more 'meaning' to the world and story you gotta play FFXIII lolololololol. And also try to make sense of  XIII-2's plotline lololololol. Even if you don't this game's just so damn good and creative in various aspects.\n\nOh, and the music is so good that I forgot to even mention it since lol it's expected from the XIII series at this

historietas interesantes, la historia principal hay que pasarse el juego entero para comprenderlo y no tiene desperdicio ninguna.\nLa performance segun que pocos sitios pega algun que otro bajon de fps molesto.\nLa historia se merece un 10/10\nSistema de combate un 8,5/10\nMapa y decoracion un 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1470695936, "timestamp_updated": 1470695936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

It has very little to do with the games it is a direct sequel of. The quests themselves rarely have anything to do with the plot, and even less to do with the actual characters. At one point Lightning needs to break into a palace because reasons, but she can't get over the wall. She must first knock over a statue on a stage. But first she has to wander the city collecting fireworks to knock over the statue. And then get a part in the play to get access to the stage. Which she needs a costume for, which she can only get by winning battles in the coloseum. What. \n\nThe setting is bad. The entire game takes place in only four areas: two cities and two wilderness areas. The quests in the cities will make you walk back and forth across them several times over. The wilderness areas are vast expanses of mosly empty land, creating long walks for no reason other than to waste the player's time.\n\nThe combat is bad. The game encourages you to spam moves because it adds bonus damage if you start your attack at the exact same the previous attack lands. Except the attacks use up your energy bar which refills v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y so in all but the easiest fights you're spending most of your time standing around waiting for your bars to refill themselves. \n\nLeveling up is bad. In most games you kill monsters, get xp, and level up. In this game, you kill monsters, get loot, turn in loot to level up. It's basically the same but with an extra step added in. This is the side quest system put in the game in the place of actual side quests.\n\nThe graphics are... decent. But they are a definite downgrade from FFXIII. There are lots of ugly textures. All but the first and last cutscenes are done in-engine with terrible facial animations, instead of the pre-rendered scenes we got in FFXIII.\n\nThere are features of the game that should have been available from the start but instead are only available after beating the game. Things like upgrading weapons and armor.\n\nThe time mechanic, I'm convinced, is there only to frustrate the player and make the game less fun. Time happens in 24-hour days, with each day ending at 6am, when you are teleported back to your base automatically. There are doors that only open at certain times of the day. The only way to pass time is to either stand around and wait, or find an inn and pay some money to fast forward. At one point I was in front of a door I needed to pass for a quest, but I was there 3 hours early. I could either stand there and wait for about 10 minutes of real time, or walk across half the city to an inn, pay my 500g fee, and then walk back. Neither option is fun. In one dungeon there are doors that open/close on every hour. There are no inns in the middle of the dungeon obviously. If you are waiting for a certain door to open or close the ONLY choice is to wait. Time passes in the game at about 3 actual seconds per game minute. So you could be standing there doing nothing for up to 3 minutes before your door does anything. The entire game is also on a time limit, where you only have a certain number of days before the game is over. This time can be extended by doing side quests. In my playthrough I was done with all the main quests on day 4. I had enough side quests done to extend the final day to day 13. So the overall time limit really isn't much of a problem. Except for the fact that the game doesn't let you go to the final area until the final day arrives, and there is no way to skip straight to it. So for about an hour I did nothing but this: talk to innkeeper. Pick a time to fast foward to: scroll through all the hours of the day until I get to 6am and select it. Loading screen. Wake up. Game says it's 6am, time to get teleported back to base. Loading screen. Appear in base, walk to teleporter, choose to teleport back to the inn. Loading screen. Day 5 begins. Repeat all of the above. Day 6. Repeat again and again for days 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12...", "timestamp_created": 1470351035, "timestamp_updated": 1470353832, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561962425708770752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24678121": {"recommendationid": "24678121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070729770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 949, "last_played": 1499391225}, "language": "english", "review": "im not sure why its saying ive only logged 28.1 hours here but my in game time is actually 60+ hours.

No best build that can use in every situation.\n- As above said, the game have many different style and equipment keep looking and try for your best.\n- If you like to just playthough the game for story only. There's no need to be grinding like hell to achieve it actually the game isn't for farming things like other ff game.\n- You may need the controller to play this game no need to find the decent at all if you're not  plan to play other games with controller.

Find item or farm item, return to spot for quest. Run run run find run run run return. You can teleport later, but only to specific points which makes this feel really disjointed.\n\nBattles - The few battles that do happen are even less strategic than the previous games, although more action packed. It rewards timing which I do usually love, however you rarely fight the same monster enough to learn their patterns and when you do, you are usually strong enough to blow through them so its all kind of for naught. The timing feels much less important than equipping the correct skills anyways so you kind of have to alter your equip per zone.\n\nNarrative - Bassically every rule or interesting fact in this game is told to you. You never experience anything first hand unless its a cutscene. Oh time does wierd stuff now... ok, chaos stuff happens now anddd uhhh you live in this heavens area and your a demi-god now... ok... ok.... ok yes... ok... annnnd then go and do side quests... really??? I get there needs to be a setup but that was a very bland first hour.\n\nSound - non existant sound track. Its bassically ambient noise with I think two tracks from the previous game they hit you over the head a bunch of times with, in case you haven't forgotten them. Who needs new content anyways? this is a sequel!\n\nPros\n\nGreat graphics - Really beautiful things to look at, solid animations and nice voice acting (although... the script... sigh)\n\n???????\n\nYep...

There's not a lot Square could have done to rectify the ridiculous convoluted story (90hrs into the trilogy, and I'm still not confident I could explain it to someone if I had to), but I think they have done the best they could to make it reasonably motivating. Games of this length have to be motivating to keep the player interested, and that's where XIII-2 fell down, and where Lightning Returns ultimately picks it back up. Part of this is due to the fact that the game is completely open-world, more so than any other FF game I've played (possibly due to the complaints the previous two XIII games got for being 'corridor simulators'). Literally all of the explorable world is accessable right from the word go, but you quickly realise that there is a logical order to the locations you should visit.\nThe combat system is reminiscent of XIII, but rather than customising paradigms across the party, Lightning herself is able to switch roles on the fly and perform different actions. There is seemingly endless customisation options for these roles using the vast array of outfits which can be purchased from stores, found in containers or won from battles.\nThe game looks fantastic at higher resolutions, in fact much better than I was expecting from what is essentially a port of a PS3 game. SE clearly put some effort into making great visual improvements, and it's just a shame the same effort wasn't put in to optimisation. At launch, this game ran pretty terribly. After a number of patches, the game runs acceptably, but was still prone to pretty serious dips in framerate for seemingly no reason.\nIn conclusion, if, like me, you enjoyed the previous XIII games but were slightly put off by one thing or another, then I'd definitely suggest picking up Lightning Returns, as it makes an effort to correct most of the complaints the previous two games suffered, and it does it very well.

I actually liked FFXIII and was wanting to play this trilogy to its conclusion, but after my time with Lightning Returns: FFXIII (LR), I just have no desire to keep going, and as best I can tell, I'm about halfway through the game. I'm pretty unskilled at games, but it wasn't the difficulty that got me. No, no...I was doing just fine with that, and I was getting the combat system.\n\nThe concept of this game is philosophically awesome: all humans on the world have stopped aging, so no one dies from growing old; only other means like disease/murder. This means everyone who was alive 500 years ago still looks the same, including children, and some shadowy crap that spews out monsters is seeping everywhere, with the last areas of the world poised to be destroyed within one to two weeks (depending on how many major quests, etc. you complete). That has some fantastic philosophical and psychological implications. Knowing this and being a fan of FFXIII, why in the world didn't I like this game?\n\nWell, before that, let's start with one thing I really did like without any negatives whatsoever: Lumina. (don't look her up as her appearance might be kind of a spoiler if you haven't finished FFXIII-2.). She's a young girl who seems to be able to control this chaos stuff that's apparently destroying the world. She helps some people, hinders others, and seems to be making Lightning think and question her cause in good ways while taunting her playfully and occasionally summoning big monsters for her to fight for reasons unknown.\n\nShe's a wild card, with an appearance that raises some serious questions about who or what she is, and why she looks like that. She's doesn't come off as creeper eye candy and her voice was enjoyable; not that high-pitched, annoying standard fare you sometimes from from young female characters in JRPGs. She intrigued me and quite frankly, I have no interest whatsoever about the rest of this game, other than as it pertains to her.\n\nWhat didn't I enjoy? Virtually everything else either turned me off completely or had a glaring flaw that other FF games (including FFXIII or FFXIII-2) did better. Since I was just talking about Lumina, let's talk about the story. Get ready for some awkward Biblical terminologies getting liberally thrown about. Lighning is the \"Savior.\" She calls herself this, as do other characters, and she serves a being she and others call \"God.\" However, that's not its name or a translation of its name; rather, its name is \"Bhunivelze,\" and there are three other \"gods\" that are apparently lower level managers to the \"God\" in this game.\n\nYour mission is to save souls so that when the world ends, those people will be created anew and live again in a new world Bhunivelze will create. How do we save souls? Well, you make depressed people have hope again by doing fetch quests and their souls pop of their chests and into Lightning's, and boom, tiny max stat increase for you (a lot more from major bosses you beat up). Let me repeat that: person is sad, bring them something they want or beat them up, now they have hope again and you get their soul. This is the plot of the game. Hope communicates with you over some sort of radio channel, and isn't very interesting or funny, and Lightning is -less- emotional than in FFXIII and FFXIII-2. LESS emotional. She's even less likable in this game than before, and they even talk about it! Her having no emotions is a plot point which I still haven't seen resolved yet.\n\nWell, except anyone who has ever played a JRPG already knows that something will go wrong with the deity. Either everything with it happens off-screen and it's just a badly written plot device, OR it ends up being fake or evil and you have to kill it. JRPGS love having you kill deities because it's upping the ante...much in a way that some Hollywood movie sequels end up being set in space because they keep upping the ante in each sequel and can't come up with anything more \"impressive\" than going into space.\n\nBut I digress. The game's religious terminologies are just a poor excuse for one of the aforementioned inevitable outcomes with a deity in a JRPG while simultaneously trying to justify fetch quests. I was terribly bored with the three major maps I explored in the game. As best I can tell, there are 4 or 5, and two of them are cities with slightly different design and color pallets. Were you aching for cities/towns with real NPCs that have relevance and shops in FFXIII? Well, you got your wish...they exist here. That's all, though. I found them terribly uninteresting, as with almost every side quest I did. I just kept hoping for more cutscenes to take me away from these dull towns and all the running around through them for so long. They're pretty big and just eat up your time (real world time, not just the game's Time system) instead of presenting entertaining content.\n\nSpeaking of the Time system, you game over in approximately 8 hours or so from starting, while the clock is going. You can freeze time with a spell outside combat as long as you keep fighting monsters to get your resources back to cast the spell again and again, but if you run out of time, you save your game and start over from the beginning of the first major quests with all your gear and stats in tact, and can do the quests over again for 50% of the stat gain rewards from the first playthrough. You can do this infinitely, I hear. \n\nI never restarted, though before I bought the game, I read the reviews and thought this sounded really fun! Other people were griping about this, but I foolishly didn't listen, thinking it'd be awesome to zip through the main quests again while really powerful and still getting more stat boosts in the process. However, having actually played the game, it would bore me terribly to play through even the main quests again. Everything is just bland and uninteresting! The game feels like busy work everywhere except in combat, which I'll discuss now.\n\nLooking at screenshots, one might assume this is a third person action game. Not quite. It's more like FFX-2's Dressphere system and FFV's Job system, but with ONE character and you can only bring 3 outfits. Each outfit gives you different stat boosts and has four slots for equipping attacks/spells, but almost every outfit (Garb) has 1-2 locked-in commands, meaning you can only assign 2-3 commands  (hence the FFV reference). And no, I don't mean \"Black Magic\" is a command so you can choose between a myriad of spells like you could in FFV. If you want Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Aero, it would take all four slots on one of your 3 garbs you can take into battle to equip it. The same goes for all of the debuff spells like Deprotect and Deshell. Also, you need to be able to block or dodge, or bosses will destroy you, and that takes another command slot! \n\nA few non-slotted abilities are available like Curaga, but for the most part, you can only have between 6 and 12 slotted commands in battle, and you don't have a team like you do in other FF games. That means this is one of the most limiting FF games ever made in terms of number of abilities that can be used in a single battle. In LR, it's just too few, and I'm one of those people who thinks other FF games have too many. Other than the blocking, I prefer the combat system in virtually every other FF game made to LR's combat. Oh, and you don't level up or gain stats at all from combat, except against bosses. That sounds refreshing, but I hated it. =/\n\nLastly, the music is simply forgettable for me. I like the first two games' music in this trilogy and remember several songs from each, but I draw a blank here just trying to remember one song from LR.\n\nI don't have much else to say about how uninteresting, bland, and unenjoyable my time was with this game.

It is only in the very beginning chapter where you are restricted on your choices. This isn't limiting, but rather freeing, as it educates you on how to manage your time wisely without feeling impaired. \n\n[b]The Time Limit:[/b] I want to address something I've seen said a lot; \u201cThe game doesn't have options or any freedom because of the time limit.\u201d \n\n[u]My answer is the time limit is more of incentive than it is an actual limit.[/u] Yes, there is a limited amount of times you can hand in or complete a quest but that is only a problem if you neglect to pay attention to your progression in the game. [u]It is IMPORTANT to take the time to explore and soak in the environment if you have any intentions of coming close to 100%.[/u] \n\nTo date I have 132 hours of gameplay. I finished my first play-through with a time played of 131 hours. I would say 50 of those hours were from sitting in menus, reading datalogs, fighting monsters and testing. All points where the clock is not ticking. 80 of those hours were from actual time spent running around exploring with the clock active. The time translation is about [u]two real-life seconds is 1 in-game min.[/u] How did I do this then? Simple; I used my time wisely when it mattered and I used the ability that allows you to stop the clock. I did everything in this game besides kill the super side-boss and I did it without a manual. I took my time to seek out and find all the quests and did not rush.[u]This is the first Final Fantasy title I have EVER played[/u]. Although I am by no means new to RPGs, anyone who is a fan of the series is more than capable if they allow themselves the chance to learn how to play. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\n[b][u]Combat and Gearing[/u][/b]\n\nLR:FFXIII offers the standard turn-based three-party class-orientated combat system that every RPG does but in an refreshing different package with one playable character. You have \u201cATB bars\u201d which translates to turn-per-minute or simply how often you get to do things. The more ATB recharge you have, more times you get to do things. \n\nYou have three different schema in combat (specs/characters) all played by one character on-screen. It is \u201creal time\u201d in that you can't stand idle but with the strategy of turn-based. Which is a nice and refreshing. A spec is reflected in actual outfits that house up to four abilities. They often have an ability locked to it already. Some of them are very strong abilities, others get weaker as the game continues. The point is that you really have three abilities to customized into anything you want. \n\nThe customization of the character was very fun and rewarding as I spent hours just thinking of how I wanted to play. \n\nI found as I learned the enemies I was rewarded greatly for my efforts. I would swap out abilities for ones better suited in the specific area I was in. When exploring I kept a generic jane-of-trades ability load-out so I never got caught facing something I was ill-equip to handle. [u]Despite the swapping of abilities/weapons I never felt like I was being forced to play a specific way but rather rewarded for being prepared.[/u] My mage was always a mage, my tank a tank and my melee a melee.\n\nI did like that high damage / rank does not translate to it being the best. Secondary stats are important and not neglected making combat and gearing about more than just finding the hardest hitting weapon. \n\n[b][u]Story Progression / Character / Ending[/u][/b]\n\nThe world of story is rich and luscious. I found myself interested and engaged. I spent time reading the information provided in the datalog out of pure interest in learning more rather than feeling confused. I never found myself lost because I didn't play the prequels. All I had to do is pop into the datalog and read up on it. Quick read, detailed, coherent, enjoyable. No complaints. \n\nQuesting was well done, all-be it confusing at first. As I learned how the title played and handled questing it became second nature. That said, there is a learning curve, but it goes away as you progress. Best advice I can give is talking to people will solve almost every quest problem.\n\nThere are complaints about it being grindy. I didn't find this to be the case. [u]The fetch quests are a staple of RPGs. Go play a different game if you hate them, you are doing it wrong.[/u] Every RPG is go to location A and do B or collect C. This game is no exception. I thought it was well done. Many of the fetch quests were completed as you progressed through the main story or moved around. Some of them yielded awesome rewards. Others were stat buffs that seemed trivial until facing some of the harder monsters. It adds up at the end. So don't disregard the quest simply because the reward seems to low.  \n\n[u]My standards of story uniqueness are rather high in that it must make sense but my standards for characters are far higher.[/u] Lets be real here, if it makes sense and you follow what is happening then there is a really good chance you've seen the story before. All-be it in a different package, but good vs evil is not unique. [u]What makes a story inviting and new is characters.[/u]\n\n[u]I want to address that Lightning is wonderful female protagonist.[/u] Something we just don't see enough of in any media. She is stoic, confident, and real about the world she is a part of. She is intuitive and capable of evolving. She is also caring and compassionate. Subtle changes that do not happen too soon or too late are a part of her depth. The world and herself do not ignore what makes her-her. If you take the time to stop and appreciate the development of Lightning's personality you will find a great deal of enjoyment. \n\n[u]Sadly the development spent on Lightning is not spent on other characters.[/u] It really makes me sad to see this.  They feel like they are almost \u201cjust there.\u201d The voice acting and lines they deliver are very real, and I was convinced of their importance. They aren't bad or poorly done characters but the fine-detail polish just isn't apparent. \n\nI did find the ending to be restricted due to the characters found in the prequels. [u]The spotlight shifted, perhaps, to far away from Lightning in the final moments of engagement making the player's contribution to the story feel a little lacking.[/u] It makes sense, but it could have been done in a more satisfying way.  \n\n[b][u]Final Thoughts[/u][/b]\n\nI truly love this game. I just wish more people could take the time to let go of their expectations of a title and rather hold their standards of fun firmly in mind. We vote with our wallet and we should never accept anything less than what we pay for. \n\nIf you found this title less than what you paid for I challenge you to go back. Ask yourself if you took the time to set aside your expectations? Did you focus on the bad as an excuse to not attempt to have fun? If you can't find fun in a game, that is okay. Give yourself a chance to though. There are a lot of amazing games out there that have some technical quirks that take a little bit of tinkering to get rid of. That is something you may run into because this game is a port. Read-up and give it more than a few minutes to figure out. [u]I hold by my stance that [i]Lightning Returns: FFXIII[/i] has excellent quality fun inside but it isn't accessible to everyone because of the seemingly daunting clock.[/u]\n\nSincerely,\nVel", "timestamp_created": 1467876726, "timestamp_updated": 1598068038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687711596488952637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24130382": {"recommendationid": "24130382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057731796", "num_games_owned": 2329, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1516, "last_played": 1467630847}, "language": "english", "review": "For Vanille.\n\nVanille got new look.

Pretty much the greatest heroine that the gaming industry has ever given us, full stop.\n\nDo bring a controller of some kind though, the PC controls are a bit awkward, and that's pretty much the -only- downside to this game, the controls, everything else is perfection\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467571511, "timestamp_updated": 1467571511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448866903781890869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24056928": {"recommendationid": "24056928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974722099", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1567093856}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally I got an XBox Controller and was able to play this game.

For example: why do you have to ease peoples regrets in order to save their souls while in the opening scene Lightning can just force a soul out of people? Why doesn't her god even bother telling her anything about his supposedly great plan?

La banda sonora tambien es la misma que en los dos juegos anteriores, una banda sonora a la altura de la saga Final Fantasy, sin llegar a ser la mejor ni por asomo.\n\nY es en la jugabilidad donde este juego se desmarca totalmente de los anteriores, pues, a pesar de que el dise\u00f1o de niveles sigue siendo mediocre, esta entrega nos presenta un sistema de combate totalmente nuevo y mucho m\u00e1s entretenido que el anterior, aportando ese punto de dinamismo que sin duda Square Enix ha estado buscando desde Final Fantasy XIII. Adem\u00e1s, mientras en la primera entrega se nos presentaba un escenario totalmente lineal, y en la segunda varios escenarios semi-abiertos por los que teniamos que ir pasando, esta tercera entrega nos ofrece un mundo enorme con cuatro zonas totalmente conectadas entre si y nos permite elegir el orden en el que las completaremos, destrozando todo tipo de linealidad y ofreciendo una enorme cantidad de misiones secundarias. Finalmente hay que hablar del sistema de arquetipos, un sistema mucho m\u00e1s personalizable que el de los roles de las entregas anteriores, un gran acierto. A pesar de esto, hay un gran fallo en la jugabilidad, y es que al abolir cualquier sistema de niveles, hay pocos alicientes a enfrentarte a los enemigos que aparecen en el mapa.\n\nLa historia es la continuaci\u00f3n directa de la segunda entrega, con el estilo profundo de esta, aunque se echa de menos un villano tan visible y carismatico como fue Caius en FFXIII-2, se puede perdonar ya que la historia est\u00e1 a la altura, y ofrece un final \u00e9pico como pocos. A pesar de esto, la narraci\u00f3n es la peor de la saga, debido a haber abierto el mapa e implementado tantisimas misiones secundarias se pierde el ritmo de la historia en algunas ocasiones.\n\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII es el ejemplo de buen capitulo final, donde se mejora la gran mayor\u00eda de los aspectos de los juegos de la saga y se cierra la historia de forma magistral, sin dejar cabos sueltos y de forma \u00e9pica. Es una compra obligatoria para quienes han jugado a los dos anteriores, y para quien no, vale la pena soportar FFXIII para poder disfrutar FFXIII-2 y este juego, los cuales si merecen el nombre de Final Fantasy. 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1467563715, "timestamp_updated": 1467563715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24036811": {"recommendationid": "24036811", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971521977", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1467515520}, "language": "english", "review": "I really didn't enjoy the time pressure and I had technical issues with it not remembering my settings.

If you hated XIII, just stop. Don't try to convince yourself that  you'll like the other two. Otherwise...\n\nLightning Returns is in many ways the best of the three games. The story is nonsensical, but that's largely true for all three games. What LR is, however, is a swansong. Kind of like how they make up a story for Dissidia, so they can have all these various FF characters fighting each other, the story for LR is basically an excuse for you-as Lightning-to have one last reunion with your party members from the first game, and go off into the sunset. \n\nMechanically, the combat is the best of the three games. It's also the most difficult, though that comes with the caveat that the game will throw all levels of difficulty at you in the same area. The end boss...well, if you have no sense of timing, you're going to be in for a world of hurt, as it comes in 4 iterations, and the last iteration is a test to see if you can figure out how to stagger it. I consider myself a fairly good gamer, and it took me 3 hours to figure out exactly when in its rotation you could actually stagger it (and, once staggered, it dies in a matter of seconds). After which, I browsed the internet, and let's just say there's a lot of misinformation out there on that boss.\n\nThe elephant in the room. Time limits. Assuming you do most of the side quests, you're going to have 14 in-game days to finish the game. I finished the main quest and majority of side quests in the first 4 days. So...yes, the time limits seem ornerous, but if you're willing to kill everything you see and constantly freeze time, it'll be fine. Once you're able to kill the types of mobs that give you 1 EP or more easily (EP is what you use to freeze time, among other things), then you are essentially able to keep time frozen as long as you want-other than when the story forces you to advance. 18 hours to complete the main story + majority of side quests. 31 total hours to complete the game (those last sidequests (consisting of running through each map every day to see if a new quest was available)/exploring/figuring out how to beat the final form of the boss took up almost half the game). \n\nThere's a lot of sidequests. Do them, as they tell bits of story (and improve your stats). \n\nI'll be honest. If this game had a party, and about 10 more zones, and a sensible story...it'd probably have been the best FF game ever made. They had the framework for a great game, and we can only hope that they aren't completely reinventing the wheel with open world when FF 15 is released. \n\nPutting aside the main story, a lot of the writing in the side quests, random npc voices, etc...were great.

The frames are fine, the game is well optimized, and it's exactly like the console version.\n\nThat being said, this game is very different to FFXIII or FFXIII-2.\n\nNow, if you did play the first two, or any other Final Fantasy game (aside from FFXI or FFXIV,) you're probably familiar with its turn based combat, and if you're coming from FFXIII or FFXIII-2, you're also familiar with the Paradigm Shifts. LIGHTNING RETURNS has a whole new take on the combat system. You can move around your enemies, although your attacks are based on your gauge, ie, how many attacks you can pull off in one go, it's not turn based. You can start going all out in attacks against the enemy, then right before they hit, you can sneak in a guard and significantly reduce the damage taken. Then go back to your onslaught, or in the middle of your melee/physical attacks, throw in some magic, all while moving around.\n\nParadigm shifts, I'm not going to explain too much about them because if you played FFXIII or FFXIII-2, then you're already familiar with the concept. Essentially, you can still do paradigm shifts in this, and each time you do, your gauge is pretty much filled back up so you can go back to attacking/guarding, so you don't have to wait for it to fill up each time. This just helps cut down the waiting time between attacks and makes everything feel a little more real-time.\n\nI personally bought this game to finish my FFXIII collection (the other two games are on a different account, don't bother looking for them on this account,) and I was kinda surprised when I saw all the changes in this compared to the others, but I learned it, got into it, and it's just fantastic. The story just follows our epic trilogy and brings us to the conclusion, nothing really shocking there, but damn it's a good story. The music is still just as good as any other Final Fantasy game.\n\nAll in all, I'm really enjoying the game, and although was a little surprised with the new mechanics, I'm thouroughly enjoying it.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10\nVIDEO: 9/10\nAUDIO: 10/10\nOVERALL: 9/10\n\nTL;DR, buy it, it's a good game, but it's a little different than the other FFXIII games.", "timestamp_created": 1466993186, "timestamp_updated": 1466993186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534191727638244629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23846868": {"recommendationid": "23846868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105239642", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 4596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3997, "last_played": 1643422166}, "language": "english", "review": "3 hours struggling to decide what to wear\n11/10 would ask my girlfriend again", "timestamp_created": 1466987965, "timestamp_updated": 1466987965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23846295": {"recommendationid": "23846295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055482009", "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1467703221}, "language": "english", "review": "Please keep in mind that I have not played a single Final Fantasy game, let alone the first XIII games.

The battle system isn't the best in the world, especially compared to what I've seen in the upcoming FF15, but it's good enough to keep me engaged. Anyone that has played Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask will be very familiar with the timer system in this game, as it is pretty much exactly Majora's Mask in that regard; you have a limited amount of time to complete as many side quests as possible, as well as completing main quests to extend the world's time limit. Unlike Majora's Mask, you cannot rewind time as far as I have played, but can only extend the amount of time you have left by up to thirteen days. It would be a rather stressful mechanic, given how side quests can only be completed the same day you accept them, had it not been for the time stopping EP ability that you get fairly early in the game. It's not AS useful as the slow-down song from Majora's Mask, since this spell only lasts for a limited time and you have to reuse it after it finishes, but it still does enough to help with any side quests you may find difficult.\n\nDespite the battle system not being the best I've seen, the ability to change between different movesets via the costumes you unlock is pretty cool, not to mention that the various costumes do provide some of their own effects, making them more than just eye candy.

I got this for $15 at gmg but this is the last time I ever buy a Square game for PC, ever. The lag stuttering is bad and constantly distracts. It is hard core lag-slowdown-stuttering that is inexcusable but expected from Square. They are the bad port masters and this one buddy boy it shows it. It's wicked and angering. I should have known better than to buy this. Square has made me ill for years and this is just the last straw. They get no more support from me because they just do not care about their PC side of their games since 95% of their profits come from consoles. I suppose I wouldn't either.\n\nEven though I am a huge FF fan, my favs being 7 and 12, this one just rubs me the wrong way in several ways. The combat just is imo not very good for a FF game. The 13 day time limit is not fun at all. It reminds me of Dead Rising 2 where if you fail to complete the main mission in time you can start over with your saved stats. I don't want to do that in any game, ever. I just feel very stressed and rushed while playing. Hopefully this is the last time they ever put a time limit in a FF game. I felt so incredibly rushed, especially with Hope chiming into my earpiece every couple minutes telling me to hurry up, that while on the first real main mission where you have to find the pass code symbols I got stuck and couldn't find the fourth one, which in itself is incredibly stupid mission gameplay for any game let alone a FF game. It was in no way fun at all. Without the help of a Youtube guide I would probably have never figured it out because I didn't know you could set the time to wake up at a inn to the next day. I thought if the day ended then you failed the mission, since earlier it had snapped me out of the mission to take me back to the main base when the day ended. It is confusing but i figured it out.\n\nEven more confusing is the gear system and discovering robots early on that have what feels like billions of hp and take me about 5 minutes to beat per battle doesn't help. It says they are weak against lightning but aero and blizzard do twice as much dmg to them than lightning does. It says use lightning to stagger them but lightning, no matter how many times I cast it, won't stagger them. The schemata system is awkward to say the least. Should I have a fire spell in the red schemata slot, a lightning in the yellow slot, and blizzard in the blue? Or can I do like one person I read online and make the red assault, the yellow for debuffs, and put all magic spells in the blue schemata? What a stupid, ill conceived mess.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the more I'm playing the more I think that I might be getting the hang of it. I may just restart the game on easy and try that since normal is hard like folks have said. Then again probably not since, poor performance aside, this game absolutely fucking blows.\n\nPros:\n+ Good graphics\n+ Characters\n+ Fun move switching (when it works right)\n\nNeutral:\nthe combat\n\nCons:\n- Runs like garbage\n- Time constraints\n- Unbeatable enemies in the first area\n- Enemies in the first area that take 5 minutes to kill each time you fight one\n- Awful mission design\n- Needlessly contrived schemata spell/skill system\n\n4/10 the worst FF game I have ever played by far.", "timestamp_created": 1465951593, "timestamp_updated": 1501474039, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.395569860935211182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23557308": {"recommendationid": "23557308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009682181", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1465928209}, "language": "english", "review": "No mouse support.

The best aspect of this game is definitely the combat system, mixing the XIII and XIII-2 style with a more action-RPG style, but being neither of those in the end. It's fun to play, but somewhat cluncky. You have 3 garbs in which you assign 4 abilities (for each face button), and using them consumes your ATB. You'll need to switch often (with the shoulder buttons) to ensure that you have actions to perform and don't get stuck without options. The garbs and abilities are highly customizable, which is a plus. The combat isn't great, but it's good. The rest of the game however, is mediocre. This time you have an open world to roam, but it's bland and you only have 3 settings: 2 cities, forest and desert with ruins. That's it. Sounds good, but in practice means little. And then there's the time limit mechanic. I hate it. I admit that the game gives you plenty of time to do all the main quests and plenty of side quests, but if you want to do everything then the time limit will freak you out. And speaking of side quests, that's how you get stronger this time. Fighting enemies gives you less rewards, and sometimes is a bad ideia to fight, making the new combat system less important. What i really hate about this game is the way it's designed: the game almost forces you to play multiple playthroughs, especially if you're a completionist. Even if there wasn't a time limit, you must replay the game at least 3 times to collect \"everything\" (it's very subjective here). Problem is, the game becomes boring after that. Getting \"100%\" in this game is a chore. Most of the side quests are boring. Travelling is boring. And it shouldn't be that way. The rest of the game isn't great either: the graphics are just OK, the music isn't memorable, and the story sucks. Like i said, playing the game once (and on easy difficulty) is OK. Replaying it isn't. The combat is good, but doesn't make up for the rest of it. I even prefered XIII over this one in the end. The PC port this time is actually decent, but i won't praise it because all PC games should be optimized in the first place.

What's the issue with it?  It's drastically different from your other Final Fantasy titles.\n\nStoryline;\nThe end of the Lightning Saga, wrapping up the Fabula Nova Crystallis universe. And man, what an ending! The storyline is kind of spread thin; the bulk of the storyline is on the Final Day. In order to unlock the Final Day, you need to gain Eradia, the bulk of which is gained from saving the souls of some familiar friends. It's a very hit-or-miss storyline; I can see how people might not like it, but for me, it's one of my most favorite stories of all time.\n\nGameplay;\nThis is where the drastic changes come in. While the previous FF13 games were more relatable to turn-based games, Lightning Returns is more relatable to action games.  Some fights require you to move around the field in order to strike a specific part of an enemy.\n\nYou have 3 \"schemata\" each with their own ATB gauges. Using actions require different amounts of ATB, with your other schemata's ATB gauges recharing while they aren't currently in use.  There are some action elements, like Perfect Guards and Perfect Attacks, where you perform guards/attacks on a specific frame in order to reduce damage to 0/increase damage.\n\nAlmost immediately from the start, the game becomes open-world.  While you spend the first 15-20 minutes or so in Luxerion, you're soon given free reign over the 4 different regions; enemies are all relative in strength for the first 7 days.  After the 7th day, they get modifiers to their HP, Attack, and Magic stats.\n\nDifficulty;\nIt may just be because I'm terrible at action games, but even on normal mode, I found this to be the most challenging Final Fantasy game i've played.  One of the story bosses in The Wildlands means business, it took me an hour or two to find the right setup. \n\nThe superbosses are an insane challenge.  Aeronite in particular - you've got to take off 8-9m health within 3 minutes.  The first few times I attempted him, I was barely able to take off 3m before he took off.  I ended up completely cheesing it with a whole lot of ethers.\n\nMusic;\nI may not have been listening too closely, because I didn't catch much, if any, songs unique to Lightning Returns.

I suppose with enough ,practice I could find the right flow, and it would come natural, but after 15 years of gamin, this is something I've only seen done when two dudes were playing a flash game together. What compounds this process is that when you change schematics, they come with abilities that are binded to their own button. So, you can have 3 schemes at a time, and switch between them. So i set guard as the F button on two, only it moves to space bar on the 3rd. I go to that one, hit F to guard and OOPS, hit in the face because I can't establish any kind of muscle memory for the controls. Believe me, I tried different configs, nothing feels natural, comfy, or something I could see myself getting used to without 40 hours of practice.\n\nSo the actual game.

LIGHTNING RETURNS\u2122 aknowledges the faults of previous installations and offers this time only four areas that are considerably sizeable compared to one big area fo the original FF XIII. \n\nTo be more dethful LIGHTNING RETURNS\u2122 has a 13 day cycle. Unfortunately the days don't really vary, just mostly add more quests. So the game doesn't come anywhere near the (very old) gloriousness of the Majora's Mask where every day was unique and the fates of inhabitants were genuinely touching. The writing team seems to be aware of this and really like to emphasize how Lightning has lost all of her humanity and empathy and is a do-gooder only for quest-rewards, or something. \n\nOne thing that really shines in the game is the voice acting. The game is full of sounds and every line that is said is voice acted. This might come close to 20 hours of voice acting both in japanese and english. This partly remedies the lifelessness of the game world and the game is more vivid than Final Fantasy XII, which had the series record in this field.\n\nDespite the critique of the world I had two reasons for complaining. Another them is a stupid and addicting cheat code called chronostasis that should be NEVER used, the game would have been better without. I think time restrainment in rpg is a very cool idea especially if failing makes you stronger (and smarter). Another complaint is that the guy responsible for dress attributes should have been fired.

My main motivation for and why I even played it was to get some closure on 13-2's ending and Serah and Lightning. I approached it with the mindset of completing it as quickly as possible to see the story, but I found myself enjoying it more the farther I got.\n\nSo first, things I liked. I loved the environments. Such an improvement from 13-2 in terms of size and utility. There was much more to see and do in the world that felt a lot more expansive. I liked how there were a greater variety of NPCs you could interact with (whether as vendors, quest givers, or just random people) It also looked a lot nicer than 13-2, particularly the Wildlands and the Dead Dunes. Side quests are a MASSIVE improvement over 13-2's. I'm not talking about the side AREAS in 13-2 like the Vile Peaks or the extra Oerbas that had a side story (they were well done and we SO needed more of those), I'm talking about those meaningless fetch quests with pretty much zero interaction and take up the 80% of the side quest datalog. In LR, there are more side quests, and a good portion of them have interesting stories and actually feature our protagonist INTERACTING with the quest givers. Not perfect, but a major improvement. I actually liked how this game took a bit more of a personal tone with the protagonist, really delving into Lightning as a person and character. I wish 13-2 treated Serah in the same way. Maybe because this series is pretty much just about Lightning :/. \n\nMoving onto things I didn't like: \n\nThe time system. It's awfully frustrating and inconveniencing. How I have to wait for a specific time to access some area or a particular quest. There are some quest givers that only appear during certain times of the day and some parts of any main or side quest can only be done at certain times of the day. And once you're finished your quest and go to turn it in? Oh sorry, the NPCs aren't there anymore and you have to wait till the next day... It's annoying, especially when you have a THIRTEEN DAY TIME LIMIT. You have to painfully wait for some quests to progress because of the time while having a constant reminder of the short amount of time you have left. It's stupid. I know there should be enough time to complete most of the side quests, but it's stressful to have to worry about what time of the day I can do what while being reminded that time is running out. I understand how the time limit imposes a sense of urgency that's more realistic, but it could have been far less annoying and restrictive. Maybe I just want to take my time, enjoy the environments and explore as much as I can.\n\nThe combat. I liked having a real time battle system (it's what I'm used to), I liked being able to time my attacks, my dodges, and my guards. It made fighting more immersive. But what I liked even more was the more strategic-based combat system in 13-2. I liked the paradigm system where I was able to choose my strategy, assign roles to party members. Every move felt like it had some thought and planning put into it. I usually like real time combat, but for some reason, it felt off in this game. Nothing bad about it, it's just a personal preference, I guess.\n\nThe story for the most part felt rather incoherent and messy. There wasn't some underlying path Lightning was treading on to reach her goal. Her journey felt all over the place. There wasn't anything significant tying each chapter of her goal to save Serah. It felt like she was just visiting the areas to do busywork, taking part in the irrelevant lives of others. Yes, she was working to save the souls of her close friends, but it wasn't tied to her ultimate goal. It feels like the work she's doing throughout those thirteen days didn't advance any part of the overarcing plot: to save Serah. The final encounter did not have enough buildup from the plot at all, which made it feel rather incohesive with the rest of the story. I still enjoyed Lightning's reunion with her friends throughout her story, however, especially the Snow part (one of the sections where you could really feel the connection to the plot). Sections like that maintain the game's continuity from its predecessors.\n\nThe villain was a disappointment. He wasn't much of a character. He basically had no presence in the whole game until the very end. He had zero development and didn't feel like a threat at any point in the game, because he was missing for like 95% of the game. You couldn't really feel his influence on the story at all, it's like he came out of nowhere and conviently makes an appearance to take the physical form as a target who the good guys need to unleash their weapons at. \n\nThis brings me to my biggest complaint: how the characters were handled. My ultimate motivation for playing this game is to get some closure on what was left behind in FF13-2. Mostly on the characters. For the most part, the characters were handled well throughout the story. It was how they wre concluded that left me really disappointed. Serah, the person that Lightning starts this whole journey for, the centerpiece behind her motivations, and the person who was the main drive for her actions and story, is basically non-existant in the game. And what little there is of her takes form mostly in a fake Serah they created. I thought this was a neat concept (especially how this fake developed to harbor feelings for Lightning) but WHY NOT use what little characterization and development time there was on the REAL character? You know, the one Lightning talks about for the WHOLE GAME. But the biggerst letdown was how the journey for Serah concluded. There is basically no satisfactory closure on her relationship with Lightning. What did Serah want to say to Lightning after being revived? Did she forgive Light for her death in 13-2 (we should all know the answer but I would've liked to hear it from her)? Did she and Light have anything to say to each other after 500 years that showed the power of their will to be together again? Did she have any words about how she felt about everything that happened and being together with Light again? Did she even acknowledge Snow? Her fiance??? Nope, it ends just like that. She utters maybe three lines (that weren't all that memorable) before the game ends. Lightning has spent THREE WHOLE GAMES trying to get her back, even defeated a god. Then it's like she came back and it doesn't even matter at all. I mention Serah, and not so much the other characters, because I really felt like Lightning and Serah were the two most important characters in the trilogy (on how every game has been about them trying to be together), with everyone else a whole level below in terms of significance. If that is to be the centerpeice of your trilogy, it better be well developed and concluded, which I felt that it was not. Not only that, closure on the other characters were scarce too. It's like how everyone is leaving behind their old lives and homes, and no one cares. This game needed better, more satisfying closure on the characters than that last cutscene. It's supposed to be a happy ending, which is good, but there's no reason that a happy ending like this can't be more satisfying.\n\nOverall a decent game that I enjoyed my time with, despite frustrating things, mostly because of the return of characters I grew into, even though in some cases they may have been inconsistent or lacking. The gameplay held its own well enough for me, though on a mechanical standpoint, this game really doesn't have much going for it, as there isn't anything all that special about it. The game is mostly carried by the characters built from the two precious games, and their stories. If you like the character or generally like Final Fantasy or JRPG style characters, then this may be your thing. If you don't care about the characters or the story beyond 13-2, I would say this isn't worth the time.", "timestamp_created": 1463651216, "timestamp_updated": 1463726030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23027305": {"recommendationid": "23027305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032207192", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1463432144}, "language": "english", "review": "Dispite how much I managed to like 13-1 and 13-2, this one made me uninstall it after this little time, but it is a very personal opinion.

The first game was rather bland in total. It had some nice character development, but the story and gameplay just fell flat for me. So then I tried the \"sequel\" which was really just a completely different game that happened to use the same characters. Honestly nothing from the first game really mattered for the second. Combat felt a bit better, since it focused on two characters instead of two parties worth that you had to juggle back and forth if you wanted even growth (hint to developers: if your cast is bigger than your party, share exp with all of them, not just the active party). Asside from being completely unrelated to the first one, the story was pretty good, though the ending was obvious sequel bait.\n\nAnd that brings us to this one. Which I feel is the worst of the lot. First of all the time mechanic and open world feel like terrible ideas. I know they got a lot of flak for how linear the first game was, but trying to follow a story in an open world game is always a pain. I go over here and find something out and then go over there and pretend I've never heard it before because they didn't know which I'd do first. The timer had me initially worried about running out of time, so I stopped time as often as possible, which resulted in me finishing ALL of the main stories by day 4 (out of 13). So I relaxed a bit more and did the side quests... and got them all done by day 8. So the Savior slept through the last 5 days. Needless to say, between those two elements pacing was killed, cremated, and thrown to the winds.\n\nCombat was pretty meh at first, but the tougher enemies just annoyed me. They weren't so much hard as tedious as hell. There were a couple enemies I got halfway through and just reloaded a save to ignore them. Your selection for combat is also rather limiting and there's no way to adjust in combat for the various enemies you'll face. Where the last game gave you access to all the spells in a set that you had (if still forcing you to have certain Paradigms) this game limits you to 12 abilities spread over 3 outfits, each with one or two locked in abilities. (Another developer hint: don't do this crap. Allow players to be flexible in combat, not force them to reload and change the loadout because they didn't bring a fire spell or something.) And then there was the timing elements which were just annoying. It didn't feel like things were telegraphed all that well either for your attacks or your enemies (such as for attacks that seemed to move the camera off to some other part of the field entirely or come from off screen). Overall, I just avoided it near the end.\n\nAnd finally there's the story itself, we've got another disconnect where it's 500 years past the last game (which had a good deal of jumping around by itself) and we start off at odds with a number of our past friends. It felt like the game was deliberately trying to make Lightning a boring character, despite most of her actions in the field not really fitting with that persona. Certain parts of the plot are dragged out between various days but are forced to wait for the last day for final resolution... which makes very little sense honestly. I could tell stuff was happening but for the most part I had either no investment or no clue.\n\nOverall I can't recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1463022169, "timestamp_updated": 1463022169, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478586822748184204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22902248": {"recommendationid": "22902248", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998602481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1581, "last_played": 1460150509}, "language": "english", "review": "Horrible, terrible game design, buggy and boring.", "timestamp_created": 1462916046, "timestamp_updated": 1462916046, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.340624988079071045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22893562": {"recommendationid": "22893562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122567047", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1367, "last_played": 1533493735}, "language": "english", "review": "\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u6211\u6c92\u6709\u62ff\u5230\u4e0b\u8f09\u5167\u5bb9\u88e1\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\u6a23\u5f0f sad", "timestamp_created": 1462877841, "timestamp_updated": 1462877841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22891087": {"recommendationid": "22891087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093869757", "num_games_owned": 677, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 2211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2017, "last_played": 1463126181}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally a good port of the FF13 Franchise and Lightning is back fluidly in 60fps!\n", "timestamp_created": 1462860713, "timestamp_updated": 1462860713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622342944145202637", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22891021": {"recommendationid": "22891021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250449888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7304, "last_played": 1466688507}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished it!

Pues porque si un enemigo es d\u00e9bil a un elemento que no tienes equipado, te jodes.\n\nTe jodes, a secas, puedes huir del combate, pero pierdes una hora, y si quieres volver a intentarlo tienes que entrar en un men\u00fa poco intuitivo y bastante engorroso para cambiar tus configuraciones, habiendo podido dejar algunas predefinidas (GRACIAS).\n\nY ahora viene el segundo problema, las habilidades son objetos equipables que por si fuera poco, en tu primera partida van a hacer una basura de da\u00f1o (15-60% de tu ataque base, que puede ser 400; para acabar con monstruos con 30k de vida). Un engorro.\n\nPero el juego viene y te da una buena noticia: \"las habilidades se pueden mejorar para que sean m\u00e1s efectivas\". Noticia que por cierto, te da en cuanto matas a un \"\u00daltimo\" y pillas objetos especiales y dif\u00edciles de conseguir; caus\u00e1ndote adem\u00e1s, que no vuelvas a poder conseguir las habilidades que dropea ese enemigo (y no se pueden comprar), puesto que al matar a un \u00daltimo de una raza, no vuelve a aparecer NUNCA m\u00e1s hasta que no empiezas un new game+.\n\nEn definitiva, el juego se convierte en un come horas de farmeo, que adem\u00e1s te bloquea el farmeo, y aunque original, limita un sistema \"en tiempo real\" de forma que lo convierte casi en un piedra papel tijera lagarto spock dej\u00e1ndote solo usar piedra o tijera, debido a la forma est\u00fapida de limitar un juego tipo final fantasy en lo que por lo general, lo mejor es la gran lista de opciones a mano.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1462470823, "timestamp_updated": 1462470823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502556443214416504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22802632": {"recommendationid": "22802632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074734380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 8812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4662, "last_played": 1540921438}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down, best game in the series. Great improvements over the last two games.

I love the new system where there is no more just pressing one button and the new introduction of guarding requires precise timing. It made me sit on the edge of my seat and focused on the battle.\n\nBut the game do has flaws. Expect A LOT of backtracking. There is a steep learning curve at every bosses (which, for me, is kind of good), voice acting somehow became worse than before, the combat feels cheap once you acquired some very good abilities while I find myself never using most of other abilities, same thing with schematics, and the game feels restrictive when it comes to playtstyle (you WILL end up using a defensive set up).\n\nBut the pros outweigh the cons. I absolutely love tons of side quests and bits of lore here and there. I feel connections with the NPCs when I finish the quests and I definitely love dressing Lightning up in cute and sexy outfits.\n\nFinal boss is kind of meh, XIII-2 has a better final boss. But hey!

The artwork is killer, the gameplay mechanics come across quickly while having major depth, the story team really found their groove with wrapping up the mythos, and everything is polished to a mirror-shine - it's all top shelf craft.\n\nThere's nothing to have a problem with there.\n\n...and the game is a HUGE improvement over its predecessors. The environments are expansive and free-roaming from the beginning, and the emotional core is handled far better. Yes, it really is a bunch of fetch quests, yet it all manages to contextualize itself in a motivating way. Not everything is directly tied in with the main plot, of course, but everything does manage to feed into the main plot. The \"just a bunch of random stuff going on\" problem is NOT in play here, which is a welcome upgrade from \"XIII-2.\"\n\nSo, why did I hate the game at first?\n\nThe theme of the game is time, and the race against it. This is already a bit of a precarious thing when it comes to a Final Fantasy title, where the \"Take Your Time\" trope has been essentially baked-in since the 8-bit era. The experience of racing the clock gets downright VICIOUS in \"Lightning Returns,\" because of how everything seems to pile on.\n\nTo start, battle is a tough business in the early game, and battle is still central to getting anything done. Fighting is also clearly tied to the central \"time\" theme, with getting the rhythm of the encounter exactly right being very important. The thing is, getting the rhythm exactly right is extremely difficult. The window for getting a \"perfect guard\" (where you take no damage) is very small, and the enemies hit hard. The window for getting enhanced attacks is even smaller - so small that I gave up on it almost immediately. (To be fair, it doesn't seem that enhanced attacks are really core to successful gameplay.)\n\nFurther adding to the difficulty of battle is the way resource management works. You start out with a very limited stack of carryable restoration items, and a similarly shallow pool of EP. Your EP is sort of your \"safety net,\" because you can cast curative magic from it. Where things get hairy is that EP is also your pool for attacking powerfully, and for all practical purposes, you can NOT restore EP with your item inventory. (There are ethers in the game, but they are as rare as megalixirs were in other titles.) You restore EP by winning battles, but winning battles can be quite pyrrhic: A difficult encounter can burn through all your items and all your EP, leaving you with nothing in reserve for the next face-off.\n\nYou have to fight to progress, but fighting is actually pretty dangerous.\n\nIf you get into a really tight spot, you can escape from a battle and get your used items back, but escape costs some of your limited time.\n\nAll this creates a nasty ball of frustration, especially at the beginning of the game. You don't really have a handle on how long things are going to take to do, so you don't know if you're taking too long to do them, There's no indication of exactly how much is required to extend the world's time, and the go-where-you-want nature of the game means that you can waste precious hours in finding out that you're just not ready for a major encounter. (The only way to find out is the hard way.) If you're like me, you end up being very tense about everything that doesn't go well, because running out of time means starting over. From the beginning of the game. (!)\n\nAs a motivator and tension builder, it's incredibly effective. It can also be not very fun.\n\nThe good news is that things get a lot better as Lightning strengthens. As that happens, and you get some wins, the tension begins to ease. That's when you can really start to appreciate just how tightly woven the whole thing is. I might even go so far as to call the game a masterpiece of interlocking mechanics.\n\nA pretty darn difficult masterpiece, but still.\n\nWhen you do \"find the groove,\" you'll have many hours of enjoyable questing in the world. You'll even get good at the time-management aspects.\n\nSo, why did I give up at the very end (literally, at the final stage of the final battle)?\n\n\"Lightning Returns\" ended up doing what the other games in the \"Fabula Nova Crystallis\" series did: The end boss is essentially a puzzle that is not solved in ways that have worked for the rest of the game. If you try to solve the puzzle the wrong way, you encounter a near-vertical difficulty spike. You can have progressed diligently through the whole of the quest, finding a setup that works for you, and then \"bang,\" the setup stops working.\n\nThis title, much of the time, has your character on a solitary journey. To give Lightning the necessary versatility to survive, she's equipped with \"schemata,\" or battle setups that allow her to switch \"jobs\" instantly. The thing is that it's easy to start leaning heavily on say, physical attacks. It's a bread-and-butter configuration that actually can end up being very effective - right up until the tail-tail-tail-end of the game.\n\nI finally survived the other stages of the final encounter, and suddenly noticed that my attacks were doing almost no damage...on an opponent with over a million HP! I went back, tried switching things up, couldn't repeat my previous success, tried again, got beaten into the ground, and finally said:\n\n\"Forget it. I could win the stupid game if I was willing to have a three-day fight with this thing. I'm going to find the ending on YouTube.\"\n\nOther people have, of course, legitimately seen the quest through to the actual end, but I was done. I play games to enjoy myself, not to be frustrated by trying every combination of character configurations.\n\nLike I said earlier, though, this game is really well made. It seems to be the perfect capstone to the series, even if I really disliked parts of it. If you've played the others in the series, be sure to play this.

Can\u2019t speak for the keyboard controls as I use a controller but in terms of the game itself the time concept and the open world nature FINALLY back to an extent is very refreshing to see again. The game play is fun and the story is not as deep as other games but still a good game, just a shame it didn\u2019t get much development. Really love lightning as a character but the whole emotionless all the time though got annoying but well play the game and see what happens. If you haven\u2019t played it then may be worth playing if you want an end to the XIII story and played the other two but overall I didn\u2019t mind it. Just I\u2019ve played it on PS3 already when it was out. Only got the steam one because it was pretty cheap on sale. [/spoiler]\n\nPositives: \n[list] \n[*] The successor to XIII and XIII-2 and how the other two games should have been. \n[*] Finally open world again allowing for doing things pretty much however you want with the exception of time based events. \n[*] The time concept was an interesting one. And for those who find it annoying just keep using Chronostasis. When I played it on PS3 I stopped for awhile and totally forgot about that ability and ran out of time. But using that ability you pretty much never will run out of time. \n[*] [strike]Lighting dress up simulator. [/strike]\n[/list] \n\nNegatives: \n[list] \n[*] Found myself doing a lot of grinding for items or quests. But that\u2019s what I expected having played the PS3 version upon release. \n[*] The depth of the story was a little bit disappointing. I was hoping for a super expansive story and universe after XIII was a little bit of a flop. XIII-2 improved a little but while LR was good, it wasn\u2019t the bound I was hoping for. \n[*] occasional cringy dialogue. \n[*] Time sink.

By the time LR had been released I didn't think it looked very fun.  I really only wanted the story since this was the finale.  I built a good computer and found out that FF 13 was coming to steam.  So I replayed them on steam while waiting for the next one.  I never played LR until it came out on steam.  \n\nThe story is split up from the start.  You get to pick where you want to start in terms of the story.  There are 4 different areas with 5 main storylines and a bunch of side quests.  Completing those main and side quest will reward you with base stats.  So you'll get stronger the more quests you complete.  The game is large so there is quite a bit of running around involved.\n\nUnlike the other two games this game is on a timer.  12 in game days which in my first playthrough was way more than enough to get through the entire main story and almost all side quests.  So don't be stressed about the timer.  Also if you don't happen to make the timer there is the option to new game plus.  You'll keep all the stats and non key items you've earned.\n\nI was very confused at first and frustrated trying to learn how exactly you are supposed to stagger enemies.  Not being able to see their stagger gauge unlike the previous games and just increasing the stagger gauge in general.  It took a while but once you learn the game is very fun.  It's basically the same as the previous games except increasing the gauge is different for every enemy.  Enemies stagger in levels, so basically after staggering an enemy once their condition changes.  They might be aplied debuffs such as deprotect or become vulnerable to certain debuffs and elements.  Some will stagger with a single perfect shield and some have to be staggered 4 times before you can even deal significant damage to them.\n\nOther than that the game can be challenging at times and pretty technical.  It requires a lot of learning to deal with enemies and their attacks.  Perfect shielding and retaliating correctly to stagger them is a lot harder in this game than it sounds.  Especially if you're still learning the basics.  Just stick to it and it'll be a fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1460408532, "timestamp_updated": 1460408532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22357269": {"recommendationid": "22357269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065036811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1496676687}, "language": "english", "review": "Cant even start game after reinstall it, and not even able to be refunded . shitty steam", "timestamp_created": 1460385389, "timestamp_updated": 1460385389, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22351554": {"recommendationid": "22351554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154949402", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1506631116}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1460346153, "timestamp_updated": 1505036601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22347679": {"recommendationid": "22347679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021924865", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537244898}, "language": "english", "review": "Why did it take me so long to play this game?

I bought Lightning Returns primarily for the dress up, and my expectations weren\u2019t high. While I wasn\u2019t a fan of FF XIII, and even less of a fan of it\u2019s confused, malformed sequel, you couldn\u2019t fault either game for their excellent selection of high quality, glossy lipped and slightly dead eyed Japanese dolls. The producers of Lightning Returns seem to have realised this and baked it into the marketing campaign with all the subtlety of a cruise missile aimed at a nunnery.\n\nWhat will come as something of a surprise to many then is that the game is not the car crash disaster it by all rights should have been, though it is heavily flawed. Lightning Returns is a good example of why steam needs a middle ground rating \u2013 I can\u2019t honestly give it a thumbs up, not without serious caveats but dismissing it entirely is every bit as unjust.\n\nThe core conceit in particular is both original and compelling \u2013 God is going to end the world in seven days in order to create a new one, being evidently based on the bored bi-polar sociopath of the Old Testament. You as the hero can do nothing to stop this \u2013 all you can do is save as many souls of those in this world as you can, so that they may be reborn in the next. There\u2019s a further wrinkle to this - no-one has been born in 500 years, but equally no-one can die of old age. However, people may still be killed by other traditional means such as disease, misadventure or good fashioned suicide. This sets up a nihilistic Children of Men-esque world covered in a thick malaise of apathy, offset by a tense race against time as you do what you can to save what little hope is left.\n\nThis being based on the characters and premises of FF XIII, this potential is of course completely squandered. The story is borderline incomprehensible at best, a train wreck with no survivors at worst. Set 1000 years after the first game, Lightning is awoken from cryosleep by God and has agreed to be the world\u2019s soul collecting saviour with the hook that her sister Serah is reborn in the next world. But she\u2019s also had her emotions removed, the reasons of which are never adequately explained, so why she should be moved by this emotional plea is unclear. Removing your main character\u2019s personality as well as driving motivation doesn\u2019t sound like a recipe for entertaining drama without a careful writer at the helm. Sadly the writing is roughly on par with the last two games \u2013 which is to say it\u2019s crushingly, wincingly awful. All of the characters you either loathe or barely remember make their melodramatic, floppy haired return, and chew their way through dialogue so purple it would make Anne Rice blush.\n\nWord of advice \u2013 set the language to Japanese. All credit to the English voice actors, they do the best they can with the material they\u2019re served but this is hot, George Lucus tier garbage and not understanding the words being spoken adds a comforting, brain shielding barrier between player and script. Your comlink companion Hope (also thankfully de-emotioned) never shuts the fuck up either, and in English his repeated dialogue goes from irritating to excruciating very quickly indeed.\n\nSo it\u2019s down to the mechanics to save the whole show, and I personally found the game quite compelling in spite of its shortcomings. The impact of the time limit on this game can not be overstated. Make no mistake, this is an absolute core part of the game that cannot be ignored in any way, shape or form. You have six in game days to finish the whole thing, with an hour of game time being roughly equal to a real-world minute. You have a limited supply of EP (I forget what it actually is, so I\u2019m going to assume it refers to Lightning\u2019s collection of Emerson Lake & Palmer records) that can be used to stop time for about three real world minutes \u2013 EP is regained slowly, typically by killing baddies. Time management is absolutely crucial, and it is a massive barrier to relaxed exploration. If this sounds like a deal breaker to you, I would not recommend this game regardless of how much you want to see Lightning in her knickers.\n\nIn terms of freedom, Lightning Returns finally gets the balance right after the hand holding corridor of FFXIII and the borderline cryptic non-linearity of the sequel. There are four large areas, each containing their own main quest as well as a series of side quests that can be tackled in any order, though enemies do get tougher in the larger, more open sections. The side quests are of particular import \u2013 Lightning does not level up by fighting monsters (the lazy cow) and instead gains flat bonuses by completing these quests. They\u2019re of a variable quality \u2013 there is a literal \u201cfind my dog\u201d quest, but there are some nice multi-tiered interwoven quests that don\u2019t inhale dong in there as well. The time limit alongside a general lack of waypoints can make this aspect of the game quite frustrating, and I feel that they should have made these more optional \u2013 you will have to complete a sizable number if you want to have hope of beating the bosses or even some of the tougher basic enemies.\n\nA word of warning - The game is surprisingly difficult, and demands you learn its mechanics quickly. You will need to learn how to block quickly, or you will die, frequently and unceremoniously to even the lowliest of enemies. You will not be able to muddle through things on the default difficulty \u2013Every loss results in a loss of a precious hour from the in game clock. The first boss in particular is a wake up call, and they only get harder from there \u2013 seriously consider starting on easy if action games are not your forte, though it should be noted that if you do so your future descendants will feel your gaming shame.\n\nThe battle system is fantastic once you get the hang of it though. This is by far the most action orientated of any of the FF games, with nary a menu to be seen. You control only Lightning this time, but she can switch between three different costumes at will \u2013 when one is in use, the ATB gauges of the others will recharge faster. While each costume has different abilities and stats, you\u2019re largely free to customise their active abilities as you wish. There\u2019s a bewildering number of costumes and accessories available, and those wanting skimpy bikinis might want to temper their expectations- while those exist, they\u2019re vastly outnumbered by the range of much more tasteful outfits. This is probably for the best, as Lightning is built like a 15 year old boy with two oranges in a bra \u2013 her bottom is Isaac Clarke levels of flat. Flatter than Master Chief. Flatter than Sigourney Weaver in Alien. I\u2019m not some kind of badonkadonk zealot, but this is heartbreaking stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1460050965, "timestamp_updated": 1460051370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614781677722930908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22281534": {"recommendationid": "22281534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090817125", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1401, "last_played": 1586781309}, "language": "english", "review": "why i still in the loading page after the 1st scene of story and i cant proceed to the game anymore??? still loading................", "timestamp_created": 1460018312, "timestamp_updated": 1460018312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22250809": {"recommendationid": "22250809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063218960", "num_games_owned": 2095, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 9708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7999, "last_played": 1460564932}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will teach you how to dress prettily.

Given my opinion of the other two games that's not saying all that much, but I genuinely like this one.\n\nThe battle system is the best thing to happen to a Final Fantasy game in years, it's a fantastic hybrid between direct character control and picking commands from a menu and it's something I've never seen before.  It's possible it was ripped from some MMO I don't know about, but it was very fresh concept to me and it took me by surprise how much I'm digging it.  The battle system alone is enough to put this game ahead of the other games in the series for me.\n\nI also really like the character customization system.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel about basic abilities like attack and guard being limited, equipable items, but it works.  The garb (aka dress) system also works because, whether we admit it or not, we all like playing dress up with our virtual action figures (they're totally not dolls! :) - whether it's putting spiked pauldrons on a barbarian or a highly impractical \"armor\" on Lightning.\n\nBeyond the combat systems, I like the general structure of the game too, even though it's exceptionally basic.  Sadly none of the quests are all that compelling by themselves, they're still all Fedex and monster hunts, but I like the regulated nature of having a bunch of quests and gradually working through them.  It keeps me going in Bethesda RPGs where most quests are similarly hollow and mechanical in nature, and it kept me going here.\n\nThe time limit did worry me quite a bit.  Basically you have a limited about of time to accomplish a particular number of tasks in game, and if you fail to do so, you get a bad end and have to restart.  The notion that I could play the game for 20+ hours only to get a bad ending and have to start over seemed ridiculous.  However, it turns out it's a complete nonissue. I decided to play the game on easy because I was so worried about that and I ended up completing all main quests and like 90% of the side quests by the game's half way point without looking at a guide once.\n\nThe story is the one area I'm pretty disappointed with the game.  The plot is nonsense, but that's no different than the other FFXIII games...or Final Fantasy games in general for that matter.  However, in other FF games you at least get some degree of enjoyable spectacle in how the story is presented - big set piece moments and scenes.  Apart from the always cool opening cinematic, I've only come across one other scene that I thought was cool.  Other than that, the game doesn't even get its anime drama-on properly.  All the series main characters have like 2- 5 minute cameos at best, during which they try to cram in entire emotional arcs and it comes as especially absurd how quickly characters change from one viewpoint to another and resolve their conflict.\n\nSo the story is a wash like the other games and the spectacle that was the saving grace of the original FFXIII isn't there, but I like playing the damn thing more than any other game in the series.  It goes without saying that you shouldn't bother playing this unless you suffered through the other FFXIII games, but if you do, you might just find is a nice way to finally be done with that chapter in FF history.", "timestamp_created": 1459832672, "timestamp_updated": 1459832746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503944039344787598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22246049": {"recommendationid": "22246049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063920137", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2082, "last_played": 1513800851}, "language": "english", "review": "I was surprised: Lightning Returns is a great game.

People lived for 500 years stuck at the age they were when the ending of XIII-2 happened, no new people are being born.

Story has flashes of brilliance in terms of ideas, but never seems to understand what to do with them. Cutscenes are horribly and sometimes amateurishly directed, dialogues (often monologues) are boring and often poitnless. mini-stories in side-quests are sometimes interesting, but tied to most boring fetch quests you can imagine with most intriguing and involved quests in the entire game being the very first one you get. Things often just happen, get dropped, kinda picked up by the end, but there's no unifying feel to any of it. Everything is just *there*.\n\nSame goes for the combat/RPG systems. Yes it is more involved and action-y than other XIII games, but it's still boring and often pointless. It's no Vagrant Story of Parasite Eve II. In terms of the soul saving, time restricted mechanics it's no Valkyrie Profile either, despite Tri-Ace working on the game. Also some features that could make first playthrough fights at least a bit less pointless are locked away until NG+ and some stay locked unless NG+ is played on Hard. Because reasons.\n\nIt's a game with a great premise that fails in devlivering on it. That has features and mechanics that have been used in much better and more fun games. That has an unsatisfying story, that could bring an interesting end to the trilogy, but instead goes for a \"Lightning wet-fantasy fanfic\" feel, that often reminds of Metroid: Other M in terms of how boring, self-indulgent, repetitive and stupid it is.

However, this game does not support mouse control so you could only play with either a controller or just the keyboard. Unique to the PC platform is the ability to increase the graphical performance of this game as there are options for resolution, lighting effects, shadow quality and et cetera. There is also the options for english and japanese voiceovers which are both equally good.\n\nIn this game you play as Lightning and you have thirteen in-game days to complete it. You might think that it would be very constraining since you are given a time limit, but you are also given an ability to stop time which you could use to complete various quest and activities. Speaking of things to do, there are quite alot of them! There are five main questlines and over a hundred side quest/canvas of prayers to do to increase stats and unlock cosmetics. You could also hunt different monsters to extinction and would be given a powerful reward in doing so.\n\nThis game would be a delight for those who love customization. You could unlock many different garbs, weapons, shields and adornment to dress Lightning up in and they each have special abilities and stats. The combat in this game is pretty satisfying as it is semi-action combat and no longer turn-based. You could customized your garbs with different abilities and this would allow you to pull out some great combos during battles.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing and really fits well during different scenarios of the game. After completing the game you are given the ability to continue with new game + which allow you to retain almost everything such as gears and stats. You might be wondering why would you want to replay the game again, well there are some pretty cool features in new game + such as a hard mode for added difficulty, ability to upgrade weapon, shields, accesories as well as the ability to restart the game from day one with almost everything intact at any point of the game.\n\nOverall this is a great game and I would recommend it for those who like customization and role-playing games.

Lightning Returns is the final game of the FFXIII Trilogy. That being said this game is made to give the player closure after playing FFXIII and FXIII-2. The closure this game gives may or may not be enough for some people but you just have to play it to find out if it is enough for you. Now Lightning Returns introduces a new combat system, Instead of the menu combat it is now Realtime Combat. Realtime Combat made the gameplay extremely immersive and alot more fun (In my opinion). Now Lightning gets to use 3 Schemas which the player can customize like this:\n-Garb\n-Weapon\n-Shield\n-Accessory 1\n-Accessory 2\n-Adornment (Optional Wear: Bunny Ears, Tails, Wings, Tattoos etc.)\n-Ability 1\n-Ability 2\n-Ability 3\n-Ability 4\n(Note that some Garbs have locked abilities where the player cannot put their own ability into the locked slot)\nLightning again uses 3 Main Schemas and switches out between the 3 different schemas the player has put into their Main Schema Slots.\nATB Bars are basically Mana Pools where Lightning uses an ability and that amount of ATB is taken from the ATB Bar. (Note that ATB is NOT shared between your Schemas and will regenerate when not in use.)\nCombat Highly Revolves around how well the player can perfectly Block and Attack. \nStaggering is the main way to do damage, Staggering has different conditions depending on the enemy and there are many different ways you can stagger a single enemy. \nThe player may choose whatever goes into the schema and is completely up to the player on which they would like to use. While on the topic of Schemas I would like to address a complaint that some players have about the Schema Setups.\nSome players may feel forced to use a certain garb for a locked ability [spoiler] Soldier of Peace with Artemis's Arrow [/spoiler] Choosing to use a garb for the reward of easing the play is the PLAYER'S choice and not the games. I personally beat the game using garbs that Lightning wore in the previous games; which are given to the player for free in the Rewards Barter Shop (Only on the PC Port, On console you must have to have a save file from FXIII for 1 and FXIII-2 for another).\nOne of the aspects of the game are the Time Limit, You are given 6 Days to start but by progressing through the story you are given more. (PROTIP: DO NOT LOOK AT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OR YOU WILL GET SPOILED VERY HARD ;-;) Now roughly 2.5 seconds in Real Life are equivalent to 1 Minute in Lightning Returns clock. So 1 Hour of Lightning Returns time is equivalent to 2 minutes and 30 seconds of Real Life. That being said a Full Day in Lightning Returns is about 1 Real Life Hour. The clock is stopped during cutscenes, fights, and interaction with NPC's. Do not feel rushed, Square Enix knows that the time limit may be stressful and they incoporated abilities to help Lightning get through the quests without running out of time. \nLightning is also given Eradia, which can be found in the bottom left corner indicated by a glowing orange number with orange bars. Eradia has many uses which are given to the player throughout the game. Eradia is lost when using an Eradia Powered ability and is gained by killing enemies. Certain enemies such as, Niblets, will not grant as much Eradia (roughly .02 Eradia gain) than slaying a Zaltys ( 1 Eradia gain). So killing big monsters will grant more Eradia to let Lightning use the Eradia spells.\nNow the world is dying and it's all because of the Chaos. Chaos can be seen as a black aura with many tiles. If Lightning chooses to go to this area enemy encounters are alot harder. The enemy is given certain buffs while in the Chaos but if it leaves the chaos it becomes a regular enemy again. Fighting inside chaos may prove a challenge but if Lightning does win a battle inside the Chaos she is rewarded with: Bonus Eradia, Bonus Gil, and a higher chance of good drops.\nUnlike the regular experience system in other FInal Fantasy games, Lightning Returns doesn't give you an experience system. Instead Lightning gets stronger through finishing: Main Quests, Side Quests, and Canvas of Prayer Quests (The Board found by Chocolina). While it may annoy some people having to grind quests to get stronger, it is optional. I was so engrossed in the story that after day 7 I slept all the way through the last day to see the ending.\nNow we all play Final Fantasy Titles expecting story. Lightning Returns gives us story, some may not like it some may, Personally I enjoyed it. The story may be rushed at times but isn't that how it's suppoused to be? The world ends in 13 days and you can't dally or you fail your mission. The ending is something very special and if you hate Lightning as a character from FXIII and FXIII-2 for her attitude I would say you HAVE to play Lightning Returns. I personally loved Lightning as the main character throughout the series, being cold, violent, and mean made her seem like the biggest ***** alive but if that's the reason you don't want to play Lightning Returns you are doing yourself an injustice. The ending is something VERY SPECIAL while many seem to hate it I loved it (Even though I could barely see the screen through all my tears). It's something unique to say the least, I had always had an emotional connection with Lightning and the character progression of Lightning in this game parody'd (Related too well) to me, May have just caused a more emotional effect (I literally was blind in tears) \nNow Square Enix forces you to start with either Normal or Easy, Both do NOT offer the full experience and the player must play again on HARD, which is awarded after completing the game. You basically have to play through the whole game again to get the full experience. May be annoying for some people I found it fun going through the tougher bosses for round 2.\nThe PC Port of FXIII Lightning Returns, as said in other reviews is undoubtedly the BEST PC PORT for the FXIII Series and is great. I ran FXIII Lightning Returns on 1920 x 1080 60 FPS (Ocassionally dipped down to 40) on a NVIDIA GTX 960M (Comparable to the GTX 750TI for Desktop Users) I5-6300HQ 2.3GHz with 8 GB of RAM\nFXIII Gets alot of hate and alot of negative reviews for different reasons and people always have differing opinions. If you did play FXIII and FXIII-2 you MUST play this one. If you want to start with Lightning Returns I would highly oppose it, and URGE you to play through FXIII and FXIII-2 to get the story and get the most from FXIII Lightning Returns.\n\n[h1] Too Long; Didn't Read [/h1]\n\nPROS:\n-Realtime Combat System\n-Gives Closure\n-Replayability (The game gives the option for NG+ I have seen people do 9 Playthroughs)\n-Open World (Not Linear like FFXIII)\n-SE Gives an ability to FREEZE Clock\n-Lightning is Customizeable\n-BEST PC PORT for the FXIII Series\n-Most entertaining and immersive boss fights (IMO)\n-Game Comes with DLC (Except the Aerith and Seigfried Garbs)\n-Character Development \n-Beautiful Landscape\n-No Party Members (If you didn't like the FFXIII Characters will be a pro)\n-No EXP system (Lightning gets stronger through finishing Main and Side Quests)\n\n\nCONS:\n-Time Limit (Unless you play like a turtle or lose every fight you will not Time Out)\n-Military Time (The Game Clock is in Military Time, Might be difficult to tell time for some people)\n-Rushed Story (Makes sense because of the time limit)\n-If you don't play on HARD you don't get the full experience.\n-No Party Members (Revolves around Lightning, May be a Con for some people)\n-No EXP system (Some people liked grinding monsters to lvl, I am not one of those people)\n-Difficult Boss Fights (Hard NG+)\n-Story might be difficult to understand (Really only in the beginning)\n\nSolid 9/10, My favorite of all the FF games.\n\n(I will finish this review after my completion of NG+ on HARD)", "timestamp_created": 1458768578, "timestamp_updated": 1459213380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661121845245361", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22009794": {"recommendationid": "22009794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079158559", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5310, "last_played": 1487628920}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un gran juego que cuenta con un diferente estilo de batalla bastante adecuado para mi gusto.\n\nEn definitiva, ha sido una buena compra.", "timestamp_created": 1458760783, "timestamp_updated": 1458760783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503267943859100342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22007038": {"recommendationid": "22007038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163694979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 5440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5440, "last_played": 1458640971}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][u]tl;dr[/u][/h1]\n+ decent gameplay; almost action game-esque\n+ collecting different outfits, weapons and shields\n+ quasi open world \n+ interesting side stories\n+ a girl asked me to find her green doll. I brought her a red doll. She started laughing hysterically and went insane. The game told me her soul was now lost forever.\n\n- main story is completely inane\n- pointless and annoying time limit \n- framerate is still terrible\n\nI'm really torn on this one.\n\nOn the one hand the gameplay is pretty decent and I would definitely lie if I said I didn't have fun with this game. Finding and changing between different costumes (surprisingly few of them are metal bikinis!) and weapon/ shield/ ability sets really motivated me to continue playing and exploring. Battles still mostly revolve around the stagger system which has a lot more depth this time around. More often than not you won't be able to dish out any meaningful damage on your opponents until you finally stagger them. However the conditions to do so vary from enemy to enemy. Sometimes you have to attack using a specific element, or use only physical or magical attacks respectively, other times you have to wait for them to attack you in a particular manner (like wait till they raise their weapon and stand on one leg) and then block/ dodge and counterattack or knock them over during the wind up. Part of me wishes they would have turned this into a proper action game (like Devil May Cry) or an action-RPG (like the Tales of series) because it certainly feels like those at times if it weren't for the lack of direct control. But, in the end, it's still fine the way it is. \nThe only thing I didn't like gameplaywise was the timelimit. In fact I absolutely hate the whole idea. It doesn't even make sense from a storytelling perspective. Because apparently ever since what happened in XIII-2 the world itself has been slowly dying over the span of hundreds of years. But only in the last 13 days God decides to bring back Lightning to collect some souls for him. Like, he really couldn't have done that a little bit sooner...?\nAnd now from a gameplay perspective, why would you ever design an open world RPG that more often than not asks you to run from one side of the map the other, and then limit the time you're allowed to explore all these areas? Even moreso when it's constantly shoved in our faces (Really. Hope never ever shuts up and reminds you - I think - every ingame hour which is about three minutes in real time that you're supposed to 'hurry up!').\nNow, what most people will tell you, though, is that the time limit hardly even matters. And that's completely true. But, you know what? That ultimately makes it even worse, in my opinion. Because when the game constantly prompts you to speedrun through the game, you're most likely going to hurry from plot marker to plot marker and NPC to NPC to finish as many story and side quests as you can before you \"run out of time\". But in doing so you inevitably run out of things to do about halfway through the game, which means you now actually have to purposely waste time until you reach the final day to trigger the final story quest. That's just bad game design and so unnecessary as it really doesn't add anything to the gameplay or the story.\n\nThen again, the story...\nWhat a pile of crap, honestly. What the hell were they thinking? It almost reaches fan fiction levels of disconnectivity. None of this has anything to do with the original XIII, yet for some barely explained reasons the entire main cast of XIII still plays a major part in LR's story, although they mostly just look like them and act completely differently. It really feels like this was supposed to be an entirely different game which had the FF XIII theme slapped on top of it.\nThe dialogue is pretty damn cringe worthy as well. Mainly because Lightning is probably the biggest edgelord in Final Fantasy history, surpassing even Squall, Sephiroth and Paine. I mean, come on, she can no longer FEEL anything!? She forgot how to be happy or sad? Why.............................................\nThis ties right into the ending which a GameFAQs user perfectly describes as \"the most unbearably hammy, cheesy cheese filled cheese videogame ending I have ever witnessed in my 20+ years of gaming\". It's a textbook happy ending if I've ever seen one, yet it doesn't explain jack sh*t, because apparently you'll have to read like 3 extra books to even understand half of the stuff that happened in this and the previous games. I think I'll pass...\n\nApart from the main story, the sidequests are kinda good though, I'll admit that. Maybe also a bit corny every now and then (Thank you Lightning, for showing me the mistakes of my past, so I can redeem myself!) but there are definitely some interesting side stories. You meet a lot of different characters and personalities, who will sometimes go out of their way to tell you their entire life story (another thing that kind of goes against the whole idea of hurrying up), but at least they actually have something meaningful to say. Some of the sidequests build upon each other in a way that you have to finish one person's quest and learn about their past in order to realize that this is the exact kind of person who can help with another character's problem. The game rarely points you directly to your destination and you kind of have to look for the relevant quest items or NPC yourself (while the time limit ticks down...).\n\nAll in all a solid experience. Out of the three XIII games it's the one with the best gameplay in my opinion, but also the weakest story.\n\nAs for the PC port. I personally didn't see any improvement over XIII-2 whatsoever. The graphic options are there, like on paper. But what does that even mean when I choose between 'standard' and 'advanced' color correction. I played around a little bit with all the different options, but excluding resolutions I didn't notice any difference. The framerate is still terrible, because it costantly jumps between 60 and 30 fps lock every time it loads a set of NPCs. But at least you can permanently lock it to 30 fps now (Yay...?). Battles ran at a perfect 60 frames per second for me (which was the same experience I had with XIII-2).", "timestamp_created": 1458752015, "timestamp_updated": 1458752288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49751242995262146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22005067": {"recommendationid": "22005067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030408286", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1526809374}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful graphics, but a bizarre story, some bad writing (in places) and the extremely unnecessary/restrictive time constraints ruin the game.\n\nIt's not as fun as the first two, simply because you're always rushing around.

Confusing plot, mundane gameplay, annoying characters; the list goes on endlessly. I'm a massive Final Fantasy fan (played all the numbered entries, some spinoffs and currently clocking 1000 hours on FFXIV) but FFXIII and its sequel is a steaming pile of disappointment. When Lightning Returns went on sale, I still had doubts that the trilogy could get me interested. One hesitant purchase later, I was pleasantly surprised that all my earlier worries were for naught. Not only is Lightning Returns a great comeback to quality Final Fantasy, but it's also one of the most exceptional RPGs to come out in a while. And just so I can make this clear before continuing my review: [b] you don\u2019t have to play or like the first two games to appreciate Lightning Returns, although they may help in your enjoyment of the game. [/b]\n\nThe plot picks up centuries after the second game\u2019s ending. After being crystallized for hundreds of years, Lightning awakens to find that the entire world is ending in 13 days. Numerous monsters rise from sinister zones called Chaos, most of the world has been engulfed in darkness and the remaining traces of civilization left can be found in the Dead Dunes, The Wildlands and the cities of Luxerion and Yusnaan. The worst realization for Lightning, however, is her sister Serah being held captive by the god of light, Bhunivelze. The god then made a deal to Lightning: she would become his servant for the final 13 days in return for her sister's freedom.\n\nI have not finished both prequels, but I can assure you that the game does a good enough job in explaining its branching storyline. Some terms and characters are foreign at first for new players, but it's nothing a few hours of playing the game can fix. The story is also easier to follow and not distracting unlike in the past two games. Also two giant thumbs up for wrapping up the story in one of the most epic finale in the series!\n\nSpeaking of characters, Lightning Returns takes a step forward for the supporting characters and a massive leap for our titular heroine. If you couldn't stand any of the characters in the prequels, you'll be glad to hear that this game made their presence actually bearable. All returning characters except Lightning receive limited screen time, but their personality this time around is fleshed out through individual story arcs. With an impending apocalypse in sight, it\u2019s not really surprising that many of the upbeat characters took a turn for the worst. Lightning herself is no longer the constantly broody genderbent Cloud from the first game, but a strong woman who is constantly seeking out her true self while looking out for her sister. From her rich interactions with the other characters and NPCs, I realize that she could be snarky, cynical, hilarious and even (gasp) feminine. She yearns to help others while always putting her mission first. I couldn't help but notice that the characterization of Lightning here just screams Geralt from The Witcher 3.\n\nI would like to thank Square Enix for heavily revamping the combat system and making the battles actually enjoyable. Still remember the clunky mix of turn-based and real-time combat of the prequels? In Lightning Returns, the battles feel like a fresh hybrid of FFX and Crisis Core. You can unleash different attacks real-time using the four button inputs while keeping an eye on the ATB bar. If your ATB bar runs out, you'll be unable to take action for a period of time. Timing your attacks, managing your bar, exploiting the enemy's weaknesses and switching between garbs (which I'll get to in a sec) form the combat mechanics of Lightning Returns. There's even a dose of Dark Souls thrown in where timing your blocks become essential to survive against tougher foes and bosses. Unlike other Final Fantasy games, Lightning Returns will reward players who can master strategic combat instead of those who can grind the longest or obtain the best equipment. This is further backed up by the lack of EXP system in the game.\n\nWait, did I hear that right? No EXP, so no levels? That's absolutely correct. The term \"experience points\" and \"levels\" is nonexistent in Lightning Returns. The only way to boost Lightning's stats is by completing main story missions and side quests. Instead of getting EXP, killing monsters will net you new skills, rare weapon drops and EP for your counter. The EP counter is sort of like your SP bar in traditional RPGs for using utility skills. The only reason you will want to grind mobs is to farm skills and build up your EP counter for very situational moments. Strong skills are essential to create the ultimate Lightning, but fear not since the drop rate in this game is abnormally high.\n\nIn exchange for controlling Lightning the entire game, our heroine can equip different armors called \"garbs\" to fulfill the role of an entire party. Think back to the different roles like Commando and Ravager in the prequels except it involves Lightning switching garbs mid-battle instead. Each garb has their own ATB bar so timing your switches is essential since they can only refill their bar while on standby mode. For even more customization, the garbs can be modified heavily with skills that drop from monsters. The maximum number of garbs you can wield per battle is three, and there are over 80 different garbs you can buy and find. Not to mention all the garbs have pretty sweet designs!\n\nA major complaint I've seen by most critics and players is the clock system. Every three seconds in the real world equals a minute in Lightning Returns. Right out of the tutorial level, you are given only 13 in-game days to complete numerous tasks before the world ends. Fail to do so and Lightning might not be strong enough to fight through the final day. Here's a confession: this feature was actually the main turnoff that almost made me pass the game. Even I thought the developers were on meds when they decided to make a time-restricted RPG. Guess what? By the 9th day, I was able to complete virtually every side quest and story arc! This includes me wandering around aimlessly, backtracking a lot because I felt like I skipped a treasure chest and even falling asleep once (which, by the way, causes the game to pause automatically to not waste precious time). My total playtime was already a good 40ish hours by then. The clock system may sound restrictive, but the time available is actually much, MUCH, longer than you think. For those who played the game and still think that time is too short, be aware that a skill to temporarily stop time is forever at your disposal for only a measly 1 EP. The only minor annoyance with this feature is that some quests can only be taken and turned in at specific times. The same goes for the accessibility of several areas in the world.\n\nAll in all, I consider Lightning Returns as a reminder to why I love the series so much. It's the second game I ever cared to Platinum to date, so take that as you will.\n\nDefinitely a strong [b] 9/10 [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1458709977, "timestamp_updated": 1458711225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643265962600708008", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21988222": {"recommendationid": "21988222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998699595", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1583618747}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor de la trilogia FFXIII, excelente optimizacion, pero que aun no llega a las grandes glorias del pasado, si eres jugador nuevo te gustara mucho, buena grafica y por fin tenemos algo de exploracion.

I really have to say it is definitly one of, if not my favorite final Fantasy to date. Just improves upon many of the somewhat mediocre aspects to the combat system in the XIII series. Performance and graphics are great (Minus Luxerion at times) and the whole customization thing just blows my mind. Adding so much variety to your combat style and really encouraging experimentation. I spent hours just customizing for look and fighting style trying to find good balances. I mean come on I used to stop and gaze at her for days in XIII, now I can do it with different outfits. Just.Plain.Awsome.\n\nThe difficulty was also a very, very sweet suprise as in my case the XIII series had yet to offer any real challenge at all so far, just auto-spam, spam, spam with occasional stratedgy required here and there but even those were trivial at best. Now the battles feel way more engaging than ever before. This and so many other reasons are the reasons I cant decide my favorite over FFX or FFLR athough Story wise X takes the cake of course. Especially considering this is the third installment so of course theres no suprises here. But I did enjoy the story more than I did XIII-2 so def an improvement imo.\n\nThough some people have a dislike towards lightning, I never shared them. I love her strong demeanor and always prefer a hardened heroin over one like Sarah for instance. It saddens me that this is the final chapter for her, love me some lightning xP\n\nAll in all a great conclusion (I assume) to the XIII series and a great step forward in the overall mechanics of how to modernise a Final Fantasy game.

Truly, Congratulations.\n\nNow I'm not a huge Final Fanatasy Fanatic, I only really played a select few like Tactics, 7 and 8 so going in, I didn't know what to expect. I do have a certain passion for turn based games as most FF's are like but what this game gives you is no turn based RPG. The only game I could compare this to would be Transistor ( Another top 5 ) but even that is a stretch. Whats great about this game in particular is that it literally takes my favourite games of all time and combines them. Perfectly. [b]{DETAILS}[/b] Majoras Mask quests and time restraints keeps you constantly thinking of what to do next, but theres no Song of Time in this game. Transistor in a sense of combat, after running into an enemy ( no random encounters, they spawn near player ) you're taken to an arena where you battle it out. Most FF games have parties, sadly only select sections in this game do you have said parties. Instead, you have 3 different classes you can switch to at will, each with their own ATB meter, or energy in a sense.  Which combines, somewhat, a beat-em-up game, where certain combos have unique specials and you're constantly switching between classes for the best output. \n\nThe game was a great bang for your buck with my first playthough going on for 40 hours, after only purchasing the game for 10$. I would have easily spent 30$ if I had know it would be this good. Re-playability looks to be profitable with doing quests you never got to complete and getting the equipment you could never afford. But I think I'll wait a while before that. Total, I have little to no complaints. Looks great, runs great, feels great. I just highly reccomend a controller.\n\nEdit: FFXIII is not as fun, this is totally better\n\n[h1] Buy it? Buy it.

Gran Pulse was invited to a picnic, but was given nothing but shit sandwiches. All that's left of the world now is Nova Chrysalia, four continents inhabited by humans who have lost their \"time\". Children never grow up, adults never grow old, and the seniors... they just keep being old. For 500 years the last remnants of humanity have endured, but it's all coming to a close. The world is ending in 13 days, and no I'm not talking in JRPG days. The clock is ticking, and only a Goddess can save everyone's souls. Lightning has returned to settle this mess once and for all.\n\nAs with the previous game (FF13-2), Lightning Returns is a major departure from the first entry, yet it carries over many of the sub-systems and combat-design. It's a decidedly different adventure, with its emphasis on open-world exploration, and stat-building tied almost entirely to quests, but the elements of familiarity keep everything somewhat grounded. The battle-system still revolves around the number 3. Lightning can equip three schematas aka outfits. Each set of clothes has different stats or abilities tied to them. These schemata are customized further with abilities you acquire from monsters or treasure. \n\nBattles are entirely real-time, and you're given far more agency than previous FF titles. By switching between the three schemata, you'll account for every possible situation. You can even deflect large amounts of damage with a perfectly-timed block. Unlike a number of JRPGs, high stats tend to take a back-seat to planning, strategies, and reflexes. Lightning also has access to a handful of EP skills. These powerful abilities can really turn the tide. All in all, the battle-system in this game is excellent. It really feels like the culmination of all of the ideas Square-Enix has implemented throughout the FF series. \n\nThe rest of the game is more interesting in concept than execution. As with most open-world games, there are a lot of side-quests. These side-quests usually involve fetching items, or finding people to converse with. This means you'll be spending a ton of time just running around. The in-game timer isn't too much of a worry, especially on the easy setting, because you can just spam chronostasis to stop the clock. However, your real-world time is going to be rather dull and annoying. I won't lie, I used a guide to locate all of the quest-giving NPCs. There was no way I was going to run circles around every continent just to find people. \n\nIt's too bad really, because there is a subtle cleverness to NPC interactions in this game. As with previous FF-13 games, most of the NPCs don't really have anything to say, aside from sharing their opinion on Lightning's current outfit. What is this? [i]Skyrim[/i]? Maybe the guards will ask Lightning to conjure them up a nice warm bed next. Anyway, almost all of the interesting NPCs have ??? marks over their head. This is what catches the player's curiousity. Sometimes these NPCs can't be talked to at first, so the player will think: \"Hmm... I'll have to keep them in mind in the future.\" When using a guide, all of the mystery is lost, since you'll know where to go, when to arrive there, and how to go about accomplishing the task you're given.\n\nWhile there's a heavy amount of combat in Lightning Returns, there are actually very few bosses. This is disappointing for a number of reasons. Due to the constant fighting, you'll figure out the strategy for every monster, and get lulled into a sense of complacency. Unfortunately, this means you'll be ill-prepared for the few major encounters, which are varied and immensely thrilling. In keeping with LR being a \"send-off\" for FF13, you'll face \"Last Ones\". Ever see that Jet Li movie [i]The One[/i]? Same concept. When a monster is hunted to near-extinction, the Last One gains the power of all the others that had died before it. Some of these Last Ones can be really tough, especially when fought near the very end of the game. The problem is that you either have to grind away, or face them all in a gauntlet. I tried to do a bit of both, and it led to boredom and then frustration, because I got my tail handed to me quite a few times.\n\nI really like the idea of The Last One, it drives home the fact that this might be the last time you experience FF13. Unless, of course, you decide to play New Game+. I approve of any RPG that implements this system. Although, I think making equipment-upgrades NG+ only is a real head-scratcher. I believe that having weapon-upgrades available earlier would make the level of difficulty more fluid. More players would opt to choose the normal setting for a first play-through, if they had additional opportunities to strengthen Lightning. Also, while this game offers a lot of niceties to NG+ players, you still have to re-do almost every quest, especially if you're like me and didn't defeat a certain end-game super-boss. \n\nAs for the story, well, I can't tell you how many times I got the urge to skip a cut-scene or three. It's not that the storyline is particularly bad, there's just not much to it. When there's organized religion in a JRPG, you already have an idea of how things are going to turn out. A lot of the time I felt like I was just going through the motions. Still, I have to say that Square-Enix really knocked it out of the park with the final portion of the game. Everything about the last hour or two is just perfect. To give an idea of how good it is, it not only lifted my opinion of LR, but also the other FF13 games. This is a trilogy that put its cast of characters as well as the players through a lot of crap, but its ending is so great, that I felt it was all worthwhile.\n\nSurprisingly, this port is the best of the FF13 PC trilogy. Aside from that nasty online-only DRM that was quickly removed, I'm very pleased with how it turned out. Granted, the frame-rate chokes a little when moving around, but for me it's always been at or around 60 fps during battles, which is exceedingly important. I didn't run into any crashes or other major issues, and that's always nice. Actually, there might have been one crash, but I'm going to blame it on my PC, it was acting a little strange that day.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Lightning Returns. Aside from its many unique ideas, this game presents one of the most refreshing and fun battle-systems in franchise history. It carries over the familiarity of the previous FF13 titles, but with its own spin. Nova Chrysalia is an interesting world, and each continent has at least one or two cool aspects to it. While LR's ambitions are never quite matched by tight game-design, S-E still managed to craft something very special.", "timestamp_created": 1458189088, "timestamp_updated": 1458226890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687827825546264648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21880422": {"recommendationid": "21880422", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992506916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 810, "last_played": 1460220178}, "language": "english", "review": "gud game.\nwould bang lightning\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1458185077, "timestamp_updated": 1458185077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49751242995262146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21879209": {"recommendationid": "21879209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040005780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1601, "last_played": 1458991971}, "language": "english", "review": "The Eternal battle of Fashion VS Effectiveness Continues.", "timestamp_created": 1458177222, "timestamp_updated": 1458177222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21877364": {"recommendationid": "21877364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083747141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1672570829}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 (y)", "timestamp_created": 1458167147, "timestamp_updated": 1458167147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21863046": {"recommendationid": "21863046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218886583", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1126, "last_played": 1490198447}, "language": "english", "review": "best port for pc, good story, good gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1458096691, "timestamp_updated": 1458096691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21862447": {"recommendationid": "21862447", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978600652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 200, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1458091734}, "language": "english", "review": "Five centuries after XIII-2 the world is going to be destroyed in thirteen days and it's up to Lightning to get the band back together ... in heaven.  While it might not be as dumb as it sounds to me, what I do know is the plot will be delivered almost exclusively through forced exposition that DOES. NOT. STOP.  You will hear conversation after conversation repeating the same exposition, often several times in a row!  Need a thing?  Don't need a thing?  Don't worry, your loyal resident Navi, Hope, will remind you every five minutes to get that thing, even if it so happens you can't get the thing, don't want to get the thing or are trying to find a different thing.\n\nHonestly, this game has opened up a new genre for me that I dub the 'chore' game.  Lightning Returns is quite literally a series of expositional cut scenes intersped with fetch quests.  The chore is both literal, the never ending fetch quests, and metaphorical, as in this game is a chore to play.  Yet, as awful as that sounds, every character is in on this joke: even Lightning herself contually bemoans her fate before begrudgingly accepting these countless, thankless tasks.  It's not a good sign when the lead character's only motivation is to acquiesce because she has to, but tell me game, what's MY motivation.  Every quest, and I mean EVERY quest will work as follows: a person will tell you something they need, get that thing and take it to them.  This either completes the quest or leads you to the next person who needs something.  Yay.  This formula will not be deviated from.\n\n\nWhile we could have a philosophical debate that nearly all games work this way, other games usually try to pad this out a bit with dialogue, minigames, crafting, inventory management.  Something!  In Lightning Returns you are either fetching an item or looking for a person to fetch for.  I would have been shocked if a SINGLE character you spoke with said, \"I can help you, right this way!\"  Spoiler alert: that will never happen, and neither will anything else.  So it's basically what it looks like, a cosplay fetch quest fantasy.  I'm not really sure what Square Enix was trying to create here but while I admit it might have some charm and appeal for some, personally I found it too limited to put up with for more than my recorded play time.", "timestamp_created": 1458092825, "timestamp_updated": 1472097795, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443025290966033936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21858748": {"recommendationid": "21858748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052953768", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1674, "last_played": 1457991474}, "language": "english", "review": "Waifu dress up simulator where Lightning must kill God himself to create an atheist utopia.

Practice makes a huge improvement.\n-Vast array of outfits to wear, each with their own buffs and abilities - AND they react to wind and movement, which calls for [i]fantabulously impressive[/i] victory poses!\n-A myriad of adornments to add style to Lightning. More than I can keep track of.\n-Anti-frustration features and intuitive controls/interface\n-Memorable story, music, and visual art that capture the essence of the Final Fantasy universe\n\nCons!\n-Many outfits become obsolete upon progressing to New Game+, because the bound abilities can not be upgraded.\n-Some bosses can be -incredibly- difficult on your first playthrough, and may make you ragequit. [spoiler]*cough* Chocobo Eater *cough*[/spoiler]\n\nAlmost cons, but more just gripes.\n-Lightning looks slightly different in CGI cutscenes, as if she's wearing makeup that she isn't wearing in-game.

It's slightly difficult to recommend to anyone who's not already into JRPGs or familiar with Final Fantasy (which for all intents and purposes are rather 'Westernised' and not particularly 'hardcore' JRPGs anyway), but that kind of goes without saying. It's a niche genre game and a great one at that. I know people have been critical about the FFXIII games, but from the few hours I've spend on this game so far (about 11 hours) I'd generally disagree with most of the critique. It got me hooked fairly easily, despite a few flaws.\n\nPROS:\n-excellent voice acting, both in Japanese and English\n-great sountrack \n-great combat system with surprising depth in strategy because of the Schemata you can customise and abilities you can upgrade.\n-your clothing (garbs), weapons and items determine a large portion of the damage you do, health you have and so on, which makes for a very good combat system\n-no XP level up nonsense grind here, although you can upgrade general stats from around half-way through the game\n-defeating monsters actually requires skill and blocking / evading\n-the game's difficulty is excellent and higher difficulties will really make this a tough challenge for experienced players, people new to JRPGs should probably start on Easy as to not get frustrated\n-main quest missions are great and actually make you want to play on and on\n-side quest missions are not too much of a grind or fetch quest IMHO\n-locations are great, varied and generally just very interesting, something that can't be said about many recent games these days that suffer from open-world generic-ness and problematic recycling of content\n-despite the somewhat lazy port, PERFORMANCE is excellent at all times, with combat being a joy at full HD resolution (or higher) @ 60 fps. I'd say it's required for a game like this, as you do have to respond rather quickly in combat\n-graphics in general look great, even despite texture resolution not really being entirely current generation quality. It's hardly a problem in a game that looks like an anime anyway\n-amazing cutscenes (that kind of make you wish the entire game looked like that, but lets not forget this is a PS3 port)\n\nCONS:\n-sidequests aren't entirely optional, you kind of need to gather as much souls, gil credits/weapons/garbs/etc as possible in order to stop 'time' and have acceptable stats to progress through the main quest. I'd say one to three side quests per zone (or chapter I suppose) seems to be the minimum. thankfully there's a variation in difficulty of said side quests.\n-speaking of time, the game has a day and night cycle which includes a mandatory trip to a futuristic spin on 'Noah's Ark', which is actually kind of immersion breaking and annoying. They probably should have made that optional. Trainers do exist to mod the game and turn the timer off though, but I didn't really found that necessary. \n-story line is kind of a biblical affair with the player being 'the savior' in a fairly literal way, this might be off putting to some. Without spoiling too much, you've struck a deal with God and need to gather as many souls as possible within the  5 days left before an inevitable apocalypse. \n-the game could use a few more voice overs for the taunts or commentary of the player, there are only a few different lines and she uses them a lot. Same goes for voice over loops of announcers in some areas that keep telling you you're a wanted criminal. \n\nSome nitpicking:\n-there's a downside to how some enemies have rather varied weaknesses, which means your most successful 'build of Schematas (which defines your attacks, blocks, evasions, magic attacks or heals or any kind of bonuses in combat) tends to be more of a generalised build, instead of specialising which results in far more powerful more interesting builds. I wouldn't say the game is ever unfair here, but don't be too surprised if you need to change your Schematas in order to beat specific types of enemies, which otherwise take forever to beat with your weaker attacks that happen to be the kind they aren't immune to. I suppose to many people this is a good thing, because it means the game requires some skill / stragey in building effective Schematas\n-you'll see the same enemy types a lot, but with the combat being rather exciting it's a minor gripe. You'll also figure out how to deal with the strengths and weaknesses of each specific type fairly soon. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of different enemies in total, but 10 hours in I've only seen less than a dozen so far\n-keyboard control is rebindable which is great, but the default lay-out makes zero sense. You'll be using BackSpace, M, . and all kinds of keys across the keyboard to control the game; I've played thusfar on keyboard, but I'm sure using a Gamepad of some kind would work way better\n-no mouse camera control /in-menu control as far as I can tell, but you'd best play this with a controller anyway\n-don't be too surprised to find literal references to the PS3, because it's actually a fairly lazy port all around. \n\nI've got no doubt some people think this game is pushing it's whole 'savior story' a bit too much, which is kind of true, but there's plenty of great content to be found regardless with the new combat system being a big pro.

The reason for this of course was the dreaded \"timer\".\n\nWell, the game has been out a while, it was on sale for 8 Euro, I figured id keep an open mind and try it out! And I gotta say.. I misjudged it. Don't get me wrong, I still don't like the time management aspect as it stresses me out, it makes me rush more than i'd like in an RPG, some of the zones are pretty huge and i'd love to just go exploring for a while - but I can't because i'll game over if I do. Im a completionist and this game doesn't allow it. With that said I gotta say for what it is, the time aspect is well done - it's actually bareable even for someone who hates that sort of thing, the timer pauses in conversations, cutscenes, menu's - and when you chill at your base (ark) in between days, stopping to take a breather or tinkering with your gear/shopping is really not an issue which is great! The timer will only run when you are running around the map exploring and moving about.. It even pauses in combat, and the more combat you do the more \"EP\" you collect, which you can use to cast Chronostasis which freezes the timer for a while. You can also extend your total time by several days when you do certain quests, so in short.. You have plenty of time. I haven't finished the game at the time of writing this but I am quite confident that i'll be able to do most if not all things that I want too during my first playthrough with some management, and with the game being built around multiple playthroughs (like Type-0) anything I do miss i'll be able to check out the next time around, and there seems to be plenty of reasons to play through a second time.\n\nAlright, im ranting on so i'll move away from the timer topic and get into the game itself. The story has been referred to as lighthearted but I think that's incorrect, it's not as deep as what you are used too from the main series of games, but was any spin-off sequal ever? Think X-2, yes it has a few more lighthearted moments and some obvious fan service, but the story do have a serious tone as well as it wraps up the series.\nThe performance of the game is great, it looks pretty and runs smoothly and I haven't run into any bugs or crashes. The only thing that I would complain on from a technical standpoint is the controls, they are really weird and you can't set everything as you want which makes it feel like an obvious console port, for an example your map button and one of your attack buttons shares a key, and similarly with the menu button and a second attack, etc. So if you want your map on M and your menu on say Tab or Esc like in a typical PC game, you would have to do combat with those two keys as well which is a pain in the ass and 20 houres in im still not used to the controls and I probably won't ever be, so i'd definetly recommend trying a controller if you have on since the game is obviously built for that! \nLastly the gameplay itself, combat is suprisingly fun although some of the random monster encounters can be a bit annoying, either they will knock you to the ground all too often, or die too easily, when you to get around to a boss you are rewarded for strategy. You can play the game button mashing, but the game rewards you if you choose to play better, as an example - you can hold the block button to block things, but if you simply press block at the right moment you might knock back and stagger your enemy, and there's also tactical strategies as using vulnerabilities against enemies. \nYou do not get to level up in the traditional way which im not sure if I like or not.. Instead you are rewarded with permanent stats for each quest you complete, another reason to replay the game, as you can increase in power endlessly (?). You also get quite alot of new equipments and you can equip multiple setups to switch between in batte, and you can upgrade your spells - and from what I hear your equipment too once you unlock hard mode, so despite not leveling up you still have plenty of ways to increase in power and you get quite a few ways to customize your Lightning the way you like her.\n\nThat should cover the basics so i'll just TLDR; The time management is annoying but ok, it sounds worse than it is - the game is not as serious as the previous two installments but doesn't screw around with it's story, don't go into it expecting another main series game, with an open mind though you should definetly have alot of fun and get a nice conclusion to the story.\n\nAnd most of all - get ready to repeat these words regularly every time you play..

The battle system is the best in the series, being less about cheap and tedious grinding and more about precise timing, exploiting enemy weaknesses and having the right kind of schemata. The game's most notorious feature, the clock, is perhaps also its best feature, encouraging you to be efficient with your time, and allowing you to feel good about yourself at the end of a productive day. (It's also quite generous; after having finished nearly every available quest on Normal, I still had almost a week left on the clock.) And then there's Lightning, the icing on the cake if there ever was one and a reason in itself to buy the game.

Forced storyline that made an originally complete and charming fairy tale from FFXIII completely nonsensical.\n\nFinal Fantasy Lightning Returns:\nTL:DR: Lightning is back with actual player controlled combat and no more pokemons. Doom clock ticking down to 0? Better go plant some more herbs.\n\nPros:\n- GREAT PC port. Perhaps mechanically one of the best PC port of all time.\n- You get to play as Lightning again! (Experience may vary.)\n- You have direct control of all of your character's moves in real time! It controls well and makes game genuinely fun to play.\n- Combat is actually challenging now and you need learn to block.\n- With the new clock system, you have an actual sense of urgency to the story line. But not enough urgency to skip the sheep herding or flower planting apparently.\n- All the  50 shades of grey monsters are gone. You no longer have 3 different colored behemoth running around for no good reason.\n- 4 very different land scapes with diverse biomes to explores.\n- Monsters go extinct when you kill enough of them, which is awesome.\n- Better music.\n- No more annoying whiny pussy companions.\n\nCons:\n- No more pokemons :(\n- No more companions (meh)\n- Lots of running and you need to min-max the most efficient routes constantly.\n- Scope of the game isn't nearly as big as FFXIII.\n- Story is rushed and you are tieing loose ends left and right with very unsatisfying final quests.\n- Plot line is genuinely uninteresting and poorly paced.

Some people might all it complex, others might say it has strategy, to me is just annoying and bad. The staggering system, that i think was best on FF XIII, is really annoying and takes away some freedom during battles, since the so called strategy is basically doing what you have to do to stagger that monster and then beat him up. Then you have the fact that most fight are useless, since you don't get any xp, potions, etc... you only get monster items and sometimes attacks or spells.\nThe enemies are also very few in variety, and you will find yourselves fighting the same enemy countless times, even on different zones.\nThe schemata is a downgrade of FF X-2 fighting style, in my opinion, and i found it way less fun.\n\nThen you have the story, god the aweful story. I really liked FF XIII story, and didn't dislike XIII-2 story even if basically had little to do with XIII, but this one, was a pain to sit through. In my opinion theys should have stop on XIII-2, and even that one was not necessary, because this game's story felt like somthing they tought on the spot. Serah was a more interesting character than Lightning is on this game. She's like bipolar, she's loosing human's emotions and only cares about saving her sister, but at the same time she cares for the people she's saving. She's a contradition. The only character that i enjoyed was Lumina, at least she was interesting.\n\nThe side quests are nice, and way more interesting than the main story, and that's kind of sad. When the optional content (here isn't much optional since it's where you'll get upgrades to your stats) is better than the main game you did something wrong.\n\nThe countdown is a nice touch and is not much of a pressure, but you will still keep an eye on the clock.\n\nI gotta be honest, i gave up on the last boss, not because is hard (i love Dark Souls, so i don't really mind hard bosses), but because i didn't find any motivation to keep trying.I didn't like the story, i hated the combat system and it was the only FF that i couldn't get 1 minute of joy to play, i was only playing it for the love i have for FF. But to me, this isn't a game i can enjoy playing, but as i said, it might be for other people.\n\n\nSo basically, in my opinion, this is a great port, way better than XIII or XIII-2 technically speaking, but it's a bad game having the story and the gameplay in consideration.", "timestamp_created": 1456624849, "timestamp_updated": 1456624849, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426289111375808716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21502524": {"recommendationid": "21502524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019143281", "num_games_owned": 2249, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1464296125}, "language": "english", "review": "If the FF XIII and XIII-2 port are straight garbage, I'm willing to give credit to Square Enix when credit is due. \n\nWhile not flawless, Lightning Returns port is really great, offers a fair amount of graphical settings, support a ton of resolutions natively and have absolutely no trouble keeping a steady 60 FPS, unlike the two first game of the trilogy.", "timestamp_created": 1456590960, "timestamp_updated": 1456590960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500726222991943359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21468217": {"recommendationid": "21468217", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974283038", "num_games_owned": 846, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3703, "last_played": 1498107349}, "language": "english", "review": "Two thumbs up.", "timestamp_created": 1456461720, "timestamp_updated": 1456461720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526627242565155029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21452918": {"recommendationid": "21452918", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994500066", "num_games_owned": 1041, "num_reviews": 139, "playtime_forever": 4115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3993, "last_played": 1456437209}, "language": "english", "review": "Following FF13-2 and 13-1, Lightning Returns with a new battle system and an open world concept. It features a day/night cycle that dictate npc interactions and serves as a constant reminder of how much time has been spent. The story was mediocre and aimed too high. However the cinematic story rendering was fantastic and the voice acting was well done (English).\n\nSmall gripes I had with this game - Firstly I felt the day/night countdown timer really made players hardpressed to find efficient quest completion routes. If you are a relaxed and slow player like myself, you might not be able to progress far enough into the game to defeat the last boss. My second issue was with the characters and the actual story. I felt the storytelling in Snow's and Noel's storylines were languid. Their motivation in the game weren't realistic and didn't support their original actions against the protagonist. Lumina's behavour was also perplexing, her attitude flip-flopped and you couldn't tell when she was was lying or telling the truth. The story becomes even more unrelatable when you're forced to trust in something she says, given her history of messing with you.\nFinally the overarching story aimed too high and simply fell short of my expectations. The final boss and the the wrap-up all felt a little too forced as Lightning, storywise, was shown to be more impressive in comparison to the final boss, a notion that wasn't conveyed properly through the cinematics.\n\nHowever, despite these gripes, Lightning Returns does conclude the stories of FF13-1&2 in a meaningful satisfactory manner. 8/10.

I enjoyed this game so much that I completed 100% of the achievements just to ekk out every bit of game-play possible.\n\nIn this game you can upgrade your abilities (skills) and completely customize what schema you want to use.  I found that replicating what FF13/13-2 did worked out best for my gaming experience.  You can use three different groups; one as commander (melee), two as ravager (mage), and the third schema as sentinel (tank)/saboteur (debuffs) hybrid.    Following are my final set-ups that beat 99% of the game on normal mode, with the exception of a few switches to battle a couple of the final bosses.\n\n[b]Garb Commander: Soldier of Peace[/b]\nWeapon: Masamune\nShield: Blasphemy\nAccessories: Tiger's Emblem, Dawn Gauntlets\nAdornment: Killer Shades\nAbilities: Shadownbind, Attack, Heavy Slash, Mediguard\nWhy use this Schema? Leveled up Heavy Slash turns Artemis's Pierce into a one turn killing machine.  Alternatively use Mediguard to life-up.\n\n[b]Garb Ravager: Spira's Summoner[/b]\nWeapon: Chaos's Revenge\nShield: Summoner's Shield\nAccessories: Falcon Charm, Sniper's Gloves\nAdornment: White Mage's Hat\nAbilities: Elementa Lv. \u2605, Mediguard, Magnet, *\nWhy use this Schema? Elementa Lv. \u2605 will simply destroy 99% of the game. Alternatively use Mediguard to life-up.  Never found much else to use in the other two slots that was worth ATB Vs. Elementa, besides perhaps magnet and then something like fire or air depending on the enemy.\n\n[b]Garb Sentinel/Saboteur: Guardian Corps[/b]\nWeapon: Blazefire Saber\nShield: Noblesse Veronique\nAccessories: Preta Hood, Runic Ring\nAdornment: Black Mage's Hood\nAbilities: Deshell, Deprotect, Imperil, Mediguard\nWhy use this Schema? Those accessories will make you immune to magic attacks.  This is my default garb, so when the battle starts you can cast Deshell and Imperil onto target then smash them with Elementa.  Cast Deprotect before hitting with Heavy Slash.  Mediguard for life-up.  Alternatively switch to Guard Glove & Ghostly Hood accessories when fighting heavy physical enemies.  Also switch Imperil with Poison for some bosses.\n\nSince the PC version of Lightning returns gives you all DLC for free (turn on DLC in the options and buy them for free in the rewards screen) most of these garbs are already available to you... starting out I did use Cloud's SOLDIER 1st Class in place of the commander's Soldier of Peace garb (along with his weapon/shield.)

It is up to our old pal Lightning to save the day (or is it days?)\nLightning, who slumbered for 500 years is awakened by the god of light Bhunivelze. The world isn't like she hoped it would be, the people are stuck in a world ruled by chaos, they do not age, but they are still able to die from diseases. Bhunivelze gives Lighning the task and power to save their souls so that they can be born again on a new world created by the almighty god of light. Lightning seeing her efforts were in vain sets foot again on a quest to save her sister Serah.\nShe soon meets her old partner Snow, who knows she's sent by god and isn't so willingy to hand over his soul and questions Lightning's beliefs. So, after a little fight Lightning retreats, while so she meets a mysterious young girl named Lumina who only she can see and hear, her role in this story very important and and she frequently shows up to help Lightning, in her own mischief ways and remind her what she's fighting for. Who Lumina really is, is something that you can find out pretty early if you use your wits. Lightning herself will stay dumbstruck till the end of the game and when she finally figures it out you get a relieved satisfactory feeling.\nLightning will meet many of her old friends on her journy to save the souls, some want to fight her, one just doesn't give one f*** and others welcome her with open arms! Lightning helps them get a hold of themselves by helping out with serious troubles, something they couldn't figure out on their own. Which brings me to something I noticed. There are quests that involve a children who lost their things, one lost her stuffed animal, another lost his ball. In both instances the belongings are literally 30 feet away from them and family disputes which could easily be solved by talking to each other, but instead it took a middle woman a.k.a. Lightning to go back and forth delivering messages. Wheter these people got realy lazy because of the chaos or if it was the developers who couldn't come up with better quests will be a question I don't know how to answer. \n\nSo far, there aren't too many main quest, you can finnish these quite fast. The game revolves about a timed based kind of gameplay. The world as we know it will end in a couple of days and it is Lightning's task to save as many souls before they are lost forever. In order to save people's souls Lightning has to help these troubled people across the world, which usually  translate to fetch quests and defeat xx number of enemies or talk to a person. Completing these quests mostly end up in a follow up quests. Once you successfully complete a quest you will be awarded xp and unique items and the person's soul. At 6AM the day is over and you will return to \"The Ark\", here you will drop the souls into a gigantic flower named Yggdrasil, the more souls you put in the more it will grow and by giving many souls, you will be granted extra days. You will also find some useful items here and you can fight previously fought bosses for idk, better score? Oh, and there's Hope who you can talk to and replenish items. Anyways...\n\n As you explore huge fields and cities, finding people who are in need of your help, time keeps on ticking and boy does it tick fast! Like, two seconds in real life equals one minute on the clock. Now this can be countermeasured with a skill named chronostasis, this skill will cost the player 1 EP. EP which is from a special meter that fills up from defeating monsters, the stronger the monster, the faster you build up your EP meter. Chronostasis will only last about a minute, but recharging just one point of the EP meter will take quite some time and most of the time you use it, there won't be strong monsters around, so it makes this skill totally impractical. Personally, I think they did the whole time constraint thing better in FFXIII-2, since you could just travel through time via the Historia Crux, why the Ark doesn't work this way? Beats me. I am not sure what they were thinking. I wish time would only advance when you completed a quest or that the clock didn't tick so quickly. Fortunately I found an easy mod to stop the clock for good.\n \nWhich brings me to the combat. The combat in this game involves Lightning switching between three active roles which all have a matching costume (garb), hp and atb, that last one is very important, because it's the feul in a well oiled machine! The idea is to equip three garbs and balane them in a way that gives you the upper hand in battle. For instance, you come across enemies that are weak to ice, but strong to fire attacks. Each costume has four slots, usually they have one or two occupied slots, so you choose a garb that has the skills you need and fill up the rest of the slots with attack, defensive and debilitating skills, you then switch between switch between garbs during battle to attack relentlessly. Come across different enemies? No problem, you can save your setup to extra slots and equip a whole new garb + skills without overwriting your old setup. Defeating monsters reward you with skills that you can then equip and fight with. You can obtain unique garbs from shops and completing quests. A fun way to make up for just controlling one character throughout mostly of the game. If there is one garb I can recommend, the FFX Yuna garb is extremely powerfull, I used this garb till late end game.\n\nThere are a handful beautiful locations you visit, from a town with little restaurants and terraces, a field with windmills and in the distance a view of something that resembles a city of modern day skyscrapers, a forest so huge that it is easy to lose your bearings, to a desert where the most fun you can have there is sand surfing!\nAll the areas look really amazing and are rendered with a pretty smooth 60 fps, which is a nice job. The only time the fps drops is when passing through obvious load areas, which is a bit of a let down, but since you run right past it, it doesn't really hinder the experience.\nThe sounds in this game are alright,  in the huge city Yusnaan there are street artist who play memorable final fantasy songs on their instruments which is really cool and the background music is really nice, because there are different tracks that play depending on what time it is, so no happy joy joy festval music at 6am in the morning, just a nice mix of synths and piano and at night you will something jazzy. The voice acting is done beautiful, I actually prefer the english dub because I got so used to hear Ali Hillis's soothing voice. The japanese voice actress who sounds also great and fitting to the character is just missing that little bit of uniqueness. Although the voice cast sounds great, the sound editing crew did a poor job of making everything sound in place, so when you are located e.g. in a church, the voice acting will sound like they are in a studio talking through some really expensive equipment. No biggy.\nThe world feels alive, with people doing their thing like, doing the laundry, moving boxes around, run when they see you run, petting animals, walking in between you and the npc, pushing them 30 feet away from you, you know the usual thing. \nGraphics are quite good, but there are definitally moments where you will see some really low res textures and npcs and animals look like they were transferred from a PS2 game, but that didn't bother me very much.  \nUltimately, would I recommend this game? If you like to find out wha happen with Serah or if you just like Lightning and the fanservice, then yes, otherwise no. it's a fun game that you can play for a while and then pick it back up couple days later. this is not like other jrpgs where you have tons of interaction between the characters and just enjoy it so much that you forget about the time.", "timestamp_created": 1455016493, "timestamp_updated": 1455017563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646552145481109619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21064979": {"recommendationid": "21064979", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970296001", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 3933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3708, "last_played": 1454976953}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice conclusion to a saga which didn't start very well.

But after playing through this game, I am so glad that I did.[/b]\n\nLightning Returns really feels like a Final Fantasy game. When I played XIII and XIII-2, they felt like okay games, but for Final Fantasy games, they really fell short in a lot of places. On the other hand, LR had the same feel as the old Final Fantasy games did. I could not stop playing, because I wanted to explore the world and literally do every side quest I could in the game. This is the kind of feeling that FFVI - FFX had for me, and I'm really pleased with how Square-Enix brought this exciting feeling back.\n\nA few things that made this game so much more interesting than the others:[list]\n[*]The opening sequence really drew me in and made me extremely interested in what this game was about. While the other two had slightly interesting beginnings, neither of them pulled it off quite as well as this one did.\n\n[*]Another thing that made this game so strong was the interesting world. It was so open world that you could literally do any of the main quests in whatever order you wanted. I loved exploring the whole world, and how each area had its own unique culture.\n\n[*]All of the NPCs had their own back stories and interesting reasons for doing what they were doing. This is one of the features that really made me want to do all of the side quests, without making them feel like \"extra work\" or generic \"fetch quests,\" even if they were technically asking you to go get an item for them or slay a monster. There were even certain times of day that certain NPCs would be in specific areas. This made them seem so real. Like they were real people with real lives, and couldn't just be sitting in the same spot all day, because they had things to do.\n\n[/list]At first the battle system was my main complaint, but after getting used to it, it turned out to be my favorite battle system in the XIII series. It requires so much strategy and isn't as simple as hitting \"auto-battle\" and sitting there, watching the battle play through. I love how it has elements of the ATB system from previous Final Fantasy titles, but it also brings in much more action elements to really make it feel like you are participating and controlling every move.\n\nAnother thing that turned me off at first was the time limit of the game. At first I was worried that I would be unable to do everything in the amount of time given, but as I played the game, it really wasn't a huge issue. I was able to complete all of the main five quests with at least three days left to finish up side quests. Using the combination of Chronostasis and Teleport really makes things fairly easy to complete in the time limit given. Also, being a project manager, this was really a lot of fun for me to manage my time and use every second efficiently. It got me excited to be able to write down what times certain quests could be completed, and when things had to be done by. This might be hard for people who don't enjoy time management as much as me, but honestly it's a really fun challenge that is added to the game.\n\nOne last thing that I would like to point out is the improvement from XIII-2, in regards to the PC Port. I didn't find too much wrong with this port, and it ran just like it would on a PS3, for the most part. No lag at all (I played on the lowest settings and it still looked beautiful). The only issues I had were that it would crash in the Jagd Woods in the Wildlands sporadically if I did not save every few minutes. Other than that, I never had any problems.\n\nOverall, I can't express how pleasantly surprised I was with this game. I spent about 56 hours on my first play through, but I got 81% of the achievements and did all besides three side quests (that's about the same amount of time it took me to play through both XIII and XIII-2 combined). \n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\nThis game is the best in the XIII series.

Free dlc is free dlc so yes.\nStory = great\nFighting = great\nloads and loads of side quests, and even side quests side quests, Basically. What I am saying is, you have the average side quests \" Canvas of prayers \" where you just do the average stuff like collect stuff from killing monsters, you have the actual side quests where their are a ton of cut scenes and you go out and do something different, like saving moogles from tree things and then finding the lost moogles and literally chucking them in the air to get them home. Then you have the story, which raps up where ff13 2 left off. Overall, if you're a fan of Final Fantasy 13, its a must buy, If you are just a fan of Final Fantasy, then start with 13. If you love turn base combat, this game isn't for you, still has a Turn base LIKE combat, but it really make you think and what not, but not regular turn base. If you're just looking to buy a game, start with 13 2, since 13 is kinda,,,, well 13 is great to me, but some people didn't like how linear it was, but 13 2 / 13 3 is free to do as you please. Overall my rating a good 9/10, if I where not a fan of the final fantasy and just picked it up a 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1453487629, "timestamp_updated": 1453487629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20679795": {"recommendationid": "20679795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159536773", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4359, "last_played": 1579026357}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing this game for over 70 hrs. now and I don't think I can't stop myself from playing this over and over.\nAt first I thought this game was gonna tie me tight on schedule due to the story line of the world is gonna end in the 13 days but after I got a hang on how to manage time and learn how to use EP ability instead of game will end in 20 - 30 hrs. as I expected, it got me playing over 40 hrs. just to get end this game normal mode.\n\nFor battle system I think it was a lot better than FFXIII and FFXIII-2. When I start playing this game I thought I just walk in stagger the enemy and then pound thier HP down like I did in earlier FFXIII series but it differents. Every enemy I face in the game have different way to stagger them and since I only have only 12 ability to work(3 schematas , 4 each) with instead of a lot of number like in the past and don't forget about guarding. Eevery enemy I face have at least one way or another to get a huge chunk of your HP if you don't guard against its attack. For example when I face nibblet in the first time I thought like \"Oh what's a cute little monster\" and then \"thud\" I have to say good bye to good chunk of my HP so that's what make this real time ATB system very interesting. \n\nFor side quest and farming. There are a ton of side quest to do to keep you occupied until the last day come for sure\nbut sometime it throw me off schedule sometime. Farming in this game is fun until the extinction system kick in. I think this is making farming very interesting since you can't just farming all day like old time because monster now can come to extinction so it make me have to come up with other plan when one monster come to extinction.\n\nSo far playing on the Hard mode NG+ now all I can say is This game was a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1453474652, "timestamp_updated": 1453474804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20677187": {"recommendationid": "20677187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065062288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1576845376}, "language": "english", "review": "This Optimize is suck Part I and II is better than this", "timestamp_created": 1453464028, "timestamp_updated": 1453464028, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448984205722808838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20673111": {"recommendationid": "20673111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081162734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1362, "last_played": 1590634429}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it, I have now played the entire trilogy and I'm still working to beat this one. \nThe schemata system is great and I love to play dress up lol. \nYou can also actually  move during battle now too!", "timestamp_created": 1453438676, "timestamp_updated": 1453438676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1980, "total_negative": 487, "total_reviews": 2467}, "cursors": {"AoJwwsXss9ICd6XuTg==": "Thu Nov 23 16:04:06 2023"}}
