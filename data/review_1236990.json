Who does he run from? Well, there are four different enemies in the face of: \n -the Ink Demon, which is the primary enemy before you unlock any other ones; \n -the Projectionist (a.k.a. the swag Ink Demon re-skin);\n -Twisted Alice (a.k.a. th- OH MY GOD SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME);\n -The Butcher Gang (a.k.a. the three bumbling idiots). \nOnly one threat will be present as you begin the round so no double troubles will ever occur. Their presence is indicated by a different colour tone that the studio gets coated with. They are all also exceptionally dumb since they will not hesitate to endlessly chase you through the studio but lose you the second you step in a nearby locker, even if they just bloody saw you enter it.\n Your task is to collect 6 items that will be glowing and scattered around the rooms and halls of a randomly generated studio. That's it.\n But there are a number of collectable items that can all be found inside lockers (or, well, corpses...(or, well... toilets...)) such as music tracks and dance moves for the lobby (which really makes me sad that this game isn't multiplayer,,), scraps to unlock a \"very deep lore implication cutscene\", keys and such to unlock the above-mentioned enemies and some items like lost papers that unlock the two playable characters:\n -The Lost One, who is Boris (but walks slow and is depressed);\n -and Sammy Lawrence who has noodle legs and thus can't run, which he \"makes up\" by entering holes in the walls and teleporting randomly through one.\n (basically both are downgrades so don't waste your time on them lmao)\nSo yeah, a neat time-killer with stylish graphics.

ever played, if you even want to call it a game. Basically, you play as Boris, who was an ancillary character in Bendy and the Ink Machine. I'm assuming the Bendy series isn't made for gamers since the two that I've played barely qualify as games. Essentially, Boris is a cartoon mascot who acts as a doppelganger for Disney's Goofy. You'd think a game starring him might flesh his story out, but it doesn't. Basically you start in a safehouse, enter a procedurally generated dungeon, collect six items while avoiding a bad guy chasing you, and then return to the safehouse. That is the whole game, and, while it's not technically broken, it's not very compelling either. Mostly because there's no map or radar and no way of knowing if the enemy coming to catch you is anywhere near you. The only way to ensure success is to draw a map in your head or make a mental note of where the elevator is so you can quickly run back once you have all the items.\n\nBut that's not even how you \"beat\" the game. At least as I looked it up. When you open lockers it starts a timing button press minigame where, once unlocked, you get an item. So really you don't have to complete a single floor of the dungeon, you can just enter the lockers to get the items. I'm not even sure if it's possible to beat this game, but when I googled the ending it essentially involves just collecting seven scraps from a locker, approaching a wall, receiving two lines of text and then being kicked back into the safehouse. \n\nIt would help if the game play was particularly compelling, but it isn't at all. The main problem with the game play is that you move like a snail unless you run, which consumes bacon soup. You have to go to a bacon soup station to refill your stamina or you will walk very slowly and more likely get caught and die. If you have bacon soup, then you can outrun the enemy. If you don't have bacon soup, he can outrun you. As long as you are running you can pretty much do a Uturn and run right past the enemy that's chasing you since he doesn't lunge at you or do anything other than make a beeline toward your position with less AI than a mosquito looking for blood. \n\nIt's a shame because the game is visually very interesting, but I wouldn't even spend a few dollars on this if I couldn't get it for free. If you really like the Bendy series, then it's your choice as to whether you want to play it because it doesn't add anything to the story or anything like that.

This is hide and seek game with items collecting. Main character is slow. He needs to drink coffee for a short boost. This boost is so short that doesn't help to move at least a bit faster at all. Another issue is the levels. The idea was nice. Some demon tries to catch the player and need to avoid it, but like levels designer doesn't have any idea how to play their own game. Maybe it's some AI that generates levels or something like this. Just imagine long rooms without any place to hide and the demon at the end with an item. Each time when player runs away demon returns to that room with item or it will come when player gets an item. There is no place to hide or avoid it. Sometimes there is no coffee at all in some places and there are 2-3 coffee boxes at other places next to each other. It makes me think that all levels are poorly generated.\nAnother issue: there is no save/load. Each time you launch the game, you start from the Day 1. Other plays say that it's made on purpose. It means you cannot play 30-60 mins and have fun. You need to play a long period to collect special items.\nOne more issue: each time you start the game you get other poorly created levels. Some levels are impossible to beat and need to loose or restart the game because demon protects items and it's not possible to get them. Each time demon goes back to that room and doesn't allow to finish the finish the level.\nI don't recommend this game for anyone who wants to play up to an hour, who likes to save progress or how likes to enjoy the game and don't like to restart to win. \nI hope I can get refund", "timestamp_created": 1689490958, "timestamp_updated": 1689490958, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142176161": {"recommendationid": "142176161", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233655462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1690611431}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u2874\u2811\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u28c0\u28c0\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28c0\u2840\n\u2838\u2847\u2800\u283f\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u2874\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28e6\u2840\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2811\u2884\u28e0\u283e\u2801\u28c0\u28c4\u2848\u2819\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6 ta bueno\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2840\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u281b\u2802\u2808\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u287f\u28bf\u28c6\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u287e\u28c1\u28c0\u2800\u2834\u2802\u2819\u28d7\u2840\u2800\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u282d\u28a4\u28f4\u28e6\u28e4\u28f9\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28b4\u28f6\u28c6\n\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28ee\u28fd\u28fe\u28ff\u28e5\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2882\u2814\u289a\u287f\u28bf\u28ff\u28e6\u28f4\u28fe\u2838\u28fc\u287f\n\u2800\u2880\u285e\u2801\u2819\u283b\u283f\u281f\u2809\u2800\u281b\u28b9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cc\u28a4\u28fc\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u285f\u2809\n\u2800\u28fe\u28f7\u28f6\u2807\u2800\u2800\u28e4\u28c4\u28c0\u2840\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847compralo\n\u2800\u2809\u2808\u2809\u2800\u2800\u28a6\u2848\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28e4\u28fd\u2879\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2832\u28fd\u287b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28dc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28ee\u28ed\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28c8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff", "timestamp_created": 1689481791, "timestamp_updated": 1689481791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142170451": {"recommendationid": "142170451", "author": {"steamid": "76561199131725426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1669954325}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to like this game, but I can't.

would have never played it. A top down perspective item hunt across levels, where you are hunted by a monster from the first game. There really is not much more to the game than that, search the level, grab some bacon soup so you can keep up your sprint, when the monster sees you run for the nearest safe box till it walks away. Items are hidden in different spots on the randomised levels and I had to keep replaying the levels to find everything, it took a while.\n\nAs a horror game Boris just is not good, mainly the perspective removes any level of fear. The monsters are easy enough to avoid, though the variety in the monsters does create some interesting gameplay changes. The visuals are still on point and brings across the Sepia world of Bendy\u2019s. While some levels look great from the top down perspective as the ink slowly consumes the level. \n\nThe Problem the game has is that the randomised item hunting so that you can fully complete the game can take hours, and really becomes a chore of will I find it in this level. This endless slog really turns me off the game, and the fun I had the first few runs was destroyed by the end of the game.\n\nAt the end, if this game was not a Bendy game I would have done two runs and got bored, it just is not the game for me and is a stop gap between playing the next game. You can get the game for cheap during the sales so it may be worth the try, but I would only really recommend the game for someone wanting to play all of the games in the Bendy series. \n\nBelow is a video of my gameplay it is massively cut down, it shows a better representation of the gameplay:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQIwCioKJYo\n \nLooking for some more horror games check out my

that the entire game is just one long fetch quest. It's not necessarily bad, but after a short while it just gets boring. I played for 1\u00bd hours.\nThe whole game is basically:\nTake lift down. Fetch items, search toilets/bodies/cupboards for collectables, avoid the monster by jumping into a wooden cupboard right in front of it's face. Take lift up.\nRepeat.\n\nAnd then, there are the levels themselves.\nThe levels are random gen, but even then there will be some occasional confusion since they reuse sets of rooms. It feels... cheap.\nThere's also the occasional issue of the game sometimes generating one very long empty corridor. If you're lucky you can get back out, but sometimes you'll investigate and get trapped by the monster since there's nowhere to hide. This feels very unfair to die due to poor level design.\nOn the other hand it also feels disgustingly easy if you've got a safe spot to retreat to. 70% of the time you can just walk (not even run... walk) up to your safe spot.\n\nIf you're going to give this game a try anyway, have some free tips below.\n1) The monster will sometimes see you from several rooms away, even if you can't see it.

Whilst it's definitely nothing astounding, the look of the game fits well with what it is.\n* The game explores a bit more of the lore around BATIM. Whilst it doesn't reveal a whole lot, there are a couple of tidbits that add just that little bit extra. This is a nice to have if you are into the lore, though arguably, you could say that this should've been a DLC to BATIM rather than its own standalone game.\n* The sound design and atmosphere were pretty good for a game this simple.\n\nThe bad:\n* The game becomes repetitive veeery quickly. Even though this is a game that should really take you no longer than ~5 hours to get through, even then the game is quite repetitive and not interesting. The developers tried to add variance by adding different playable characters and different enemies but really its all the same.\n* The extra playable characters are just baad. You'd think that unlockable characters would be in some way better or at least somewhat balanced with Boris, but in my humble opinion they are objectively worse and make playing the separate levels just more difficult and tedious.\n* There is no clear sequence to the game and no clear ending. This is more an arcade type of game than anything else. You can earn rewards for playing but at some point theres nothing else you can find, but there is no clear indication of this.\n* The game has no system for ensuring you find collectables during a level. This isn't a problem at the start of the game since there are so many of them and different types, however at the of the game when all you have left thats not collected is scraps, this becomes a huge issue. I played 7 levels before I found a single scrap of paper. This is terrible design for something so easy to implement and made the game an even bigger slog than it already was. This ultimately is what pushed me to rate this game negative.\n\nOverall, Boris and the Dark survival is not a terrible game, but it has a lot of flaws and honestly, if you skip this one you wont miss much. If you are a diehard BATIM fan then consider playing it for those little crumbs of lore, but dont expect too much and definitely dont expect this game to amount to BATIM itself.", "timestamp_created": 1673822274, "timestamp_updated": 1673822274, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130718675": {"recommendationid": "130718675", "author": {"steamid": "76561199141042950", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1673553395}, "language": "english", "review": "\u00b8good game", "timestamp_created": 1673553347, "timestamp_updated": 1673553347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130659899": {"recommendationid": "130659899", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023616185", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1673222281}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego, pasas un buen rato jugandolo", "timestamp_created": 1673471958, "timestamp_updated": 1673471958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130640633": {"recommendationid": "130640633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315283029", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 727, "last_played": 1669236322}, "language": "english", "review": "garsh", "timestamp_created": 1673449245, "timestamp_updated": 1679036258, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130608408": {"recommendationid": "130608408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426048157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 657, "last_played": 1668736081}, "language": "english", "review": "The only good bendy game", "timestamp_created": 1673403627, "timestamp_updated": 1673403627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130532452": {"recommendationid": "130532452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003010934", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 293, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1672982194}, "language": "english", "review": "You wander around random halls completing QTE minigames and get chased by a monster that you cannot possibly avoid due to poor level design.

Their collectables and other goodies but that's about it and after that..... that's the entire game you experienced in likely a few minutes or under 30 minutes I would say. After the first few levels I just keeping going on and on and on until your going to quit out of the game. The level layouts are different but nothing else changes or becomes different but that it, nothing else to be engaged with.\n\nRating: 2/10: In conclusion, boris and the dark survival may have something different going for it, but for how repetitive the game is, their nothing worth or good to say about this game, it's just bad but again, not the worst, I don't want to end on a bad note here, play bendy and the ink machine and therefore, your going to have a much funnier and scarier night to have for your day.

Though it hasn't been updated in a little over 2 years, it does have a lot of variety. From escaping the Ink Demon and immediately finding a new safe house tune in one of the lockers. Also, the developers kept the game from getting old and boring by adding more playable characters, from a Lost One to Sammy Lawrence, and levels with recognizable characters from other Bendy games such as Alice Angel, The Projectionist, and The Butcher Gang. Of course, like any game, it has flaws. Sometimes I'll get stuck on nothing and then get killed by the Ink Demon, or the really funny but weird thing you can do when an enemy is chasing you and you find a Little Miracle Station, you just keep pressing E and you can just infinitely make whatever is chasing you start to try and get you.

I know its just meant to essentially be a time passer/lore miner until we get Bendy 2, but I really wish it was made to be more engaging.  It's very repetitive.  At the very least, some kind of progress bar that unlocks content after x amount of excursions would be nice.  I also run into the issue of getting annoyed by Bendy rather than scared of him.  It would be nice if Boris could do something other than just run and interact with items/puzzles.  Maybe he could set environmental traps that can destroy Bendy and get rid of him for a while?  Anything to make the gameplay more interesting.  It has potential and I think if the devs updated it with some extras it could be a great little nugget of a game.\n\nSuggested updates:\n-No bacon soup meter in the hub area, there's no reason to limit sprinting there.\n-Every 5 successful excursions you unlock an item towards one of the various progression spots in the hub world.  This is on top of any you found on an excursion.  Maybe a character who joins the hub area gives it to you, indicated with an exclamation point on the screen that doesn't go away until you collect it.  They also should stack, so you can just keep doing expeditions without needing to collect your freebie constantly.  Indicate how many have stacked with a number next to the exclamation point.\n-Bear trap and flash bang/smoke screen traps you can craft with materials you find to stop Bendy temporarily, but these can affect you too if you're not careful.  Each time you use one of these, Bendy gets faster during that excursion.\n-Put crafting materials in lockers and Boris bodies and you receive them instead of receiving nothing as it currently is.\n-Bendy leaves the area after a random duration of searching, and comes back after another random duration.  Play a sound effect in a radius around him when he does this.  This gives you a little more breathing room, and you don't know when or where he'll show up, instead of him always being around once he appears.\n-Basic combat with the low level ink monsters from Bendy and the Ink Machine.  Doesn't need to be with a weapon, perhaps Boris uses some kind of anti-ink gadget that either fends them off or eliminates them entirely.", "timestamp_created": 1666661893, "timestamp_updated": 1667185215, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436600089073181152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124335908": {"recommendationid": "124335908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972075985", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1666801665}, "language": "english", "review": "k", "timestamp_created": 1666636593, "timestamp_updated": 1666636593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124290433": {"recommendationid": "124290433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983167021", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1585250190}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring, quite boring but still, an okay game!

It really added and extra level of dread if you ask me. The graphics are sleek and clean. Voice acting was good too. The bad? Well, you control Boris, who seems to be the janitor of the place and he walks very slowly and by that I mean SLOWLY. You can run in the this game but that takes up stamina. Which can be replenished with bacon soup! How the game plays out is more of a top down cat and mouse where you must collect items from the floor below you then once collected that the elevator up and put the items away. And a level is completed. Sound easy no? Well this is where BENDY an ink demon comes in and relentlessly chases you till you collect all the items and escape via elevator. Not a problem right? Well, Bendy is always faster than you so you will always use up some of your stamina to escape. The only way to get away is to hide in whats called \"Little miracle stations\" scattered through out the level. The problem comes when you hide Bendy only goes so far and never disappears. So you are kinda trapped between exploration and Bendy just right around the corner.  I tried waiting it out in hopes Bendy would disappear and perhaps respawn in another part of the level but no he never disappears. So the game play become this frantic suicidal run trying to collect items with Bendy right behind you and I found this to be a serious game design flaw. I simply gave up.

(For example- there's 4 pathways leading away from the elevator, when I was playing 3 of these paths immediately lead to dead ends, so all of the items were scattered throughout a gigantic maze in the 4th path. I kept dying over and over again because I kept getting cornered in badly generated maps.)\n\nThe amount of times I'd have to go back to get all of the collectibles is hilarious, and it took me 2 hours to get to day 7. I also expected much more lore.\n\n As harsh as it is to say this- I've never played a game before that was so un-fun. Sorry, but to me it really isn't worth the money.\n\n(Maybe I just suck at the gameplay, but I do blame at least a portion of my deaths on the map generation.)", "timestamp_created": 1654203596, "timestamp_updated": 1654203596, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542982041835784912", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116362187": {"recommendationid": "116362187", "author": {"steamid": "76561199081953727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1683781473}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than Bendy Run", "timestamp_created": 1654142172, "timestamp_updated": 1654142172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660198092460632324", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116341352": {"recommendationid": "116341352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316532566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 724, "last_played": 1670559366}, "language": "english", "review": "Boris yes", "timestamp_created": 1654103162, "timestamp_updated": 1654103162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116307928": {"recommendationid": "116307928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990979019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1681529079}, "language": "english", "review": "Its really fun \nthat's it\nplease make this go viral", "timestamp_created": 1654035151, "timestamp_updated": 1654035151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116265100": {"recommendationid": "116265100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873561771", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 350, "last_played": 1696030556}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta shido compralo", "timestamp_created": 1653954623, "timestamp_updated": 1653954623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116245694": {"recommendationid": "116245694", "author": {"steamid": "76561199141220435", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1690746697}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game! fans of bendy and the ink machine will love this game!", "timestamp_created": 1653924514, "timestamp_updated": 1653924514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116165645": {"recommendationid": "116165645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198923849606", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1699126269}, "language": "english", "review": "teh light", "timestamp_created": 1653782184, "timestamp_updated": 1653782184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116054728": {"recommendationid": "116054728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126637199", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1653594812}, "language": "english", "review": "A quaint little game set in the BATIM universe.

enemys, alice angel and bendy are the most simple as you can see the ink and halo light around them yet alice is more creepy than bendy as she keeps on singing in a creepy way.\nprojectionist is real fun actually too, hes a bit harder as he only has the light infront of him and would be hard to hear unless you have headphones, best is to focus on your ears than your eyes on where he is.\nand then the butcher gang, oh lord, those are some tricky guys, they luckly are slower and can be shaken off without hiding yet their big difficulty is their 3 and they split up so its best to focus on your eyes and mostly ears, they are a bit blind so its easy to get around them but harder when they chase you and the others block the path.\n\nthen the playable characters, first boris, face of the game, i use him alot tho he aint the best at abilitys as he has none, yet he is the best character for searching as he is the fastest runner.\nthen the lost one, i suggest only picking him if you want a real challange as his running and walking speed is slightly slower so best you only pick him if you want the game to be harder.\nand lastly sammy, hes the best at abilitys, he can teleport through the cracks in the walls instead of running, and his walking speed also is the fastest, he is almost equally fast as bendy, only a tiny bit slower than bendy so you can easily go on a walk with bendy until you find a station, same with alice, the projectionist and the butcher gang, the butcher gang is too slow for his steps too.\n\nthe game is a pure 10/10, a masterpiece worth playing, you even can get

With the characters having no voice acting, their design are really unique and were able to keep the game fresh. The overall premise of finding supplies works well, at least providing the player with some motive as to what they are doing \nThe setting of the Joey Drew Studios is great with the layout of the different floors giving players variety, however it does repeat assets and rooms so it can get a bit stale over time. But for what its worth, it didn't really bother me that much\nThe art design in Boris give a really nice twist of the 1930s cartoons by adding a yellow undertone to its overall setting making it feel more disgusting and old which works really well for what the game is trying to portray. In saying this, I believe that the atmosphere of the game is captured perfectly with it having some resemblance to Bendy while being its own game\nSound and Audio work really well with songs from the record player capturing the 30s style of music really well and the audio for opening things such as lockers, the sounds of the different enemies that are within the floors and other assets within the game do a great job of adding immersion into the world\nIn terms of gameplay, this game can get repetitive. While at the start its really fun to play and trying to avoid enemies, it get boring after a while of playing it. The camera angle of this being top down survival horror works in the games favour as it help separate Bendy from this game. There a range of different enemies which sounds good when in fact they all play pretty much the same as each other basically meaning that they are reskins of each other. Like two of the enemies that you encounter have some difference with one being really fast and the other being in a group of 3, however they play pretty much the same as the other two characters as the other two might as well be identical. The mechanics of the stamina bar and the stations for both \"Bacon Soup\" and a cubical to hid in are a really nice addition as they are spread out in each floor making the player have to venture around to find these to aid them in their traversal through the floor. While enemies at the start of the game could be seen as intense interactions, over the playtime i had found them to be less and less of a threat and more of an obstacle as the best way to get away from these enemies is by leading them into a big room and just doing a circle around them. The different collectables that Boris is able to collect give the player reason to keep playing and discover what they can unlock. The different characters that you can play as are done well enough being a bit different from one another.\nOverall, Boris and the Dark Survival is a really well done game for how small it really is in comparison to Bendy and the Ink Machine.

Except for Norman Polk (The Projectionist).  He has a revamped version of \"Reel Fear.\"\nNew Playable Characters:  Lost One, Sammy Lawrence\n\nCONS:\nThe jumpscares are super poorly made, as they just reused animations.\nSpeaking of which, Bendy's run animation is actually a very outdated animation, as it was used for the Beta Chapter 3 release for BATIM.\nThe enemies aren't unique.  Sure, Norman has his light, but that's really the only unique character.

The reason it's delayed was beacuse the team, Joey Drew Studios/ Kindly Beast got bankrupt. It's such a shame, beacuse this Bendy series had a potential, but a wasted one now. If you've noticed, they keep made the price higher and higher by time, do you really think a change of a model or a player model would cost you 3 times the actual price? Anyways, this game's reason to exist is shamful, and it has no true plot points even if the theorists come up with ideas, as the team sticks to their work anyways.\n\nHow is the game?\nOverall it's not some terrible level stuff, but when you first open the game, it fastly switches to the menu with a small image of the Joey Drew Studios reels, pretty low quality on that. And the UI for the menu is just bad to look at, it's simple, but too simple in a bad way. The options are limited and it's overall almost like it was made in 1 week (Surprise surprise, it WAS made in 1 week.). For the main gameplay, the 3rd person view is kinda off, especially when you have walls and pipes blocking your every way to see the objects. Other than that, it's a simple concept and kinda fun to play with. But when it just keeps repeating like the cashgrab of a game it is, it gets boring. That's why I'd call it a game related to Bendy if it has the updates still on. There really is no effort for writing the plot or anything, it's just a bunch of mish mash mixed together in a hide and seek sort of board game.", "timestamp_created": 1617183648, "timestamp_updated": 1617183648, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89306016": {"recommendationid": "89306016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310512420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 327, "last_played": 1680708570}, "language": "english", "review": "BORIS AND THE DARK SURVIVAL\n\nWell its not the best game, i think its ok.

The atmosphere, the aesthetics, the tension, the lore are all very well placed in this perspective of Boris who acts as an employee behind the \"glamor\" of the artists.\n\nAs a game for those who haven't played Bendy:\nOf course, it won't have the same charm for those who played Bendy, but I believe it works very well as a solo game. In any context, the climate and aesthetics are powerful enough to make anyone interested. The mechanics are very simple, you go out of the looby to a randomly generated room, search for few items in the scenario fleeing from a monster that wants to kill you. The great fun of gameplay is more about getting all collectibles through repeated gameplays that get you hooked right from the start.\n\nIt's not the best game in the world, but at no time does it disappoint, I loved playing it and only stopped when I got all the collectibles.

The experience is so much better.\n\nOne warning though: the game gets very repetitive, very fast. It can become boring after a while, just to let you know. The game also really needs achievements, which would make playing the game more rewarding meta-wise and give the players a sense of completion.\n\nThe gameplay, graphics, and the overall game itself is so smooth, creepy and pretty dang fun.

Every ending, character, mini-game, ect. is locked behind a number of \"keys\" which can be randomly found. And they just stopped touching this game and probably aren't coming back to add new content, or at the very least change how the unlocks work. I do however really like this game, especially the learning phase.\n\nOkay this game IS fun for the most part but 90% of this game is finding \"keys\" in lockers, toilets, and corpses just to progress the \"story.\" Once you learn how to play, well it becomes increasingly more boring the longer you go. This is because EVERY time you start it is the same gameplay loop: \n\n1. Listen to a noise at the start of the round to tell which enemy you're up against\n2. Do not pick up the glowing item closest to the elevator until last\n2. pick a direction to go\n3. collect items\n4. pick another direction\n5. collect more items\n6. now that you have 5/6 items, go back and pick up the first item near the elevator\n7. profit (but not really)\n\nYou do that literally every time and the only difference is the enemy (sometimes) and layout of the floor.\n\nThey have added three free ad-ons to the game, and I mean, they're okay i guess? \n\nThe first one added three new enemies, three unique floors, an ending, and some other collectibles. Not that bad right? Well the issue is that all of the new enemies only have a chance of happening. One you have to get lucky and get sent to his level (no way to force it) and when you do finally get there they didn't even have a jump scare. The other two are locked behind doors. Of course the only way to unlock those doors is by RANDOMLY finding the corresponding key(s).\n\nThe second update added another enemy to go against, a playable character (who sucks), and a jump scare to an enemy that DIDN'T have one in update #1. First off the enemy is just generic, instead of one big enemy it's three small ones that are just really annoying but super easy to run away from. The character just walks really slow and it's just painful using him. OH YEAH, both of these things are locked behind randomly found keys.\n\nThe third update added a gallery (I really like this it shows fan art), restrooms (restrooms?), a new playable character, two music tracks, and new dance moves. EVERYTHING in this update (minus the gallery) is locked behind KEYS. The character is very unique and he is more of a memorization and skill character so it at least changes something about the gameplay. Again, they also added restrooms and you can search the toilets because why not.\n\nEverything I didn't mention is a generic audio log randomly placed around the map + two secret ones in the hub. \n\nUpdate #3 came out two years ago, and this game hasn't been touched since. \n\nAll of my problems in this game wouldn't be here if keys weren't 100% random. You can go HOURS without finding ANYTHING. To fix this, maybe every five levels there is at least one guaranteed key hidden in a locker. The key you get will still be random but you are still guaranteed A key. This will solve all of the boredom because now players can slowly watch their doors being unlocked at a steady rate, rather than just grinding away for hours and literally achieve no progress because luck wasn't on their side that day. \n\nHowever, I do really love this game. The atmosphere, art style, sound, and music. It's just amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed this game in the beginning. Figuring out how to best avoid my foes, and exploring special areas of the studio. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1609654592, "timestamp_updated": 1656658106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

But I find that it actually makes the game quite worse, You can no longer make well thought out strategy because the levels are random so it brights back the same feeling of back in BATIM's old Days were all the needed items to complete a puzzle would spawn randomly each time you play But BATDS is even worse than that case because each time you'll be searching A entirely new map you don't know the layout of.\nok so I have been over the gameplay and Now the Controls. The PC control layout is fine besides the fact that when you use the keyboard controls in gameplay there really janky to the point that I end up dying most the time due to running or getting stuck in A wall. But playing this on PC with Controller support works really well so that's upsetting to see since this game is A PC and Mobile exclusive so if you don't have A Controller the works with this game then I can only see someone have fun with this game if they get really lucky or is just A really Big fan of Bendy to the point that they don't even care about good gameplay.\nBUT I original wrote my first Review back when this game came out in 2020, since then they updated the game a couple times but none of the updates made the game more functional to play but I think made the game far worse, Each new puzzle requires you to search for items first So zero new gameplay and most the rewards are either unlocking A level with harder eniemes (Basically not A reward) or Unlocking A new character which makes the game harder to play for the most part, the only newly added gameplay I got up to was The Ink ball game which is fun for quite abit but it isnt worth Hours of fetching for to unlock it.\nOverall the game isnt to bad in terms of price, it was only 1 dollar on launch but the fact that they raised the price to nearly 5 dollars for new players just because they added the same gameplay again and again is just disapointing. Although its still lower price than A regular DLC and you can still refund it if you didnt enjoy it but I bet nearly all players who wanted to refund it couldnt because they most likely would of still wanted to unlock everything and finish every puzzle before there final choice. But by the time youve bet your first Puzzle to complete you probably would have already played over 2 Hours and had the game for almost 14 Days.\nSo overall I rate this game A 4\\10.\nI sure hope Dark Revival wont give me the same enjoyment out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1594889020, "timestamp_updated": 1646819279, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72695284": {"recommendationid": "72695284", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026989700", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6873, "last_played": 1667860109}, "language": "english", "review": "Very gud gaem 10/10 - IGN", "timestamp_created": 1594758602, "timestamp_updated": 1594758602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72628765": {"recommendationid": "72628765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342485353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1603649674}, "language": "english", "review": "game lol xd", "timestamp_created": 1594657979, "timestamp_updated": 1594657979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454664289951324463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72531947": {"recommendationid": "72531947", "author": {"steamid": "76561199003111748", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1668492235}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game!", "timestamp_created": 1594514767, "timestamp_updated": 1594514767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72511875": {"recommendationid": "72511875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198924222684", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1593474291}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring", "timestamp_created": 1594487867, "timestamp_updated": 1594487867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445482879877090454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72478663": {"recommendationid": "72478663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299366200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 502, "last_played": 1636498162}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend playing this awesome game, It's so much fun!

be strategic about what areas you can be caught in since there are never enough miracle stations to hide in and what places qualify as \"cover\" to the boss's ai. Sometimes if you angle yourself right in corners and behind barrels they won't see you. \n\nThe tools you fetch themselves are useless, just qualifiers to make it back to base, so what you're REALLY looking for are the scraps, candles, keys, music disks, etc. you find in lockers, toilets, and Boris corpses by rushing to solve simple puzzles that add some suspense. \n\nThe rooms and corridors you walk through have gotten much more interesting and fitting for an animation studio, with spaces full of drawing tables, recording booths, and music rooms rather than the same four empty spaces it used to give you. The tapes open up more lore. I love that I can have Boris breakdance with the new dance sheets you can find. It's definitely become more than worth it for the price I paid when it first came out. \n\nThere's just one little issue I have. My game seems to have a bit of a glitch that's certainly upped the difficulty. \n\nAlice is... uh, invisible. \n\nLike, her model is almost completely non-existent, I just get little flickers of what I assume are the polygons or whatever that are supposed to make her up. The animation when she catches you doesn't play for me. I just have to rely in the little halo of light to avoid her and that makes those tight corner manuevers nearly impossible. It's sort of funny, and adds a bit of a twist, but I think I'd like to see her instead xD. \n\nIt's a game that does get a little tedious, but I enjoy it and can't wait to see if there are more additions in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1594328072, "timestamp_updated": 1594328072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72355948": {"recommendationid": "72355948", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067662433", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1593770855}, "language": "english", "review": "Good time killer,  BatDS is a topdown survival game (duh.)

The best you'll get is a small cutscene you've worked for an hour to achieve that means nothing. You can unlock other characters to chase you around, but with the exception of the Butcher Gang Members, they don't change anything.\n\nOne of the main problems is that while the game wants you to replay it, is gives you too much incentive in the wrong way. They lock extra content behind random drops from minigames and expect you to find them yourself. And if you don't want to? No extra characters, no secret cutscenes, and no fleshed-out minigame. And pray to god you don't get a Butcher Gang Member encounter. Then you're screwed.\n\nIt doesn't even deliver on being a good horror game. The jumpscares are outright bad, you can kite Bendy and his associates around with ease, and so long as the procedurally generated levels don't screw you over, there's no reason for you to die. Unless you're in a Butcher Gang Encounter.\n\nI suggest buying the game, playing an hour of it, then refunding it, because it's just boring and tedious after that.

You've got your base, where you can basically unlock some features, listen to old tapes and go down to basement for necessary items. \n\nAnd here comes the first problem with that game - basement. It's randomly generated every time you enter there, but the game itself contains 100 levels anyway and program automatically chooses you one random level. So it ain't really \"generating random basement's layout\" as developers say.\n\nThe gameplay itself may at first seem really interesting and exciting, but it fast gets repetetive and you know what you can expect. Every time your only aim is to collect 6 \"necessary\" items, which you don't do anything with later. These items aren't even your key to victory, you win the game when you collect all 6 scraps that you have a chance to find in each day in basement - inside the lockers. By the way, you don't even have 100 % chance of finding scraps.\n\nI wanna write something about the AI, which is terrible. In game, you'll face one of three monsters. The Ink Demon, The Camera with legs made from Ink and The Ink Gang. The Ink Demon a.k.a Bendy has his terror radious and every time he is close, you'll hear Boris' heart beating harder and harder, The Camera makes sounds as if it was recording something, The Gang is unlockable after you've collected 6 keys and destroyed the crate in your safehouse, they make scraching sounds.\nWhat's the problem then? It doesn't matter if you hide well, if you're in their radious and they looking directly at you, they'll start chasing you and you only can escape from The Gang without hiding in a closet. All the monsters don't give a fuck when you're hidden, they're like \"where the fuck did he go\", even when you hide just in front of their face. It isn't hard to escape a chase as well, you only have to sprint to a locker and you're safe. Even when you're at dead end you can easily jink their hitbox and outrun 'em. They have that fear aspect, but after some time they get more annoying than scary.\n\nAnother dumb thing that makes everything more easy - sprint. While walking, they eventually will hunt you down but entering sprint mode it's a guaranteed escape. In every single basement you'll find at least 3 vending machines that refill your sprint meter in 3 seconds.\n\nOverall, it's like devs were like \"Let's put graphics from the original game, put some already known mechanics and sell it on Steam\". I hope new updates will come and they'll make this game more interesting.\n\nIf you expect high experience from this game, don't buy it in current state, unless you wanna spend your one dollar somehow or you're just a fan of the original Bendy and The Ink Machine.", "timestamp_created": 1585860177, "timestamp_updated": 1585947552, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1,

excitement/fright. I love exploring the animation studio in [i[Bendy and the Ink Machine[/i] and taking in all of the lore, but it can get time-consuming. Don't take that the wrong way; each game has its own charm. Something interesting though, is that, at least in my experience, this benefits from the use of a gamepad while Bendy and the Ink Machine benefits from a mouse and keyboard.\n\nMy only criticisms are that there aren't definitive levels and it starts you back at the same map every time. You retain items you've found along the way and some other types of progress markers, but every time you start up the game, it starts you from the beginning. If you die and you want to try that map again, it won't let you do that; instead, it will bring you to a different map. These two problems make it take way too long to finish. I'm not sure if I'll ever finish.

Though this game offers tons of content and sprinkles on a bit of lore, the halls of the studio start becoming boring. Luckily, the fun outweighs the boring. The game has so much updates being The Wolf Trials, Unleashed, and Symphony of Shadows and each one has usually three things to do. One thing just being regular and occasionally two things will be regular, but there is always be something thrown in for lore. There's the pinball tape and the symphony tape which are secrets and then there are things like Alice's part in The Wolf Trials. This spin-off game doesn't just add lore to BATIM, but also Bendy and the Dark Revival. The symphony tape does tease the new game, but I won't put any spoilers into this review. Overall I give this game a 9/10 or 4.5 stars out of 5. My only issue with this game is that the game gets boring once you do everything, but that doesn't mean the game isn't good.\n\nGameplay:\nYou play as Boris regularly but can also play as a Lost One or Sammy Laurence.

My girlfriend actually bought this for me and I had avoided looking at any sort of \"spoilers\" beforehand, as I didn't know what kind of \"secrets\" or \"spoilers\" this game could have.\n\nAfter playing like...a few minutes of the game, I think the objective and the vision of what the entire game comes full circle and completely clear. \n\nI think one of the things that was most disappointing to me was the camera angle, yes it's kinda a picky point but, it personally really bothers me how the entire game is stuck in one angle and in this angle, it's sometimes really hard to find a door's opening thus making it a challenge at times. \n\nAnother down side of this game was the controls. Now, granted, they work for the MOST part but sometimes...Sometimes they just don't work, at all. There'll be times Boris goes in a completely different direction than what I hit or seems stuck in moving, and that's kind of frustrating. \n\nAs for the good; I think this game is decently fun when you're listening/doing something else whilst playing. I find myself usually talking to friends on the phone, listening to Youtube videos and ect. rather than just playing the game completely \"immersed\". The visuals are just as pretty as the original BATIM game (however it's hard to marvel when the angle is so ass) and I'm pretty happy that a once-was side character now has his own game. \n\nIf you're coming from the original game expecting something like it, you'd be making a bad choice getting this game. Whereas Bendy and the Ink Machine focuses on plot, horror, and ect., but Boris and the Dark Survival seems to be a game made for people who aren't into all that and just want a simple collecting game. \n\nI personally would've been much more unhappy had the price been a bit higher, but as it was LITERALLY just one dollar, I don't think it's that much of a fuss. \n\nOverall: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1583434352, "timestamp_updated": 1583434352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64528196": {"recommendationid": "64528196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834969783", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1693244795}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is extremely entertaining, I am so close to completing my picture. 2 pieces left.

Considering BATDS doesn't resort to cheap mechanics like making the character very weak or have to rely on cheap gimmics that started from the Amnessia games.  Sure Boris isn't a fighter but, considering how far he can run for every 1 can of Bacon soup. Boris feels balanced with what I assume to be the rubber banding A.I. the Ink demon uses.  So, the game-play is fair but, challenging as the game goes on.\n \n From the first, hour of game-play. I noticed a few things. You die-ing is your fault for not understanding Bendy really isn't fast. Don't let the screen effects trick you. Using the wooden poles in rooms you can easily egg Bendy to go somewhere and hurry to a safety box. An when, you do collect everything if you hide Bendy can't just rip you out of the safety boxs.\n\n So planning your escape can be tricky. But, planning your routes is part of the fun of BATDS . BATDS isn't just a survical horror game. Memorization and planning is part of the fine. Patients is the key to the game. If you constantly run you will get lots of game overs.

Since BATIM doesn't have much replay value if you already know about the secret messages, I hoped that this game would be able to keep me satisfied until Bioshock: Bendy Edition (Bendy and the Dark Revival) was released. So, does Boris and the Dark Survival have the potential to satisfy me? \n\nThe answer: meh, not really. \n\nIt's a fine game to pass the time with every once in a while. You can play the whole thing with one hand while listening to some kind of podcast or something in the background. But, the problem is that this game is incredibly easy, at least in my experience. I have yet to experience horrendous RNG when it comes to level generation, so there may be a chance for the game to seem even remotely difficult. But, I truly don't get how other people can say that this game is suspenseful in any way. Let me explain.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. You go around collecting items while Bendy walks around looking for you. You have a stamina bar that shows how long you can run for and you can replenish that bar at Bacon Soup dispensers. The only way to escape Bendy is to hide inside lockers. Finally, once you collect all the pieces, Bendy will make a beeline for you and you have to escape to the elevator before he catches you.\n\nSo, how is this game easy? Well, for starters, there is no time limit. You can just walk around at your leisure while looking for the pieces, so it's not like you feel rushed at all. Secondly, Bendy himself isn't all that intimidating. He occasionally startles me, but that's only when I start to zone out while walking around so he can catch me off guard. But, Boris can run much faster than Bendy can, so you're always able to make it to a locker somewhere if you have the stamina.\n\n\"But what if I'm low on stamina?\"\n\nWhy would you be? I always walk when Bendy isn't nearby, since there is no time limit, so I don't waste stamina that way. The moment he finds me, I run to the nearest locker, wait for him to get 10 feet away from the locker, hop out, and go replenish my stamina meter immediately afterward. The Bacon Soup dispensers, 9 times out of 10, will be near the lockers. And, if there isn't one near the locker you're at, it's fine since you know which direction Bendy walks off to if you leave soon enough. \n\n\"Ok, but what do I do when he makes a beeline for me after I collect everything?\"\n\nThis is actually the easiest part of this already easy game. Whenever I get to this point, I just stand near the nearest object that I can walk around like a table, pillar, wall, etc, and wait for him. Once he comes, I wait until he starts walking around one side of the object and I just run the other way. He can't teleport through the object, so you can just juke him every time and run your victory lap to the elevator. \n\nRinse and repeat each time you go down.\n\nI'm still going to recommend this game, since I think Bendy fans will get a kick out of the little lore bits the audio logs provide and you'll still be supporting the devs by buying this. But, if you are only buying this game because you think it will be a somewhat challenging and fun time waster, then look elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1582350269, "timestamp_updated": 1582350269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619021236896514893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63905621": {"recommendationid": "63905621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271706196", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1667952639}, "language": "english", "review": "it good", "timestamp_created": 1582338361, "timestamp_updated": 1582338361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63904292": {"recommendationid": "63904292", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012769991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1594502973}, "language": "english", "review": "The creators of Bendy and the Ink Machine made their first spin-off with Boris and the Dark Survival which brings first person horror to a whole different genre of game.

Adding to the low difficulty is how items can spawn in the spawn room, up to 2-3 sometimes, making it so you can leave them for last and Bendy has a 0% chance to catch you unless E and the space key on your keyboard is broken. Plus once I literally had Bendy walk into my room I was in and he never saw me, I was just easily in plain sight, not trying to hide, and he didn't see me. The Bendy AI is stupid and dumb, especially since he can sometimes look through walls. Only time I ever died to Bendy was when I was cornered in a dead end of a hallway and I failed to dodge him and then got the least scary jumpscare I have ever gotten, and I played FNaF 3 on mobile (no offense Scott lmao).\nI recommend getting this game if you want to see some lore and be a little scared the first time Bendy spots you, and even then Chapter 1 of the official first game is still better at doing that than this and it's free. Just only get it if you are a die hard Bendy fan and want more content I guess.\nHonestly wish I could put a *maybe* for if I recommend this game or not but Steam won't let me.", "timestamp_created": 1581789241, "timestamp_updated": 1581789241, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479108631610870361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63559452": {"recommendationid": "63559452", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015610247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 732, "last_played": 1588798013}, "language": "english", "review": "really fun but dont expect too much it is only 1 dollar", "timestamp_created": 1581787482, "timestamp_updated": 1581787482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63556978": {"recommendationid": "63556978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242421740", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1667798047}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun to play.

I would've rather the dev team make a full project, much like Bendy and the Ink Machine, from Boris' perspective. With that being said, there is some charm to the game, and for a dollar, you can't really go wrong with trying it out. Now, if they plan on updating it or adding something in the future, then maybe my opinion may change a bit. But, for now, my word stands. Best of luck to the Joey Drew Studios Team for the future!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Q9xvHYLGA", "timestamp_created": 1581640838, "timestamp_updated": 1581640838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63458536": {"recommendationid": "63458536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198898277758", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1630556168}, "language": "english", "review": "Its like Pacman but even more fun\\", "timestamp_created": 1581638090, "timestamp_updated": 1581638090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569873213768005371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63458339": {"recommendationid": "63458339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447009947", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1678736765}, "language": "english", "review": "it  is very enjoyable game. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1581637624, "timestamp_updated": 1581637624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543283581733703613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63458160": {"recommendationid": "63458160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198962369799", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1698630539}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game i could play it all day", "timestamp_created": 1581637197, "timestamp_updated": 1581637197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543283581733703613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63456868": {"recommendationid": "63456868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262382537", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1583982337}, "language": "english", "review": "(ENDING.)

At first, I was unsure if this was going to be good or not, because it looked a bit like Showdown Bandit, with the point of view of an observer, and I personally didn't like Showdown Bandit. But Boris and the Dark Survival is actually really enjoyable. It's fun, simple, and it seems like it's filled with secrets. The only downgrade is that it doesn't really seem to be following a story, or at least none that I could find. Still, it's pretty entertaining. Great esthetic (as expected from Kindly Beast), not a very original concept but still a fun one, I recommand it to anyone who just wants to play a simple game to pass the time.\n\nGameplay 6/10 :\nNothing special, pretty simple but still fun to play.\n\nGraphism 8/10 :\nAgain, the esthetic is fantastic. Bendy always had a great esthetic, which made, in my opinion, a lot of the success of BatIM, so it's great to see they kept the same level of quality, even for a game with much less ambition.\n\nStory 5/10 :\nThere isn't really any, and the little there is makes us ask many questions. But clearly, the story was not the main objective of the game, so giving it a bad note would be really unfair. I'll give it a 5.\n\nSoundtrack 7/10 :\nNothing particular, but still more than decent. It really has that Bendy vibe to it, if you like Bendy's soundtrack, you'll like Boris' soundtrack.\n\nTotal : 13/20\n\nMy personal note : 15/20", "timestamp_created": 1581378104, "timestamp_updated": 1581378313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63303250": {"recommendationid": "63303250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410288154", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 13488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1670188828}, "language": "english", "review": "Boris dancing", "timestamp_created": 1581377973, "timestamp_updated": 1664652213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63302898": {"recommendationid": "63302898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797074992", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1583530822}, "language": "english", "review": "AaAAhhHhHhHHhHHhhHhhhhHH", "timestamp_created": 1581377176, "timestamp_updated": 1581377176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63302599": {"recommendationid": "63302599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384449316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1593827126}, "language": "english", "review": "This is currently one of the best games I've played from TheMealy Games/Joey Drew Studios.\nFeels like a much bigger improvement from what Showdown Bandit could've been to begin with.\nCongrats on making another great game.", "timestamp_created": 1581376457, "timestamp_updated": 1581376457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63302321": {"recommendationid": "63302321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278465543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 81, "last_played": 1604437281}, "language": "english", "review": "A great way to celebrate for Bendy's anvaninvary\nIt's good", "timestamp_created": 1581375856, "timestamp_updated": 1581375856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63301701": {"recommendationid": "63301701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198843775952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1584772631}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great for the Bendy thrill seekers out there Highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1581374556, "timestamp_updated": 1581374556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63300851": {"recommendationid": "63300851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198858101936", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1689994516}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh.

He would stop for no reason or the keyboard inputs won't respond, but like I said it is rare for me. Overall, I might try using controllers for the time being and I really enjoy this game and the randomly generated floors make it interesting.\n\nEdit (2/16): So I tried a controller recently and it seems to work a lot better than keyboard controls. So if you also have problems with the keyboard controls, I recommend it. Also when they said \"Randomly Generated\", they were not kidding. I have been playing so many levels for the past days of playing this game and I cannot find the other scrap pieces needed. I assume that either something broke in the random generation and I need to somehow reset my data, the chance of finding the last scrap pieces are rare, or maybe I needed to do this in one sitting.
