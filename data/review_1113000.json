Remember that the persona series was mostly playstation exclusive so a lot of persona fans who don't own playstations would usually watch youtube gameplays of it. Atlus broke that rule when this released. It was the first persona series that was on steam and OH BOY! WHAT A RELEASE THIS WAS! This sold extremely well and it became the starter entry to the persona series as well as the next standard for all persona games. \n\nIn terms of the game, its Persona 4 Golden! What else do you expect! Its a PC ports with improvements according to sources that I will surely find later :trollface: and a good PC port at that. Plus this games goes really cheap during sales so get it while the sales are happening.\n\nBut this is not a review on why the game is good, I want to thank the game for making me love the persona franchise.

can't get my attention at the beginning i just don't have any desire to play more. the farthest i went was beating the first dungeon and it might just be me coming from p5 to p4, but i felt this game was very boring, though i only played a couple hours of p5 before deciding that i should play 4 then 5, i enjoyed what i had played of 5. the procedurally generated dungeons make them very boring. initiating combat is very confusing as if i attack from any angle, but the back i start standard combat, if they attack me from any angle i start at a disadvantage, if i attack them from the back i have a 50/50 chance to start at advantage, i don't know whether or not them being alerted affects this but since there is no sneaking or walking animation when pushing the analog stick slightly i feel like sneaking isn't a thing in this and they always seem to get alerted by the time i attack them anyway, and if they just run into me from the back they starts with advantage, while if we just run into each other it's a 50/50 chance that i starts with disadvantage and if i run into them from the back i start standard combat. I feel like games like earthbound and the mario rpgs make the best ways to initiating combat in a turn based rpg i.e. earthbound with running into their back or them running into yours determined who's at advantage or mario rps where it's who attacks who first on the field, but persona 4 feels like it took from both without properly implementing either. i don't like how the sos just starts and isn't a yes or no prompt as i would accidentally press starts as i'm more used to start being a menu button in other games and while i could get used to it i chose to just change it to a button that isn't used to avoid accidentally pressing it. while i understand that the protagonist is supposed to be the player's character i feel that for a rpg with teams that the team is the player's characters as i will never understand that when the protag dies that's a game over state, i hate this even in games i like such as kingdom hearts, why would the party just lose when the protag dies they just choose to not revive or bring him out? they all just lose instantly without him? it makes no sense, at least 3 had an explanation, but 4 has none. finally i feel like the characters are idiotic as none of them ran to cover a character's mouth to prevent that person from saying the line \"you're not me\" and thus prevent a boss fight. at least after the second time they should be doing this, no need to fight enemies that could be avoided.", "timestamp_created": 1700251684, "timestamp_updated": 1700251684, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

I came to this series after hearing a lot of fans of Danganronpa like this game, and I was not disappointed. The graphics are a little older, and the gameplay can require a bit of grinding, but rest assured it is worth it. \n\nThe rest of this review is targeted toward people who played Persona 5 and came back to this after.\n\nIf you are coming back to this game after playing Persona 5, I would definitely say go for it. I went the opposite direction (so P4G to P5R), but I don't think it's a problem to go backwards. There is a lot of things that haven't aged the best, but if you can look past it this is a very amazing game that has actually queer characters and not just baiting so if that's up your alley definitely check it out. \n\nThere is a lot character development in the skill links, but some can be a bit problematic *cough nurse cough*. Also some good social links are hid behind other links that are less... pleasant. However despite some elements aging poorly, they also were a bit more free to make queer characters outright queer which I appreciate. There are also some implied ones and tbh this is just a good game for if you enjoy shipping. Also fun fact that everyone likes to point out is that Yosuke (the male sidekick character you meet him in the first chapter so not a real spoiler) was originally going to be a romance option before the production cut it. People are still salty to this day. I am one of these people.\n\nI also like the story of this game compared to Persona 5. I would say the twists in Persona 5 were a bit harder to deduce, but I really like the usage of Shadows in persona 4. And even if you are obviously suspicious of certain characters, you still need more information to piece things together. Persona 4 still has incentive to keep playing since you don't have all the cards (pun not intended, but welcome). \n\nSpeaking of cards, I will say that going backwards it would be really odd to change methods of attaining personas and changing dungeon systems. Instead of talking with personas you pick between shuffled cards which sometimes have personas and sometimes do other things. However I will say that this system does make the dungeons have more longevity since you can recover SP with this method. This only works after battle though, and only if certain conditions are met in said battle, so SP is still a careful resource and if you want a specific persona then you gotta skip on it. Also you can misclick on picking the card that you want at the end of a battle. So it's a bit change but has its pros and cons. \n\nI will also say that all the dungeons in this game are like Mementos in P5, so if that was annoying for you that could be a turn off. Also most floors are randomly generated aside from boss floors. There are none of the cool puzzles like in P5, but I think the story and characters is what makes it worth sticking to it. Also if you are like me and playing with a family member on steam you can just have one person grind for you lol. \n\nAll in all I would say definitely play the game if you played persona 5 first, but I thought I should give some warnings ahead of time. Hope you enjoy the game as much as I have :)", "timestamp_created": 1700164847, "timestamp_updated": 1700164847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150222640": {"recommendationid": "150222640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100694096", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 6701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6701, "last_played": 1699455008}, "language": "english", "review": "great veggies", "timestamp_created": 1700142317, "timestamp_updated": 1700142317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150213339": {"recommendationid": "150213339", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072445607", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11956, "last_played": 1675960031}, "language": "english", "review": "The classic Persona tradition of killing gods with the power of friendship returns.", "timestamp_created": 1700126398, "timestamp_updated": 1700126398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150204664": {"recommendationid": "150204664", "author": {"steamid": "76561199175539054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3372, "playtime_at_review": 6207, "last_played": 1700114493}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si estas pensando en empezar la saga persona por aqu\u00ed -como muchas rese\u00f1as lo sugieren- te dir\u00eda que no.

Same goes for SOOO many other characters. This game should be called \u201ccharacter progression, the game\u201d. The characters, their interactions and characteristics are the meat of the game)\n\nBattle/fights or just gameplay:9/10(an amazing jrpg experience, I\u2019m getting more into them than I ever have before. It\u2019s turn based at that, which my main experience of is from Pok\u00e9mon which is my favorite video game series so of course I loved the gameplay of persona 4. I had a hard time figuring out type advantages though until rise came around. Moving the main character around is smooth, the social status thing reminds me jojo stand stats and I love it, social links are also gameplay and I mentioned I love persona 4\u2019s social links, my favorites I did in my first play through are Marie,rise,chie and doujima.

The \"slice of life\" gameplay (for lack of a better term) is the highlight of this game and is really enjoyable. The combat is decent but a bit too repetitive. Thankfully it's easy and scarce enough for it to not get in the way. I love the main cast of characters they have super fun chemistry between eachother. A large portion of their interactions are ruined by unfunny pervy Japanese humour though so be warned. \n\nAlso I didn't realize this game had multiple endings and I got the bad ending. I lost the chance to experience the actual plot and tons of content. Be sure to look up a guide on how to get the true ending because that shit was so arbitrary and the game gives no indication on what to do in order to gain it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699917553, "timestamp_updated": 1699917553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150050632": {"recommendationid": "150050632", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042517671", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 790, "last_played": 1695154673}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm convinced that this game is great but even after 3 YEARS it keeps crashing.

Persona 3 still has the best story and characters of the modern Persona games, but 4's are solid as well.  Where Persona 4 really shines is how it expands on the social links and the activities around town.  Every social link is well crafted and helps add depth to the supporting characters and the setting.  \nThe port Atlus developed for Persona 4 is better than the one they created for Persona 3.  The characters and backgrounds look polished and there are no audio issues this time around.  I just wish Persona 3 got this much love for its port.\nOverall, Persona 4 is a fantastic game.  The characters are likable and the story is good. Its biggest improvement overall is to the social links.

I probably played about 15-20 hours of it and life took over. More than a decade later, I have returned to it on PC after buying the 'Golden' remake. I knew the game was quality but I didn't quite realise what I was in for in terms of its entire experience this time around.\n\nPersona 4 (whether it is the original or Golden) is one of the best games I've every played, and I was born in the 80's. Do not hesitate to buy the game. In terms of the philosophical aspects of the game, as well as the friendship and dating aspects of the game (albeit very casual), these actually taught me a lot in terms of self reflection and self improvement. I truly believe Persona 4 is a game that can make you a better person. I wish that I was exposed to it in my early teens or 20s or even 30s. With a rough childhood, experiences of neglect, self hatred and abuse, I feel that this game really impacted me personally. There is something in here for everyone out there to relate to, and it is both heartwarming as well as healing. \nPersona is a game that is more than what it is, and it encapsulates what is a majestic vision that only the Japanese could possibly envision and implement successfully. By the time you get into it, you will find yourself with an affinity towards the characters that borders on surreal.\n\nJust some important points if you're considering this game:\n1) You will have to time sink and grind. That is part of the game. Once you get used to it and have your goal in mind, this won't be too much of a problem.\n\n2) You can't play this game with a mouse. While you can get by with the keyboard, I would recommend a controller for this game.\n\n3) On PC (and perhaps modern consoles?) The 'fishing game' is basically impossible because the fishing cursor moves far too quick. I had to forego fishing as a quest and for that reason, achievement hunters out there may find this part of the game frustrating. Not a big deal as it doesn't affect things all too much.\n\n4) Try to avoid spoilers and guides with the exception of 3 circumstances. Firstly to get yourself off to a good start. Secondly, only in situations where you may be stuck and can't find something. Or thirdly at the late game after the reveal. There are story elements in the form of spoilers that will really ruin the experience if exposed too early. So avoid the mistake of reading ahead or checking videos on YouTube (where I spotted videos with titles that wrecked the story for me).\n\n5) It's worth watching the anime AFTER playing the game.\n\n6) The soundtrack that comes with the Steam version of the game is not the (only) soundtrack you will want.

If you haven't played this game yet, you're doing a disservice to yourself. This game shouldn't be \"overwhelming positive\" on Steam, it should be universally positive. It's that good of a game, and beloved by almost everyone who's played it. Some of the themes can be a bit uncomfortable (those who have played know the ones), but as a queer person myself, I think the game handles them pretty well. Especially given that the original story itself was from 2008. At first glance, the themes can come off a little offensive. But when you sit and think about the character, how they've interacted with the world around them, how the world has interacted back, their personality, etc, it begins to make a lot more sense, and comes together very cohesively. The game and characters are very well written, even the ones that deal with queerness. All games have their flaws, including this one, but the things it does right, it does *right.* And most of the things it does, are done right, if that makes sense. I don't know what else to say other than this is a game you have to experience for yourself, even if you come away disliking some or all of it (you probably won't, but you might).

This theme is most present in the social link aspect of the game, which is done excellently, deepening your investment in these characters, specifically your fellow party members, by telling these very emphatic human stories. Additionally, this also furthers your immersion, making the setting of Inaba feel less like just a game world and more like a real place with real people, which is funny when the map of Inaba is so limited. \n\nWhile I certainly missed the intricate palaces from Persona 5, Persona 4 by no means has weak dungeon crawling, as each dungeon still oozes personality, and I generally found the battles on Hard difficulty more consistently engaging than Persona 5 Royal even though it has more complex combat due to Baton Pass and Technical. This is because in Persona 5 Royal it is much easier to start battles with player advantage and battles are frequently over before the enemies\u2019 turn whilst this is less the case in Persona 4 forcing you to consider your moves better and play more strategically. However, I do think Persona 5 still has Persona 4 beat on boss battles both visually and mechanically. The visual design of Persona 4\u2019s bosses are still strong though, reaching the end of each dungeon was always a highlight, as I loved seeing how the twisted shadow of each victim would manifest. As in any Persona game the music is fantastic and does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the game. \n\nAdditionally, the scenes of the investigation team hanging out do a great job in convincing you that the group are genuine friends, and it was always a joy watching the characters interact with each other and seeing their relationships develop during these. Persona 4 is downright hilarious at times too which I can\u2019t say about many other games. \n\nIn conclusion I think the best word that describes Persona 4 is \u2018genuine\u2019, and I think that is an amazing achievement.", "timestamp_created": 1699478823, "timestamp_updated": 1699478961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149778804": {"recommendationid": "149778804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384538963", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2059, "playtime_at_review": 1189, "last_played": 1700749145}, "language": "english", "review": "Shits peak", "timestamp_created": 1699478202, "timestamp_updated": 1699478202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149765491": {"recommendationid": "149765491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024811184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2026, "last_played": 1670437838}, "language": "english", "review": "its great", "timestamp_created": 1699460967, "timestamp_updated": 1699460967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149759481": {"recommendationid": "149759481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976698606", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 4926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4926, "last_played": 1699450101}, "language": "english", "review": "Teddie is so me", "timestamp_created": 1699452958, "timestamp_updated": 1699452958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149753762": {"recommendationid": "149753762", "author": {"steamid": "76561199221283052", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1348, "last_played": 1699522460}, "language": "english", "review": "im in love with marie", "timestamp_created": 1699443956, "timestamp_updated": 1699443956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149738380": {"recommendationid": "149738380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035019649", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3852, "last_played": 1699389456}, "language": "english", "review": "yes.", "timestamp_created": 1699411199, "timestamp_updated": 1699411199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149737329": {"recommendationid": "149737329", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126365375", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 8023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8023, "last_played": 1686454973}, "language": "english", "review": "Persona 4 for me really did suprise me in alot of good ways.

This is a huge aspect of the fun I had with P5R, so the procedural generation was very boring and tedious and eventually I lowered difficulty just so I could skip around shadows and not be screwed for the boss fights.\n\nP5R does a fantastic job of giving most of the main cast a good amount of screen time without ever feeling like character involvement is being shoehorned in. Group scenes are done in such a way that there are clearly characters with the main focus from scene to scene. P4G on the other hand, does its utmost to make sure every character always gets a word in, but it's usually redundant and again just becomes boring and tedious. I generally think the writing quality of P5R is just so exceptional that clearly any other game will have a hard time being compared to it, but even so I found this aspect lackluster.\n\nFinally, and this is a problem I had with some parts of P5R as well, but to a lesser extent, the music cues are all over the place, and make empathizing with the cast more difficult. A few of the tracks, especially the ones meant to be somber, are played far too frequently for the emotional beats to hit properly. A more understated use of the background tracks within scenes would have helped immensely.\n\nAs a little aside, if you're ever stuck on what to do in a dungeon, be very careful of where you go to find playthrough help. Some of what I found as well as some reviews here spoiled the culprit which completely sullied half the game for me.

That being said, it does have its shortcomings but they are mostly due to the era it came out in. The dungeon crawl can get a little repetitive and the controls can feel just a bit outdated but, all in all, Persona 4 will always be a 11/10 in my humble opinion.

A former friend had told me countless times about it in high school, and how much he admired it. I desired greatly to play it, but never had the money to get a Vita in order to play. \n\nWhen this came out on Steam, I had really no choice except to buy it. What followed was a great experience. I played it through a sort of midpoint in my life between a chaotic era and new beginnings. It really helped me through the process of change.\n\nI fell in love with the everything. The characters, the setting, the music. The combat, the enemies, the Personas. All of it was so fresh for me. I played it pretty much every day, enjoying every moment of the story and anticipating the end.\n\nWhen I did finish the game, I was left with a profound sense of accomplishment. This is a long fucking game with a lot of moments dedicated to dialogue and plenty of time spent grinding, plenty of deaths I would have to go back to checkpoints because of, and honestly instances where I simply enjoyed the soundtrack as I switched focus to talk to a friend while playing. My save sat somewhere in the ballpark of 65 to 70 hours and I was proud of it. I had that sense of loss every gamer knows when they finish a good fucking game, but it was bittersweet. I still was left with a net good, I'd say.\n\nDefinitely play this game. It is a classic, with a wonderful story and great mechanics, in terms of combat and plenty else.

With a fantastic cast of characters to love and explore, it surely is a fantastic experience to create bonds with characters who feel like complex people with goals, aspirations, insecurities, etc etc. The fantastic soundtrack from the epic to the somber that almost never feels out of place. \nWhile I do think the original Persona 4 is the superior game, do not make the mistake of skipping this one, while not a master piece, it is certainly close to one in regards to story.\nIn regards to gameplay, it takes after other SMT games, especially Persona 3 with some changes added in, that can help the experience some what, it does however suffer from the sometimes mind numbing stuff that can plague jrpgs such as grinding. Unlike most others though tough fights require insane strategy even on easier difficulties that can make game play engaging and fulfilling to beat a boss. \nOverall: 8.5/10 play it, it is truly an experience worth having.", "timestamp_created": 1698646325, "timestamp_updated": 1698646325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149155482": {"recommendationid": "149155482", "author": {"steamid": "76561199073433123", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 3087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2269, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1700417369}, "language": "english", "review": "basically JoJo: the rpg", "timestamp_created": 1698612896, "timestamp_updated": 1698612896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149150964": {"recommendationid": "149150964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363048491", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2120, "last_played": 1698389228}, "language": "english", "review": "Persona 4 is so good I wish TV's were real", "timestamp_created": 1698608344, "timestamp_updated": 1698608344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149088081": {"recommendationid": "149088081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982147286", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 14013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 431, "playtime_at_review": 8615, "last_played": 1699832158}, "language": "english", "review": "bro it literally has chie", "timestamp_created": 1698538138, "timestamp_updated": 1698538138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149087808": {"recommendationid": "149087808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303523345", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 5972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5972, "last_played": 1699576772}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Obra maestra, Joya, Excelencia, Maravilla, Genialidad, Fen\u00f3meno, Sensaci\u00f3n, Esplendor, Magia, Sorpresa, Perfecci\u00f3n, Admirable, Incre\u00edble, Asombroso, Fascinante, Extraordinario, Grandioso, Monumental, Deslumbrante, Deslumbrador, Impresionante, Sobresaliente, Magn\u00edfico, Estupendo, Formidable, Espectacular, Excepcional, Brillante, Destacado, Inigualable, Incomparable, Insuperable, M\u00e1gico, Exquisito, Emocionante, Sublime, Apote\u00f3sico, Estelar, Impecable, Atractivo, Maravilloso, Fant\u00e1stico, Espl\u00e9ndido, Sensacional.", "timestamp_created": 1698537791, "timestamp_updated": 1699577129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479452043771743774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149077378": {"recommendationid": "149077378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074370112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 30019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29989, "last_played": 1698700669}, "language": "english", "review": "God there's nothing I wouldn't give to be able to play this game fresh again.

The fantasy aspects didn't feel forced. However, I guess it wasn't a great fit for me due to the lack of good-looking characters and the absence of a happy ending. I dislike the notion of having to replay a game multiple times to get the \"proper\" ending or to be allowed to finish achievements. I also noticed a disproportionate amount of humor at the expense of boys compared to girls. If they make fun of girls, then shortly after, boys get it much worse.\n\nMechanically, the combat was pretty good, and the persona unlocks were interesting.

But as the story progresses, that's when you can really feel how well the story was written. Every one of your friends within the game feels so real, as if you are truly there with them, enjoying the student life in the small country town of Inaba. Though I have to agree that some of the jokes in the game are really outdated and feel a bit cringey (actually, it's bear-able,iykwim), the overall experience is irreplaceable.\n\nAfter all, this is such a great game with great soundtracks.

the reviews on here and to sum it up they simply do not do the game justice.\n\nTo sum the game up, it is like a successful cross between Final Fantasy and Jade Cocoon (one for the older RPG fans).  \n\nEvery character has been extremely well thought out and it is definitely catered for the more adult crowd as the language used at times contains swearing however this does nothing but give more believably to some of the main protagonists.\n\nThe story without giving away any spoilers is gripping and extremely well told and thought out and at times it is extremely dark and deep, \n\nThe only downside, dungeons are repetitive and there seems to be no real thought put in with that side of the game play but for anyone who likes turn based combat games this should not be a put off as the story telling way outweighs this oversight.\n\nNever has a game made me go through a whirlwind of emotions between laughing through the extremely witty humour and crying out of sadness.\n\nHighly

Originally released on the PlayStation 2 and later enhanced for the PlayStation Vita, then released to Steam and other platforms, this game remains a testament to the power of storytelling in the medium of video games.\n\nStorytelling: 10/10\nThe narrative of Persona 4 Golden is a work of art. It begins with your character, the silent protagonist, moving to the rural town of Inaba and quickly immerses you in a suspenseful murder mystery. This story is meticulously crafted, masterfully weaving elements of mystery, suspense, and supernatural intrigue. The pacing is impeccable, with each in-game day offering a new layer of the story, allowing players to slowly unravel the mystery behind the Midnight Channel and the strange occurrences in Inaba. The twists and turns keep you engaged, and the revelations are both surprising and thought-provoking.\n\nOne of the game's strengths is its exploration of the human psyche and the inner struggles of its characters. As you forge bonds with your friends and delve into the dungeons of their inner selves, you witness their deepest fears and insecurities. The way the game addresses these issues with empathy and depth is a testament to the craftsmanship behind the storytelling. By the time you reach the climax, you're deeply invested in the lives and fates of the characters, making each emotional beat all the more impactful.\n\nCharacter Development: 10/10\nThe characters of Persona 4 Golden are a testament to how well-written and fleshed out video game characters can be. Each character has their own distinct personality, struggles, and growth arcs, making them feel like real people you genuinely care about. As you spend time with them, you get to know their quirks, vulnerabilities, and strengths. The \"Social Link\" system allows you to deepen your relationships, offering insight into their backgrounds and helping them overcome their personal issues. This not only enhances the game-play but also creates a profound emotional connection with the characters.\n\nThe central cast, including Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Kanji, Rise, Naoto, and Teddie, are multifaceted and undergo significant development throughout the story. Their personal stories are both heartwarming and heart-wrenching, and you can't help but root for them. The antagonist, too, is brilliantly crafted, adding a layer of complexity to the narrative that's rarely seen in video games.\n\nEmotional Impact: 10/10\nThe emotional impact of Persona 4 Golden is where it truly shines. This game masterfully tugs at your heartstrings. It's impossible not to feel a strong connection to the characters as you watch them grapple with their inner demons and grow through adversity. The game doesn't shy away from addressing sensitive themes like identity, sexuality, acceptance, and the masks people wear to hide their true selves.\n\nThe final act of Persona 4 Golden is a roller-coaster of emotions, as you confront the true nature of the villain and help your friends confront their innermost fears. The climax is gut-wrenching and awe-inspiring in equal measure, and it leaves a lasting impact on players.\n\nIn conclusion, Persona 4 Golden is a game that excels in storytelling, character development, and evoking genuine, hard-hitting emotions. Its unforgettable cast, thought-provoking narrative, and profound exploration of human psychology make it a timeless classic in the world of video games. If you haven't experienced this emotional roller-coaster, you're missing out on one of the greatest storytelling achievements in gaming history.", "timestamp_created": 1697080192, "timestamp_updated": 1697080192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148056309": {"recommendationid": "148056309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198957453004", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4630, "last_played": 1699008249}, "language": "english", "review": "Persona 4 Golden is quite possibly the most perfectly crafted high school slice-of-life JRPG video game ever made currently.\n\n*** NPC Design ***\n\nThe characters all have personalities and developments that'll make you cross your fingers that none of them, and i mean literally NONE of the characters die or even get hurt because how beautifully complimentary their designs are.\n\n*** Combat System ***\n\nThe combat system has a decent growth curve as you will start out weak due to the impact having multiple personas has on the games flow, this combat system is the only system i've seen that actually makes the concept of switching out personas for specific useful spells constantly, makes usage of even the worst personas, ergo no persona is left behind.\n\n*** The Music ***\n\nThe sound tracks of this game is the best i've ever heard in any Persona (TM) video game so far. It fits the student life aesthetic of the protagonist and gives the environments more character, anyone who hasn't started the game yet, enjoy the eargasms, you'll wish you could listen to the music for the first time again, i know i have, hah!\n\n/////  THE CONCLUSION BOIS //////\n\nThis game is absolutely worth getting, as a matter of fact i think every steam account should own it, it's an amazing experience to not miss out on, better to get this video game when it goes on sale since it is a Playstation 2 game and from the 2000's era, the price is kinda high right now for such a beautiful relic.

The first problem is that even though the detectives don't want the characters to get involved, the smart thing to do would be to wait for a foggy night and show them that they can enter the TVs and that the people showing on the midnight channel are the one's being killed. If you show someone something that seems so impossible and they can do it too, they'll almost always believe the weirder stuff you tell them, and then the police can take it from there and probably find the killer better because they can send in more people and they are trained.\n\nThe characters are easily the worst part of this game. The characters you play know that if they don't stop this threat then the entire world will come to an end. And yet all they fucking care about is their relationships and unimportant personal problems. I'm sorry senpai doesn't love you, but the entire fucking world is gonna end unless you do something to stop it and that's really what your worried about? Also if you can't stand UwU senpai talk, play this on Japanese dub. The English dub is super annoying.\n\nThis game also glorifies pedophilia and brushes sexual assault off as a gag. There are multiple instances where one character sexually assaults another for gag and it's played off as a joke. The offender literally doesn't see any consequences. Not even a slap on the wrist. Everything is normal between the offender and victim in the next scene. There's also a job you can take as a hospital janitor where a adult women creeps on you and very blatantly wants to fuck you. Keep in mind you are playing as a highschooler that's not even a senior. She also doesn't get any consequences, in fact the game wants you to play into it. The dialogue options include, ignore it and do nothing, or actively partake in the pedophilia. And guess what? You get rewarded for playing into it. Your social link increases with that character.\n\nThe fighting game is fun.\n\nAnyways if you want to play a better RPG play Yakuza like a dragon.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1235140/Yakuza_Like_a_Dragon/", "timestamp_created": 1696471506, "timestamp_updated": 1696471691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3,

Having initially explored the Persona universe through Persona 5 Royal, Persona 4 Golden brings a distinctive flavor to the table.\n\nOne of the standout features is undoubtedly the enigmatic storyline. Persona 4 excels in building suspense and curiosity, keeping me hooked on the mysteries unfolding in the game. The \"Shuffle Time\" mechanic adds a layer of unpredictability that I found quite enjoyable, providing a different dynamic compared to Persona 5.\n\nPersona 4's strengths lie in its engaging characters and a plot that keeps you guessing. While the endgame lacks the tough decision-making element (there really only is 1 Choice that makes sense), it doesn't take away from the overall experience. The narrative unfolds seamlessly, and the characters' development is both heartwarming and impactful.\n\nOn the musical front, the soundtrack is undeniably impressive, creating a fitting atmosphere for the game. However, it's worth noting that, in my opinion, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the Persona 5 soundtrack. Persona 5 set a high bar with its unforgettable tunes, and while Persona 4's soundtrack is excellent, it doesn't quite match the same level of brilliance.\n\nIn conclusion, Persona 4 Golden is a remarkable addition to the Persona series, offering a captivating journey filled with mysteries and memorable moments. If you're a fan of deep narratives, well-crafted characters, and a touch of suspense, Persona 4 Golden is a must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1695975655, "timestamp_updated": 1695975655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147253552": {"recommendationid": "147253552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074870847", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 7031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7031, "last_played": 1695951469}, "language": "english", "review": "The happiest serial killer story ever", "timestamp_created": 1695957853, "timestamp_updated": 1695957853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147249253": {"recommendationid": "147249253", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089826958", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1696032346}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to play this game, but I can't.

out of 10. \n\n\n\nBut jokes aside, it's the best game i've played so far. At first, the whole JRPG fighting and the graphics weren't that appealing for me. However, as i got used to the game, i was fully amazed how well the game was planned out.\n\nFirst of all, the whole background and stage really gives the early 2010s vibe which gives a big nostalgic feels. The fashion and the art style, somehow even the BGM makes me feel like i'm a highschool student in 2010. \n\nThe main story is full of surprises, it's really well-written and witty. And the anime cut scenes that appear time to time are always on point. \n\nWhat REALLY lured me in was the side stories. And i'm not just talking about the side characters. Every NPC in this game has their backstory. The dialogues of all mob characters vary every time you talk to them. Personally, the dialogues are the most important part of this game. It gives replay values as the characters all show different reactions to the player's choice. \n\nThe fact you can fully bond with all the side characters also made this game more likable than other games. Some games make perfectly well structured into a blunt talking doll. Persona, however, never waste their characters. They show the whole iceberg and the player does a big part revealing the iceberg.  \n\nAlso, there are tons of collectible stuff you can gather throughout the game. So, if you're a collector, you'll have to put a reasonable amount of time in this game. But, i can assure you, it ain't boring. \n\n In the end, if you are not sure of buying this game, i highly suggest playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1695653792, "timestamp_updated": 1695653792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627380430698394775", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146999294": {"recommendationid": "146999294", "author": {"steamid": "76561199163516528", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2985, "playtime_at_review": 11160, "last_played": 1700154489}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really enjoyable story and RPG focused game that provides good characters, a decent challenge, and a fun experience!

It got to the point where I dreaded that part of the game so I just turned the difficulty all the way down and blasted through any combat areas.

At first, i was trying to speed through it but that turned out to be a gigantic mistake. It is by taking your time during dialogue, during cutscenes and having a bit of patience with the dungeons that you truly come to bond with the game and its characters. This is one of those games that make you WISH you could play it for the first time again the most. The first time you play through this game is an absolutely amazing experiences with engaging story elements carefully put together and neat details.\n\nThere are MANY, MANY things you can do to progress through the story which enables the player great flexibility when it comes to creating your route.

Mi siguiente parada entonces era este Persona 4 Golden. M\u00e1s a\u00fan tras saber que se TRADUJO AL ESPA\u00d1OL OFICIALMENTE.\n\nJugablemente es lo que se puede esperar de un juego de esta saga tras Persona 3, mezcla de simulador social con JRPG por turnos.\nTenemos dos planos, el humano y el mundo de dentro de la televisi\u00f3n.\nEn el humano se nos presenta un estilo de juego en plan Visual Novel donde podremos explorar el pueblo en el que transcurre la historia y decidir como vamos a pasar el tiempo. De primeras habr\u00e1 que ir a clase pero tras que se acaben seremos libres de hacer lo que queramos como pasar tiempo con nuestros conocidos, buscar un curro con el que ganaremos dinero, comprar armas, armaduras y objetos necesarios para luchar en el mundo de la televisi\u00f3n, estudiar o realizar otras actividades.\nTodo esto es necesario para:\n-Aumentar el nivel de nuestros Social Link, lo que nos ayudar\u00e1 a la hora de crear nuevas Personas (en el caso de tus compa\u00f1eros de grupo recibir\u00e1n nuevas habilidades como resistir un ataque normal, curar estados alterados, derribar o tirar fuera del combate a los enemigos)\n-Aumentar las caracter\u00edsticas sociales del protagonista como el carisma, el valor o la inteligencia. Lo que nos ayuda a conseguir nuevos trabajos, nuevos Social Link y nuevas opciones de di\u00e1logo.\n-Profundizar m\u00e1s en las historias y conflictos personales de cada personaje del juego.\n\nEn el mundo de la televisi\u00f3n tendremos la parte de JRPG convencional, nos metemos en dungeon donde luchamos contra enemigos en combates por turnos, la clave que diferencia esta saga de las otras es su forma de luchar. Hay que aprovechar las debilidades de nuestros enemigos para ganar turnos extra, derribarlos a todos y evitar que ellos hagan lo propio con nosotros.\nAqu\u00ed el \"darle a atacar todo el rato\" no funciona, la estrategia y conocer bien las habilidades de todo tu grupo es la clave para salir victorioso de los combates.\nLa lucha y la subida de nivel es importante puesto que te ayudar\u00e1 a crear y conseguir nuevas \"Personas\" m\u00e1s poderosas y con mejores habilidades que ya tienes, algo as\u00ed como en Pok\u00e9mon pero en lugar de capturar bichos los consigues mediante un juego de cartas o fusion\u00e1ndolos.\n\nEsto es algo que todos los juegos de Persona tienen \u00bfQu\u00e9 tiene Persona 4 para destacar frente al resto?\nLa historia.\n\nEn esta ocasi\u00f3n estamos ante una trama de misterio e investigaci\u00f3n donde en el pueblo de Inaba se est\u00e1n sucediendo una serie de asesinatos para los que la polic\u00eda, sorpresa, no sabe c\u00f3mo resolver. Todo esto est\u00e1 relacionado con un canal de televisi\u00f3n que aparece de noche los d\u00edas de lluvia y con un mundo alterno dentro de dicho canal al que solo nuestros protas tienen acceso. De este modo, los protas forman un equipo de investigaci\u00f3n hecho para descubrir qui\u00e9n es el asesino de Inaba.\n\nNo solo es una gran historia de investigaci\u00f3n y misterio, sino que adem\u00e1s es una historia introspectiva donde conoceremos a profundidad los miedos, paranoias y dudas de todos los integrantes de nuestro grupo, a la par que intentamos que estos se vayan aceptando a si mismos. Poco a poco se ver\u00e1 que esto de no aceptarse a uno mismo es un mal que ata\u00f1e a toda la sociedad del pueblo y est\u00e1 relacionado con la extra\u00f1a niebla que aparece tras varios d\u00edas de lluvia.\n\nMi conclusi\u00f3n es que este es uno de los mejores juegos de la saga Persona y uno de mis JRPG preferidos de toda la vida.\nMUY RECOMENDABLE TANTO SI HAS JUGADO PREVIAMENTE PERSONA 5 COMO NO.\n\nPD: Si quieres acceder al contenido extra de la versi\u00f3n Golden, sube el Social Link de Marie al Nivel 10 tan r\u00e1pido como puedas.", "timestamp_created": 1694789072, "timestamp_updated": 1694789072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146318390": {"recommendationid": "146318390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198993421628", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1696725725}, "language": "english", "review": "Everyday's great at at your Junes!", "timestamp_created": 1694757218, "timestamp_updated": 1694757218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146317675": {"recommendationid": "146317675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110501815", "num_games_owned": 610, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 493, "last_played": 1694991358}, "language": "english", "review": "It's beating my ass", "timestamp_created": 1694755559, "timestamp_updated": 1694755559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146301171": {"recommendationid": "146301171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086837496", "num_games_owned": 575, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 4058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4058, "last_played": 1694708522}, "language": "english", "review": "Every time I replay this game, every time I return to Inaba, it feels a little like returning home.

I've never played a game that has a cast quite like P4. The bonds between the members of the Investigation Team feel like genuine friendships. The beauty of P4 is that it makes you feel like they're your friends too. You grow to genuinely care for these characters, and want to spend as much time as you can with them before your time with them runs out.\n\nThe gameplay is your usual JRPG fare, the writing is sometimes questionable, but none of that matters. The reason you play this game is for the story and the cast (and the incredible soundtrack). \n\nIf you have any qualms at all, cast them aside. Buy this game and experience for yourself just how a sense of community and friendship can be conveyed in a piece of media.\n\nAlso, Rise best girl", "timestamp_created": 1694725154,

See, there's about 40 hours (idk how far for others but that's where I am) where the game will consistently crash after a boss fight AND a very long cut scene. \n\nWhat this means is that I cannot actually progress in the game. I've seen elsewhere that it may because of my graphics card (AMD). I have tried multiple times to get through this section for it to consistently crash and I have to do an entire boss battle AGAIN. \n\nThis has been a known issue for YEARS and Atlus has done nothing to fix a GAME BREAKING bug. I've seen elsewhere that there is a 4GB patch that can fix the bugs and it has worked for others.

I just do not like this game. Its got all the persona tropes and trappings and that clearly gives it enough for most to like it but the gameplay its wrapped in just feels so flat and slow to me. The dungeons bored me, the side quests did not interest me (the confidants did for the record), and the party is a mixed bag. I like most of them well enough they all have good moments but they have just too many scenes that come off as abrasive rather than charming.\n\nAlso a lot of their arcs just don't work for me? Kanji and Naoto have been the center of debate for 15 years now for good reason. Honestly I find their arcs fine if a little boring? Like yeah it is totally fine for Kanji to be a straight guy and be into feminine things but like. I don't find much value in that? I don't find it homophobic that he isn't gay but it just isn't saying much interesting to me. It probably resonated more in 2008 but it just feels like a big deal about nothing now. Especially combined with Yosuke just being a total dick to him for the rest of the game for being gay it just feels off. \n\nHonestly though the arc that really pissed me off was Yukiko's. She was my favorite character and I loved how her dungeon encapsulated and visualized her struggles in relation to her family business. Then when you do her social link she decides... to take over the family business. Which yeah they gave reasons for it but doesn't mean I liked the reasons. It just makes the game feel like the things you do often don't end up mattering long term story wise.\n\nI think I could still \"recommend\" this game I know there is a lot to like in it and clearly most who play do end up enjoying it. But personally I just gotta give it the thumbs down.\n\nAlso why do the colors in golden look so much worse than the PS2 game?

And of course, Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal came out and were stellar.\n\nLooking back, Persona 4: Golden is THE BEST Persona game.  Not an easy or light statement.  P4G fleshes out each and every character and was even addressing things like \"A man not wanting to be manly but liking girly things\" before all of this current-gen craziness hit us all.  And it wasn't forced, it was natural, interesting, relatable.  They truly did ALL of the characters justice in this game.\n\nI haven't even gotten to the game itself, the battles are fun and fast.  The usual mythology packed in very well.  Just, great stuff.\n\nI'm posting this review without a single achieve on the Steam version yet and I'll update/edit if I find any flaws or improvements over the PS Vita version.

"language": "english", "review": "If I had a proper rating scale to give this game, it'd get a 6.5/10. But I can't do that, so, yes I do recommend people IF THEY HAVE A LARGE INTEREST.\n\nI am not overly offended by P4's gameplay loop, but the game gets incredibly stale by the latter part of the game, the first optional final dungeon is probably the worst section gameplay-wise in the entire game, and the effort of doing everything to even get to the final boss, only for one of the least memorable boss fights possible... leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nEverything else? Good enough. Main cast varies from excellent (Naoto, Teddie, Kanji) to what did they do to you in Golden cutscenes (Youske), and the side characters vary from the best in the world (Kou) to certainly existing (Nurse.) Combat made sense for a while, although the reuse of enemies absolutely wore its novelty quickly after the fifth Basalt enemy encountered with unique weaknesses. Once you get Megido and any level of Invigorate, encounters become trivialized, and the Chakra ring or Spell Master proceed to truly invalidate everything else remaining. If nothing else, it speeds the game up drastically when you no longer need to worry about the omnidrain enemies late-game.\n\nShuffle time truly ruined everything, though - I'm a grinder who will abuse every tool, even if I know it actively ruins an experience, and shuffle time just makes the player significantly more powerful than they have any right being. My favorite design-wise is Ippon-Datara, and I wound up by the endgame having a 99 in all stats, Megidolaon-Mind Charge + 2 AOEs my team couldn't cover, Invigorate 3 and Spell Master copy of him. The game became click Mind Charge->Heat Riser Naoto->Masukunda Kanji->delete button.\n\nI'm sure people who aren't me will find more enjoyment out of P4G, especially if they aren't a farmer. For me, the game turned into a slog by the end, but I still have good memories of working through the early game and barely getting everything prepped for the True Ending.", "timestamp_created": 1693644539, "timestamp_updated": 1693644539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145500988": {"recommendationid": "145500988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066856526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1693268495}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a mistake to play this after [i]Persona 5[/i], which, as of writing, is the apotheosis of the entire series.

It did take me a while to get into it, especially as I took a while to grasp the mechanics and find the motivation to play it more (thank you, Steam Deck!) Once I started getting used to it and had a full party setup, I didn't struggle much once to get through the story with the exception of a few bosses. There is one major gripe I have with the Steam version that I can't ignore. Why does a single player game, let alone a PS2 one have DRM that forces you to go online before you play it?\n\nMoving past that, I enjoyed the story and the setting of Inaba, and I liked the little twists and turns along the way as I progressed further through the story, but some of the dialogue is so cringe and made me feel like I'm way past the game's target demographic, it's a bit of an unfortunate side effect of the game showing its age.\n\nAs these dialogue issues are brought up by most people, I'll skip over them but I'll make a point that Rise's obsession with Narukami got me feeling that If I were him, I'd keep a spray bottle filled with holy water on me with my finger always on the trigger, ready to pull it at any given second if she got within 3 feet of me.\n\nDespite my gripes, I really enjoyed the game and I'm glad I started playing it around the time I did as while I was mid-playthrough, an update dropped which added a quick save feature, which tremendously improved my experience as someone that played in short bursts during my work breaks.

The story also kind of falls apart at the end, it goes from solid murder mystery to \"Let's kill god because this is a JRPG and we have to.\" The soundtrack is great, but seriously begins to grate on your ears after you hear History Maker for the 300th time.

It can feel a bit repetitive especially around halfway through, but the player-made pace of the game makes it incredibly addictive and I constantly found myself saying \"just one more day\". The story is pretty engaging and each character has their own distinct personality, though occasionally they act more like caricatures than people. I wish there were a few more story events scattered throughout the game, but that's because they're so much fun to watch and goes to show how good the writing can be. The JRPG gameplay was hit-or-miss for me, as sometimes it can be extremely repetitive and you can feel the grind, but it really shines when you can chain critical hits and weaknesses together and seeing your high ranking social links dramatically affect combat (tip I wish I knew earlier -> [spoiler] Maxing out Rise's sl is super powerful[/spoiler]). \nOverall a really well made game and absolutely worth the price if you think it's up your alley.

The idea of \"shadows\" and facing one's true self is a great way to showcase our main party's struggles and issues that they have to deal with and flesh them out as characters. The only problem with this is the execution. Both Kanji's and Naoto's shadows and issues often misrepresent their true issues are pretty representative that this game was made in 2008 Japan. Like if the general themes of the dungeons completely got rid of the awful misrepresentation of gay and trans issues, then this game would be so much better. Kanji and Naoto's character don't even go in that direction, instead using those LGBT as an unfortunate mask for their real issues. Maybe some future persona games can better represent these issues but for what we have here, it is not well-aged at all. The dungeon system in this game is pretty uninteresting, all floors feel the same and can get pretty mind-numbing after awhile. But if you can get past these issues, there is a fantastic game underneath that makes you feel like you're apart of this group of friends that transcend the digital space.", "timestamp_created": 1692238741, "timestamp_updated": 1692238741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507804334163665771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144376292": {"recommendationid": "144376292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095235134", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4531, "last_played": 1692269827}, "language": "english", "review": "Persona 4 is without a doubt one of my favorite games I've played in recent memory, with phenomenal storytelling and an equally incredible soundtrack. The juxtaposition between a high school life-sim and a classic JRPG blends well and creates an experience greater than the sum of its parts. The characters are, for the most part, extremely well written which makes you genuinely care for them, and the game's mystery elements which require you to pick up on subtle cues throughout the story to determine what is happening behind the scenes creates a story that is more gripping than most games I have played. While the true ending can be brute-forced, having a reward for paying attention to these clues can be very gratifying for players who are genuinely invested in the story. The game is decently sized too, taking me about 63.5 hours to beat, not counting deaths and idling. Technically speaking, this is a very stable release in which I only noticed one frame dip in my entire playthrough. While this isn't that impressive considering this is a PlayStation 2 game, it is nice to see the developers took care in making sure this was a quality PC port. My only real gripes with the game lie due to the cultural gap that comes from playing a game intended for Japanese audiences with Western eyes, with more than one occasion in the game leaving me genuinely uncomfortable in regards to how the game treats certain characters. All things considered, I'd say this game is a 9.5/10 which I recommend for most people to at least try, given how little it costs.", "timestamp_created": 1692236532, "timestamp_updated": 1692236532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144374116": {"recommendationid": "144374116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198973286967", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 7181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7181, "last_played": 1681417149}, "language": "english", "review": "Banger after banger, story and writing is peak, last two dungeons are dumb.\n\nAmazing game", "timestamp_created": 1692233644, "timestamp_updated": 1692233644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144366211": {"recommendationid": "144366211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121497511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7154, "last_played": 1692229698}, "language": "english", "review": "The best Persona game and this is the definitive edition of it.

Depending on how you wish to spend your time, you may choose who and how much your character interacts with others. Relationships that you strengthen feel legitimate. These characters are expertly written, all having clear reasons for their personality, motives, and feelings. Slowing building relationships in P4G makes you feel invested in them like if they were real. Solving the mysteries of Inaba is just as compelling as you work together with the characters you grow so fond of to solve injustices and protect others. There is never a dull moment when playing this game.\n\nIf you enjoy any kind of turn-based combat, visual novel, or even just a story to follow, playing this game is a requirement to experience what makes those aspects of a video game fun at its absolute best. P4G goes to show that some games will never age. It is a must-try classic.", "timestamp_created": 1692082967, "timestamp_updated": 1692130483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628915667533874512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144232764": {"recommendationid": "144232764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256709931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1902, "last_played": 1695695284}, "language": "english", "review": "THOSE LONG DAYS PASSING BY FROM THAT DOOR!", "timestamp_created": 1692074471, "timestamp_updated": 1692388911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144228730": {"recommendationid": "144228730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855528032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1697725677}, "language": "english", "review": "S tier plot", "timestamp_created": 1692069416, "timestamp_updated": 1692069416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144223505": {"recommendationid": "144223505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991957071", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1696700417}, "language": "english", "review": "adachi babyyy", "timestamp_created": 1692063021, "timestamp_updated": 1692063021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144223389": {"recommendationid": "144223389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024017915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4795, "last_played": 1695963841}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't like how the game did Naoto and Kanji dirty, and that they made Chie a cop.

But just from my first experience, it's without a doubt a great, great game that have you truly attached.\n\nMusic: 10/10. The music is SO GOOD. It really is. Every track just fits perfectly with what's happening and gets your emotions rolling through uncontrollably. \n\nCombat: 7/10. In my opinion the weakest part of the game. The system is easy to understand but it's quite clunky and slow at times with too much repetitive corridor maze running grind. It does the job however, and in major, epic fights that are important, the atmosphere truly pulls through. The flaws however are mostly due to this game being quite old for some time now so it's understandable. \n\nCharacters: 10/10. The best description for the cast is that, they work together in this story and game PERFECTLY. Besides each one of them being so so deep and beautiful in their lives at Inaba. Everyone just fits their role and some characters truly elevate your experience in the story.\n\nGraphics/Art: 8/10. Very well designed characters and the scenes around Inaba and surrounding regions. There are a few moments where the character art or graphics show their old, outdated age but it does the job well. \n\nStory: 100/10. Please just experience P4G story with 0 spoilers from start to finish. You won't regret it. Incredibly emotional story from start to finish and many plot twists with PEAK ARCS that throw you off your chair. I went in with expectations that were COMPLETELY SHATTERED by how the story developed.\n\nExploration/Content: 9/10. Many many things to do and great events that add to the story development. The town of Inaba itself is small so not much daily exploration but other than that there are tons of content to be explored. \n\nThe truth will be shrouded in fog...

So keep in mind the nostalgia factor is off the charts here for me.  That said, even if you don't know anything about Japan, I think you would likely still enjoy Persona 4, one of the best RPGs ever made.  My thoughts:\n\nThe good:\nThe story is excellent. It's a supernatural murder mystery and coming-of-age tale set in a small town in Japan. You play a high school student and you must make friends, juggle studies and part-time jobs...and  fight demons in an alternate dimension. To say anymore would be to ruin the thrill of discovery.  Great mix of comedy, horror, teen drama and fantasy.\n\nThe characters are insanely likable, and their dialog is frequently hilarious and occasionally heartwarming. There is a heavy emphasis on creating a network of friends - as well as some light dating sim aspects.  And the social links you make improve your combat abilities too in the more fantastical battles that inevitably occur. Also, the teachers you get are consistently funny (and realistic) in their obsessions and inappropriate comments in and out of class.\n\nThe design work for character portraits and monsters is all top-notch.  Of course the surreal demons and demigods present here as the MOBs and Personae are mostly recycled from previous Shin Megami Tensei and Persona games, so no need to reinvent the wheel.  But aesthetically, this is a fantastic game.\n\nThe gameplay loop is a mix of life sim and dungeon crawling, and it is hyperaddictive.  Combat is turn-based but extremely dynamic and colorful.  There is also a Pokemon-like mechanic in which you collect and/or combine your 'pets' in cool and unpredictable ways.\n\nThe OST is a bop, and the anime cut-scenes by Madhouse are great. Oh, and the voice acting is tremendous (at least on the Japanese side, I can't speak for the English dub).\n\nThe meh:\nThough character portraits are in gorgeous manga-style, the actual characters are showing their age a bit - a very Wii-U look to them overall.  And though the aesthetic of the backgrounds is spot on stylistically, there's not a lot of realism. That might bother some who have came from Persona 5 or other more recent SMT games.\n\nWithout going into spoiler territory, there are multiple endings and the 'best' one apparently involves an entirely unnecessary secret boss. I avoided it, and regret nothing, as I was very happy to finish my 68 hour runthrough where I did.  \n\nIt is a bit of a slow burn starting out, and the unofficial tutorial section at the start lasts a really long time.\n\nIf you don't like occasionally over-the-top anime style slapstick comedy, some story beats may be a little cringy for you.\n\nSome of the side-quests can be a little low effort (i.e. go into the dungeon and find this thing for me).\n\nIf you're into dungeons that really challenge your brain full of intricate puzzles, you might be disappointed. From my perspective, though, having just finished SMT Nocturne, I was glad not to have the arbitrary trial and error nonsense puzzling of that game.\n\nI'm not a fan of fishing mini-games in most RPGs, and admittedly P4G did not do much to win me over to the sweaty angler mindset.\n\nThe bad:\nThere is not a scrap of \"bad\" in this thing.\n\nThe verdict:\nPersona 4 is full of contradictions.  It's wholesome yet bawdy.  Heartwarming and horrific.  Dark yet ultimately optimistic. I am now super-hyped to be saddling up for 5...", "timestamp_created": 1691749820, "timestamp_updated": 1691805034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143854442": {"recommendationid": "143854442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045814620", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 7437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6953, "last_played": 1691808035}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

There was more time to tighten up all my bonds with my companions and max out all of my Social Links and to eventually fight some big nasty boss but I decided to put the game down and step back.  My knee-jerk reaction is that Persona 4 Golden is one of the best RPGs I've played in the last few years.  I have never played any other Persona game or Shin Megami Tensei game.  I enjoyed the feeling of autonomy you get when controlling your character's actions within the time-blocks.  You essentially get one full school year broken up into after school and night time time-segments to pursue friendships, romantic relationships, folding cranes, translating things, or even part-time jobs like working in a hospital.  And all of your choices contribute to the overall story and make your character unique in his experience and interactions.\n\nIt felt a little drawn out with how many times we have to dive back into the TV to save people over and over and over again.  And there's 10 floors of randomly generated mobs and hazards with no save points so you have to goho-me and save each time and then restart from the 5th or 6th floor - depending on how far you got.\n\nI loved the story!  It's a teenaged-murder mystery that really engages its audience and makes you feel like you're in control of solving the murders.  The music was fantastic and the characters are unique and loveable and really heartwarming.  I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of JRPGs or Final Fantasy RPGs or just turn-based tactical RPGs in general.  The combat was a lot of fun and they make the rock-paper-scissor mechanic go very far.

Persona 5 Royal was my introduction to the franchise, but I enjoyed this game even more, which was not what I was expecting.\n\nIf you compare it to P5R on the surface level, the gameplay seems inferior. Dungeons are procedurally generated (like Mementos), there's no baton pass, no gun skills, and the battle UI isn't as nice. That might sound bad, but I got used to it after a few floors in the first dungeon, and it ultimately didn't affect my enjoyment of the game. On the plus side, this game didn't have any bs bosses (*cough* Okumura *cough*). Although, I do prefer the Shuffle Time mechanic in this game to shadow negotiation in P5. Obtaining new Personas is no longer a guessing game, and trying to get sweep bonuses at every opportunity is kind of addicting.\n\nThe graphics are also significantly inferior to P5R, but that's just because the base game was released on the PS2, which is more than two decades old at this point. Again, it didn't affect my enjoyment of the game.\n\nWhat really sold this game for me was the story, more specifically, the setting and characters. Inaba is the perfect setting for this game. The small town environment allows the characters to more easily develop bonds with each other in a way that feels genuine and organic. I really enjoyed all of the social links in this game and overall prefer them to those in P5.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack. P5 set the bar extremely high, so I thought it couldn't get any better. But it did. The only thing is that it's not as extensive as P5's, so it's not as varied. I swear, \"Like a dream come true\" plays for at least a quarter of the scenes in the game.\n\nMy only real complaint about this game?

I, as a person, am not drawn towards turn-based games and started P4Golden because of my incredibly positive experience in P5Royal. Overall, I really enjoyed the characters and story, but had a below average experience with the combat.\n\n  The combat in P4Golden I would describe as being a participant in a japanese game show where most of the time they just fuck with the contestant then play the funny noise whenever they get flustered.\n  A lot of the in-game combat encounters just left me annoyed with enemies with funny quirks as being heavily damage resistant to their own weaknesses, being resistant to literally everything, severely reducing damage taken from all-out-attacks, and having other enemies/themselves cast protection magic that block the only normal way of actually fighting them.\n\n  As for the characters, comparatively with my experience with the P5Royal cast, I found all the characters to be just as good, or better than the P5Royal cast as a result of being a little more well-rounded, except for the sidekick character, oh my god.\n  The story at times feels like going through the motions but often enough asks for the player to engage with it to keep me from losing interest.\n\n  In spite of my complaints, I feel I had an overall good experience with this game but feel like it might not be the best entry point for the series for anyone not into turn-based combat.\n\nI look forward to the release of Persona 3 Reload for my first experience with P3, partially because I've been told the version ported to steam is an inferior version of the game. Hopefully if that does well then there could be the possibility of a P4 remake of sorts to bring the game up to the quality to allow it to be just a fine entry point as P5 was.", "timestamp_created": 1690886750, "timestamp_updated": 1690886750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143195268": {"recommendationid": "143195268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872589145", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 14265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 150, "playtime_at_review": 13523, "last_played": 1700555370}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

This game is an absolute masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on my heart and soul. From the moment I first set foot in the fictional town of Inaba, I knew I was in for something extraordinary. Little did I realize that this immersive and emotionally charged experience would not only become my favorite game but also a reflection of my personal growth.\n\nA Captivating Story:\nAt its core, Persona 4 Golden is a captivating murder mystery wrapped in a high school simulator with supernatural elements. The narrative centers around a group of endearing characters who band together to investigate a series of mysterious murders plaguing the sleepy town of Inaba. As the protagonist, I was not merely a spectator; I was an active participant in shaping the outcome of this enthralling tale. The storytelling is gripping, seamlessly weaving themes of friendship, self-discovery, identity, and the shadows within us all.\n\nThe Power of Bonds:\nThe game brilliantly showcases the power of human connections. The bonds forged with the diverse cast of characters are at the heart of Persona 4 Golden's charm. Each character is so richly developed, with their struggles and insecurities, making them feel like real individuals. Through meaningful interactions, I learned valuable life lessons, empathy, and the importance of supporting one another during times of adversity. Witnessing these relationships evolve and grow was both heartwarming and emotionally impactful.\n\nThe Persona Fusion:\nThe gameplay mechanics are a brilliant blend of traditional turn-based combat and social simulation. The concept of \"Personas\" - manifestations of one's inner self - added depth to the battles and allowed for strategic planning. The thrill of collecting, fusing, and experimenting with different Personas was immensely satisfying, encouraging me to explore different playstyles and discover my strengths.\n\nA Living, Breathing World:\nInaba felt like a real place. The attention to detail in the world-building, the NPCs with their daily routines, and the seasonal changes contributed to the game's immersive nature. I enjoyed strolling through the shopping district, working part-time jobs, and establishing bonds with fellow students. It's rare to find a game that captures the essence of living in a small town so beautifully.\n\nEmotional Soundtrack:\nShoji Meguro's masterful compositions provided the perfect emotional backdrop for the entire experience. From upbeat battle themes to melancholic melodies, the music added another layer of depth to the game's storytelling. Even now, certain tracks evoke strong emotions and transport me back to my time in Inaba.\n\nImpact on My Life:\nPersona 4 Golden isn't just a game; it's a reflection of my personal growth. Through the characters' struggles and triumphs, I found solace in my journey of self-discovery. It taught me to confront my inner demons, accept myself for who I am, and cherish the friendships that make life meaningful. The game served as a beacon of hope during challenging times, reminding me that even in the darkest of days, there's always light waiting to be found.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPersona 4 Golden is an extraordinary RPG that has etched a permanent place in my heart. It represents the epitome of what gaming can achieve as an art form, blending captivating storytelling, deep gameplay mechanics, and a profound emotional impact. This game taught me the value of friendship, self-acceptance, and the beauty of forging bonds with others. To me, Persona 4 Golden is not just a game; it's a life-changing experience that will forever hold a special place in my heart.", "timestamp_created": 1690685077, "timestamp_updated": 1690685077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143055863": {"recommendationid": "143055863", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121331543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2411, "last_played": 1692330408}, "language": "english", "review": "Hanako is so fine\ud83e\udd24", "timestamp_created": 1690683296, "timestamp_updated": 1690683296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143050577": {"recommendationid": "143050577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148762966", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5290, "last_played": 1690649859}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Primer Persona que juego, y el primero en su genero.

It constantly requires reclearing and grinding to reach certain character levels, as bosses often outlevel you. While some dungeons offer respite with good music, I found myself try skipping encounters and solely focusing on defeating the Goldhands most of the time.\n\n[b]* Goldhands;[/b] whoever thought placing them near chests with hidden monsters in it near the end of corridors was a good idea, should just be shoved into the nearest TV.\n\n[b]* Triggers;[/b] for unlocking some dungeons, social links, romance options, and even endings are confusing and questionable, to say the least. Backtracking, waiting a day, talking to random NPCs with no apparent relation, and head-scratching dialogue choices are involved in some.\n\nWithout spoiling, two triggers that pissed me the most are\n\n1. \"I am glad you are a girl.\"\n\n2. Game itself openly tells you to go somewhere which can cause you to miss \"True\" ending if you do that.\n\n[b]* JRPG Tropefest;[/b] while common in JRPG's especially considering this game's target audience beign teenagers, it's infested with tropes, the way themes are served and directly told through heavy-handed metaphors feels anime-like and juvenile, which is a bit shame.

It's taxing over a journey that takes around 80-100 hours depending how much you want to complete the game. \n\nAside from that the game suffers from pacing issues like crazy, bouncing between serious murder mystery and \"let's fuck around and throw a concert\" and other such distractions. It's hard to get engaged in the plot when the game itself doesn't seem that interested in the plot, and drags it's heels with telling it. It's also a murder mystery where you can never really solve the TRUE mystery at hand, or even really discern the killer from the information the games gives you on your own (not to mention the wrench that the post-game content throws into your ability to figure out the killer). One of the \"Bad Endings\" of the games called the Accomplice Ending by fans that shows a very interesting what-if scenario, but the actual plot itself is lackluster. When it actually stays on track it feels very repetitive, of the same order of events happening with only a few changes. The game also chickens out so many times of there being dire consequences to dire situations, such as characters dying. It feels cheap and completely removes the idea that anything bad is actually going to happen. \n\nThe characters, like the plot, are another instance of a lot of potential wasted. So many of the main cast have interesting stories that their social links/general dialogue bring up but never resolve in an interesting or meaningful way.  Yosuke is especially homophobic/disparaging to non-traditionally male activities/hobbies or being perceived as not straight or into women and eager to prove he's a \"real man\", something the other male characters are not, and that is never resolved or explained. Many see him as a closeted gay character and while that makes sense as homosexual men tend to have a drive to be perceived as straight to avoid ridicule, the game never confirms this or even really hints towards it, so it exists solely in fan-cannon.  Basically all the characters like this example feel incomplete and don't do anything with the interesting premises of these characters, such as Naoto's gender/gender expression, Yukiko's family expectations, Rise and the model/idol industry in Japan/Asia as a whole. I enjoyed Kanji's character the most as he's just a dude who's comfortable with himself and learns to deal with his anger issues, I especially enjoy this character because he's into very non-traditionally masculine activities like knitting and when people point that out he's like \"so?\" I love the confidence. Chie has absolutely zero character but she's funny, Teddy is god awful, I hate his voice and all the words that come out of his mouth, Dojima has an interesting story exploring grief/guilt and single parenthood that I thought was the most interesting in the game, and Nanako is just adorable and sweet, always upbeat and positive and the way she bonds with the MC is very cute. Her resiliency in the face of a difficult upbringing is admirable and she serves as a great foil to Dojima's character. \n\nGameplay wise this game is great, incredibly similar to P3, but native party control which you only get in P3P is very nice. If you've played any persona game before it's nothing you haven't seen before. The UI is the same as P3 but yellow/gold instead of blue, so the game is easy to navigate. You can pretty easily get through this game on normal mode without excessive grinding, and there are no unfair or sharp difficulty spikes, with the exception of one boss towards the late parts of the mid-game that feels quite a bit harder than it should be, the early parts of the game being the hardest. In typical JRPG fashion, late game bosses are HP tanks, and will take a little while but are overall manageable. If you want to break the game or optimize, Shuffle Time is incredibly easy to break and become especially overpowered.\n\nThe music is the exceptionally good, and a highlight though it could do with more tracks, some get repetitive by the end.", "timestamp_created": 1690613585, "timestamp_updated": 1690613585, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.377198845148086548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142998865": {"recommendationid": "142998865", "author": {"steamid": "76561199108516069", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7057, "last_played": 1688610178}, "language": "english", "review": "I love pretending Adachi is my friend 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1690607328, "timestamp_updated": 1690607411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142991849": {"recommendationid": "142991849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010814521", "num_games_owned": 902, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5301, "last_played": 1690595999}, "language": "english", "review": "After almost 90 hours with this game start to finish, I have found it to be one of my favorite titles of all time.

chance, and now, after finishing it 2 times and is currently on my 3rd playthrough, I can say with total confidende that Persona 4 is one of the best games I've ever played;\nAs a casual player, this game is absolutely incredble, and it mixes the visual novel storytelling with rpg battles very nicely, I could even say there's stuff for both casual and hardcore players.\nMy favorite part of Persona 4, and main focus imo, gotta be the characters and social links. It's just so fun to spend time with your party members or other classmembers, and slowing learning about theirs hobbies, struggles, aspirations really gives each social link   its uniqueness and character depth.\nThe rpg battles are also very nice, (but repetive, as expected) you can toggle the difficulty as you wish, making it accessible for all skill levels!

There have been plenty arguments written by many before about P4 v P5 (and P3) comparisons, such as better cast chemistry in P4, much better QoL features in P5 (which the mod helped alleviate somewhat), massive upgrade in dungeon design in P5, way more things to do in P5, and many other points favoring P5. Understandably, these points are expected improvements given the fact that it is a newer installment to the franchise, so I'd like to shift focus into the more timeless aspects of these titles:\n\nPersona's plot writing has never been its party piece, and it's no different in Persona 4. It's decent, shortly put. But what Persona consistently delivers is its message, a commentary of society's flaws, using concepts derived from Jungian psychology as its medium to deliver that message, while also doubling as the device to break through the latches of those flaws. Examining P4 and P5 closer, P5 takes an approach of antagonizing individuals that have negatively affected one of the party members, while also representing one of the seven deadly sins on the side. In P4's case, the antagonists are[spoiler]themselves, i.e. each of the party members, in fighting an alter ego shaped by the individual's incompatibility with society[/spoiler]. I find P4's ideas to be far more interesting than what is being done in P5, taking a more introspective look into the problems of society, which I appreciate better than identifying \"bad seeds\" in society and taking them out. In a more practical sense, P4's approach facilitates an easy way to add depth, development, and dimension to the party members, whom you will be interacting with for the entire game.\n\nWhat makes P4 outstanding to me however, is not this inwards-looking approach to solve problems mentioned above per se, but its ability to continuously reinforce the themes that make up P4. This idea of \"thematic coherence\" is something that I am particularly fond of when I examine works, and I think P4 is one of them that excels in this regard. The idea of \"incompatibilities with society\" is turned into conflict points in the main plot, resolved with them accepting their weaknesses, and this is then further expanded in the party member's S.Links as they try to overcome those said weaknesses. The narrative likes to emphasize the importance of your bonds, as it is the norm with Persona titles. But P4 feels particularly on-the-nose about this, as I recall a certain scene in early December where the narration drives this point home after reading text messages from concerned friends shortly after a tragedy. This coherence runs through the finer details as well: P4 sets up a very thematically matching final boss, and is the only one that manages to fit in a quick course on the mythology behind the main persona (Izanagi) and the definition of Persona and Shadow according to Jungian psychology (The extra Classroom TV episodes are very informative and fascinating, I highly recommend giving it a read to anyone who's interested in psychology).\n\nIn short, the thematic coherence in P4 is the strongest among the three, setting it apart from the other titles.\n\nI would like to praise the great localization work Atlus has done for the Persona titles as a final note. One full playthrough in JP gave me direct confirmation of the quality of translation and voice acting work in place of the source material. Though there are some EN voices that irritate me to no end (Chie), the quality is far better than many subpar dubs I've heard in other works. Here's my opinion of which version of the cast's voices I prefer, to conclude this piece:\n\n-Yosuke: EN > JP\n-Chie: JP > EN\n-Yukiko: JP >= EN\n-Kanji: EN > JP\n-Rise: EN > JP\n-Teddie: EN > JP\n-Naoto: JP >= EN\n-Nanako: JP > EN\n-Dojima: JP = EN", "timestamp_created": 1690300035, "timestamp_updated": 1690369999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142761193": {"recommendationid": "142761193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092077785", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 3817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2857, "last_played": 1690387893}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of fun and game was longer than what I expected!

Several of them have really deep emotional impacts, especially Nanako.\n\nWhy then would I not recommend it?\n\nHomophobia.\n\nIn the middle of the story the game delved into full-blown homophobia without either resolving it or questioning it. All the nuances about two different characters' sexuality and gender identity went down the drain for cheap comic reliefs. The writing was disturbing, disappointing and hurtful.\n\nI want to clarify that I don't want to pin this to the in-game characters, but the writer of the game. I get that they wanted to convey immaturity of the adolescence, while trying to be funny. But this is done at the expense of queer identity, at the expense of a topic that needed sensitivity, especially in East Asia. It's \"funny\" to the perceived player base, because the writers never considered how these homophobic scenes would impact queer players, who in real life have probably dealt with similar frustrating situations. Queer players remained outsiders for the writers of the game.\n\nIf you find it a minor issue, or even a non-issue, good for you. Please enjoy the game. But I wish to convey how much of this attitude of poking fun at the queer identity has negatively colored the game for me.

It's the most comedy-driven of the 3 available Persona games (3P-5R), while still maintaining an intriguing murder mystery plot. A very small (and kind of optional) portion of the content added in Golden may be a drag, but with that aside, the additions are pretty decent. It also streamlined the battle system, in comparison to 3, which made it a bit more complicated than it should've been (which 5 improved upon). The soundtrack of this game is also pretty good, and worth the 30$ I spent to own it on CD. Tracks like Long Way (Magatsu Inaba/Mandala), SNOWFLAKES, Your Affection, and Reach Out to the Truth are worth a listen, on their own. The cast (the Investigation Team) also feels like it has a better dynamic, in comparison to 5's Phantom Thieves, in which everyone in the Investigation Team feels like they're all friends with each other, compared to the Phantom Thieves, in which all the members (excluding maybe a few) are just mutually friends with Joker. The social links are also very interesting, like Rise's, in which she deals with leaving showbiz, Yukiko not wanting to inherit her inn (and coming to terms with it), Yosuke's grief over Saki, Dojima trying to connect with his daughter (while also trying to solve the unsolved case regarding his late wife), etc.\n\nAs for the negatives, there were some, like Marie's (optional, unless you want the true ending) dungeon, how long Shadow Mitsuo's boss fight drags out for a bit too long, and how generic the battle UI was, in-between 3's revolver based UI and 5's clean (and streamlined) UI. Those 3 aside, I can't remember that many other bones I had to pick, that aren't really divisive.\n\nThis game was an overall fun experience and a roller coaster of emotions and comedy, which I enjoyed, the whole way through. I loved about all this game had to offer, till the very end.\n\n\n\nalso, tomboys you can date, automatic 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1689825398, "timestamp_updated": 1689825398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142435457": {"recommendationid": "142435457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108159713", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6973, "last_played": 1685738881}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a great representative for the bisexual community.

This game had me completely captivated from start to finish, and it's an experience that I will cherish for a long time.\n\nFirst and foremost, the story of Persona 4 Golden is compelling and expertly crafted. It revolves around a group of high school students investigating a series of mysterious murders in a rural town. The blend of supernatural elements with real-world issues creates a unique and immersive narrative that kept me hooked throughout the entire game. The characters are well-developed and have their own personal struggles, making them relatable and endearing. The bonds you forge with them feel genuine and have a profound impact on the overall story.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics in Persona 4 Golden are deep and addictive. The core of the game revolves around balancing your school life, social interactions, and dungeon exploration. During the day, you attend classes, build relationships with your classmates, and explore the town. At night, you dive into the TV World, a dungeon filled with shadows, where you engage in turn-based battles. The combat system is strategic and satisfying, allowing you to exploit enemy weaknesses and unleash devastating attacks. The Persona fusion system, which lets you combine and create new Personas, adds an extra layer of depth and customization.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Persona 4 Golden is its incredible soundtrack. The music perfectly complements the game's atmosphere and enhances every moment. Whether it's the catchy battle themes or the poignant melodies during emotional scenes, the soundtrack is simply outstanding.\n\nThe graphics and art style in Persona 4 Golden may not be cutting-edge by today's standards, but they have a unique charm that still holds up well. The character designs are vibrant and memorable, and the animated cutscenes are a visual treat.

I was very intrigued about the concept of facing your Shadows of the story. I thought \"This seems like a game I would really like, I'll buy it when I have money from having a job as a responsible adult\".\nFast forward to March 2023, I was pretty stressed out. My grandmother just passed away, my crush rejected me for the Nth time and I still couldn't overcome my crippling anxiety to get a job. I was on the verge of a breakdown. For some reason, I was reminded of this game. So I bought a game for the first time.\nMaybe it was because I had been spoiled but I won't lie the main story wasn't a masterpiece or anything. For a murder mystery, it was heavily bogged down by copious amount of slice-of-life scenes. BUT those ARE what made P4 truly shines. It's the wacky but endearing characters that you spend time talking to.\nThe cozy small town setting that you can run around just singing along to the catchy BGM.\nThe ability to do so many things at your own pace (which can be daunting at first but you'll get used to it).\nThe combat, eh that one could be better. Not really a fan of the auto-generated dungeons, it's a bit grindy. I'm not great at strategy games either for the hard battles and fusing mechanics. But if that's your thing, you do you! :D\n\n--- Spoilers about some social links ---\nAs I hanged out to talk to:\n+ Grandma Death about [spoiler] dementia [/spoiler]\n+ Ai about her [spoiler] inability to love herself [/spoiler]\n+ Naoto about [spoiler] not being afraid to change [/spoiler]\n+ Nanako about her [spoiler] loneliness [/spoiler]\n+ Rise and Teddie about [spoiler] not knowing who they are [/spoiler]\n+ Yosuke about his [spoiler] unfulfilled feelings towards his crush [/spoiler]\n+ Kanji about [spoiler] wanting to be accepted for who he is [/spoiler]\n+ Naoki about [spoiler] processing his grief [/spoiler]\nI felt I was indirectly comforting myself. I suppose in the end, I can't say that Persona 4 makes me a better person. But it was there for me when I needed it. The 2 months I spent playing this game to hang out with these fictional friends and family was precious. Thank you Persona 4 Golden. Here's to hoping I can one day afford to play P5R too. (I'm waiting to play the P3R remake before P3P).\n\nP.S: I have recently started learning piano [spoiler] like Nanako at the epilogue [/spoiler]. Not exactly because of her, but I guess it's just one of those things where life slowly warms you up to an idea overtime.\nP.P.S: Naoto and Ai are my top girls, but ultimately I have to choose Naoto as my bae.

As the stage of the whole case, the *Yasoinabashi* town owns the same weird but warm vibe as the *Twin Peak town* which is known as the classical TV series by David Lynch and it\u2019s more possibly a tribute to this show. The story began with a murder case same as the show, and this classical theme seems always fascinating. \n\nP4G added a weather system to replace the moon phase system in P3 as the key to promoting the plot. The innovative settings of midnight TV and fog made the story more strange but interesting. Its essence is to reflect people's desire to peek into the inner world of a specific character and will parody the way to produce people's thoughts about the character's character style and ambiguous scenes. The character's appearance on midnight TV was sharply different from the real world.\n\nThe music was also in charge of Sh\u014dji same as P3. The original soundtrack of the Golden edition adds a lot of new tracks based on the \u201908 album, especially the tracks of fight and hang out made me love so bad.\n\nThese lifeful characters constitute the core part of the whole story without a doubt, the daily, affection, and community parts were the funniest for me as the tradition of the Persona series. It seems to me that Chie is the best girl among all the kids and she made me feel relaxed and funny every time I get along with her.\n\nAs the enhanced edition of the \u201908 game first sold on PS2, besides the quirky twist story and all distinctive characters, the actual graphics are obviously out of step with the current trends and the action of characters sometimes looks slightly awkward, but this nostalgic vibe precisely fits the story optimally.", "timestamp_created": 1689503398, "timestamp_updated": 1689506856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674298465251922607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142188997": {"recommendationid": "142188997", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125599237", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 903, "last_played": 1691677122}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best jrpg", "timestamp_created": 1689501155, "timestamp_updated": 1689501155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142183088": {"recommendationid": "142183088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198811518598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3938, "last_played": 1689972786}, "language": "english", "review": "Very, VERY good game. 9/10.

The best entry point into Persona as a franchise, but definitely not the best Persona game.\n\nGeneral thoughts: Persona 4 Golden is good game, its a good Persona game, but it's dramatically over-hyped. I enjoyed my time with persona 4, but i found it considerably lacking compared to its successor. If you're like me, you're here because you heard a lot of people say its the best entry in the entire series; its not. Despite having a main character and important side character voiced by Ichigo Kurosaki/ Lelouch Vi Britannia, i found the game lacking in a lot of the personality and flair that other persona games have. Lets talk about it.\n\nGameplay:\nPersona 4's gameplay is classic SMT gameplay. 4 member party, turned based, elemental weaknesses, and a 1-more system. Enjoyable, fairly easy, and familiar if you've played a party-based RPG before. The gameplay is nothing special though, and becomes exceptionally repetitive after your 3rd or 4th dungeon.\n\nThe social link system is also present, and that is executed very well in Persona 4. The bonds are well done, with some feeling awfully rushed towards their highest ranks, but otherwise provide good characterization and gameplay benefits (though not on the level of Persona 5's confidant system). Coming to 4 after playing 5 will make you hunger for a bit more.\n\nMinigames are here too, with fishing being the one you'll likely engage in the most as well as bug catching and farming. You will want to rip your ears out after hearing \"Great Vegetables\" for the 100th time though.\n\nLastly, there are no save-points in the actual dungeons themselves. An inconvenience that can be fixed if you're willing to mod the game, though.\n\nGraphics:\nThis is a game from 2008, it looks like its from 2008. Not ugly, but certainly dated.\n\nAudio:\nNormally a strong-point for Persona games, I genuinely dislike most of Persona 4's soundtrack. It is super pop-heavy, and the higher tones that are generally present throughout gave me ear fatigue. That said, there are of course a few exceptional tracks here. Studio Backlot and Heaven come to mind. I found the battle themes lacking and the same can be said for the overworld tracks as well, Snowflakes being the lone exception the that trend.\n\nAudience:\nWell, there's a lot of provocative stuff in this game so i'd say if you're not 18 or older you should get your parent's permission. Rise's dungeon, particularly that boss fight is..... sensual. 18+ for sure.\n\nDifficulty:\nPersona 4 is not a hard game, but it does require a bit of grinding. Fairly easy overall, especially once you get the hang of party composition and managing your own personas.\n\nStory:\nPersona 4 tells a great story, but the true ending is kind of out of left field. I'm trying to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, so I won't go into many details. The story is well written, good characters and villains, but just... a kinda random true ending.\n\nCharacters:\nThe selling point for any Persona game is the cast of characters. For this section, I will refer to the characters by their Arcana to avoid spoilers. There are a few great characters here, like the Emperor and Fortune characters in particular. I do find some characters overly annoying, however, like the Lovers and Star characters. Star in particular has voice acting that is painful for me to listen to. Chariot is hit or miss as is Magician. Some of their social link stories are also very well done, Moon in particular has an incredibly satisfying development.\n\nIf that made no sense to you, characters that you form bonds with are classified by an \"Arcana\" and having a persona of that \"Arcana\" or type when interacting with them yields more progress towards your bond. The higher a bond level, the more powerful the personas of that type you can create.\n\nGametime:\nIt took me roughly 60 hours to 100% this game, but I was moving at a lightning pace. If you're unfamiliar with this game, 60 hours is probably the runtime for a full playthrough. It has replayability in the sense of an added super-boss and a standard NG+ identity.\n\nComparison to Persona 5 Royal:\nSeeing as Persona 5 Royal is the most popular Persona game, I'm writing this section for people who have played Persona 5 and are considering Persona 4. A few major differences to note here. The combat in Persona 4 feels much less dynamic. There are no technicals, there are no baton passes, and there is no mid-battle party shuffling.\n\nPersonally, i think Persona 5's cast is also better. Don't get me wrong, Persona 4 has Ichigo/Lelouch as a main character with Rei Ayanami, Spiderman, Rakshata Chawla/Chun-Li, Phoenix Wright, and Batman/Pagan Min as the other main voice actors but their development feels uneven. Persona 5 suffers a similar problem with some of its characters as well, but those felt like the exception while rushed character development feels like the norm in Persona 4.\n\nThe biggest difference for me though is the quality of the soundtracks. I know music is by far the most subjective thing in this review, but Persona 5's jazz theme accentuated by the game's striking visuals made it feel like it had so much more character than Persona 4. Inaba is a great setting, but I think not having any of the vendors be confidants/social links made the city feel more distant than it should have considering it's meant to have a small-town vibe and yet i felt more connected to Tokyo in P5.\n\nPersona 5 is a better game than Persona 4 is, and Persona 5 certainly has better final bosses than 4.\n\nI'd recommend grabbing this on sale for $15 or cheaper if you're interested, its a good game. Just not great. 7.5/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1689064906, "timestamp_updated": 1689064906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524844765663146973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141814828": {"recommendationid": "141814828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024411904", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_at_review": 10060, "last_played": 1699756722}, "language": "english", "review": "It's simply the best.

The persona series is renowned for its extremely good story telling, and Persona 4 is probably the best of bunch in this regard. The game does suffer from a dated combat system and more grind than you would expect to find in a modern game. However, the later problem can be solved with the provided difficulty options (I recommend setting the difficulty hard, but also giving yourself bonus XP and money). The combat system is a bit of a drag, although it is certainly passable rather than bad, and the story you experience along the way more than make up for it. \n\nI would say that if you have never played a Persona game before you should certainly get 5 before 4, as that offers a much more well rounded experience, but 4 is an extremely good game should you find yourself wanting more. I also found that a controller was almost essential, as the game was quite tricky to play on a mouse and keyboard.

Enemy repetition is also a problem, by the time you are on the last third of the game you will be tired of seeing the same enemies over and over again. \n\nThe battle music, while great and catchy at first, also gets tiring due to hay many times you are going to hear the same few loud vocal themes over and over again throughout the game.\n\nAnd finally, there are some problems when it comes to balancing, with some weird difficulty spikes in the middle of the game that force you to grind and an ending stretch that is way too easy with how overpowered you can get in those last few months of the game with minimal effort.\n\nBut while those are big problems for a lengthy jrpg, Persona 4 Golden not only has good qualities to balance this out but also has something that a lot of games lack: SOUL.\n\nWhen it comes to its good qualities, the design of the UI is stylish, the music is fantastic (even though, as I said earlier they could have used more variety for the battle themes), the art direction and backgrounds are strong, and the combat system is solid.\n\nBut as I mentioned above, SOUL is what makes this game shine, and that soul is found in its story.\n\nThe plot is a well-written and satisfying mystery that constantly keeps you on edge with its many turns and revelations (especially in the last third of the game). \n\nThe theme of truth is thoroughly explored, first delving deep into how the nature of society transforms reality, the media, repression, and identity and then masterfully tying all of those topics up by the end by reflecting on the desire and need for lies at the core of the human heart. And yet despite how fucking pretentious all of this sounds the messages delivered after exploring these topics feel honest and are presented in such a humble way that they come off as something beautiful.\n\nAnd finally, its main characters are beyond excellent. The dynamics between characters as well as the group dynamic are fantastic, you could put these characters in any situation and it would be entertaining. Furthermore, all of them have lively personalities, are well fleshed out, feel rounded, and go through interesting and meaningful character arcs.\n\nBy the way congratulations to the English voice actors since they delivered some of the best performances that I have heard in a dub of a Japanese property.\n\nThe story as a whole has some incredible moments with all its elements working together to create heart-touching, powerful, memorable, cute, and meaningful scenes. Honestly, to see a story in any medium where you can feel that the writers are trying to convey and present something special is rare, but this is one of those stories.\n\nTo conclude, while its flaws aren\u2019t easy to overlook, the positives way outnumber the negatives. In fact, the game story in particular has a unique charm of its own that makes it feel special, and while playing it you can see why so many have fallen in love with this entry in the franchise in particular and why it's a favorite game for so many. \n\nI definitely recommend it.\n\n\n[h1]-Final score: 9,3-[/h1]\n\n\nI completed the game on normal difficulty and I got the Golden ending (completing the optional dungeon as well). I maxed out a lot of the social links.

It has an excellent story with a mostly well-written cast, solid mechanical depth, and plenty of interplay between the time management simulation and the dungeon crawling. However, this particular version has changes from the PS2 original that I logged hundreds of hours in. There's an entirely new section of story gated off behind link progress on new characters, and your enjoyment of the game's final hours will largely hinge on how you like Marie and Adachi's links if you are a returning player, as well as the voice cast changes to Teddie and Chie. I personally greatly preferred the original Chie VA, so the new voice takes a lot of getting used to. Teddie's change is barely noticeable, however. \n\nI haven't personally played the endgame content, but I'm currently working on a new play-through and will be getting to those bits of the game soon. I'll update this review with further thoughts on that as soon as possible. But overall, if you want to get sold on RPGs as a genre, Persona 4 makes a persuasive argument for the genre as a whole.\n\nAdded note: I've been primarily playing on Steam Deck, and my experience has been overall quite stable, save for my Deck's personal quirk of randomly shutting off sometimes. Some art gets a bit jaggy looking in the distance at the deck's native resolution, like social link notification \"!\" boxes.

Amo el enfoque de que en vez de ser un grupo de amigos salvando el mundo (Un poco clich\u00e9) Sea un grupo de amigos resolviendo una serie de asesinatos en un pueblo remoto como lo es Inaba. \n9/10, le daria un 10, sin embargo, ac\u00e1 van razones por las cuales me gusta tanto y un par de cosas malas.\nEl pacing mejor\u00f3 demasiado, si, las dungeons personalizadas son muy buenas, sin embargo, es horriblemente tedioso llegar a ellas. Por alguna raz\u00f3n, para algunas dungeons tienes que hacer una investigaci\u00f3n antes, la cual permite al navegador de turno encontrar a la persona que buscan, esta investigaci\u00f3n es horrible y bastante tediosa, lo cual tambi\u00e9n la hace aburrida. El cast de personajes es muy diverso, amo varios de ellos, me gusta el detalle de que para aprender mas de ciertos personajes tengas que hacer su social link, le da mas importancia a los mismos, mucha gente se queja de que es todo muy \"Somos los mejores amigos por siempre!\" y comparando eso con Persona 3, pero me parece algo estupido, aqui no es algo tan exagerado como salvar el mundo(A ver, casi, pero no dir\u00e9 mas porque es spoiler del final verdadero), me parece lindo como este juego le da un enfoque mas detallado sobre las relaciones y las amistades, alguien como yo(un antisocial de mierda) agradece, el antagonista principal es bastante carismatico a decir verdad, me encanta tanto como antagonista y como personaje, es simplemente increible. Es muy alegre, recibir una experiencia asi de agradable luego de un juego tan oscuro y triste como lo es Persona 3 es bastante agradable. \n\u00bfRecomendado?, definitivamente, es muuy bueno, pero hay

Golden epilogue was really nice coming from P3.\nMain cast is great. Dynamics greatly contribute to the lighter tone of the game and helps to build contrast for story climax. True culprit is a great character and villian.\nVisuals are good. Overworld was kinda ruined by Golden because they broke a lot of visual effects, but TV World still looks great. Shared stylization with TV static and scanline effect is really cool. Dungeon visuals are good, Magatsu Inaba is especially great.\nOverall gameplay is good. Game having party control and being balanced around it is good. Smaller gameplay improvements compared to P3 are all good.\nInaba as a setting was interesting. Refreshing change from urban setting of P3 and P5. Also liked commentary on japanese rural decay.\n \nI didn't like mostly 2 things:\nDungeon \"level design\" sucks. I hated long hallways, tartarus generated floors were unironically better. And backtracking sucks too.\nHollow Forest gimmicks were annoying as fuck.

For example, Yosuke may seem like a jerk at first, but he becomes more good as you get to know him. however, at just 20 dollars, Persona 4 is definitely a great deal.", "timestamp_created": 1687018683, "timestamp_updated": 1687642593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140223329": {"recommendationid": "140223329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176927217", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4841, "last_played": 1692848096}, "language": "english", "review": "i cant believe nanako was the killer", "timestamp_created": 1687016518, "timestamp_updated": 1687056932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140220633": {"recommendationid": "140220633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198935092016", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 6430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6430, "last_played": 1687012490}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy bonito remake de Diamond is Unbreakable", "timestamp_created": 1687013532, "timestamp_updated": 1687013532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498421281576156616", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140219604": {"recommendationid": "140219604", "author": {"steamid": "76561199371685870", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2000, "last_played": 1697233280}, "language": "english", "review": "yosuke will never have children", "timestamp_created": 1687012365, "timestamp_updated": 1687012365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140217703": {"recommendationid": "140217703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857880107", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5902, "last_played": 1683509849}, "language": "english", "review": "If this game looks remotely interesting, buy it, it will be the best 20$ you have ever spent.

It's rare to find a game that is able to combine an array of genres so skillfully, but this title does exactly that.\n\nAt its core, Persona 4 Golden is an RPG. But it also masterfully incorporates elements of life simulation and monster-battling games, making it a unique standout in the crowded gaming world. It's the perfect fusion of Japanese high school life and mystical dungeon crawling that makes Persona 4 Golden a distinct experience.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the game is the interesting blend of high school student life in Japan with the pokemon style stat raising. I enjoyed managing my time and choosing which activities to do each day, as well as building relationships with different characters. I also liked the fusion system that allows you to create new Personas by combining two or more existing ones. It was satisfying to experiment with different combinations and see what skills they inherited.\n\nHowever, the game also has some drawbacks. One of them that is especially hard for me is that it can be very challenging to make choices, especially when they have consequences for the story and the relationships. Sometimes I felt overwhelmed by the options and the pressure to do everything right. I had to plan carefully and save often, otherwise I might miss out on some events or endings.\n\nOverall, Persona 4 Golden is one of my favorite games. It has a unique and interesting blend of genres and themes that kept me engaged and entertained for hours. I would recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs, mystery, and slice-of-life.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1686889374, "timestamp_updated": 1686889374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140138735": {"recommendationid": "140138735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372882846", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4975, "last_played": 1692407224}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 game.

I thought \"well, they probably just ramped it up in 5, while this one is rather average.\"\n\nWell, I'm happy to say that I was wrong.\n\nSee, persona 4 may not have p5's insane palaces or the phantom thief swag, HOWEVER, it does have loads and loads of heart. With a spectacular OST, a cast of adorkable friends, the loveliness of the small town Inaba, and the absolute cinnamon roll that is Nanako.\n\nFurthermore, the slice of life events and the whole group dynamic here is even better than 5. The phantom thieves are great as a fighting team, and I mostly prefer them as individuals. But as a group of friends that hang out together, joke around and make you smile with them? The group here takes the cake. If p5's focused on being rebellious and cool, this one is about happiness and friendship, and it shows.\n\nThe story is complex, intriguing, and the theme of truth really resonates with the twist and turns of the plot.\nYou want to go in blind, and you want to have multiple save files. Believe me, getting the true, full, best ending is an amazing experience. When I was finally done, I felt like someone put a sun in my heart. \"Wholesome\" is an understatement.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, and give this game a try.\nThere's a good chance it will make you happier.", "timestamp_created": 1686679740, "timestamp_updated": 1686679740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true,

I make this statement up front knowing the complaints I am going to levy against it later, but in my heart of hearts, despite these complaints, I cannot say I did not enjoy my time with the game.\n\nThe game is old, having initially being released in 2008, the gold edition coming 4 years later in 2012.  To expect such a game to have all the bells and whistles would be unfair on it.  A large part of this lies with me.  Having seen that the Persona franchise allows for one to play more up-to-date titles without missing much from the previous games, I decided to start with Persona 5.  This with the benefit of hindsight was a mistake.  By doing this comparison to the previous titles would be unavoidable, and indeed that is what happened.\nI do not want this to come off as a pure dump on the game, however.  From a story and character perspective I believe that 4 may very well exceed 5.  The characters for the most part being grounded with interesting quirks and an enjoyable group dynamic never failed to make me smile when they all got together.  Even some of the, what could be considered, side characters had some of the most interesting character concepts I could think of.\n\nIn terms of story, having seen the initial twist during a friend of mines run-through meant I was not surprised when it inevitably happened in mine.  My friend however never having known of or going for the \u201cTrue\u201d ending meant I was in for a big surprise when I stumbled upon it myself.\n\nMy main issue with the game is unfortunately the \u201cgame\u201d aspect of it itself.  The dungeon running and battle system is very dated and so I find myself wondering, would the game be better if it stuck to the visual novel aspects of the story and characters, while removing the more grindy elements?  A older fan would probably say no, and even I struggle to hold up that idea.  The story in part works because of those grindy elements.\n\nIf you are looking to pick up the Persona series and you are looking to determine which one to start with, I would say do not go in reverse order like I have now committed to.  It will invite unfair comparisons which will only make you frustrated.  Start with this one (or Persona 3, which I still need to get to) and go from there.\n\nPros:\n\u2022\tInteresting dynamic characters with some of the most interesting and thought-provoking concepts I \n        have seen in a long time.\n\u2022\tA story with a lot of twists and turns which will keep you interested and invested until the end.\n\nCons:\n\u2022\tAn unfortunately outdated combat system that will descend into heavy grinding if you want to max out \n        or having to keep the difficulty low to abuse the increase in experience gain.\n", "timestamp_created": 1686206807, "timestamp_updated": 1686206807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139712929": {"recommendationid": "139712929", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031735097", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8434, "last_played": 1686184188}, "language": "spanish", "review": "mejor que tener vida social", "timestamp_created": 1686184249, "timestamp_updated": 1686184249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139712474": {"recommendationid": "139712474", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970719002", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 939, "last_played": 1690604818}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very much a vibe game.

during your normal daily life progress the game time (After school/Evening/Sleep)\nAnd you have less than one year (ingame) time to avoid the end of the world.\nIn that time you care for social contacts, go to high school and do all kind of activities.\nOn top of that you also beat dungeons and level your characters. \n\nThe difficult is generally higher when you are used to final fantasy, still not as punishing as main series \nShin Megami Tensei titles but still not super casual.\nBasically the enemies can use the so called \"press turn system\" (when you or the enemy attack a weakness you and them can attack again.) just like your own characters. \nBut if you have fun with a little more challenging content the game is gonna be a blast for you.", "timestamp_created":

You have to actually avoid enemies or just run away. This may not seem big, but I think it affects the gameplay a lot.\n3. You don't capture or negotiate with Shadows. Rather, there is a random card game that can get you money, exp, Personas, skill cards, etc. The game will explain it to you better.\n4. Just in general, I think some of the scaling is a little different. I definitely find it harder than Persona 5.\n\nOverall, I think it's a fun game and I'd recommend it, but just know that there are some differences between this and P5R.

If one doesn't catch your eye, others are bound to whether it's by design, personality, or anything else.\n- Engaging story that's extremely interesting so far. It will leave you excited and wanting to play more to figure out what's happening.\n- Charming Graphics. Even though they are old, the still hold up for their time, at least character model wise.\n- Character voices. Some characters like Yosuke, Adachi, and Dojima for example give great voiced performances that are fun and investing to watch. (this point is also continued in cons.)\n- Great for those who love dungeon crawlers akin to games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon as ever level in the TV world is set up as a dungeon crawler where each level changes layout randomly.\n\ncons:\n- Voice... again. While other voice acting performances are great, others give performances that are just okay or... for lack of a better term, entirely unconvincing. Chie's voice actor talks like she's talking at the screen and not to and with other characters.\n- Inconsistent in it's overall tone and morals at times. The main moral of P4 is that you should be free to be who you want to be and have your own freedom to choose so. The character Kanji is a prime example of this con. His sexuality is left ambiguous, but it is implied he's queer. Giving him the freedom to be unlabeled is fine, and even a great a choice I think! But in writing his back story, the only reason he ever questioned it was because he thought women were too mean because they called him gay or made fun of his feminine hobbies which led to him only being around men and made him question his interests in romance... Implying your only queer character is queer because they were possibly 'confused' or pushed into it by others being cruel has... absolutely reductive implications that are rooted in the very stereotypes they were trying to avoid. In a later scene, there is an entire joke around the idea of this character committing sexual assault just because he is queer. Persona has never really been good at following the own morals they set though, so I'm not really surprised. \n- Very outdated humor. Something I wont hold against the game entirely as it's a product of it's time, but something to watch out for if you're upset or sensitive to this.

easy to root for, and P4G certainly manages that with ease, which is exactly why its disappointing when the game completely botches the landing on most of their arcs, Yosuke is a straight up asshole to most of his friends especially Kanji, and is a downright creep in a lot of his interactions with others, Kanji and Naoto's arcs are so poorly handled its laughable, completely mishandling the struggle with sexuality and gender identity, Persona never managed to stick the landing for these types of characters (Yusuke in P5) but its especially egregious in Naoto and Kanji's cases",

base de la tarta\n\n125 g de harina de reposter\u00eda\n100 g de az\u00facar\n75 g de almendra molida\n100 g de mantequilla fr\u00eda\n1 huevo para pincelar la masa\n\nPara la crema de mandarina\n\n100 g de az\u00facar\nLa piel de 2 mandarinas\n350 g de agua\n150 g de zumo de mandarina\n3 yemas de huevo\n50 g de maicena\n\nPara terminar tu tarta\n\n3 mandarinas (depende del tama\u00f1o)\n1 cucharada de mantequilla\n2 cucharada de mermelada de naranja\n\nPuedes prorratear los ingredientes a otras cantidades usando nuestra calculadora\nPreparaci\u00f3n\n\nDisponible tambi\u00e9n:\n\nPara Cook Expert\nPara Thermomix\n\nElaboraci\u00f3n de la masa\n\nCorta la mantequilla en peque\u00f1os dados.\nPon todos los ingredientes menos el huevo en un cuenco. Mezcla, pero sin trabajar mucho la masa, lo justo para que se unan los ingredientes.\nHaz una bola y apl\u00e1nala un poco. M\u00e9tela media hora en el frigor\u00edfico envuelta en pl\u00e1stico transparente.\nExtiende la masa sobre un trozo de pl\u00e1stico transparente, c\u00fabrela con otro y apl\u00e1nala con un rodillo.\nEngrasa la base del molde. F\u00f3rralo con la masa. Retira la masa restante con los propios dedos. La masa es arenosa y delicada. Lee los consejos porque te doy otras dos opciones de masa m\u00e1s sencillas, por si no te atreves con \u00e9sta.\nPincela la superficie con huevo batido y pincha toda la masa con un tenedor.\nMete en el frigor\u00edfico durante 5 minutos.\nPrecalienta el horno a 200\u00baC, calor arriba y abajo.\nBaja la temperatura a 180\u00baC y hornea unos 15 minutos.\n\nElaboraci\u00f3n de la crema\n\nLava bien las mandarinas y ralla su piel. Reserva. Haz zumo con ellas y reserva igualmente.\nPon el agua, el zumo de mandarina, las yemas, la maicena, el az\u00facar y la ralladura en un cazo. Ponlo a fuego medio y no dejes de remover hasta que espese, aproximadamente de unos 8 a 10 minutos. Reserva hasta que enfr\u00ede poniendo un pl\u00e1stico transparente tocando la superficie de la crema para que no cree costra.\n\nPara terminar\n\nPela las mandarinas que van a cubrir la tarta, quitando bien toda la parte blanca. C\u00f3rtalas en rodajas.\nPon la cucharada de mantequilla en una sart\u00e9n antiadherente a fuego medio y pasa las rodajas de mandarina uno segundos por cada lado. De esta manera quedan un poco blanditas y con un sabor delicioso.\nVierte la crema sobre la base y exti\u00e9ndela ayud\u00e1ndote de una esp\u00e1tula. Reparte las mandarinas como ves en la foto.\nCalienta la mermelada unos segundos en el microondas, cu\u00e9lala en un colador y pincela tu tarta.

But that isn't the issue I have with it. I mainly picked it up because of all the good things I've heard about the series.\n\nEven though it was not originally for PC. This is one of those games that need an extended period for a refund. Because, my god, the beginning takes sooooo long. It feels like 80% dialog. By the time you can move around freely and you have took your time letting the voice acting (which is pretty good for its time) play out. You have reached at least 1 hour of game time. Maybe 1.5 hours. If you care about your refund window. You will want to demo this somehow before paying for it.\n\nThe music is so GD repetitive and uncreative. The budget clearly went into the anime cut scene art. The art is everything you'd expect from anime from 2012. So they nailed it there. With the 4th iteration of the series you'd think they would have had a larger budget. When I continue playing next time the music is going off. \n\nSome of the combat mechanics make little to no sense. Rushing (when all of them attack at once, I can't remember term exactly at the time of writing this) does laughably little damage. It feels like it was just added in for the lolz. Because when you attack separately. You can literally do 3-4x the damage compared to when they attack at once.\nAlso, why do your characters surround the enemy all the time? Outside of battle your position matters *a lot*. So why are your characters magically surrounding them. All it does it make the battlefield seem messy (yes, irl combat is messy but its a video game...) and makes the camera fly around a lot.\n\nCombining Personas and the Personas themselves doesn't make much sense either. They have seemingly random skills. You would expect them to say, for example, the pixie and angel to be healing and/or confusion, but they don't? Maybe I overlooked it?\n\nIf you don't like social mechanics then this is another issue. Personally, I find social time exhausting. Having to maintain and/or developing it with non-fiction characters is just as exhausting.\n\nMaybe it is my monitor (even though I have the gamma lowered a bit). But the colors are ridiculously bright. Maybe this is from the HD graphics remake. They should have toned it down a little. Play with a controller on your largest monitor and sit back a bit so you're not constantly blinded in the menu anytime you have to open it.\n\nSpeaking of controllers. Play it with a controller. The keyboard controls feel clunky. There is very little room to remap any of the controls. Your character also moves in a very 8 directional way with no leeway to move outside of them.\n\nPerformance wise I have no real complaints. You have a few options to crank the anti-aliasing to max, vsync and 120fps, borderless, and resolution. There's a few bugs here and there that are noticeable at the beginning. But that's really it. Overall not that bad of a port.\n\nStoryline is OK. But overall I'm having a hard time seeing the hype with this series. I'm hoping it will reveal itself later after a few more key points in the story reveal itself.\n\nI'll probably have more to add later. But for the moment I am glad it was only $20.

The game features new content, fully voiced dialogue, and improved graphics, among other changes.\n\nThe gameplay in Persona 4 Golden is similar to the original Persona 4, with players controlling a high school student who discovers he has the ability to enter a mysterious world called the TV world through a television set. In the TV world, the player can battle various creatures known as Shadows, recruit them as Persona, and use them to battle other enemies.\n\nOne of the most significant changes in Persona 4 Golden is the addition of a new character named Marie, who brings new story and dungeon content to the game. The game also features a new epilogue that expands on the story and ties up loose ends left in the original Persona 4.\n\nThe social and relationship-building elements of Persona 4 Golden have been expanded, with new events and interactions with the game's various characters. The game also features a new gardening feature that allows players to grow and harvest vegetables, which can be used in various ways in the game.\n\nThe music and graphics in Persona 4 Golden have also been improved, with remastered music tracks and updated graphics that take advantage of the Vita's high-resolution screen. The game's new cutscenes and animations add depth and immersion to the game's story and characters.\n\nOverall, Persona 4 Golden is a fantastic re-release of an already great game. The new content, expanded social links, and updated graphics and music make it a must-play for fans of the genre, and an excellent entry point for newcomers to the Persona series.", "timestamp_created": 1684079589, "timestamp_updated": 1684079589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138285408": {"recommendationid": "138285408", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982949225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 5367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5198, "last_played": 1694708598}, "language": "english", "review": "Roses are red, violets are blue,\nmy memories seem to have fled,\nshutupstupidjerkihateyou.\n\nThanks, I'll be here all week.", "timestamp_created": 1684063365, "timestamp_updated": 1684063365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138281289": {"recommendationid": "138281289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137221404", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 4454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4454, "last_played": 1684056034}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't believe how much I ended up enjoying this game.

Persona 5 Royal is my 2nd favorite game of all time and I love almost every single bit of it to death. While I still loved this game, I hate being proven right. Persona 4 is without a doubt one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, while being one of the greatest games I've ever experienced.\n\nThe good (the world, story, characters and music): \n*This is a persona game through and though. It has so much heart and emotion in a way that no other medium can possibly convey. Getting to know a group of friends that slowly become inseparable over the course of dozens of hours of gameplay only to hit you with a nuclear gut punch at the very end. It's bursting at the seams with character, humor, happiness and tragedy, and dips into all manner of subject matter without straying away from its bright and happy tone. These games just make you feel good, and seeing the credits roll is like saying goodbye to a close friend.\n\n*The music, if you can believe it, is stellar. It's nowhere close to P5's jazzy, cocky and infinitely stylish OST in my personal opinion, but you would be hard pressed to find any persona music track that isn't an absolutely transcendental banger. The songs in this game go for a more J-pop style, and every single one (with the exception of that stupid piano track that plays every time someone so much as stubs their toe) is just so damn good that it's incredible. \n\n*The story has plenty of twists and turns and even though I had been spoiled on the big twist, there were still a few story beats that surprised me. While it still devolves into the [spoiler] Me japanese game so now you must kill god that comes out of nowhere hurr durr [/spoiler] toward the end, the journey more than makes up for the lacklustre destination.\n\n*The romance feels natural and is actually integrated into the story. Your choice of partner influences dialogue and how some scenes play out rather than maybe one or two dialogue changes in the entire game. This is unlike P5 where everyone randomly decides to keep it a secret, keeping %99 of the game identical no matter who you choose.\n(As an aside to all this however, I have to mention the acting. While most of the english actors are really good for their roles, some of them do everything in their power to devour the scenery at every opportunity. Not only that though, you can HEAR how bad their mics are, to the point where you can hear the microphone popping in a large chunk of their lines, with rise and yukiko being the most egregious. It's annoying, it's inexcusable, but I can muscle past it.)\n\nThe bad (the gameplay):\nLet's not mince words here: Persona 4's gameplay SUCKS. In fact, in terms of turn-based rpg gameplay, it's the worst I have ever played and it's not even close. The game seems almost determined to fight with the player on absolutely everything, turning what should be a tight and satisfying battle system into an agonising struggle.\n\n*The menus and UI are crunchy, archaic and clunky as all hell. Animations don't have snap, and quickly selecting options in combat is a chore. Having to press an extra button just to see what a move does is tedious, and the fact that switching personas is an action with its own menu prompt that you can only do once per turn is nothing short of baffling. Reminder that Final Fantasy 7 came out 10 years before P4 and 14 years before Golden yet is still infinitely more fluid in its combat.\n\n*Every single dungeon is literally exactly the same with a different coat of paint. Long dark paper-thin randomly arranged hallways with N64 draw distance filled with enemies you can only sometimes avoid, wandering around aimlessly for minutes on end to hopefully find the stairs. And god help you if the dungeon in question requires you to backtrack to find a key to progression. It's boring, and just feels like tedious meandering to make them last longer. Compared to P5's palaces, it's not even a question. Random generation works in roguelikes, survival games, DRG and nothing else.\n\n*The enemy variety is nonexistant. You'll be seeing the same exact enemy model copied and pasted from the very beginning to the very end of the game. Not only is it boring to fight the same ball-with-mouth or haunted-table for 60 hours, but since this game is all about exploiting enemy weaknesses, the fact that they all look the same means that you have to be constantly checking the analysis menu to see if the yellow rock-with-face has a different weakness than the blue rock-with-face.\n\n*Persona 4 thinks that making an rpg difficult means \"Just don't let the player deal damage.\" Enemy has one weakness and nullifies everything else? That weakness will be also nullified. Enemy has no weaknesses and takes half physical damage? It also has high counter so a large portion of your attacks will be reflected. Finally got that enemy with no weakness down? This enemy randomly takes no damage from all-out-attacks. \n\n*The thing that murders the combat stone dead more than anything else though is the god damn fucking MISSING. I cannot even come close to overstating how fucking awful attack accuracy is in this game. It does not matter which party member is using which attack, it does not matter if you've stacked a party accuracy buff with an enemy evasion debuff, and it does not matter how many times it happens, it is not even an exaggeration to say that your attacks on similarly levelled enemies WILL miss %50 of the time. I mean it when I say that EVERY SINGLE ATTACK feels like buying a lottery ticket, and it was a COMMON occurrence to go multiple FULL ROUNDS without landing a single attack. When I was fighting one of the big story bosses, completely out of resources with my back against the wall and the boss at low health, all 4 party members missed every. single. one. of their attacks for 4 ROUNDS STRAIGHT. It's like dangling some desperately needed dopamine over the player's head while punching them in the gut over and over and over again. If that weren't enough, you can also CRIT MISS, which knocks the character over and leaves them vulnerable, which is like eating a cookie and discovering that it's full of live fire ants. And the thing is, fighting the vanilla final boss and having most of my attacks actually landing made it the most enjoyable fight in the entire game. In P5, you look forward to going into a dungeon, in P4 you dread it.\n\n(As one last aside, it is absolutely asinine that there is [spoiler] A secret ending AFTER the first secret ending that you can only find on the last day of the game by going to an area you have no business going to after declining a choice you have literally no reason to decline. Seriously, if I hadn't made a save the day of, I would have been locked out of content that was AFTER content I was nearly locked out of. [/spoiler]\n\nSo here's the big verdict: If you can look past some truly, objectively terrible Turn-based RPG gameplay that will not hesitate to make you tear your hair out over and over, you have yourself a great story with some amazingly fun and likeable characters waiting for you, filled to the brim with heart and emotion. If you go in expecting gameplay on the same level as something like FF7 or P5, save your money and bash your head on the nearest hard surface for a similar experience.

The graphics are also acceptable, considering that it was originally released on the Vita.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a game that will blow your mind, you might want to look elsewhere. The game can be quite repetitive at times, with a lot of time spent on dungeon crawling and grinding levels. The combat system is decent, but can become tiresome after a while.\n\nOn the other hand, the game's storyline is engaging and well-written. The characters are also well-developed and have their own unique personalities. The game's social sim aspect is also enjoyable, as you get to interact with the characters and learn more about their lives.\n\nBut don't get too excited just yet. The game can be quite slow-paced, and the dialogue can sometimes be cringey and cheesy. Some of the character designs and outfits can also be a bit questionable if your into dudes.\n\nIn conclusion, Persona 4 Golden is a game that exists and can be played.

However, it just never pulled me in. I tried yet again on the Nintendo switch and played well into the game this time. \n\nThe game does an excellent job of creating an eerie-atmosphere that compliments the mystery presented to you of \"Who did it?\" \n\nThe music is very great at times, but sometimes feels out of place....as though it belongs more appropriately in the future Persona 5. Sometimes the music is weirdly absent at times that you think music should be present. \n\nAlmost all the side characters are stereotypes, but considering how long ago this game was first made.....I can give that a pass. \n\nI suppose the real issue is this. I like the idea behind the Persona games more than the execution. Persona 4 is no different. \nThere are two big reasons why I can't recommend this game. \n\n1. The gameplay is incredibly repetitive with zero thrills. Leveling up becomes incredibly tiresome when you reach level 20 and you're running through the same dungeon fighting the exact same enemies.......even same room locations.......for the 20th time.  Sure you can get \"stronger\" personas, but that itself feels repetitive as well. I will explain below.\n\nYou can literally put ANY move on ANY persona, even if it seems contrary to the nature of that persona(making an ice persona use fire attacks). On one hand I can appreciate the freedom to customize persona's, but I can't help feel like there isn't any personas that are unique. Why should there be any unique personas when you can make them all the same with the same attacks? The stat differences really don't matter much unless you're comparing the level of personas to have a 10-15 levels difference.  A level 12 persona will really be compareable in stats up to a level 22 persona.  So, all the leveling in between those levels is to possibly gain new moves(which you can spam later). \n\nThe daily life interactions/jobs/school clubs/jobs...........is a good idea in general, but when you're in that much of a time crunch to level up before the next challenge than such activities feels more tedious than enjoyable. I suppose it ultimately doesn't matter a lot since none of the activities are engrossing or interactive. You can try to say \"Well this game came out like 15 years ago and the technology wasn't available to do such things\". \n\nThat's hogwash. Shemmue came out 10 years earlier than P4 and did it better. \n\n2. The bad guy is obvious from nearly the beginning. One of the worst things that can be done in a \"Who done it?\" mystery is make the bad guy an easily identifiable individual. \n\nI will say that P4 is not a bad game for what it is, but don't try to use it's age as an excuse for it's shortcomings. 7 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1683616393, "timestamp_updated": 1683616713, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560832083225250244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138024106": {"recommendationid": "138024106", "author": {"steamid": "76561199243561557", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9843, "last_played": 1684326998}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]naoto supremacy[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1683590958, "timestamp_updated": 1683590958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784003913402557373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138015924": {"recommendationid": "138015924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075949554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 5427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5173, "last_played": 1697567108}, "language": "english", "review": "86 hours. How many entire single player only, narrative games can boast that they can keep you engaged and playing for 86 hours for ONE play-through, and all you can think about at the end is planning the next play-through?\n\nIt's weird to love a game so much and not even know how to describe it. Is this a JRPG? Is this a visual novel? A dating sim? A perfectly crafted time management game? Is it a noir detective game? Is it a comedy? A drama? It's everything all at once to the point I couldn't even neatly sum up one thing that it really \"is\". IT just kinda does everything all at once, seamlessly blending it without feeling messy. \n\nThis game also perfects the kind of gameplay loop that is just catnip to me, which is the \"just one more\" setup, with no microtransactions, just offers little packages of fun one after the other. Like, a game like stronghold, or any dungeon match games, idk a good example (any game with clearly defined levels) - you have a game, or scenario, and you win or lose, and then the level is over. You have an easy and natural stopping point. If you win \"that's enough, let's go on a high note\" or \"screw this, I lost! *quits game*\". This game keeps you playing. Just one more day! A day is a short, easy, bitesize unit of time, that it feels inconsequential to play just one more of, then suddenly you save the game and two hours have passed. The same way a paradox map game just kinda goes on with no clear time breaks, \"just one more war\", this has the same feeling that sucks you into a game you love to focus on. I think part of that is that it's a semi-open world. A full open world game with a gigantic map gives you too much freedom, you can run around, waste time with side missions, and wander back to the world ending calamity whenever you damn well please. A fully linear game lets you blow through it with no time to pace yourself. This game keeps the urgency up, gives you only so much time to do everything, while still feeling like you HAVE a lot of choice in what to do. It is not restrictive, while keeping up the tension that TES games lose when you ignore the apocalypse to go and fight trolls or join the bard's guild for nine in-game months. \n\nThe story is superb, every time I thought \"oh X hasn't happened for a while they need to keep the stakes up\" it would happen within a day or two. I did see a few things coming, but I think they were kinda signposted anyway, and because it was naturally the correct story decision TO happen next in terms of good writing. The pacing is generally done well, and the story balances drama and intensity with humour and levity in waves that are so well spaced out. The funny moments are genuinely sweet and funny, the dramatic moments are just that. While I was unsure of the game for the first 2 hours, when it semed to be JUST a visual novel, I'm glad I pressed on, and it makes sense to have that long of an intro considering how vast the story is. No joke, I first started this game, played for about 8 hours solid, then proceeded to do the same for pretty much every day for a month, until I was done. I worked a full time jobs' worth of time playing this. This WAS my April. I would do whatever I had to do that day, then play this for 8 hours straight, fall alseep and dream about playing it, or it's story, or characters, for another 8 hours, then repeat. Yes, I genuinely, actually just dreamed bout the game the majority of nights during the time I played it. \n\nEverything about the story, the assets, the scenery, the MUSIC, was nostalgic (for a game I never even played before) bitter-sweet, amazing, enrapturing. I got lost in this game, and fell in love with so many original characters that just endear themselves to you beyond words. It also shows you just how vast it is, that you can press a button to see the choices others made on a given day, and like 7 months in, you can see most people hung out with a character YOU DIDN'T EVEN MEET YET! The combat was balanced and felt challenging and fun as well, everything was just done great. Even when I was months away from the end of the game, I would deliberately take the time to slow down, read every prompt slowly ,and admire the scenery, the music, the assets, and live in the moment, to enjoy every last second, the whole environments they created, with unique assets, to just be in this one scene. I would drag out time to simply VIBE with the game, and no other game has made me cherish every last moment playing it as much.\n\nMy nitpicks, for fairness:\nMaybe it's due to being an old game, but how they dealt with LGBT characters felt a bit... off, with how their journeys concluded. Not in a horrific way, just, without spoilers, I think it would be handled differently by a 2023 story, and felt like a cop out from making them LGBT to begin with. This applies most closely to the final team member, as well as another character, but 2009 gonna 2009 I guess. \n\nThe villain: NYOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nThey hold off on other characters romancing one another so that you, as the player, have the option to date/cheat on everyone. But, I kinda wish there were story branches for pushing the other characters to date each other if you've already picked someone, or just want to see that outcome for the others. And it might be nice to have your relationship be a bit more public, since it's kinda forced to be kept a secret to keep up the charade for players who choose to be a cheater, which means whoever you date can't have AS big an impact on the story as it might otherwise have. \n\nNo girl protagonist! NO GIRL PROTAGONIST. Since the MC is so bland/self inserty, I don't see how it would be so hard to just offer an asset/dialogue swap for a girl protagonist with a few romantic options added to open up all genders. \n\nCannot rebind move to the arrow keys. While this did lead me to playing with a PS4 controller, which I ultimately think was the best choice, I always mark a game down for accessibility for left handed players when they arbitrarily disallow using the arrow keys for movement. If I didn't happen to own a console, that would have made the game boarderline unplayable for me. \n\nGood ending is locked behind a complex dialogue tree that you can only break through with a game guide - I think it should be a tad easier to access the last quarter of the game, because without the internet to tell me this was multi-ending, I would have assumed the game just ended like that, or at least assume that I must have soft locked a good ending out accidentally months before.\n\nSome of the side quests were too arbitrary to complete, even a pretty basic one I wasted months building a social link to complete, just to discover that's not how you complete it at all.\n\nHow some things work aren't signposted QUITE clearly enough, so I avoided doing some things until way too late bc I assumed they'd be mandatory once I began. Kinda my fault, but still.\n\nWhile I did enjoy my time grinding, and felt that the amount of grinding you did balanced your time spent outside of dungeons well, I think the outcome of fights was tied to it a little too much.

If you're in for stories, this would be a must-play from me. \n\nIn here you are thrown into Inaba as a transfer student. You experience life with a group of pals who all have their own background stories, followed by different journeys they are taking to overcome and accept themselves while solving the serial murder emerging in the quiet town. \n\nI really love the theme and the illustration about the 'self' throughout every part of the main story, the script writers did not slack off while writing the separate episodic character developmental arcs - and it is a real challenge to link up every episode soundly! These sub-arcs complement the main story while they are also individual and complete stories on their own, making it a harmonious interplay between the two concepts. If there aren't the sub-arcs, the main story would not be complete, vice versa. The characters, be them the deuteragonists, or the minor support characters, are all fully developed personalities who I can really imagine as real people. I can picture laughing and crying with them, and I never had such sentiments for the P5 characters (not that they're bad, just not comparable to the writing in P4G).\n\nThere are some segments of the story focusing on (obligatory - for such genre and setting) high school humor, but they do not derail from the main theme of 'self', that the shadow and the persona are just the two sides of a coin. It would be unfair and ignorant to simply call P4G a 'typical high school anime boys and girls story'. What they successfully illustrated is that there are indeed ups and downs in life, and the motto is to remain honest to oneself and those who one can trust, and not to distort whatever you hold as a rationale bona fide. \n\nWant some good laughs or somehow you want to shed some genuine tears? P4G got you covered, and both. Complexity does not necessitate darkness and sorrow, P4 Golden delivers an engaging plot that does not trade 'youth, friendship and happiness' away just to appear deep or solemn. \n\n(By the last paragraph I did not mean to say that P3 is bad, and I only heard even better things about P3 in storytelling.
