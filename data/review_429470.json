And so I found this game.  This is an graphic adventure game.  That is, it is like the scavenger-hunt portion of a HOG, but without any mini-games or puzzles.  You can finish the entire game in a single play-through of a few hours.  \n\nIt is better at plot and story than most adventure games, because... well... for an adventure game, there really is hardly any scavenger-hunting.  You never have more than a few items in your inventory at any time, and you can't pick up (or sometimes even notice) items that you don't yet need.  So in this sense, the game is very, very linear.  You can't do anything to sabotage your game state, but you can't always advance until you do things in a particular order.  So the game is tightly on rails, ensuring that the plot is given to you always in the correct order.  This does make for a surprisingly strong story.  \n\nWhether it makes for a surprisingly weak game is up to each person to decide.  However, the game was recently put on sale, and is now free to play.  It is part of a series of similar games, some taking place on a spaceship, some taking place on a deep space mining station, and I assume future installments are taking place in the Delta Quadrant, some taking place in a French vineyard, and so on.   (This episode ends with the female 2nd-in-command having to put on a red angel battle-mech armor that looks like it was created by Section 31, so my assumptions are probably spot-on.)  \n\nThe game was made with RPG Maker, so it's the usual Commodore 64 graphics.  No voices or voice-overs.  \nThere are no bugs and glitches, and all achievements are possible.\n", "timestamp_created": 1601790630, "timestamp_updated": 1601790630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643276870250701904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76531836": {"recommendationid": "76531836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050632099", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1561197737}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing life changing, but the story was interesting enough to keep me invested in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1601036624, "timestamp_updated": 1601036624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75184450": {"recommendationid": "75184450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130983928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1598410986}, "language": "english", "review": "A short game with a great story and the puzzles all make sense", "timestamp_created": 1598816281, "timestamp_updated": 1598816281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74835380": {"recommendationid": "74835380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030784015", "num_games_owned": 8592, "num_reviews": 10534, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1598274882}, "language": "english", "review": "RPG Maker strikes again!

This is an exploration adventure game, with item collecting and puzzle solving like point and click titles. It has a sci fi theme in space, with an interesting story divided into various acts, lots of distinct characters (including various playable ones), and of course, annoying puzzles that require a lot of experimentation.

While episode I and II are smaller, III and IV expand in scope and length, and IV even has some light decisions that you must make. The graphics and music are a bit generic, but get the job done. Each episode has trading cards and achievements of their own, and they are cheap to get, with episode I even being free.\nOf course, I can only recommend this saga if you\u00b4re a fan on the genre, because if you\u2019re not you\u2019ll quickly start to get frustrated.

I tried it and now I review it...curse you for getting me hooked...)\n\n[h1]Is this episode of a space traveler really to be ranked alpha?[/h1]\n\nLong ago, I heard about this game in an achievement hunting group...and as you know, [i]RPG Maker[/i] titles take time and commitment...some flooded with battles, the others dragging on with exposition...and map designs...oh my god are they often large with obligatory mazes.  And when I heard that this was a space game with a theme similar to [i]Star Trek[/i] (and how boring I find that...) I couldn't \"nope\" out of the room any faster...wasn't made any better knowing that I had a free copy of the \"Academy\" series in my library collecting dust.  Yet out of the blue, a user gifts me episode 2 and kept giving the series high marks.  I was tempted to refuse the gift, but his passion wouldn't let up and I couldn't bring myself to break his heart, knowing how it feels to be passionate about a series as a diehard fan...so I tried out episode 1 first...and quite frankly?  I was impressed.\n\n[i]Space Pilgrim Episode I: Alpha Centauri[/i] is a short [i]RPG Maker[/i] title set in space following a girl named Gail Pilgrim who acts as an intergalactic taxi service, hauling people and goods from location to location.  However, we're not going to focus on that boring aspect because the game barely touches on it.  What it does touch on is the interactions of Gail and her passengers along with other people she meets to form a narrative between them.  While most [i]RPG Maker[/i] games utilize large environments to build their worlds, this particular title does the exact opposite to gain the same effect.  Smaller maps which actually makes me want to skip from map to map even faster, allowing me new scenery to look at from room to room.  This is a feature I greatly appreciated from the developer.\n\nAs far as the writing goes, I find it to be silly yet not overly random since the jokes are situational and arise only when necessary...with an occasional lesbian joke here and there.  The writing never pulls a joke that feels unwarranted or forced and each character's dialogue comes off naturally.  The format of writing feels good as does the interface.  My only real gripe is the \"combine\" system which makes things feel quite tedious, despite fitting into the \"point-and-click\" genre.\n\nThe story is approximately 2 hours long and I haven't found any bugs.  As for the franchise?  I guess now it's no real surprise as to why the franchise has prospered for four years (as of this review).  If you're looking for a clever little title for a few hours, I'd highly recommend giving [i]Space Pilgrim Episode I: Alpha Centauri[/i] a try.  It's free, short, has some achievements, and with some good writing.  I guess it's safe to say that I've become a bit of a fan now and am eager to see more of how this story unfolds.\n\n9/10 Umm....Obligatory sci-fi space reference catchphrase here!", "timestamp_created": 1572132624, "timestamp_updated": 1572132624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527683258056640625", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55790492": {"recommendationid": "55790492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872786083", "num_games_owned": 3535, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1572057738}, "language": "english", "review": "engaging, short, no combat, casual gameplay, average characters", "timestamp_created": 1572059683, "timestamp_updated": 1572059683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55757525": {"recommendationid": "55757525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048282865", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1571983783}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short but quite fun!

It really did surprise me because I don't usually go for cutie graphical adventure games like this. The story had gentle humor and is simple in plot and in puzzles but it all worked well.

You mainly play as Gail Pilgrim, captain of her own space vessel, and right at the start, you're acting as a taxi for a small number of people. Of course, this doesn't go to plan, setting up the events of these first few episodes. The story as a whole is pretty good, it's very engaging and easy to follow, and lets you experience a variety of different locations.\n\nIn my opinion, the series' main advantage is its characters. They're very well-written and the main characters seem like real people, rather than two-dimensional, functional characters. Gail herself is a likeable and relatable protagonist, and the way she interacts with other characters is generally believable. The whole series isn't too serious, there's a fair amount of humour (but it doesn't overpower the game - there are some very serious moments, and the writing knows when to ease up on the laughs).\n\nEach episode gives around 1-2 hours of gameplay (unless you are really good at these), so it's not a long game. The 'puzzles' aren't too obscure, but you'll often find you need to do X for character A, so that you can then do Y for character B and do Z for Character C, which was the main objective.

In predictable fashion, something goes awry when the ship is in space, and the adventure begins.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\n\nWhat are you expecting for a game that you get \"awarded\" coupons for on Steam for crafting badges?  Alright, I won't cut any corners this time!  The graphics and sound are both comparable to the graphics and sound to games made in the fourth generation of consoles, which is good enough for me, since I find game graphics from that generation to be aesthetically pleasing, and this game's graphics are no exception.  There's nothing in particular that I like about the graphics, but there's nothing I would consider game-breaking about any of the graphics.\n\nThe ambient sounds in the background help set the mood, but they're nothing exciting.  Sadly, the sounds cannot be muted in-game, so if you want to listen to your kind of music, you'll need to mute your computer and play your kind of music from an outside source.\n\nPositives:\n\nThis game represents a true value for the money.  Unlike all the other shovelware I've been given Steam coupons for after crafting badges that look like they're from the third generation of consoles, at least this game looks like it was from the fourth generation.  \n\nI knew right away from the first bits of dialogue in the beginning that I was going to enjoy the characters and what all they would have to say.  Although there wasn't much room in the way of being able to express the characters, I found them to be incredibly interesting given the price of this game.  The dialogue was very enjoyable to read, and there was some unexpected humor, especially in the conversations involving the robots encountered.  \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1719058748\n\nI also got a nice laugh when I tried to have Gail use a urinal. (Below image used with permission.)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=690982154&tscn=1519989267\n\nIf you're one of those people who buy games just for the sake of crafting badges, this game is for you!  There's only five cards, and the cards that are on the market as of the time of the writing of this review are quite cheap, so you can easily build yourself a shiny level five badge for your profile (along with earning yourself 500 XP), and top it off with an impressive foil badge for an additional 100 XP!\n\nIf you're the type of person who likes to say \"I got every achievement to this game, I'm like, uber-1337\"!  This game is also for you!  With seven achievements that are impossible not to achieve, you'll impress your friends in no time.  (Assuming, of course, your friends do not have this game!)\n\nNegatives:\n\nIt's obvious that if there's something wrong with this game, it's the length of the game.  Seven achievements?  Yes, the length of this game is shorter than an ant's pecker.\n\nWhile the dialogue is of high quality, I do find it lacking that there's never any choices to pick from when conversing with the other characters and robots.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWith zero difficulty, little adventure, and lack of choices for dialogue, this game plays more like a visual novel than an RPG.  But the reason anyone plays video games, is to have fun, and this game is good fun.  In fact, this game is far more fun than I ever would have expected for even it's regular sale price.  Coupons for this game aren't hard to come by, so get yourself a coupon if you can, and get ready to see where the adventures of Gail Pilgrim take you.  However short, it's probably for the better that the developer decided on making a bunch of individual short games instead of a bunch of mini-adventures stitched together for the sake of badge collectors with enough sense to know that a level five badge to a game with five cards to collect for a nickel counts for the same amount of XP as a level five badge featuring eight cards that all sell anywhere for a dime to a half-dollar each.  (And even more!)  If you own a software publishing company, you should buy out GrabTheGames, because their writers should be writing dialogue to games with far bigger distribution than what they're able to accomplish on their own.", "timestamp_created": 1519992296, "timestamp_updated": 1563672093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642771661281585693", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39947386": {"recommendationid": "39947386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302233876", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 209, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1518159235}, "language": "english", "review": "Can I call it is 16 bit Visual novel or 16 bit point and click game instead ?", "timestamp_created": 1518159536, "timestamp_updated": 1518159744, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.40124848484992981", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39856770": {"recommendationid": "39856770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017102770", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1645420459}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the story in this game. and the 2d retro look works well.", "timestamp_created": 1517792796, "timestamp_updated": 1517792796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455229490995407104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39855480": {"recommendationid": "39855480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080421992", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1517779259}, "language": "english", "review": "For a quick story based game this was amazing, definietly gonna play the rest", "timestamp_created": 1517786690, "timestamp_updated": 1517786690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39847404": {"recommendationid": "39847404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047017498", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1517762915}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this from Chrono, actually not bad.", "timestamp_created": 1517763031, "timestamp_updated": 1517763031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39646111": {"recommendationid": "39646111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409513603", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1516678221}, "language": "english", "review": "Liked this game quite a bit,a few times i didnt know what to do enough that it got a bit frustrating but i stuck with it and ended up buying the rest of the series", "timestamp_created": 1517031250, "timestamp_updated": 1517031250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39408579": {"recommendationid": "39408579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008556463", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1539582452}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't get past the first part and get into the cargo hold!

It's not something I would expect to spend a huge amount of time on unless you're a bit slow like I am. \n\nIf you are ready to get invested in a story, play this series. Although they are somewhat linear, the story is one that caught my attention quite well. They're on sale for super cheap right now. If I wasn't obsessed with buying things on sale, I would have bought the whole series the moment I started the 4th game. It's a simple RPGMaker series, so don't expect the mechanics to be any different from a basic run of the mill RPG. If it's your genre, this is a great game to add. If you get one, I recommend getting at least the first four so you can see the story through the 4th game.(altogether about 2USD at the moment)\n\nIf you haven't really enjoyed some of the RPGs you've played in the past but still want to find a series to bring you into the genre, this series is both cheap and entertaining as far as RPGs go.

I could not continue due to the lack of challenge and changing of scenes (i'll explain a few sentences later).\nSorry to the developer, i see your effort but either the story is compelling nor the puzzles in particular challenging and here is why:\neverything changes alot. you fulfill one task and either the scene ends in an abrupt fade to black or suddenly changes complete objectives or plot. Its like i am in a bad action movie. There is nothing really to fail, just looking around for the one object that you can interact with. Most of the puzzles got solved by just looking around and exploring things.Its a very light adventure for the curios one.Sadly the plot or the characters do not make up for this.\nSPOILERALERT:\nFor example in this first episode you board your ship with 3 passengers. Without getting too much into the characters (this is a priest, this is a soldier, this is a scientist) One of them gets immediatly insane and takes over the ship. The otherone gets almost killed and knocked out until the end of the game. And the third one almost breaks the fourth wall while knowing everything. And know the challenge: guess which characters has which behavior? You immediatly know what is going on.\nOkay leaving this aside, what is the overall plot? There is a mad priest who wants to fly your ship into the ?sun? (refered as gate to heaven). But he gets killed without further explaining anything of his plot. This could have been a big potential for a great story but it got shut down too quickly. While gaining controll back over your ship the soldier gets knocked out also without any more context to this character. So you are going to look for help and find a mining space station where people seem to act weird. But why? Never explained. Intead your rummage around their space station, treating everyone like shit and wonder why they are mad at you (duh). When they come after you, you just kill them? or at least trapping them forever alone in space, left to die, unconscious.\nAnd in the end: Yeah we're all alive and escaped. From what? From the people that you seeked for help, which they provided, and killed? Woohoo...Next episode! And here only one character made it over (maybe the soldier comes back for a visit in the future? I dont know what happened to him) - the rest is a fresh start in the same setting.\nThe only thing I know about the main antagonist at this point that she has her ship handed over by her father to contitnue his business and I guess she likes cats (cause there is one on her ship) but is willing to sacrifice it in a wimp of an eye?).\nThere could be so much more made out of the story with the mad priest or the wounded soldier but instead you hire the scientist because you got along so well? Its not like a 2nd crew member was needed before...\nI cannot see an overall story and the first episode just made me not want to explore it.\nAnd, as I said, the puzzles made not up for that. The 2nd episode begins with the act \"Play stewardess\" - after all this and the computer telling me to look around my passengers (probably to introduce the new chars) I did not want to continue because I knew, I'd be running around and asking every person to get to a new scene where probably something dramatic happen. And every other puzzle was the same. You look for objects to interact, make a connection from that object to a person and maybe sometimes add an item to find in the bathroom or so (also only actions become available after you interacted with another person or object what is very frustrating to do everything in the right order or just speak to that person for no reason again to do the thing you wanted to do).\nAnd unfortunatley exploring solves the problems ahead, you dont know about. For example there was a butterfly on the space station. One of the few animated ojects on your way, so I immediatly want to explore it. When you try to catch it, it went through a vent, you go back one room and there is the butterfly. Interact again, it flew to the next room. And when you enter the room suddenly a little scene plays with one of the station members trying to catch it and losing his key while catching. Now I got keys from a character which I dont know what to do with and a char who I never got the chance to speak first. That was a little bit odd to say the least.\nAnd prying open a chest full of explosives with a metal stick that appeared while a big robot shot at you to actually kill the robot was also not very challening.\n\nOverall:\nMassive potential waste, in my eyes. Maybe there builds up a bigger plot in the 2nd or 3rd episode but the 1st one scared me off with all the running arounds and fulfilling a task list to get to the next task list.", "timestamp_created": 1503149459, "timestamp_updated": 1503149459, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520201981067657471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34299227": {"recommendationid": "34299227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028351923", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78, "last_played": 1502939026}, "language": "english", "review": "Having this gifted to me from a friend who got the humble bundle I decided to try it out. Of course this is coming off of just this game not the series as a whole.\n\nI am fully aware that the first game one makes on RPG Maker isn't really the best one or the one where the creator puts most of their dedication to perfect. This could have been a game that was probably used to flesh out the skills the creator needed for the rest of the series. If that was the case then I don't see why the game wasn't just one giant game rather than 4 different episodes. This would have allowed for seeing what lacked in certain parts and add a bit of more repolishing to it. The reason I bring this up is cause while the gameplay wasn't bad, as someone who uses RPG Maker to design his own games, I felt it lacking. \n\nThis first episode suffers something that a game like this should not have, it is too short for it's own good. There isn't much time to get to know the characters as the game instantly sets you up into a dire situation you have to get out of. There is no time to learn the characters and grow attached to them which is what a first episode is usually meant for. This in my own opinion is heavily detremental to a game as a whole. \n\nAnother thing that felt off to me is that the characters didn't have different face portraits for different pieces of diolouge. While not necessarily a major issue it does somewhat take away the experience of emmersing your player into the world by making your characters feel a bit more alive. It doesn't make sense for someone who is worried about your character to be smirking or for a character to be smiling while things are going sour. A few other facial expressions for the characters other than the standard ones would have been a way to resolve this. A few minutes off your time to make various portaits of the same character with different expressions doesn't take much time especially if you are using VX Ace's character creator.\n\nThe story itself felt like it went barely anywhere. It kinda felt like everything that happened in this game just happened to have it happen. Again going back to the fact that it seemed to be too short for it's own good. None of the scenarios you go through felt very fleshed out in this episode.\n\nI do not know if these issues are fixed in the future episodes for I have yet to try them. However, this episode was not a very good start. It was ok but it wasn't up to my expictations of what the start of a series should be like. I cannot recommend this episode in particular. I'll eventually see what the others have to offer but if anything I can almost garuntee you can skip this episode and you will not have much of an issue understanding the rest of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1502941101, "timestamp_updated": 1502941101, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547444820404053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34249269": {"recommendationid": "34249269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096702219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1502833968}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun short rpg with a interesting story.

It\u2019s a 2.5D, pixel art, point and click adventure set in space and would normally cost \u00a30.90 on Steam. I completed in the game in just under 2 hours with 7/7 achievements.\n\nThings didn\u2019t get off to a good start; episode one launched in teeny tiny windowed mode with no options available on the start menu or in game to change this. I used Alt + Return to get the game to full screen but it was stuck in 800 x 600 resolution. About 20 minutes into the game I pressed F12 in a vain attempt to take a screen shot and received the message \u201cscript \u2018mouse support\u2019 line 131: RGSSerror occurred. Dispose sprite\u201d and the game closed without saving. There are actually no auto-save points, this needs to be done manually.\n\nThe story and characters (in episode one at least) are largely as two dimensional as the visuals, and the dialogue can be a bit stale. Everything felt a bit generic and the plot was a tad on the simple side, with events/puzzles playing out a bit too conveniently. There was nothing challenging about this episode and it offered nothing new. The best part was actually a side plot involving two robots in Act 3. This proved far more emotive than anything happening in the main story arch and the robots themselves were well written characters given their screen time.\n\nThe ending was somewhat anti-climactic. I won\u2019t spoil anything but will suffice to say it was all too neat. There was no cliff-hanger or suspense to motivate me to play the next episode, everything wraps up in a way a bit too close to \u2018happily ever after\u2019 and left me feeling unsatisfied.\n\nThere are some positives, once you get past the above foibles. It\u2019s nicely made for what is, and it was a fairly relaxing experience. If you particularly like this sort of game it is most likely worth the low price but it\u2019s not for everyone and I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this and would like to see my game reviews (and a bunch of other ramblings) in their natural habitat please visit my [url=www.rachaelbreartonwrites.com]blog[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1502604171, "timestamp_updated": 1511252637, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68346405029296875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34184867": {"recommendationid": "34184867", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997883306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1502502729}, "language": "english", "review": "fun, reminded me of older rpg's back on the SNES or similar (I guess I can now say I have collected ALL the achievements on at least ONE game I own...

An obvious RPGMaker game, with a sci-fi setting and a straightforward plot.\n\nThe story begins on Union Space Station, orbiting the planet Brahman and 6.6 light years away from Earth. Our plucky young protagonist, Gail Pilgrim, is tasked with transporting 3 passengers on her ship Quicksilver to planet Adroa in Alpha Centauri - a simple job which soon goes sideways when a stowaway is revealed to taken over piloting the  ship to a new destination. Now Gail must deal with the threat on her ship and whatever is at the new location her ship has been diverted to.\n\nAs it is a point and click game, the game works by clicking on items in the game or your inventory and then selecting what you want to do with, and as expected you will need to combine items to advance past some obstacles. The puzzles are easy and not really much of a challenge, giving the impression of a prologue episode. The additional of a journal to keep track of the missions is handy, I found it easy to get lost in exploring the world and forget which order steps needed to be taken in.\nThere are some nice little touches which give some life to the game. When speaking with people you can get a little more information about the setting, being able to see a message from your father and the option of using the restroom is an interesting addition. The dialogue can feel a little flat in some places, but each character has their own mannerisms and distinct personality, plus there are a couple of tasteful references to sex.\n\nArt wise, the characters all have a distinctive look and each sprite is each to recognise in game. The background is suitably drab in parts and vibrant in others, depending on which location Gail is in. It adds to the impression of a busy bar or small spaceship, the details in the overview of the Quicksilver is well done and makes it stand out against the inky blackness of space.\nFor the music, a couple of licenses have been obtains to play some already existing music, which has been carefully selected to fit in to the sci-fi setting and adds a little bit of atmosphere.\n\nIt is a short game, easy to complete in about an hour and a bit generic, though it could be forgiven as this is the opening episode introducing us to our protagonist.

Instead it tells a story by making you solve simple puzzles in a way a point and click game normally would.\nI welcomed the change because I got tired of all the battles in which you would spam \"attack\" all the time anyway. There are no battles here, just a story to experience. And since RPG Maker games are always quite simplistic, that's the best use for them anyway. Coming up with good and fun gameplay mechanics for this kind of engine is hard, even more so getting the balance of combat right. Many RPG Maker games struggle because of this and fail because they have to do all that and create a immersive story on top of it.\n\nSo it makes sense that this game ditches battles and balancing altogether in favor of creating a fun story and compelling characters instead.\n\nAnd it works.\n\nThe story, albeit short, is genuinely interesting enough to get you absorbed into the world, if you are willing to allow it. The characters have their unique traits and feel alive. There are a lot of things you can examine as the MC to get many interesting lines from both the MC and her companions, even very humorous ones at times. The game also looks rather good for a RPG maker game. Sprites fit the atmosphere and setting and every character has their own portrait, even irrelevant ones.\n\nAll in all, I can say that this is an RPG maker game that had some serious effort put into it and you can tell by playing it. This isn't the usual trash that gets put together in a hurry to put it on steam and make some cash. And even though it is quite short and cut into four parts, I would still wholeheartedly recommend this series for being one of the better games the RPG maker niche has to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1488042322, "timestamp_updated": 1488095352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573445916175842285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30092046": {"recommendationid": "30092046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004803930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1485833552}, "language": "english", "review": "A short but enjoyable game, I finished it in two or three evenings.

If it wasn't for this, I would've forgotten what I needed to do next.\n\nAs for game progression; at times you're prompted to combining items so as to create a more fitting object in order to proceed further.\n\nThe characters reveal in a very straightforward manner what their intentions are and what they need to execute their plans. It's a no-brainer really.\n\nIt looks fairly easy on the eye and there's no brain-busting puzzles (phew!).\n\nI absolutely loved the portrets. They looked close enough to the character sprites.\n\nI find cohesion and consistency very important (in any type of game).\n\nThis game definitely looks and feels cohesive & consistent (from character design, to environmental design to story progression).\n\nThe story is well written as well and it made sense.\n\nIt was definitely worth the investment (not that this game costs an arm and a leg - far from it).\n\nI got it on sale (including 4 Space Pilgrim chapters) + an additional game by the same developer (for the curious people reading this, I'm referring to 'Crown Champion Legends of the Arena') - which cost me less than 5 bucks.\n\nThe developers are definitely not afraid of trying things and dabbling into different genres. I really like that and I appreciate it (and they use RPGmaker every single time).\n\nI'm amazed at what they've squeezed out of this piece of software (which enables developers to focus on the artsy aspect without needing to break their heads too much in regard to any intricate technical stuff).\n\nThey really do seem like they care about what people have to say and try to implement feedback and improve their material.\n\nThere's definitely great potential here and if they continue like this, I do believe they could create something beautiful & rich (one step at a time!).\n\nI absolutely love investing in people who care this much and are capable of delivering decent quality products, time after time.\n\nIt's very heartwarming and beautiful to see how they're progressing with every title that is released and I am so proud of them, because they serve as a great example of what it means to start small, and grow bigger.\n\nI'm curious to see more!

The whole 'gotta find this, this, this, and that other thing' gets old, but I like the story enough to not mind so much.  Basically, if you like action games, RPG Maker games in general probably aren't for you.  If you like games with replay value, it's also a dud.

I mean, I didn't expect to be terrible or I wouldn't have bought it, but when you pay $2 for a game you have certain expectations and this game surpassed them.\n\nYou play the rather happless captain Gail Pilgrim whose routine passenger trip manages to go all kinds of wrong. There are plot twists along the way, some of which I saw coming, others of which took me by surprise. The writing is really quite good, with a quirky sense of humour that actually made me laugh out loud a few times. The characters have more depth that you have any right to expect from such a short title. At around 2 hours the $2 price tag feels about right.

I purchased it in a \"10 games for a dollar\" type of bundle, and expected more of the usual tripe that comes from both bundles and RPG Maker.\n\nWhat I like about RPG Maker, in theory, is that it allows enterprising story-tellers and novelists to weave a story without the trammel of having to have coding skills, technical prowess, or much knowledge about anything pertinent to the computer sciences. Unfortunately, the same features which give RPG Maker these qualities also attract the lazy, the unimaginative, and the pretentious, emboldened by the success of games such as To the Moon, which, with small development teams, have risen to sales prominence.\n\nThankfully, this one is entirely the former. I won't spoil too much; it's a short game, and I love it when people just let the action unfold. I will say, while there are some issues with the puzzles (Or, maybe it's just me? I can never tell), where some of the objects of interest are /very/ difficult to find/realize owing to how small their sprites are, and how well some of them blend into the background they're against, the characters all have individual personalities (I keep finding games in this genre where everyone was written with kind of the same voice, even if they say different things), the scriptwriting is excellent, the plot is written well enough to where I was /genuinely/ surprised by one or two things, and, by the end, I actually cared about what happened to everyone. \n\nI've been recommending this to my friends, and I recommend it to you.

This old school RPG has some problem solving, a good story with some twists and turns, & left me ready to continue with the rest of the series.\n   The series was a steal for the price that it was on sale for, and remains very low even when not on sale. If you still love the classic RPG style this Sci Fi type game delivers with a charming story and a few laughs and unexpected turns.\n   Obviously, there is nothing cutting edge or advanced about it. What you see is what you get. A short, simple game without too much difficulty whatsoever. If you are lookin for some push back or a game with a lot of depth, probably give this one a pass for the time being.\n   Basically you can tell by looking at the above art style if this game is for you. If these types of games are up your alley and you are looking to kick back with a good story and not much of a challenge for a few hours, give Space Pilgrim a try.\n\nFor more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blog\n\nHttp://www.SublimeGameReviews.wordpress.com\n\n& follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews", "timestamp_created": 1465611559, "timestamp_updated": 1465611559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528397560119628906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23487677": {"recommendationid": "23487677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194091950", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1481654941}, "language": "english", "review": "A cool game.

Mark this one down as one of the good RPG Maker titles on Steam. The story was cool. Sort of reminiscent of a 1950's sci-fi mystery. It's pretty standard point and click, combine items or sequences to solve puzzles fare. Nothing too challenging at all, but that's actually good as it doesn't step on the game by making the puzzles too complicated. This is meant to be a more casual and enjoyable introduction to the series from what I can tell and it succeeds. \n\nAs far as all video games go, I'd probably rate this as a 6 out of 10, but when taking account it being an RPG Maker title, I give it a boost to about 7.5 out of 10.

Also, whenever there's a dialog box open, it seems like the mouse cursor doesn't need to actually be inside the box to choose an option.

But the story is well-written: you go from twist to twist, you're playing two characters actually (Gail then someone else in act III) and you have some good humor in it (Gail is maybe a good girl but she's not really confident in herself).\n\nThe gameplay is easy: you search for items, you discuss with people and nope, you don't have any hidden object scenes - because usually that kind of beginning for the sentence is often found in my review about HOG. Anyway, you can combine items in your inventory when needed. Keep in mind that sometimes, you need to go to the inventory and examine more closely items in order to advance in the game - I was kinda stuck twice because I didn't think about this action.\n\nThe soundtrack is also a good one. I loved the fact that you can activate the intercom to play music and to enable finally something to listen instead of the void.\n\nSeriously, for the price, you have a little good moment to enjoy.

(Thanks for the gift, ValkyrieMoon!)\nTruth to be told, I wanted to talk about the game's story first, but an important thing for future buyers:  THIS IS NOT AN RPG. Each and every items strictly has it's usage, the story is straightforward, there is no choicemaking. This game is a point and click - pretty good at it, but I wanted to make this clear - no fighting in the game, or quests, or whatsoever.\n\nI think the developer(s?) liked Firefly, at least I felt some resemblances to the series both in some minor elements, and the overall atmosphere of the game  - it has a serious, normal story, but quote often something funny or unexpected pops up - \" my longest serving companion\" is a plant, there's the lampiest lamp of the room, something silly. Like the captain gets bored during flights and start being a little crazy.\nThe story felt like a random episode of a sci-fi show - short, somewhat clich\u00e9, but likeable, while I wasn't hyped about what will happen next, I played through the game without getting bored at all, that's a good sign. I perticularly loved the robots in the third chapter - they mixed up the themes of Asimov's robotics with some feeling, existential of robots and humans - it was really intresting, that was the best written part of the game in my opinion.\nAbout language and music... others mentioned typos, I don't recall any. Others mentioned good music, while usually I felt that the game's music was really underwhelming, usually I haven't even noticed it.  Or maybe the sounds effects were louder than the music and I turned down the volume... I think that this doesn't matter that much. The game is a good way to pass an hour if you want nothing more than a dose of sci-fi episode of a series you like - I'll keep an eye on the next episodes, hope they'll fare well.", "timestamp_created": 1451555759, "timestamp_updated": 1451561711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875085830688476563", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20143589": {"recommendationid": "20143589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146719815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1451525642}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is worth to buy today.

I don't want that to get lost when I don't recommend the game.\n\nThe premise was interesting and on sale for $0.50, how could I not check it out? Based on how things start, I was ready for a good little horror game. It'd be like Alien; stuck on a ship with an unknown threat. The developer is great at setting up atmosphere. The music was perfect and the characters set a good tone. Thumbs up on having me turn down the lights. Unfortunately, there was no real payoff and it ended very anticlimactically. The gameplay is very simple as you just do one task after the other. It's just a matter of finding the right thing to interact with. The characters are not that interesting. One is crazy, one is nice, and the other one is \"Jerk Spock\". Two of them do have a little philosophical argument that was interesting, but it never goes anywhere, unfortunately. \n\nThe second act is very similar in that you can tell something strange is going on and you're waiting for the other shoe to drop. Again, the ultimate \"reveal\" isn't very interesting. The third act actually has two interesting characters, but again it's their interaction with each other that is the best part, so you really have nothing to do with that and are just an observer. \n\nUltimately, there isn't enough here to be worth your time or money, but the developer does show some talent that can be built on for future projects.\n\nEdit: Also, my play time is not reflective of game length.

Expect to play this role specifically.\n\n[u][b]Episodes: \"Is this not a whole game?\"[/b][/u]\nIt is Episode 1 of four episodes of the now larger Space Pilgrim series. \nThis \"season\" of four episodes is followed by several other titles including prequels/sequels/back stories. \n\nThe Space Pilgrim universe has evolved rapidly and well in the past four years.\nEpisode 1 consists of three acts, which equaled about 1.5 hours play time, while each episode following is progressively longer and content/quality filled as the developers skills improved.\n\n[u][b]Looks/Navigation:[/b][/u]\nThe environments have an appealing look to them.\nThe ship is laid out fairly logically. The mapping of the rooms is good. \nIt looks and feels like a quirky spaceship.\nThere is not much back and forth walking; you will become confused if you skip the reading or have a derpy moment or two but that is it. Very straight forward and relaxing.\nYou can tell they tried to make the game engaging and not repetitive, but sometimes it is or at the worst it has little replay value. \nBy episode 2 on wards they have vastly improved many of these very minor issues, which are matter of taste any way.\n\nThere is complete mouse support, which is great because there are a lot of things to interact with and moving about is very relaxing with a mouse click. The only pathing issue I have ever had was the cat walking in front of me, which is so minor where you just walk around.\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nThe inventory works well. \nThere were initial issues navigating it and fusing items. This is mainly because the developer chose to tell the player how the inventory works at the very start of the game so by the time you get to doing so you have long forgotten that brief note. \nYou can tell they tried really hard not to impact the story with annoying how-to pop ups\nThere is a journal, which I found useful as a reference point, (*No more lag in journal tab switching.)\n\n[u][b]Soundtrack/Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nThe music is immersive with a nice Mass Effect type feeling, although slightly more retro sounding.\nThe game has a very appealing corny space theme in general. \nI strongly feel like I am playing an episode of Firefly here.\n\n[u][b]Story:[/b][/u]\nThe writing is quite solid if corny and definitely humorous.\nIt is a typical science fiction universe.\nThe future episodes have even better writing and humor.\nThe writing quality ties in with characters and character interaction; the characters are pretty cliched, but not in a bad way. \nYou can have several conversations for minor character development. \nThere are quite a few amusing one liners and the situations the characters get themselves into or discuss just make you chuckle.\n\nI enjoyed the pacing of the story. A few times I found myself interested enough to be guessing what happens next, which means I was engaged, contrary to my first assumptions about an RPG Maker style episodic game, (which usually makes many people iffy to want to invest in.)\n\n[u][b]Conclusion:[/b][/u]\nAll in all, I enjoyed my experience playing this first episode and was grinning as the game transitioned to the credits. \nThere are [b]no[/b] glitches or issues running this game.\nIf I were to describe the story I would compare it to watching an episode of Firefly; \nthe episode has its introduction, then problems arise, then the characters aim is to fix those problems or mysteries which then interestingly unfolds in front of your eyes. \nBy the end of the episode things are wrapped up, leaving you wondering what mysteries and problems will happen next episode...\n\n[u][i]Thanks for a decently designed, written and enjoyable sci-fi game Pilgrim Adventures!\nI am so glad to see you still active with game development in 2019.\nI feel you have talent in this industry and in delivering fun to players.[/i][/u]", "timestamp_created": 1450936239, "timestamp_updated": 1578103947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608825623989105225", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19896668": {"recommendationid": "19896668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196567705", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1450931578}, "language": "english", "review": "Grabbed this game at a cheap price, but I would totally say that it is worth its full price.\nThe full price isnt even a lot of money, its under a dollar guys, \nOkey, so the game is an RPG.
