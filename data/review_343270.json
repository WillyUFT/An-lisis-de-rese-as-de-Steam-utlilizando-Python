The story is not dissimilar to the depth you would see in projects like Amnesia or The Evil Within, but DMH brings the thunder by mixing manga and horror in a big vat of disillusions. The story follows Dis, a short offhand form of the word Disillusion, both bringing back the thematic elements of the game, as well as creating a truly enjoyable main protagonist along the same levels of Steins Gate, Danganronpa V3, and Invasion of the Booby Snatchers. A true revival of the genre, basically The Birth of a Nation if it was a horror game about Manga and Disillusions. I should mention if you like Manga and Horror and Disillusions, this game is particularly down your bowling alley. Anyways, this game reminds me of the time I went over to my pal Mark's place, he was throwing a Halloween party, but he was too busy yartzing in the bathroom because he tried to mix candy corn with gin. So I schmoove my way over to his girlfriend and try to put the moves on her, but it doesn't work so I kicked through the second story hallway window and shred my leg on broken glass and had to go to the hospital for lacerations in a main artery.

Epico.\n\nNow for the review:\nDMH feels more like a joke project or the first game of a new game developer. Despite that, the game gave me a good chuckle with the translation and the \"voice acting\" which ruined the atmoshpere a little.\nStory: (Lvl 1-3)\nWe are playing as Dis, who has gotten an invite by his friend Vigil to visit him in an abandoned, small and old house, inhabitated by mannequinns. After exploring the 1st & 2nd level of the game, we find out that Vigil is that end he got killed, with bombs (Cause of death still unclear). In the 3rd level we play as the policewoman Sui, which investigates an insland on which people died. At the end we find out, that Sui is all behind this and Vigil did nothing.\nNow, the concept of the story it self isnt that bad, but its not believable. It doesnt convince that much.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics arent surely a masterpiece, but also not bad. For a 1\u20ac game, what do you expect? The game didnt look blurry or pixeled. So its fine to me. The artstyle of the characters... well, its manga I guess?\n\nGameplay: \nIn the game you walk around a map and trigger certain events which are marked with \"???\".\nHere is a good example of the japanese horror mannequine clich\u00e9. I am not saying, its bad that is has been used here (even though it was quite a lot) and I wouldnt think of something else, with which you could replace the mannequins. One of the annoying things, is that the camera swings to the happening, not allowing the player to act like he wants. I am sure that it would be more scarier if the player would turn around and the mannequin would stand behind him instead of \"Camera goes WEEEE\". The only things that shocked me, were the jumpscares, but they were even predicitable, so it wasnt that bad.\n\nSound:\nNot gonna lie, its not that bad. But the sound which gets played when you see a mannequinn flying around reminds me of the sound effect which you see in 21st century humor videos.\n\nOverall:\nIf there would have been more effort put in, the game might get good. Its hard to rate this game, since it has something on it, which makes it good. I dont wanna be to harsh.

I found the environments laborious to get through and unfulfilling to explore. The quality of the art was low to mediocre and there were very precious few effort wasted on that either.

It's a pity that there is no more background of the characters, a prequel should do some good to the game.\n- You don't really do much. It's more or less a walking simulator.\n- After the first chapter, it's not too creepy anymore\n- Feels unfinished. I mean, After the third chapter, I wonder what would happen with the characters.

If they are, then the problem is with you and your potato computer. By themselves, the graphics aren't anything to praise, but they're not the worst. They won't age well, though.\n-Simple gameplay (easy to learn).\n\nCons\n-Simple storyline to say the least. If it was actually expanded on in any detail, I might be more forgiving to the game overall.\n-Linear gameplay (not always bad, obviously, but in this case it is a detriment).\n-Other than jumpscares and horror cliches, not too much originality in the horror department, what \"horror\" there is.\n-Simple gameplay (very simple).\n\nSo would I recommend this game to be bought for personal use? Not unless it's on sale, and at that point it's so cheap that the choice to buy it or not will make a miniscule impact on your wallet at best.

The game is spread out across 3 or 4 levels with a different protagonist for each. It's pretty forgettable in terms of quality. Hence why I'm not going to go into detail about it.\n         \n         Okay, enough procrastination, time to talk horror. The few jump scares/events that do occur are not scary at all, they consist of shadow people and the occasional loud noise. I don't feel any atmosphere, the music kinda sucks in atmosphere's respect.\n\n         I think that's it. I applaud the devs for their effort but I personally think it could have been better.

Y no, no se trata de un tutorial para familiarizarse con controles: el juego consiste COMPLETAMENTE en buscar esos s\u00edmbolos por el nivel y acercarse a ellos para ir recolectando fragmentos de conversaci\u00f3n del protagonista. Donde Slender triunfaba al dejarte perdido en un bosque, sin saber hacia d\u00f3nde ir o qu\u00e9 hacer y provoc\u00e1ndote una sensaci\u00f3n de inseguridad y de desorientaci\u00f3n, este juego lo destroza completamente, con un elemento que rompe totalmente la inmersi\u00f3n y que adem\u00e1s convierte en la experiencia en una simple ruta guiada.\n\nHe dicho que cada vez que llegas a tocar uno de esos conjuntos de signos interrogativos aparece una secci\u00f3n de di\u00e1logo, lo que podr\u00eda llevar a pensar que, despu\u00e9s de todo, lo principal del juego radica en su historia, y no en su inmersi\u00f3n. Nada m\u00e1s lejos de la realidad: los fragmentos de texto son insulsos, simplones y, adem\u00e1s, innecesarios. Lo primero que iba a criticar de este juego, antes siquiera de probarlo, era que estuviera traducido a varios idiomas como italiano o franc\u00e9s y no lo estuviera al espa\u00f1ol. Despu\u00e9s de probarlo, puedo decir que casi es una ventaja que no lo est\u00e9. Adem\u00e1s, estos peque\u00f1os textos banales est\u00e1n acompa\u00f1ados de un dibujo del protagonista, muy mal realizado y siempre el mismo, y de una voz en japon\u00e9s, supuestamente. Ah, dios m\u00edo, las voces...\n\nLo primero que uno esperar\u00eda es que la voz dijera lo mismo que est\u00e1 escrito en el texto. Esa era mi impresi\u00f3n las primeras veces, pero resulta que no. Se trata de varias listas de texto le\u00eddas y que se repiten sin cesar. Pero el punto fuerte es, sin duda, la expresividad de esta voz: imaginad a un actor fracasado de tercera, con la mayor resaca de su vida, leyendo en vox alta el texto sin un \u00e1pice de entusiasmo. Pues ese discurso ser\u00eda digno de un premio de doblaje comparado con la mon\u00f3tona voz que vas a escuchar repetirse de forma continua durante todo el juego. \u00a1Ah, eso es lo bueno! Que por lo menos este horror es incre\u00edblemente corto: solamente tres misiones, las dos primeras realizables en menos de 5 minutos y una tercera que se termina en 6 o 7 como mucho. Pero no os cre\u00e1is, que el creador de esta abominaci\u00f3n ha pensado en todo, y esos apenas 15 minutos de juego se os har\u00e1n tan eternos como si llev\u00e1rais varias horas jugado. \u00bfC\u00f3mo? Pues hablemos del control...\n\nSimple y sencillo: cuatro botones para moverte hacia adelante, hacia atr\u00e1s y a los lados. El movimiento del rat\u00f3n para controlar la vista, y el bot\u00f3n E para pasar los insufribles pero gracias a dios cortos textos de di\u00e1logo (m\u00e1s bien mon\u00f3logo). Nuestro personaje se mueve con la gracilidad de un octogenario con artritis, re\u00fama y gota cr\u00f3nica: creo que es el movimiento m\u00e1s lento que he visto en ning\u00fan videojuego, en ocasiones qued\u00e1ndote parado da la impresi\u00f3n de que vas m\u00e1s deprisa que si caminas. Para los impacientes, el bot\u00f3n Q te permite correr... bueno, correr... en realidad, lo que te permite es hacer un peque\u00f1o sprint durante 1 segundo o menos, a una velocidad, como mucho, del doble de tu paso normal, lo que sigue siendo m\u00e1s lento que el paso relajado de una tortuga. Encima, cada vez que pulses el bot\u00f3n Q, lo que ser\u00e1 de forma continua cada 2 segundos (porque adem\u00e1s entre Q y Q tienes un tiempo de espera antes de poder darte semejante carrera), se escucha el sonido del chirrido estridente de dos tuercas oxidadas tratando de moverse (sin duda debe de tratarse del hierro en la cadera de nuestro querido y anciano protagonista). As\u00ed que lo que m\u00e1s vas a escuchar son chirridos continuos y di\u00e1logos repetidos de nuestro soso japon\u00e9s.\n\nPor suerte el resto de sonidos del juego est\u00e1n a la altura del resto del producto. El apartado sonoro est\u00e1 lleno de sonidos toscos, chirriantes, colocados casi al azar y que aparecen de golpe sin ninguna introducci\u00f3n y se cortan con la misma intensidad tonal con la que aparecieron. Un ni\u00f1o de 5 a\u00f1os soplando una trompeta con la misma nota durante una hora resultar\u00eda m\u00e1s relajante que la m\u00fasica de este juego. Se supone que la brusquedad de estos sonidos tiene como cometido el asustar al jugador, uniendo sus esfuerzos a la aparici\u00f3n de dos o tres sombras que se mueven de un lado a otro o de maniqu\u00edes que cambian de lugar o de posici\u00f3n de repente. Ni que decir tiene que la combinaci\u00f3n fracasa estrepitosamente.\n\nEn definitiva, si tienes 15 minutos y necesitas algo que te ponga de mal humor, \u00e9ste es tu juego. Malo, feo y... bueno, baato s\u00ed que es. Aunque claro, si comparamos el precio a su calidad, podemos estar ante uno de los juegos m\u00e1s caros de la historia. \u00a1Ah, s\u00ed, que el juego tiene multijugador! Claro que, como no hab\u00eda nadie con quien jugar, no lo puedo evaluar...", "timestamp_created": 1466893409, "timestamp_updated": 1466893562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173206329345703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23719690": {"recommendationid": "23719690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040803186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1466656577}, "language": "english", "review": "Come on now\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIIkRdkf7W0", "timestamp_created": 1466656850, "timestamp_updated": 1466908152, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473556727170944214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23694803": {"recommendationid": "23694803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287997831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1466893985}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the best horror game ever i would tottaly download it its worth it trust me\n", "timestamp_created": 1466549442, "timestamp_updated": 1466549442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443675875663757324", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23664937": {"recommendationid": "23664937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255770188", "num_games_owned": 2004, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1467639651}, "language": "english", "review": "It is clearly stated that this was originally a mobile game and that is evident.

The graphics are terrible, the voice acting is abysmal and there are major flaws in the game - right in the first chapter, you can actually \"find\" one of the shadows that comes as part of one of the jump scares, as it's not removed from the game after the scare moment is gone. If you walk outside, you can find it just sitting there.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the last chapter of the game tries to be a multiplayer mode. You'd think that last chapter would have more story that would fill in the blanks of the first three chapters, but nope - it's just a large level that attempts to pit players against each other, as you can set up scare traps and follow other players' footsteps while looking for clues at the same time. It's not actually a bad idea. The problem is... No one is playing it. There were two servers available, both of which were empty.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the game is incredibly short (you can finish it in less than an hour, possibly less than half an hour), has a 3-stars score system that makes no sense (I completed chapter 2 as quickly as possible while completing all events and still got only 2 stars) and has a story that is still left filled with questions once you've played all chapters.\n\nSo, why do I recommend the game despite all these flaws?\n\nAs bad as the game might be, it has its own charm, in a way. It's actually decently scary, even if mostly all scare events are predictable, and the game leaves no breathing space - unless you stop playing, it's one jump scare right after the other. And I'd be willing to bet that the game is actually a lot scarier if you're playing it with a VR set.\n\nFor the ridiculously low price it has, I'd recommend it as a one time experience. if you're a fan of horror games.

She also killed them because they were disobedient and annoying wow teacher of the year. Also Dis leaves purgatory to go visit the place his friends died believing he killed them to mourn for them? Also if she was a teacher how did she become a police officer, get a police cruiser, go to the island after someone who broke into the police scene and know that it was Dis (who she dosent even mention his name just calls him \"the boy I framed for my murderous spree\". How does that make any sense? Also if she is some kind of demon why couldnt she open the big oak door? How did Dis escape purgatory? What actually happened? There are so many holes in plot that werent filled, that were inconsistent or didnt make sense.\n- There are very few different jumpscares mannequins, gourney, shadows, random noises and moving objects.\n- Also it was only partially voiced and the voicing was only in japenese.\n- 2 second sprint is killing me it only last 2 SECONDS and the character is so slow.\n- You cant get three stars in the game only two, whats the point in having three stars if you can only earn two of them?\n\n\nI have to admit I did like the pier thing where the pier was falling apart and you had to run while it was falling behind you. But overall the game was stupid and was just thrown together, also why would a demon need to make bombs in order to blow up part of an island and murder a bunch of school kids? none of the plot makes sense and why was there a bomb making thing in Dis's house in purgatory if he wasnt even the murderer in the first place? seriously none of the plot makes sense.

Well, there are cards, if you are into that. And it's short, so your torture is nice, short and sweet. \n\nOh, and there's multiplayer, but I don't know if it's broken or not.

SORRY, NO. These are not excuses goddammit.\n\n-Level design is bad, it is way too harsh: it looks like someone cut pieces of planes, polygons & models with an axe before assembling them. They are too empty too.\n-Textures are horrible. Seriously, that's not the first time there is this problem in this kind of games! STOP using this much bump mapping!! STOP, THIS IS REALLY DISGUSTING!!! Also, not enough/not any specular on various textures. They don't look natural and are too dark.\n-Cheap jumpscares everywhere with moving shadows and mannequins. How original. How unscary.\n-Too much forced camera movements. You can do this sometimes to make the player see something that happens but don't abuse of it, here this is too much.\n-Multiplayer mode is not really funny to play at all so it's disappointing.\n-Google translated game. I tried French, saw the massacre, instantly switched to English. If you want someone to update/correct this for free PM me dev.\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n-Story was not super innovative... at least there was an attempt, ok. End was predictable and a little clich\u00e9 but that was not a problem for me. Too short though.\n-Anime character sprites are not so bad but they could use more details (like at least some shadows).\n-The jumpscares were too cheap and repetitive like I said BESIDES two events that were actually not too bad, I'm talking about [spoiler]the walls that disolve at the end of chapter 2, reminded me of Silent Hill 3, plus the final event of chapter 3, with the books flying around and so on[/spoiler].\n-Text describing various things, events... maybe a little too much but I liked the idea.\n\nI can't really recommend this game, even at this low price. This should be free.\nThis project lacks of details and attention, especially those pretty crappy textures. I'm sorry but NO, this is a REAL problem that happens too often. It is not hard to make nice looking textures damn, or at least ones which have the right amount of bump, spec, illumination, etc..\n\nTL;DR: even with a huge discount I can't recommend it.

In Disillusions we play as two characters, Dis and Sui. Dis visits an island that was once ravaged by a serial killer and Sui is there to check it out. I can't understand what the hell this game is even about. The dialogue is hilariously bad and the voice acting made me laugh out loud. Putting the story aside the gameplay is garbage, it's just walking around running into question marks to read about the story more. The game only has 3 chapters and chapter 4 is multiplayer mode which of course no one plays. The graphics are nothing too special and since the developer admitted that i'm not gonna judge the graphics. Overall there's not a lot to say about Disillusions Manga Horror, this game is mediocre at best and i for the price i really can't recommend it unless you get it in a bundle or at a discount you can safely check it out. If you're looking for a dose of good horror go somewhere else.

Decisions need to be made here: was this an intentionally  or unintentionally bad game? I am leaning in the intentionally bad direction with this one. It's essentially a walking simulator with ridiculous attempts at jump scares (creepy mannequins moving around, random camera jumps to basically mundane items like a piano or a bookshelf, shadowy creatures, and so on). The story itself was 100% predictable, lol. The graphics themselves are fairly typical of Unity engine games. Nothing of note good or bad. \nYou dont actually click on anything. Events are unlocked mostly by question marks that you walk into., which then trigger whatever may or may not happen next lol. The dialogue is obviously ridiculous.\nThe music however was pretty cool such as it is.\n\nAlso, there are trading cards, and at the time of this review, they are shockingly selling for 20+ cents a piece.\n\nhmmm...do I rate this as a positive or a negative. \n\nI'm going with a real rating of 2 out of 10, but an intentionally bad rating of 6.5 out of 10. That averages out to what, 4.25? That settles it. Thumbs down. However, for a buck, I'df still recommend buying it just for shits and giggles. So, thumbs up?\n\nbtw...this game has multiplayer.

For example: [spoiler]the hammer flew at me when I wasn't in front of the window, but to the side of it. Because I couldn't see the hammer, I wasn't startled at all.[/spoiler]\nEven though the story is very short, the jumpscares were fairly repetitive. For example: [spoiler]the mannequins move. All of them! After the first two I got the drill and they didn't startle me at all after that.[/spoiler]\n...I do have to admit I played this game during the day and without headphones, because I scare very easily. (But that doesn't mean none of the jumpscares got me! It's just, as soon as I was able to predict them, they didn't scare me anymore.)\n\nThe voice acting would've been a nice touch, if the acting wasn't so bad. \"Ah. It's a ghost.\" --> that didn't sound like the character was scared at all. It sounds like someone's just speaking the words from the page, without visualising an actual scary scene. (Were the voice actors chosen simply because they could speak Japanese? I'm not sure if this game was originally Japanese or not, but I'm guessing it wasn't.) Anyway, voice acting is nice and all, but without professional actors it just deducts from the whole experience. \nIn this case I'd say: maybe give the player the option to turn the voices off. Cause every time they started talking (out loud, I mean) the creepy atmosphere disappeared.\n\nAfter having started the third chapter I wondered why the first two chapters weren't added together to make one chapter. That's because there is suddenly a different main character for the last chapter. I mean, I understand that there's three chapters because of the three locations, but I still think it would've been better to have two chapters with two different protagonists. What do you think?\n\nI really didn't expect the twist at the end of the second chapter, because I was thinking we'd be following DiS for the duration of the three chapters and it's the kind of twist you'd expect at the end of all things. \nThe twist at the end of the third chapter, on the other hand, was not unexpected AT ALL. The story kept hinting at [spoiler]Sui's mental disorder[/spoiler] in a not-so-subtle way - like [spoiler]when she looks at the caf\u00e9 and goes like \"those people deserved it, teehee\"[/spoiler] - kind of like the mannequins I was talking about earlier (in the second spoiler).\n\nThe anime art style was quite nice, I really liked it! \nI just didn't understand Sui's alternate costume: it's not in the game proper, only in the options menu, but just its being there tells the player a lot about Sui. [spoiler]For me, it spoiled the twist that, gasp, omg, Sui was the murderer! There's gotta be something wrong with anyone who dresses like that. ;)[/spoiler]\nI'm not sure about the virtual environment, uh, like, I mean the backgrounds and mannequins and stuff: it didn't look very special to me, just another Unity horror game, I guess.\n\nI didn't make use of the VR support, because I don't have an Oculus Rift. (VR horror games just creep me out way too much!)\n\nI'm giving the review a thumbs up because I intend to play it again sometime. It's short enough for that. Maybe I'll try to beat the high score.\n\n---\n\nAll in all I didn't think it was a bad game [i]per se[/i], but I do think it would've been better if this game were free. \nI'm not trying to rob you of your income here, but it seems like this game was more of an experiment than a full-fledged, actual, finished game. There were too many clich\u00e9s (storywise) and not enough actual horror/jumpscares (see mannequins and hammer mentioned earlier).\nI don't think you deserve the tone in which some people have reviewed this game, I really don't. But that's not to say I disagree with some of the points they've made.\n\nHope this helps!
