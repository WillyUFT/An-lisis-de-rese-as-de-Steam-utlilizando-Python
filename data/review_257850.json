I get they're going for visual storytelling, but with how vague everything is, it just seems to be wasting my time. See Noita for a good mystical opening. Also, this game is pretty buggy. Managed to get stuck in a combat arena that wouldn't open back up even after I killed the enemies inside it, and the first boss's attacks, these jars, would disappear midair if I baited a melee attack, and I figured out after a minute you can bait him into meleeing over and over until the whole boss fight is just dash swipe swipe dash, dash swipe swipe dash. Not a promising start. The atmosphere is great, art is great, very good intrigue, but I get the feeling that will be of little comfort when I run into the boss that's harder because of the bugs rather than easier.\n\nFinished the game, SPOILERS AHEAD:\nI had this whole essay comparing this game to others of its genre, but the ending of this game sucks so bad I don't even want to think about it anymore. Nothing is elaborated on, nothing is explained, there is nowhere further to look for details about the world. There are no secret final areas, or bosses, or characters. The setup in the beginning of \"go fix the four pillars and kill the boss\" goes off without a hitch. The NPCs you run into are not characters, they're 24 pixels and a bit of fan art that invites you to imagine what a cool life they had before you started playing this game. This game is beautiful, with great art and visual design, but it has no story, just a bunch of setting and a puppet protagonist who kills the enemies, moves into the next room, and kills the enemies again. The most this game can do for puzzles are literally invisible platforms and perspective tricks hiding hidden paths. I don't regret the first three hours, but I sure as hell regret the rest of my playtime trying to find anything else to build on this world's lore. And now, having finished the game, I am not haunted by the protagonist's cookie-cutter sacrifice, I am bored.\n\nAlso, if you're in need of a laugh, read this game's wiki.

The player needs some keen eye to find hints leading to hidden spots, but they are there and it feels very rewarding to discover new areas. Visuals and atmosphere are also very compelling and captivating, the game is overall very nice to look at as well as being somewhat chill and soothing to explore.\n\nIn contrast, story and navigability are among the worst you can find in its genre. The map is, without mincing words, the most useless I've ever seen in a Metroidvania and completely ruins any fun or satisfaction deriving from exploration; your exact location is never pinpointed but you can only get an indication of the macroarea you're currently in, then you're supposed to figure out the exact spot by looking at landmarks. This somewhat works while on the surface, but in the dungeons there are no landmarks whatsoever and it's nearly impossible to even figure out where the access to each subterranean area is located. Even worse, there's no way to mark places or keep track of found items. You're supposed to blindly return in each area to look for the stuff you've left behind each time you get some new key or powerup, and even then you have no way to know whether you've cleared a zone or not. There was absolutely no reason to make navigation and progress tracking so needlessly obtuse and inconvenient. Personally, I've only managed to complete the game by using [url=https://hyper-light-drifter-map.de/]this interactive map[/url] that makes everything immensely more manageable, but is it positive when you have to rely on the work of someone else other than the original developer to make a game worth playing? I really don't think so. This game's map is either a deliberate excercise in gratuitous crypticity or a massive design failure. Either way, it sucks on an astronomical level.\n\nThen there's the story and worldbuilding, which can be summed up with: [b]go figure[/b]. Except for the intro and the ending cinematics you don't get a single clue about what the hell is going on throughout the whole game. There are some monolyths to be found written in a cyphered language, but even if you go through all the hassle of translating them - I didn't, I just googled - the only thing you're left with is an extremely vague poem about some immortal cell that got corrupted and is completely up to interpretation - which nowadays, is just the convenient excuse for not writing anything by yourself. But of course people LOVE to make shit up and have filled entire wikis with completely \"inferred\" -i.e. invented - facts. It's even worse than Dark Souls.\n\nI haven't mentioned the combat system, since it's the part I find most basic; it's neither bad nor particularly good, it works most of the time but it shows its limits in the arenas. I still managed to complete them without too much hassle, so it's ok I guess.\n\nOverall, it was very disappointing to see a game with such potential being wasted by a deadly combination of very bad design choices and lazy writing. If i had to be generous I'd say that Hyper Light Drifter is 40% good, 40% bad and 20% mediocre - which makes for a pretty mediocre experience overall. But there are no neutral or detailed options for the final evaluation, so it's a thumbs down for me.

The game was released at the end of March 2016 on Steam and was developed on an old build of GameMaker. In the game, you play as the titular \u201cDrifter\u201d, dashing, shooting and slicing your way through a silent world, filled only by images and the occasional, meaningless grunts of nearby NPCs. The world is a dying, dreamlike Fantasy, somewhere between the neo-noire of Katana Zero and the colorful High Fantasy of Zelda, with an atmospheric soundtrack by one of gaming\u2019s finest composers: Disasterpeace.\n\n[h1]PROs[/h1]\n+ Stellar Soundtrack and Sound Design\n+ Stunning Visuals, Pixel Art and Cutscenes\n+ An atmosphere that you could cut with a knife\n+ Beautiful character and enemy designs, some complex, some perfectly simple\n+ A great, rhythmic hack-and-slash combat system\n+ A rich, main narrative metaphor and fantastic side stories, spoken only through a series of three images from a few, important NPCs and encrypted monoliths\n+ Fantastic bosses\n+ Fantastic feeling of urgency\n\n[h1]CONs[/h1]\n- Framerate drops and stuttering on modern systems (potential fixes in the comments)\n- At times, finicky, unresponsive feeling controls\n- Janky hit stun mechanics, that can lead to instant death by stunlock\n- Inconsistent hitboxes, especially for enemies and objects that are below the player and up against a wall\n- Repeated, unskippable cutscene (rather short, but meaningless)\n- Missing QoL features when looking for secrets and some secrets not being at all telegraphed\n- Bugs still left in the game, some game-breaking (my save was experiencing a fatal error of some sort randomly, prompting me to restart)\n- Inconsistent Enemy Behavior and Dodge timings\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\nYou play as \u201cThe Drifter\u201d chasing a cure for a mysterious corruption besetting him and slowly overwhelming his body, killing him in a war of attrition. You race through four different quadrants of the world, split in the four cardinal directions from the game\u2019s main starting area (the town). Progressing ever farther through this strange and beautifully mysterious landscape, partly overwhelmed by technology, both dead and alive. The game is very somber all the way through, but in a deeply beautiful and affecting way.\nThe game starts off with a cutscene detailing all of the above, a cutscene that is unskippable, even on New Game+. Then you\u2019re put into a tutorial, where, at the end, you\u2019re attacked by a mysterious monster, who appears as a recurring, main antagonist, and the seeming cause of the world\u2019s ills, and your own deathly ailment. The cutscene of this main antagonist encounter plays around five times throughout the game\u2019s runtime, with only slight variations. This cutscene is also unskippable and is, unfortunately, the one place where the game\u2019s audio balancing goes haywire, producing ear-rending audio, an odd, though ostensibly deliberate choice.\nOver time, by picking up \u201cgearbits\u201d, which are yellow chips that drop from enemies, bosses and crates hidden in the game\u2019s secret areas, you are able to upgrade The Drifter\u2019s dashing, slicing and his guns, which you acquire more of over the course of the game. The upgrades are serviceable for a game of Hyper Light Drifter\u2019s runtime, which is around 5-6 hours, when simply going for first time completion, without picking up everything in the game.\nSome of the game\u2019s side challenges, such as chaining your dash 800 times in a row and beating a comically strong, little hooded figure at football are shoddily built or simply annoying. The same goes for some of the game\u2019s achievements, such as \u201cOne Shot\u201d, which requires the player to beat the whole game without dying; a game where dodges, enemy behaviors, hitboxes and the ever-looming potential for cheap stunlocks leave much to be desired.\nAnimation, art, music, worldbuilding, exploration, character and enemy design and animation are all stellar, however, and the story is truly a thing of marvel. The audio design (apart from the one aforementioned cutscene) is equally great. It is a very special game, that I believe everyone should experience, while keeping in mind the caveats of its technical limitations, such as unstable framerates without workarounds on modern hardware, due to the game\u2019s development on an early version of GameMaker, and all of the issues and jankiness mentioned throughout the review. There are community guides and stellar workarounds to some of the game\u2019s archaic game design, such as the online locator for missing gearbits and a save file backup tool, that can replace the game\u2019s lacking steam cloud features. Backing up your save in an extra folder, to potentially protect against game-breaking bugs, which still seem to infrequently appear, is strongly recommended.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nHyper Light Drifter is a labor of love, beyond the shadow of a doubt. A game and world conceived by Alx Preston, planned as a potential, final soiree to a life wrought with serious medical harships, that could end at any moment due to a deathly illness of the heart. The game plays with this idea of a failing core or failing heart a lot, and the concept is already ingrained in the studio\u2019s name. It is a beautiful piece of art, one that I encourage everyone to experience, even if simply out of respect for Alx\u2019s journey. Some additional materials will be included in the review\u2019s comments.\n\n[h2]Thank You To Heart Machine And Alx Preston For Sharing With Us Their Beautiful Vision![/h2]", "timestamp_created": 1696152912, "timestamp_updated": 1696152940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803258657455444", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147410650": {"recommendationid": "147410650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133690991", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1696139587}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficult but extremely fun and atmospheric.", "timestamp_created": 1696139604, "timestamp_updated": 1696139604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508196711540222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147404136": {"recommendationid": "147404136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798480829", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 579, "last_played": 1696129831}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego de acci\u00f3n y aventura que tiene la dificultad justa para disfrutarse y estar en \u201cla zona\u201d: desde la dificultad de los jefes hasta la exigencia en la exploraci\u00f3n, imprescindible para avanzar en el juego.

From the start the story is extremely intriguing, coupled with a slamming sound track that takes you on an ambient journey. There is no doubt the music just amplifies this experience 10 fold. I feel like this game has created a very unique atmosphere and \"feel\" to the game, no other has captured before. I have only spent <2hrs in the game so far, however I plan on completing the game, just a play through should suffice, I personally don't see the need to 100% it, or \"complete\" it. I am happy to play it through as intended, I especially like how dying just sends you back a little bit and you learn more each time you die. if you spend time mastering the controls the game rewards you. Really really cool and interesting game, it's very hard to explain but if you try the game you'll get this awestruck, intrigued, cosmic thriller experience all wrapped up into a journey like no-other I have played. \n\nI write just chill and honest reviews about how I feel about games, hopefully this helped someone :)\n\nEdit: 11/10/23 - I just finished most of the stuff in the game, I just kept coming back. Thinking about it! I struggled with only 2 of the module locations and was pleasantly surprised how close I was multiple times, but I just missed it. Doing the dash challenge is not as easy as some make out. It's a game I think I'll come back to in like a year. I love all the above and agree with what I wrote.

I had NO CLUE about this because the game doesn't tell you this, and I only learned what was under the surface when I wanted to start unlocking stuff and looked up a guide. Hidden areas are marked with symbols that could very easily blend into the rest of the scenery, and the game is entirely void of dialogue or overt direction (an intentional stylistic choice that is unfortunately to its detriment in this aspect).

The game does an amazing job of revealing things to you over time, but not in a clear way. It relies on the intelligence of the player to figure out what is going on, because nothing is explained other than giving a general direction of where you need to go. But eventually you start figuring out what the main objectives are, where to look to find secrets in the world, and what the items you collect do. There are a handful of collectibles and each one is a mystery until you happen upon an area where its function is made clear. For example, the yellow currencies build up over time, but I did not realize they were used to buy upgrades until returning to the village after the first boss.\n\nThe exploration is very enjoyable, however I think it becomes a bit too easy to find everything when you realize the trick. Most of the hidden things are just a matter of looking for a symbol on the ground to indicate invisible walkways or a platform out of sight. Although I say that and I missed a bunch of collectibles on my first go through. Also, it would be nice if there was a better in game way to track items found that makes it easy to go through and get the things you missed. The only thing that is marked clearly are the 8 nodes per area. I wish there was a way to easily find where I am missing keys and the yellow gear currency, as well as a way to mark doors that I have not opened, since it can be hard to remember where they are after the fact.\n\nThe world is also beautifully done in pixel art. Each area has an interesting color palette and regional style that makes them distinct, and they also have unique enemies to each area that provide a steadily increasing challenge that requires you to alter your combat a bit.\n\nFinally, the combat feels simple but fun.

The incredibly detailed and well animated pixel art is accompanied by an equally wonderful score by Disasterpiece that captures the ethereal decaying atmosphere perfectly.\n\nThe story is intentionally enigmatic with only the animated intro providing context and while it leaves us with more questions than answers thankfully we don't need any to progress. Four directions to go in and by the time we reach the end any one we understand the game's logic - explore, fight, gather collectibles, beat the boss, grow in power.\n\nCombat is reactive and punishing as you master dashing, slashing, and shooting. It's a volatile playstyle that lets you be aggressive - too much though and you can lunge right into attacks. The enemies are also completely different in each area offering a variety of tactics that keeps things fresh. Each boss also acts as a 'super' version of the monster faction that will test your skill against their unique style of fighting.\n\nThe world is genuinely beautiful and each biome is uniquely distorted by the on-going corruption, from crystalline forests and flooded ruins to polluted factories and frozen mountain caverns, and more. The soft world building lends to the world's mystery only offering glimpses at the larger goings on with sights that had me genuinely pause to take it in. It's also filled with secrets and collectibles that invite you to explore every inch.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is an artistic masterpiece and while combat is challenging throughout it does borrow a little too much from Souls with the narrow health, hefty damage, and instant heal mechanic (as many games seem to aim for now days). That said combat never gets tedious even if it can be repetitive, and that's a small blemish on a vast canvas with so many more positives than negatives.

The guns feel nice, or most of them atleast do, but I found myself only really using one of the piercing weapons since it far outperformed every other weapon in most combat situations.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the dash mechanic, at first it's like \"woo I'm going fast\" but it's super jank and required for most of the game, it's esspecially bad once the game expects you do have an optional upgrade to complete puzzles required for beating the game, an upgrade which I could've just not gotten at the shop which would've locked me behind grinding. Once you finally do get the upgrade you'll quickly find how it's even more jank than dashing by itself.\n\nThe last gameplay related thing I wanna mention is that I often found myself hitting the menu/map button and die during combat since opening the menu doesn't actually pause the game and just lets you die while you panic.\n\nOne of the ups the game does have for me is that the music is and sound fx are really nice and well made, but the glaring problem is that you have NO way of turning down the cutscene volume in the settings so it just blows out your ear drums every time.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a 3.5 or a 4/10, if you think it's a game you might like due to it's metriodvania / zelda like gameplay as I did then please take my above points into account before buying it, and remember you can get a refund if you play less than 2 hours within the first 2 weeks of you buying the game.\n\nEnglish is my third language, so I hope this kinda made sense.", "timestamp_created": 1688397239, "timestamp_updated": 1688397560, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436507940292358398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141219139": {"recommendationid": "141219139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056178083", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1692568008}, "language": "english", "review": "I have this game on Epic as a freebie and completed everything it has to offer. I bought it here. That should be an indicator of how good this is. If you want to dodge my lengthy writing style, the TLDR is that it's well worth your 20 dollars and your time.\n\n\n\nHyper Light Drifter may be the best experience I've ever had in any game I've played. Note that word \"experience\". It's not any individual aspect of Hyper Light Drifter that made me love it so much, but how it all culminates in a near-transcendent experience that completely floored me with its quality. I've never in my time playing games been so taken aback by a non-story related event in a game that I had to stop playing and soak it in. It happened two times within the span of half an hour here. This quality makes it difficult to explain convincingly, but I promise that if you dig what this game is putting down on a surface level, you will see what I mean after giving it a chance to do its thing.\n\nAs far as a basic synopsis of systems go, it's got simple yet satisfying and responsive combat based around comboing gunshots from a handful of varied weapons and a small pool of blade related attacks to regain ammo. The general gameplay feels like a mixture off Zelda and Metroid, focused around exploration of absolutely stunningly rendered pixel art environments. The music is some of the best I've heard in any game when taken within the contexts it's presented here, and each and every track is a masterpiece, albeit not half as traditionally earwormy as what rises to the top of game music discussion. The story is told wordlessly through environment and small picture based dialogue from a small handful of NPCs, and despite its cryptic nature (which provides solid reason to replay among many other things) ends with a heavy impact. As I said before, while solid, none of these elements [spoiler] Except the music, and you can fight me on that. [/spoiler] alone is the best of any game I've played, but it absolutely smashes [u] every single game I have ever played in my life [/u] with the finesse it displays when weaving it all together.\n\nAs a closer, I'm going to discuss playtime since I have relatively few hours here compared to my Epic account. In total between the two platforms I have about 40 hours. I think this is a relatively accurate pin on what you can expect if you do everything this game has in each of its alternate modes starts post-finish. It's nothing of a cost to playtime ratio compared to the forever games common these days, but I promise you that the experience this delivers will stick with you far longer and far stronger than the hundreds of hours you pour into a roguelike or multiplayer title. It's easily worth the entry cost, and I doubt many interested in the systems I described briefly earlier will have anything but a fantastic time with it.", "timestamp_created": 1688395974,

Which means that the important part is always to go somewhere. It can give you the feeling of being turned around in the wilderness, of thinking you might know the way forward or the way back, and only being bale to know for sure by taking a path.

Hyper Light Drifter is a culmination of so many excellent and unique ideas, on every level of its design and execution, that you can't help but feel it's some higher level of art that can only be experienced in this medium of video games. \n\nI think something that immediately stands out right from when you start the game is that there isn't any voice acting... and there isn't any dialogue or readable language anywhere in the game beyond the start menu and the pause menu. The story is masterfully crafted and told through visuals alone, and the environmental storytelling is so rich that you can clearly connect some dots with the world building, and the ancient civilizations, and the struggles of the inhabitants of the land. It is hard to explain without playing it, but it's something I really appreciated because I felt like I was the one putting the puzzle pieces of the narrative together as I recall flashes of images and the environment and string it together into a crazy weaving plot. Very cool.\n\nSpeaking of environments, these are breathtakingly beautiful. All the sprite work is phenomenal as well. There's some spots where I just sat looking at how pristine the landscapes were. Man. They did such a good job. Very beautiful game.\n\nThe soundtrack is another thing. Incredibly atmospheric. Sets the tone exceptionally well. You'll hear a few background instruments hum mysteriously as you traverse the dreary land, you'll hear a couple more frenetic yet excellent sounding battle tracks, and a couple of tracks in between. In any case, you can be certain that your time in Hyper Light Drifter will be well accented with appropriately delectable music.\n\nAnd what is it that you'll do in Hyper Light Drifter? I've yet to mention the combat, and besides exploring and some simple platforming puzzles, it is the bread and butter of the game. It's simple to learn, but hard to master. You have limited ammo and a couple gun types for long range attacks, and you have a sword for short range attacks. Landing sword hits returns ammo to your equipped gun. There's also a dodge that makes you briefly invincible. You'll traverse the world fighting enemies and getting upgrades (in a very very loose metroid-vania fashion), with your main task being to collect 4 of an item, in order to face a final boss.\n\nCombat is fast and fluid. The enemies are unique and it's fun learning to counter each one and their individual move sets. Bosses and mini bosses abound and they are really fun to challenge. But if you find this to be too easy, you get a much harder difficulty after your first completion of the game. I found the difficulty curve on normal to be perfectly paced, and when I finished I did think I was well prepared to try the more challenging difficulty.\n\nUltimately, I really fell in love with Hyper Light Drifter and would recommend it to just about anybody. These days you can find it for pretty cheap, as it is quite a number of years old now, but it is such a good game that  I think it's well worth your time, and your money. If you're on the fence get it! I really believe it is worth the journey and experience, and I hope that many more people continue to get the opportunity to play it. Thanks to my bud for gifting this to me over the holidays! I played literally all of it on plane rides lol (hence the offline playtime that did not count)", "timestamp_created": 1687817671, "timestamp_updated": 1687817671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606772243976593018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140738657": {"recommendationid": "140738657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969168388", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1686884896}, "language": "english", "review": "Hyper Light Drifter is a truly stunning game that I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys exploration and challenging gameplay. The game takes place in a beautiful, vast and ruined world filled with dangers and lost technologies.\n\nOne of the things I love most about Hyper Light Drifter is its level design. Each level is intricately designed and offers a unique challenge to players. The game's puzzles are also well-designed and offer a perfect balance of challenge and reward.\n\nThe game's music is also fantastic. The soundtrack perfectly captures the mood and atmosphere of the game, and the music is both hauntingly beautiful and perfectly timed. The sound effects are also well-done and add to the immersion of the game.\n\nHowever, the one downside to Hyper Light Drifter is its somewhat stiff controls. While the game's mechanics are well-designed, the controls can feel a bit clunky and unresponsive at times. This can be frustrating when trying to navigate through difficult levels or engage in combat.\n\nOverall, Hyper Light Drifter is an excellent game that I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys challenging gameplay and beautiful visuals.

After 10, I had made up a few new curse words and temporarily damaged my gamepad. By the time I stopped counting I was just running through the motions, but was inching closer to finally beating him. Finally, I landed the death blow \u2013 but was killed at the exact moment that I killed him. I respawned, angry but determined to finally take him down once and for all. But he was already dead. Apparently, I had killed him just before he had killed me, and although I respawned, he did not. The win felt hollow. Unearned. I believe this may be the first time I have ever been disappointed after defeating a difficult enemy in a game.\n\nThis was the first and only moment of disappointment I felt when playing Hyper Light Drifter.\n\nTo call Hyper Light Drifter a good game is a disservice. It is enthralling, spellbinding, captivating, and any other multi-syllable complimentary term you can think of. \u201cRetro-inspired\u201d independent games are hardly rare, and yet the \u201cinspired\u201d part more often than not applies primarily, if not exclusively, to the art style. While Hyper Light Drifter has stunning pixel art, the game itself, its very essence, draws inspiration from some of gaming\u2019s greatest pioneers. The unforgiving difficulty, fantastical setting, and wordless story blend together seamlessly, marrying the novel with the familiar with the type of synergy that that many have attempted and few have achieved so effectively.\n\nWhen the game opens, you don\u2019t know who you are or how you found yourself in this neon post-apocalyptic wonderland. Your enigmatic protagonist is alone, wandering aimlessly on a desperate mission to find something. The land is ruined, and the few who remain seem as lost as you. The story is not explicitly spelled out, rather serves as the implied tale of a mysterious figure desperately trying to survive both his environment and his own body and mind. There are no conversations \u2013 any stragglers you attempt to interact with respond with incoherent shapes (a foreign language, perhaps) or short, one sided pictographic conversations. Not a word is uttered, to you or to your character. Rather, the tale unfolds using the dystopian atmosphere as the sole means of conveying the narrative \u2013 a daring approach, and one that would likely fail with lesser titles. This particular game, however, delivers masterfully, grabbing me from the first scene and holding firm until the finale.\n\nExploration is key in Hyper Light Drifter, from the overall goal \u2013 which you don\u2019t know \u2013 to which way you are supposed to go \u2013 which you also don\u2019t know. You\u2019re almost immediately greeted by multiple paths, which each individually lead to more paths, dead ends, and a fair amount of backtracking that manages to never feel irritating. The landscape dances the line between Escherian and Hyrulean, splattered with a seemingly unending swarm of hellish beasts and savage post-apocalyptic soldiers. There is no \u201cempty space\u201d in the game. Even dead ends hold the possibility of finding a much needed health pack or an additional piece of currency. The four main areas of the game have both a distinctive aesthetic and unique adversaries \u2013 which leads us to the best part of Hyper Light Drifter: the combat.\n\nCombat is equally frantic and methodical, with your character balancing calculated evasive dashes with desperate swordsmanship. Button mashing will land you in a grave, with the game giving you multiple weapons and demanding that you master each of them. Slashing with your sword is limited, requiring specific timing and cool-down periods. Firearms have limited ammunition, which can be recharged by either cutting down items (like bushes, pots, or crystals) or by slashing enemies. The type of enemy you will face, and the density with which they appear, changes rapidly. It\u2019s not uncommon to be trapped in a cordoned off area with ten or more enemies with varying movements, skills, and threat levels. In every different encounter you have to quickly assess the situation, size up the movements of the enemies you\u2019ll be facing, and determine which weapons to use, whether or not you have time to carefully aim a firearm, when to dash, and most importantly, who to take out first.\n\nThe environment itself poses just as much of a threat as your rivals, with disappearing sections of flooring, crystals that spring from the ground and impale you, and flames that shoot from vents should you step just a bit too close. Both combat and navigation call for precise refinement and finesse that, somehow, does not feel suffocating. The game is punishing, but it is also fair. If you think health packs are going to carry you through the game, think again. Your health is limited, and even packing away a few healing agents will do you no good when you\u2019re facing off against swarms of enemies without a plan in place. However, when you are killed you will respawn nearby with all of the items that you had prior to dying.\n\nUpgrades are available for purchase, and range from the ability to carry additional health packs to improved dashing techniques. In order to obtain these upgrades, you must collect the in-game currency, which presents in the form of small golden chips. Four individual chips fit together to create one piece of currency \u2013 think The Legend of Zelda\u2018s heart containers \u2013 and most upgrades require two or three pieces of currency.\n\nThe stunning aesthetics and spellbinding journey are emphasized by evocative music. For a story that is told without words, music is paramount. Exploration is accompanied by somber tracks which build organically as you approach an enemy, culminating in a grand, urgent score for boss fights.\n\nThe only true complaint I can muster is that the keyboard and mouse controls are terrible \u2013 however, you are advised when the game is booting up that it is best played with a controller, so to hold this point against Heart Machine would be a bit unfair.\n\nThroughout the first few areas I was completely lost, with no clue where any particular path would lead me, what would greet me at the end of the path, or whether or not I would succumb to external or internal forces. Shortly after I found myself engaged in frantic combat, immersed in an inscrutable yet downright captivating story that held strong right until the satisfying finale. It is an enchanting, haunting title that masterfully captures the excitement and the fear of the unknown. My time with Hyper Light Drifter feels more like a place that I once visited than a game that I once played.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a breathtaking game that draws heavily from gaming\u2019s most prominent pioneers without relying too heavily on their influence. It is an eclectic masterpiece that feels more like an experience than a video game.", "timestamp_created": 1686169171, "timestamp_updated": 1687715256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705347001552581787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139684778": {"recommendationid": "139684778", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079162939", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1686499890}, "language": "english", "review": "The invincibility frames are less present than my dad, my dad doesn't have a gorgeous artstyle though unlike this game", "timestamp_created": 1686140658, "timestamp_updated": 1686140658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139675123": {"recommendationid": "139675123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865073231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 955, "last_played": 1690566211}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendado, muy buen juego.

Este juego propone un combate con un alto ritmo, nos espera una alta cantidad de enemigos con  mec\u00e1nicas diferentes cada uno a la vez que ofrece al jugador herramientas variadas para enfrentarse a ellos combin\u00e1ndolas siendo realmente muy satisfactorio acabar con una sala llena de enemigos y trampas. Y funciona bien el combate? FUNCIONA MUY BIEN, retante, divertido, con posibilidades. Hay algo mas aparte de luchar? Bueno, alg\u00fan interruptor escondido o trampas pero son minor\u00eda.\n\nComo contrapunto no profundiza en la parte rpg. Solo tenemos un pueblo, no hay di\u00e1logos (de esto hablo luego), hay pocas mejoras del personaje. Esto no es malo, es una decisi\u00f3n de estudio imagino que tambi\u00e9n condicionada por el presupuesto (vienen de un Kickstarter).\n\nOfrece un mundo de fantas\u00eda futurista muy chatarrero, unas razas que someten a otras y sufrimiento por doquier. Combina un 2d con una gama de colores limitada que luce bien (me gustan especialmente las zonas norte y este) y muy bien animado. Alg\u00fan personaje canta un poco (ese perro de la plaza central lo he visto en la Atari 2600) pero son los menos.\n\nEs minimalista y parco en palabras, no hay di\u00e1logos ni apenas mensajes en pantallas, los pocos NPCs con los que interact\u00faas te muestras unas escenas para explicarte algo. Yo personalmente encuentro a faltar un poco de explicaci\u00f3n de que efecto tiene un traje o una pistola que recoges, e incluso desbloquear algo que permita entender que dicen los NPCs. Un mapa que permitiera dejar notas o con m\u00e1s datos tampoco ir\u00eda mal.\n\nLa m\u00fasica no sabr\u00eda clasificarla pero parece una mezcla de lofi con algo de synthwave. Me gusta, tiene personalidad y se disfruta fuera del juego.\n\nJuegazo de un estilo que aunque siempre divierte no todos lo hacen tan bien. Recomendado. Me lo volver\u00eda a pasar.\n\nCosas a destacar positivas:\n\u2022El combate es un vicio, querr\u00e1s repetir la sala sin gastar curaci\u00f3n solo por demostrar que eres capaz.\n\u2022Buena m\u00fasica.\n\u2022Trabajo art\u00edstico diferencial y llamativa ambientaci\u00f3n.\n\nCosas a destacar negativas:\n\u2022Demasiado minimalista, un poco de texto explicativo no vendr\u00eda mal a su lore (en los detalles est\u00e1n los recuerdos) o saber qu\u00e9 narices hace exactamente tal arma.\n\u2022No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 clase de mente perversa a dise\u00f1ado el dash/esquivar encadenado(juego con mando y tengo la sensaci\u00f3n que sigo sin entender ni su tempo ni c\u00f3mo funciona) ni en qu\u00e9 hora propuso esas salas en las que debes usarlo.

You have many weapons at your disposal, and it feels great to mix things up with slow and heavy attacks, dashes, and gunshots.

The level design is gorgeous and overflowing with secrets that reward skill and exploration in equal measure. The overall atmosphere and completely wordless storytelling really works for me, and I overall very much enjoyed my experience. The levels had enough variety to them to not feel same-y and the characters you meet along the way are quite endearing. \nIt took about 7.5 hours to beat, with me finding about half of the secrets and taking 1-3 tries to beat each room. After beating the game you can go back into your save just before the end to hunt secrets, which is always a good thing.\nThere's also a fair amount to dislike, though.

It's the kind of game that takes a lot of influence from classic titles like Zelda and Metroid. As a matter of fact the game plays like someone shoved both into the same room and what emerged was a singular gestalt entity. Stronger than both, but also a little deformed. Sadly, as we all know, fusion dances between games often result in debilitating illnesses. Like tedious challenges, underwhelming rewards, and thanking Anita Sarkeesian in your end credits.\n\nI do want to clarify at this point: this is a *GOOD* game. But it is also a game of many petty frustrations. So let's get my gripes out of the way.\n\nThe story is kind of useless. Even years later no one knows what happened outside of some broad speculation. There are only a couple paragraphs of text in the whole game explaining anything, and even those are hidden and need to be decoded. And even then they tell you next to nothing. So don't go into this expecting a good story - this game operates purely on vibes. And to be fair, the vibes are pretty nice.\n\nFor what it actually matters, the story is such: You're a traveling magician dude infected with sentient super cancer. Journeying to a post apocalyptic land that is trying to rebuild after a war with some giants, in search of some crystallized chemo. Sadly, even when 90% of the world is dead and endemics of sentient super cancer on the rise, the local furry community can't get along with eachother and are in a constant state of genocide, slavery, and light cannibalism. \n\nFortunately, as a magician you have many tricks up your cloak, which include but are not limited to: an arsenal of guns, grenades, a sword that can cut missiles in half and deflect bullets, and the ability to drift faster than the speed of light: a hyper light drifter, if you will. Using these tools, you must travel in the four cardinal directions and reactivate your local cancer treatment facility. While expanding your tools and equipment to handle each challenge you face.\n\nOn the subject of challenges: be sure to unlock your chain dash first and foremost. The chain dash is a finicky and unreliable move that requires fairly exact timing to pull off consistently. However it is also essential for combat, movement, and exploration. I honestly don't know why you even have to unlock this move - as you're pretty much useless without it. Sadly this is a common theme for most moves and equipment in this game - they range from nearly essential to profound waste of time.\n\nSecondly: head east starting out. You won't be able to appreciate this suggestion until you beat the first boss, but trust me: you want to head east.  This is another design choice I'm not fond of, and it ties into my previous complains about the unlocks and the story and well... everything. \n\nThis game loves secrets. There are secrets and goodies all over the place, but the problem is that you don't always have the means to access them. Or the game hits you with a big challenge inside a hard to find secret. OR you didn't have the means to access them so you have to come all the way back and your map is practically useless for memorizing layout and... you get the picture. \n\nI suppose that brings me to my *big* complaint: there is very little reason to explore. The gear you find in secrets are underwhelming, the lore you find in secrets are underwhelming, the guns you find are objectively worse than the ones the game gives your through story progress, the keys you find (four to an area btw) don't unlock anything of use when compared to the time spent pressing your face to a wall, even the module crystals - these ancient and mystical pieces of tech that are core to the game's story. You only need to find 4 in each area out of 8. Finding the other 4 in each area just gets you more of the underwhelming gear I had mentioned. \n\nNormally a game like this would have a good ending and a bad ending depending on how much of a completionist you are. Like you would get half the MacGuffins and you'd see the villain twirling his mustache at the end slate because you didn't find them all. The game doesn't do that. Finding all is exactly the same as finding the bare minimum - so again, no point. Even if you play the game on NG+, there is no change.\n\nAll this suggests that this is a game that really wants to sell itself on the visual presentation and challenge of the mechanics alone. And while the visuals are very nice, some screen shots of pixel art (stellar as they are) does not a 20 dollar game make. \n\nSo all that leaves is the combat. This part is admittedly pretty good. You have a fast and fluid combat system that rewards on the fly thinking, aggressiveness, and twitch reflexes. The problem is that it is still unpolished with very clear violations of its own rules. So while a singular playthrough is fun, maybe replaying it again years down the line when the memories have faded - it is not the kind of game conducive to repeat plays.\n\nAlso the dash challenge is one of the most boring and pointless time sinks I have ever seen in a game. Worst part is that the devs were very clearly showing *restraint*. They wanted to make it 1000 dashes but settled on 800. Why not 200? Seriously, you made us do 100 for the first reward, why not 200? No one likes the dash challenge - it isn't fun or interesting - it is literally pressing a single button in a metronome. It's funny because they put the only *GOOD* reward behind a challenge no one likes.\n\nI've been pretty negative, but I do recommend this game. It has a lot of flaws but it is presented so well and does so much right that I'm inclined to forgive it. It just goes to show that sometimes it pays not to look too deeply at something, otherwise you start to see the pimples and pock marks.

It's not difficult but you're locked into almost anything you do for a couple of frames so if you do a bad dash/hit you will get punished, chain hit and die.\nAt the same time most enemies get stunned when you hit them so if you line them up right you are the one chain-hitting them to death.\n\nThis wouldn't feel so bad if the dash didn't feel like utter garbage to use. After dashing you stop/slow down for a second or so which makes everything feel less fluid.\nThere's an upgrade you can buy to \"chain\" dash, but they decided to make it a frame perfect thing that is unintuitive to get used to.\nI assume the devs didn't want people to just spam dashes, but this is the worst way to go about solving that \"issue\".\n\nTo make it worse, a fair amount of optional \"purple things\" are behind dashing puzzles.\nMy original plan was to at least collect all of those and beat the main story.\nI tried for some time with one of the dashing puzzles, got fairly close until I realized that it's not even fun getting good at it.\n\n[u] Bossfights suck in this game. [/u]\nThey get worse and worse as you progress and essentially turn into using your best gun as much as possible with a few slashes in between to recharge it.\nHitboxes are wonky and difficult to eyeball.\nThe worst offenders when it comes to the bosses are the west side one and the final boss.\nI felt nothing beating the final boss, it took me about 5~ tries but none of the deaths felt \"good\" due to the strange hitboxes.\n\nI do really like the artstyle and the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe story didn't really do anything for me with how vague it was, but that's not a major issue for me.\n\nIt's truly a shame because this game could have been so very good, but because the devs wanted to make a \"difficult\" game the actual gameplay suffered.\n\nHopefully the next games from this developer do not retread the mistakes of this one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1679424837, "timestamp_updated": 1679424837, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score":

I thought it was weird young generations confused general anthropomorphism with weird modern fetishisms, so I checked Drifter... and I had bought that game 5 years ago! I thought it was time to give it a chance, and I did well! This little indie game is remarkably good and unique! Imagine a souls lite (quite hard) mixed with Zelda but without much puzzle, no dialogues, dark atmosphere of a sci-fi/dystopian fantasy... First, the game is a bit hard indeed, but it still only took me less than 10 hours to finish it. Also, I won't bother with all the secrets, but DAMN is this game PACKED with secrets! In old Zelda, you knew where to look for secrets as there would be about 1 in each level, on average. Here? There is one secret EVERY SCREEN. Crazy generous. Talking about generous: my goodness is this game pretty. Beautiful illustrations full of dark yet colorful pixels, in the same vein as a Crying Suns and all this dark pixelized school. Sublime.\nThe gameplay is a bit tough to manage at first, but then you get used to it, and all the upgrades in a zelda/metroidvania fashion make it easier. Tough (you can die in a few hits, it is a Souls lite after all) and brutal, but never unfair.\nDid I mention the music? the sound effects but especially the soundtrack are AMAZING. How modern and advanced is that writing, very dark but very rich and harmonically very deep. Congrats to the composer.\nOverall, all these positive things come together with one final, remarkably unique touch: the lore. The world of this game, its creatures, its narration (without words!), its scenery, characters, villages, monsters, ruins... EVERYTHING is so unique and beautiful (a bit reminiscent of Caves of Qud, Ashen, Shadow of Colossus etc) that I would accept any comic, manga or anime in this world. For now, I am just very eager to play the spin off they did, and am super excited about their next one, Breaker!\nThe only reason this game did not get a A for GREAT game for me is mostly the length (finished in 2 days), and the content (it is very pretty, unique and atmospheric, but its depth and reach are limited - poetic, just not on the long run enough).

There isn't a single track I'd dunk on, the credits music is just fantastic (also extremely high quality recording).\n\nThe gameplay is a bit less fantastic.\n+Combat is fun and satisfying. Despite being very simple, the enemy variety and different special abilities allow for quite deep combat mechanics.\n+Enemies are largely unique to zones which allows for a fair bit of variety in a single playthrough. The handful of enemies that aren't unique to zones are never annoying or difficult.\n-A lot of bosses feel extremely unfair due to their random sequence of abilities. Sometimes that's fine, like with the last boss where all his abilities are properly telegraphed. Other times it just means you get to restart, like on the crystal forest boss if he decides to summon friends three times instead of once.\n-The save points the game gives you are absolute bullshit half the time. You cleared out a massive area that took you 10 minutes, one stray bullet hits you at the end and you get to do it all over again. Just collected a couple of hidden items? Do that again too.\n\nWhat's weird about these issues is that they seem to be completely absent in the final area in the south of the map.

I'm not huge on the low-poly pixel art style, but I still think it's a one of the best atmospheres I've seen in a game. The environments are quite beautiful and interesting and the story (told through visual images only) is engaging. The soundtrack is probably the highlight of the game IMO and introduced me to Disasterpeace which until I looked up on Spotify I didn't realize he had done the It Follows soundtrack.

I honestly had no idea what was going on since it's a minimalist story, but I still liked the story telling aesthetic and style. I was able to put more and more together as the game went on, but by the end of it I still didn't have a full picture other than you got ghosts in your blood.\n2) Characters: 2/5. Again minimalist story, so minimalist characters, also there were no real major characters other than the main one. The most emotion I got from the main character in this game was him doing a fun flourish with his sword after you clear a boss or a challenge encounter.\n3) Setting: 5/5. Very interesting world to explore and to find what's out there. I guess that's the trade-off of a minimalist story is that most your experience if shifted to the setting and gameplay (DS1?). I'm normally not a fan of sci-fi which worked out since there was good blend of natural into the unnatural, and how you can infer the unnatural has corrupted the natural leading to the events of the game.\n4) Music: 3/5. It fit the mood as it was some low-energy, ambient synth music. There was no differentiation between ambient and combat music, which worked well in this case to not break the flow. The game flowed nicely as you moved from room to room, fight to fight, and the music helped keep it all contiguous rather than feeling like a dungeon crawl.\n5) Gameplay: 5/5. I think this is the main reason why everyone would play this game. Outside of boss fights, the movement and combat was pretty smooth. Combat could definitely get challenging at times, but was always very reward and felt really good. You only ever have 5 health over the whole game so you can't take much of a beating. You definitely learn and get good with the controls over the game so the health isn't so bad of hurdle to get over. However, I'm not sure why but the controls during boss fights specifically felt off. They were always infuriating, as if there was pre-programmed input lag and end lag to add artificial difficulty, I just never understood it. That controls issue with bosses persisted the whole game, but outside of bosses, the controls were totally fine for some reason. As the name of this game implies, I do recommend getting the chain dash ASAP so you can go whoosh-whoosh-whoosh-... for forever in a blip of light until you smack into something with a loud thud and your character just plops on the floor. It's pretty funny and you don't take damage, so worth it.\n\nAll in all, I'd give it a 72%, C-, yeah that feels about right.

You don't even get to know what you're buying at the shop you just buy stuff based on a 3x6 pixel image and its almost never what you thought it was.\n I have already beat one of the 4 bosses and still understand nothing about what i am doing or why. Any sense of accomplishment is ruined for me by the constant confusion. On top of the fact that I have to redo the same parts like 10 times after i beat them because you need the stupid collectables to unlock new areas. \n\nPersonally, I would only recommend this game if you enjoy fighting through the same impossible levels again and again with no idea of where you are going or what you are doing.

The game's plot can be intentionally vague at times and leave things up to interpretation, and while that isn't for everyone, I think it does an excellent job at conveying all it needs through through the visuals and feelings of its events. It commits to having zero in-universe human writing beyond its tutorial, explaining everything through its visuals in a way that makes you feel like a stranger adrift in strange lands. You have to figure things out for yourself, and are mostly alone. Luckily all the important things are easy to grasp, but the effort it puts into conveying how Hyper Light Drifter makes its world feel cannot be understated, and this small touch really adds a lot to the immersion. Every area feels exactly as it needs to, be it the remains of a once-thriving civilization that has been all but slaughtered, a forbidden mechanical facility with dangers so great it had to be hidden from the rest of the world, or just a small haven in the wilds where another wanderer can offer you a moment of respite.\n\nBut how does it play? Luckily, Hyper Light Drifter is no slouch in its gameplay either. Combat is snappy and challenging, but always feels fair. All of your options are simple to understand, but have a lot of nuance in use. Each of the main areas of the game has multiple unique enemy types, and it feels rewarding to learn their patterns and when to dodge or attack. Combined with a slew of upgrades and weapons you unlock over the course of the game, fighting always feels fresh and interesting. You can even play the main areas of the game in any order you want, for a different perspective on their difficulty on multiple playthroughs.\n\nThis game also loves hiding secrets everywhere. It's very satisfying to piece together clues and figure out things suspicious about the surroundings in order to find treasure. Some of them get extremely convoluted, like fake walls within fake walls within fake walls. It's great.\n\nOverall, Hyper Light Drifter is a very special game.

It does so much good in its visual and gameplay elements. The world you explore is beautifully designed. The gorgeous pixel art makes the world pop in a unique way that makes this game\u2019s visual style one of a kind. It has this vibe of \u201cModernized Retro\u201d it's a nod to SNES and Genesis graphics without holding itself back. The color palate is vibrant and makes every area feel distinct. The game just looks wonderful. It's the part that sticks out the most to me. The gameplay is like souls combat + zelda world exploration. But the games don't copy the mechanics and designs from games it takes inspiration from. It turns the ideas into something wholly unique. The combat hits similar beats to Dark Souls but there\u2019s a lot to make it feel different. I have 1 big complaint however. 1. The story isn\u2019t very compelling. In fact there isn\u2019t really a story to speak of. Like I could summarize the story in a sentence. On a surface level there\u2019s nothing there. It kinda feels like the story from Hollow Knight but without any of the plot elements. Just the background lore pushed to the forefront. There\u2019s no dialog, Just pictures and cutscenes showing you stuff that\u2019s occurring. When the credits rolled I was just confused on what the point of my journey was. Not to say that there\u2019s nothing pulling and compelling you to explore each area. But the story just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m sure that it was an intentional decision and it might be something you enjoy. But I just didn\u2019t understand what I was experiencing. But the gameplay and visuals carried it for me.

I wanted another game to break up my nights from repeated losses on Civ5.

I had many questions like: where's the verbal dialogue? what are the names of these things? what the hell is wrong with the map? why can't I go south?\n\nAs someone who's not at all used to WASD/mouse gaming - this took some getting used to, along with the dash function. The game does provide enough spaces for you to learn. \n\nThe incorporation of multiple regions of distinctly differing aesthetics and challenges, in terms of enemies, also made it very enjoyable, it felt more like 3 games than 1. I could pick and choose which route I wanted to go down on any given day, and I liked that. It wasn't fixed.\n\nMy second play through took 11 hours (still on newcomer, because I am still a newcomer) and with 18/32 pink triangles (name?) collected, I didn't do amazingly - but I didn't fail, evidently. The final boss was a pain, but it's meant to be, right?\n\nIf you can't get over the controls, or the lack of a solid story line (it's not necessary for this game IMO), and are unable to find the symbol that leads you to health/tokens/gearbits etc., you have to admire the graphics/artwork within.

Before I get to those, let's start with the good stuff.\n\nThis game has [b]amazing[/b] presentation. Gorgeous pixel art, a fittingly melancholic soundtrack, and almost completely wordless visual storytelling all come together to create quite the vibe.\n\nThen there's the combat. After the initial humiliation that comes from being killed in less than 5 seconds, you'll eventually work your way up to wiping out groups of hostiles equally quickly. The combat's progression mostly comes from the player getting better at it rather than boosting stats, which makes it extra satisfying.\n\nThat all sounds pretty good, so what rough edges should you be aware of? For me, the most notable problem is the game's pacing. It's easy to tell that some areas got way more developer attention than others, and the gaps between these content-rich areas can be rather boring.\n\nAnother problem is the map. While it's aesthetically pleasing, its different layers are either too vague or too difficult to read to give specifics for getting from point a to point b. This is kind of cool in the sense that it forces you to figure it out, but it can get very tedious when you just want to quickly backtrack to a specific spot. There's also no way to place map markers.\n\nLastly, the movement can feel clunky at times. Not enough to ruin the combat experience, but more than enough to make [spoiler]playing soccer against that stupid little goblin thing[/spoiler] a test of patience rather than skill. [spoiler]That little shit will stun-lock you any time you try to go after the ball while he's near it[/spoiler], highlighting the movement system's shortcomings.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the good parts of Hyper Light Drifter enough that I was willing to put up with its more tedious aspects.

The combat was fun, and I liked trying out all of the different guns. I also enjoyed the limited resources to upgrade your gear and abilities so you either had to make sacrifices as to what you choose to put upgrades into, or take the extra time to explore every nook an cranny.\n\nI also enjoyed the visual storytelling, which is one of the main draws of the game. Not a single piece of dialog, just images and environments. It was fun to think about what might've caused this world to end up how it did, the origin and demise of the giant creature/statue things, etc.\n\nI do have a few criticisms though. It was too easy to get stuck sometimes looking for modules or secrets if you didn't check every single tile on every single wall, and that got frustrating at times. I only used a guide once, and it was in the western area when I KNEW there was a module in one dungeon area but could not find out how to reach it, and it turned out to be in the very back corner in a cell of a room I had already checked dozens of times. Things like that happened less and less as I progressed, but it was still cumbersome at times.\n\nAlso the final boss was extremely underwhelming.

I enjoyed the artwork, exploring the world, and the collectibles, but the negatived kept adding up for me. The combat was fine at first but got stale quickly, and was difficult to control at times, especially in fights with way too many enemies. There is also the issue of not being able to keep track of what you have and haven't collected on the map. I know this is a bit of a personal issue, but it is the main reason I will not be getting all of the gear bits (one of the 4 main collectibles).\nThe boss fights are fine, but a huge part of the game I just genuinely didn't click with was the story. It starts off confusing and ends with just as much explanation as it began with, a little bit of cutscene telling nothing. Characters do not talk in this game, they show you pictures that have very little direct meaning, and while this is normally a fun way to tell a story, I felt it was done poorly in this game. Barely anyone explains anything and even the pictures were extremely convoluted. I ended this game just thinking, \"Why did I just do everything?\". \nIn the end, I have to say I do not recommend this game for someone looking for a solid experience to play to 100% completion. Story can be breezed through in like 2 hours if you get a handle on the combat, 4-6 if you struggle. The achievements are normal for the most part but there are some that are just so ridiculous (like dying one thousand times!!!) that are obviously there to garner play time. One day I will come back and get the rest of the achievements, but that day is not today.

The visuals and music are phenomenal. But I definitely can see how the game can turn off anyone.\n\nThe game is non-verbal. There are still cutscenes and some NPCs who will describe events through images. Much is left to the player's interpretation. There are also some cryptographic tablets hidden around the world which I assume offer some lore when deciphered. It does make combat a bit weird since you're not told the specifics of abilities and upgrades (notably, Chain Dash and Bullet Absorb) so when something doesn't work, you're just left wondering why.\n\nI like the combat, it feels smooth and tight but it's not lenient. Chain-dashing is pretty hard to get accustomed to, there's a window after each dash during which you can perform the next dash, i.e., you can't just quickly press the dash button immediately one after another. The window decreases as you keep dashing but I'm not sure if there's a cap. There are even two achievements dedicated to dashing, one of them for reaching 800 dashes. \n\nThere are no invincibility frames except for when you fall off a platform as well as one upgrade that lets you block projectiles when you dash but it seems like it only activates under certain conditions and not necessarily for the entirety of the dash.\n\nThere's also an impressive enemy variety. The only issues I see are that some areas are claustrophobic and most enemies have very low attack cooldown. Because there are no invincibility frames, there are some times where one hit is all it takes to get wiped out when confronted by multiple enemies within a small/enclosed area. The bosses are also pretty neat as long as you're used to the combat.\n\nThe game is also basically riddled with secret areas and collectibles.

Then you fight a final boss at the end of the game.\nTo fill things up, you can also find many secret pathways and hidden loot along the way. Although, at least after unlocking the handul of useful upgrades, these things do little more than satisfy the \"completionist compulsion\" or give your pixelated outfit a different color - yay..\n\nThe locations themselves are well done, within the limitations the game set itself. They are each distinct from one another and home to different inhabitants. However, since you always do the exact same thing in those locations, the variance in style does little to give a sense of true change. \n\nThe soundtrack doesnt help either, which I can only describe as a mix of \"it's there\" and \"boring\", and I feel like a lot of potential had been wasted here (I actually ended up playing my own music over the ingame sound and it made things better. Still, my wistful thinking of \"Ruiner\" remained).\n\nThis leaves the fights themselves. After all, the \"main course\" of the game. And they are well done, even fun, at times - until the controls ruin it. In defence of the game, I have to clarify, that I played the game with keyboard+mouse. The game recommends a controller, but that's just not for me.\nThere are about 3-4 different enemy types per location (and one that seems to be everywhere) and the fast paced fights never really get to the point, where things start to feel repetitive. The bosses, however, are a let down. They all die extremely quickly, have little if any remarkable moves and no additional phases, but at the same time, can kill you in what feels like a single hit (the game has no real i-frames and damage taken briefly staggers you, which can lead to chain of attacks that quickly depletes your small health pool). \n\nA story is basically non-existant. There are some super short, non-voiced, cryptic and honestly uninteresting cutscenes and that's all there is to it.\n\nUltimately, I can barely recommend the game. \nIt is obtainable for a very low price (I paid 5\u20ac) and does what little it does well enough to potentially be a good experience.\nAt the same time, however, it fails to deliver anything new or unexpected and can not leave a lasting impression. \nIf time is a limiting resource for you, you will be better off looking for a different game.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1666030330, "timestamp_updated": 1666030330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123976681": {"recommendationid": "123976681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010397916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1593, "last_played": 1666191813}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is exceptional.

For the indie landscape, that is. \nBut there's [i]something[/i] about Hyper Light Drifter, something which I didn't expect to find... that resonated within me. \n\nMaybe it's how everything seems correlated to the developer and his health. I don't know, but I'm sure that this has been an immersive and quite long experience, at least for me. \n\n[h3]Let It Speak[/h3]\nOne of the things which I did like was the actual narrative structure. You start off with a brief tutorial which teaches you how to play, and then you're put into this decadent, mysterious world filled with a somewhat melancholic feel. \n\nIf you've ever played [b]Dropsy[/b] (if you didn't, I would highly recommend you doing so!), you may be familiar with how dialogue is presented here. Characters don't actually talk, but rather make a bunch of noises. The actual context is shown to the player through the use of flashback images, which sum up what the NPC is talking about. \n\nNeedless to say, it [b]works[/b]. You're never disconnected from your surroundings, and for me it's really important. Other than that, the stories told by the few characters you'll encounter will be brief and concise, with not much to interpret. \nI'm not saying this should be the structure of every videogame ever, but sometimes letting the game speak for itself is the best way to catch the player's interest. \n\n[h3]Surroundings (And Your Ears)[/h3]\nIn fact, I've been invested in the places I was exploring. Much like [b]Hollow Knight[/b], I've spent quite some time running around finding hidden items or simply admiring what the environment had to offer. That and HLD's eerie soundtrack, made by Disasterpeace. \n\nEven when fighting, your ears will constantly hear the relaxing yet heavily melancholic music of that given level, and that'll create an interesting contrast which will inevitably stick around in your head. The composition is clearly excellent, and there hasn't been a moment where I didn't like what I was listening to.\n\nAs for surroundings, environments are rich and full of personality. The overall tone is decadent and arid. It's almost like there's something constantly fading away. You'll clearly remember the various biomes you'll stop by. On the other hand, the game kinda encourages you to walk around and search for secrets, so eventually you'll get to know each room pretty well.\n\nArtistically, I'd say that the only thing which I didn't really find that interesting was the enemies' design. Although some are easily recognizable, others feel somewhat flat compared to the global art direction. Not that it's negative in any way, it's just that I would've liked something with a bit more personality. Bosses are well made, though.\n\n[h3]Synchronized[/h3]\nI'd say that gameplay wise it's a solid game. You can slash your enemies with your sword and dash to dodge the enemy attacks. You can also fire with your weapon using RT. During your journey, you'll come across some items which will let you upgrade your skillset. With certain upgrades, you'll be able to do some combos which will consume your stamina. \n\nYou'll eventually arrive at a point where your set of skills will be varied, but you'll still have to use your timing right in order to fight well. I thought that the game's commands were clunky at first, but soon realized that in order to do even basic combos, you'd need to time your button presses accordingly. \n\nThat's interesting, since it creates an actual learning curve even with the simplest combos, but doesn't even lose all that accessibility since the game is not the hardest out there, and it'll mostly be you and ordinary enemies. There are some bosses, sure, but even they are not the most challenging ones. If you complete your first game, though, you'll be able to experience New Game+ with some added difficulty.\n\nSo there's a lot to praise here and there. Mastering the gameplay's flow feels really rewarding, and if that's what the developers had in my mind, they totally nailed it. With that said, good luck with the dashing challenge.\n\n[h3]Tidbits[/h3]\nLast but honorable mention, additional challenges and hidden areas. If you're a curious player and scavenge around to find items as me, then you'll be accurately rewarded. So, if you're a completionist, you'll be pleased to know that there's some work to do here. If you're not, but still curious, you'll find yourself in some interesting situations.\n\n[h2]Panacea[/h2]\nWith this song now stuck in my mind, I'd say that going blindly into Hyper Light Drifter was an incredibly good thing. The whole exclusives deal with the EGS kinda made me a little sad, but Solar Ash and Hyper Light Breaker are eventually coming to Steam, so we'll see.\n\nWith that said, I would recommend this game even at full price!\n\n[i]More reviews[/i]: \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended\n\n[i]YT Channel[/i]: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMd490dpLAJxONpEpvOMnw", "timestamp_created": 1662327130, "timestamp_updated": 1665054972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619524598121643066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121755263": {"recommendationid": "121755263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084405749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 728, "last_played": 1662232011}, "language": "english", "review": "Hyper Light Drifter is extremely \"built-to-purpose.\" It knows what it wants to be, and executes on that nearly flawlessly.

Dichos conocimientos le son ajenos completamente a los seres del nuevo mundo y por ello, sus vidas ya son parte de \u00e9l.\n Drifter sufre de una misteriosa enfermedad (aparentemente cardiaca, inspirada en los problemas de salud de su desarrollador y creador) contra la cual lucha d\u00eda a d\u00eda, aparentemente buscando una cura [spoiler]sin embargo, tras terminar el juego, esa idea puede volverse confusa y puede que sea err\u00f3nea[/spoiler]. Para ello debe de recurrir y enfrentarse a los vestigios del viejo mundo y tambi\u00e9n a las amenazas del nuevo mundo. Una suerte de gu\u00eda espiritual o alucinaci\u00f3n (o no tengo idea que) en forma de coyote o perro, aparentemente gu\u00eda a nuestro personaje, mientras que por otro lado, visiones de muerte o de su misma enfermedad le atormentan y debilitan mientras m\u00e1s se acerca a su destino. Sin embargo eso no lo detiene, y aun sufriendo, sigue adelante.\n En el camino se topara con otros seres, probablemente con las mismas habilidades y conocimientos que \u00e9l posee, ya que se destacan en combate y hasta en apariencia al igual que Drifter. Aparentemente, esos pares tambi\u00e9n sufren de la misma enfermedad y se encaminan en su duro camino en busca de una cura.\n Poco m\u00e1s se puede decir de la historia ya que es muy libre a interpretaci\u00f3n. Lo que he narrado aqu\u00ed es parte lore oficial y parte interpretaci\u00f3n, pero esto solo hace que el juego sea mejor a\u00fan, puesto que las teor\u00edas y versiones que la historia pueda contar podr\u00edan ser muchas.\n\n[h1]\u2022GRAFICOS, FISICAS Y SONIDO[/h1]\n El juego tiene una est\u00e9tica 2-D al estilo de las viejas consolas de 8 o 16 bits, usando notorios pixeles para dar forma a todo. Esto, al principio, puede ser confuso, ya que es dif\u00edcil saber distinguir formas, elevaciones o ca\u00eddas y hasta proyectiles. Sin embargo, apenas unos minutos de juego y ya sabremos entender todo y, no solo eso, sino que podremos apreciar lo hermoso de este estilo.\n Los colores son suaves, color pastel y muy definidos, as\u00ed como los brillos y destellos, los cuales est\u00e1n muy bien contrastados y hasta ayudan a guiarse. Cada movimiento del personaje es muy bueno, as\u00ed como los de cada enemigo. Que los movimientos est\u00e9n tan definidos ayuda a predecir patrones y suma mucho al agrado visual. Los entornos son dignos de apreciarse y, habr\u00e1 muchos lugares tan detallados y llamativos que, gracias tambi\u00e9n a su est\u00e9tica, se vuelven a\u00fan m\u00e1s cautivadores. No existe pixel al azar, todo aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 hecho para agradar y lo logra.\n Las f\u00edsicas son perfectas, aunque para los disparos, la perspectiva podr\u00e1 eclipsarlos, pero eso es intencional creo y hasta resulta mucho mejor. Las hitbox est\u00e1n muy bien hechas y se respetan las distancias seg\u00fan el golpe.\n En cuanto a lo sonoro, cuenta con m\u00fasica la cual es monof\u00f3nica, cambiando seg\u00fan la zona, pero siempre ser\u00e1 muy suave, ambiental, y por sobre todo, agradable, dulce y al mismo tiempo sombr\u00eda, con aires de tristeza. Es muy dif\u00edcil reunir tantos sentimientos en unas melod\u00edas monof\u00f3nicas, pero el juego lo logra y con ello transmite ese halo de misterio, paz y dolor que transita el personaje en cada etapa. Los sonidos, por otro lado son precisos y muy originales. Cada ataque, movimiento e interacci\u00f3n cuenta con su propio y distintivo sonido. Incluso el ambiente cuenta con sonidos que, adem\u00e1s de dar ambientaci\u00f3n (valga la redundancia), tambi\u00e9n ayudan a la exploraci\u00f3n, gui\u00e1ndonos hacia lugares que, de no ser por el sonido, no encontrar\u00edamos a primeras.\n En resumen, lo audiovisual, pese a lo pudelado y monof\u00f3nico, abunda de hermosura y precisi\u00f3n para el t\u00edtulo en cuesti\u00f3n. Excelente.\n\n[h1]\u2022MECANICAS Y JUGABILIDAD[/h1]\n El juego mezcla las mec\u00e1nicas de un HnS, permiti\u00e9ndonos el cuerpo a cuerpo y el esquive junto a los disparos, as\u00ed como el rol, ya que podremos hallar puntos de mejora a lo largo del mapa que podremos despu\u00e9s gastar en m\u00e1s habilidades de espada, esquive y hasta mejorar la capacidad de curas, as\u00ed como cambiar y mejorar nuestro arma de fuego. Al mismo tiempo, la exploraci\u00f3n es necesaria para hallar dichos puntos y, en esto hay que sacarse el sombrero, puesto que existen muchos caminos ocultos que tomar y rincones dif\u00edciles de hallar, pero hacerlo, es muy bien premiado. Sin embargo, algo que no termino de convencerme es el mapa. Es muy dif\u00edcil de interpretar bien, sirviendo como gu\u00eda b\u00e1sica pero sin ninguna precisi\u00f3n. Esto es intencional, lo s\u00e9, pero el mundo es muy laberintico, grande y, gracias a su est\u00e9tica, muy dif\u00edcil de leer de por s\u00ed. Por eso creo que dar vaga informaci\u00f3n en el mapa tambi\u00e9n es algo innecesario. Basta con decir que me tomo la mitad de la campa\u00f1a leerlo como se debe (puede que sea solo yo, pero no creo).\n La jugabilidad es muy simple,  movi\u00e9ndonos al cl\u00e1sico  \"W;A;S;D\", el esquive (dash) que al mismo tiempo es el salto \"Espacio\" y ambos clics, siendo uno el ataque a espada y el otro a distancia. Parece muy f\u00e1cil, pero todo depender\u00e1 de nuestras habilidades y armas, as\u00ed como los reflejos y lectura de patrones de los enemigos y el entorno, que puede ser muy reducido, con vac\u00edos o hasta con trampas. La combinaci\u00f3n de los movimientos es indispensable para un buen combate. Otro detalle es que el cursor estar\u00e1 en pantalla y ser\u00e1 el punto hacia donde ir\u00e1n nuestros ataques (como nuestro punto objetivo y mira), por lo que deberemos tambi\u00e9n prestarle atenci\u00f3n en combate.\n Cada enemigo cuenta con un moveset propio y variado en relaci\u00f3n a qu\u00e9 clase de enemigo es (un enemigo inicial apenas y tendr\u00e1 uno o dos movimientos), y cada vez aparecer\u00e1n enemigos m\u00e1s duros, en mayor cantidad y combinados, lo cual aumentara progresiva pero notoriamente la dificultad, lo cual es genial.\n El juego, por sus b\u00e1sicos controles no requiere de extrema habilidad y hasta permite dejarlo a medias y regresar mucho tiempo despu\u00e9s sin necesidad de reiniciar, ya que en un minuto le agarras la mano de nuevo. Es el juego perfecto para todo jugador, tanto casual como dedicado, y se disfruta sea cual sea el caso. Lamentablemente es algo corto, y se har\u00e1 m\u00e1s breve aun si eres bueno en estos juegos de agilidad y reflejos ya que casi no morir\u00e1s.\n\n En resumen, el juego es una joya y merece cada centavo de su valor. S\u00e9 que cuenta con un Coop para jugar con un amigo, pero a\u00fan no lo he probado y no puedo opinar de esto. Por otro lado tiene un extra al terminar la campa\u00f1a que te permite ir contra todos los bosses a elecci\u00f3n para revivir los trepidantes y r\u00e1pidos combates.", "timestamp_created": 1662293509, "timestamp_updated": 1662294028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121721366": {"recommendationid": "121721366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815181858", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 466, "last_played": 1662278344}, "language": "english", "review": "Hyper Light Drifter is a brilliant game with strong themes that I'm too dumb to understand because there's no dialogue.\n\nFun game though.

However, I do not like the controls or upgrade mechanics. I played on the standard difficulty using an Xbox One controller. I am not particularly good at hard games anymore so this review is through that perspective. These are my thoughts alone on the game and your mileage may vary.\n\nPros:\nYou will die to dumb things, but it is okay because the death system is extremely forgiving. You do not lose anything you had before entering a room, which is a good thought considering how fragile you are. Traversing the world hits that nice balance of making you feel strong but vulnerable. \nHealth is abundant in the world but you have to try and earn extra. The forgiving death system feeds into this.\nIt's very beautiful. Clearly a lot of work went into making this game and the dev team should be very proud of the final product.\n\nSlight complaints/Constructive criticisms:\nThe map is cool, but very rough around the edges. A simple legend would have helped to let me know what was checked off and what was not in the early game. The character marker could also better reflect your position in the room.\nStory is unclear at best if playing casually without the intent of hitting every collectible. Some games like JOURNEY thrive with minimal narrative, but this did not feel like one of them. For comparison, I think Hollow Knight suffers from the same problem. I like a story to be explained somehow, and this game's plot feels like it was not explained to me. In comparison, JOURNEY felt like its background was conveyed just enough.\n\nCons:\nThe game often feels like BS. The following points are why.\nYou will die to dumb things because the controls are slow to respond and you are fragile.\nYou can dash multiple times, but any dash beyond the first requires a specific timing which is slower than the game operates at. This can be waved away with \u201cgit gud\u201d, but I thought it felt wrong with the game\u2019s action pace.\nBosses can hitstun you and continue to pump damage. With so little health and slow healing, this feels cheap at best.\nThe gun I was using has an audible sound to let you know when you can fire again, however, this sound is often drowned out (especially during boss fights) and I was left guessing for the timing.\nHealing is slow but also limited. This is great until some boss fights when I was unable to heal before the next attack. This is another \u201cgit gud\u201d situation where I feel like the pace of healing does not match the pace of the action. With healing being SO limited, I\u2019d like it to be automatic or nearly so.\nThere are a few upgrades which help tremendously and many which do not feel like they matter. A game which has an intended way to play is not inherently a bad thing, but many of the upgrade options are so feeble compared to the good ones. Once I had the best ones, I did not feel like I was upgraded at all when I bought the rest.\nBeing able to accidentally dash off the edge of a stage is annoying and makes me feel like I'm playing a silly version of Soul Caliber where I jump off the stage instead of rolling around the enemy.\n", "timestamp_created": 1660631692, "timestamp_updated": 1660631692, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120706638": {"recommendationid": "120706638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085174508", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 761, "last_played": 1688188079}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego, con buenas mecanicas y una historia sin palabras we", "timestamp_created": 1660616454, "timestamp_updated": 1660616454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120702516": {"recommendationid": "120702516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083806393", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1663387975}, "language": "english", "review": "Not entirely what I expected; honestly thought it was gonna be more rogue-ish, but it's very much like Zelda.

But make no mistake, the main appeal is the trippy visuals and the oppressive ambient soundtrack, the combat can be fun, but the game is not much of a challenge if you play a lot of action games.\n\nThe story is extremely vague, the protagonist is a katana wielding masked swordsman roaming the world looking for a cure for his sickness, but beyond that it is all up to interpretation, as the game is entirely wordless, with no dialog or any other text, not unlike games like [url=store.steampowered.com/app/638230]Journey[/url] or [url=store.steampowered.com/app/304430]INSIDE[/url]. It all essentially boils down to a giant metaphor for a heart condition because the lead developer is sick in real life.\n\nThe combat is your average Souls inspired \"slash twice then dodge\". The rhythm is pretty unique though, your walking speed is quite slow but you move very fast when dashing and the first dash upgrade allows you to chain dashes indefinitely. The drifter can also deflect projectiles with his blade, as well as wield a variety of guns, from a basic pistol to a shotgun and various energy weapons. Ammo is in short supply but you restore it by slashing at the enemies giving the formula a certain ebb and flow.\n\nPersonally, I had a lot of fun hunting for secrets, because the game has tons and many of them are very sneaky and require thinking outside the box. Things are often obscured by the game's top down perspective and you basically try to break out of bounds to get them. You can find currency for upgrades, keys for optional areas and even alternate outfits that provide a variety of passive buffs.\n\nThe game is quite short, with only 4 main areas and 8 bosses. A completionist playthrough will take about 15 hours, and if you don't care about secrets, it will be around half that time.

Having to time your dashes in order to take advantage of chaining them rather than just spamming the button is really cool. The different guns are neat. Too bad there's a very small amount of bosses, they're all too easy, and regular enemies are unfulfilling. I don't need it to be bonecrushingly difficult, just enough to keep my brain engaged and have a satisfying victory. I never once died in combat, only from the 1 shot traps. That's ok though, because that's not what you'll be doing in Hyper Light Drifter.\n\nThe gameplay loop, and 90% of the experience, is painstakingly checking every single ledge, wall, breakable, open air, pretty much every square inch of the environment for stuff.

You'll comb an area for hidden areas, go down a rabbit hole, fight a room of enemies, comb the room, find nothing, backtrack to the other area you didn't search yet, and do that until a zone is clear. Then you still missed a bunch of stuff. So you'll do it again. \n\nExploration would be more fulfilling if there was some sort of puzzle element rather than the tedium of reverse engineering the art designer's fever dream.

There is something to find at every corner of the beautiful pixelated world and getting lost is the correct path.\n\nThis game doesn't tell, only shows. There won't be any dialogue but illustrations of the lore and your story explained in the background. There's not even a mission popping out telling you what to do, only a diagram. This forces the player to take the initiative and explore at their own will, some games want you to keep going right or up, here however they're all the correct way to go unless you're not ready yet.\n\nHLD rewards a great amount of exploration, if you don't find any secret in a dungeon then you probably missed a dozen of secret rooms. Noticing that weird square tile on the ground should be a second nature to you because a lot of the main quest is hidden behind them, including upgrades or optional keys. Some progression pieces are put right before your eyes while some are in the more obscure part of the map, however you're not required to get every piece of this main quest which allows you to progress however and whenever you like.\n\nThe combat is unforgiving at first, there are barely invincibility frames when you dodge or getting attacked and you're very prone to danger if you get surrounded by multiple enemies (which happens a lot). However you can continue right before a battle sequence start if you died, and you're free to find another path and upgrades until you're ready to tackle this harder part of the game. But When you do get used to the combat it can be very satisfying to pull off, juggling between your sword and guns while chain dashing in rhythm to dodge incoming attacks and projectiles. Although don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re here only to enjoy the world as there is an easy difficulty to pick.\n\nThe game recommends you to play with a controller, however what they should've told you is that the game MUST be played using a controller. Keyboard and Mouse is simply not optimized for the combat, it is clunky and just gives you a bad experience overall. Most of the negative reviews are complaints about the controls, the developers should've paid more attention to it considering this is a PC release in a PC store and players should not be expected to own a controller. So be wary if you're trying to play with KBM, it's possible but may hinder your adventure. I\u2019ve actually played it using KBM several years ago but had to put it down due to frustration.\n\nThe hand-crafted world and soundtrack is beautiful, you can't help but to keep taking screenshots and hang around to submerge yourself in the 16-bit atmosphere. However you need to bear with the difficult combat and cryptic nature of the game.

If you already have other widely praised fast-paced 2D games, metroidvanias and hack & slash games in your \"to play\" list, then skip this game for now. Or buy it on sale and play it later. The game has a fun world to explore but the map is quite shit. Your combat abilities are nice but enemies are boring and ganky. Atmosphere is superb\n\nLong ass review ahead.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is a metroidvania at its core, but it has a different approach for its level design than more traditional metroidvania games like Hollow Knight or Rabi-Ribi. Rather than having a huge interconnected world, it has 4 main regions. These regions have lots of different shortcuts, alternative paths and branching roads (much like how Dark Souls areas are designed), but they don't connect to each other. Instead, there is a hub in the middle of the map, connecting all 4 areas. Basically, don't go into this game expecting Hollow Knight. While technically a metroidvania, it differs a lot from the mold. Not to imply that that is a bad thing. I enjoyed exploring the world, even if it was quite small.\n\nThe main problem with the game's world in my opinion isn't actually about level design, it is about the map. I get that this was an aesthetic choice, but your map really sucks at being a map. It only shows what room you are in and not where you are in it. Considering how big some rooms in the game are, finding out where you are exactly can be a chore. It is hard to deduce where you should go or how you can get to a certain place. The map already shows every room when you get it so you can't check whether or not you have been to a place before either. I just really didn't like the map, and it is the main reason I won't bother 100%ing the game. I can't visualize the game's map in my head without getting a headache. There are too many shortcuts and branches for that, not to mention different parts of the map can only be accessed through underground areas (and the map for those areas sucks as well). I think a map like Rabi-Ribi's would have been leagues better than the current one. Also they should have added more than 1 warp for each region imo. 2 or 3 would be a lot better. Backtracking is a huge issue in the game.\n\nThe combat is pretty good, but it has some flaws. The major one is enemy design and placement. The game would have benefited from more variety in enemy types, as there are only 20 enemies in the game. Some of them have very similar functions too, and some are practically reskins. Enemy placement is a mess and relies a lot on swarming you. You'll often be forced into a tiny room with a dozen or so Dirks trying to gank you at once. Or 20 Vultures harassing you. Or 10 toads endlessly throwing crap at you from far away. It seems like when the devs realized their enemies are dull and too easy to fight, they decided to fix that; not by making more complex enemies with better AI, but rather by turning every third room into a gank fest.\n\nBosses are meh. They just didn't click for me. All of the bosses in the game are pretty mundane and none of them really feels like a boss, they are more like glorified minibosses. None are very memorable. That isn't to say they were all very easy, I died a few times to almost all of them, partly because I almost always managed to enter with low heals, mostly because I suck. \n\nLooking at the players moveset, you have some fun tools. Your default attack with the sword is always reliable and feels great to use. Your guns are nicely balanced, you can't just shoot everything from a safe distance. You have to get up and personal and hit people with your sword to get more ammo. All of your sidegrades are fun too. The charge attack is extremely satisfying to use but getting interrupted can be a bit frustrating. But that (and the severe mobility penalty) is the tradeoff for a whopping 5 damage with a huge arc that can one shot most enemies. Your dash attacks are a lot more situational but make you feel like the coolest fuck out there when you pull them off. And your grenade is a nice tool to deal with big groups or far away ranged enemies. My only major gripe is with the deflect ability. I feel like it should already be a part of your core moveset and deflecting things can be a bit wonky.\n\nMovement... is weird. And by movement I mean dashing. The weird delay you get after a normal dash feels... off? It doesn't feel like a set cooldown like you have in most games. The time between dashes almost feels random. Like the game isn't reading my input correctly sometimes. I don't know how to explain it, maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it caused a lot of problems in combat. Chain dashing is the coolest shit ever when you pull it off. Zooming across the map just feels good, but getting cockblocked by ledges and obstacles sucks ass. For some reason, your character does this slide once you stop chain dashing, which causes you to fall to your doom 9/10 times. Your character also can't dash through breakable objects and gets completely wrecked if you chain dash next to an object and your collision hitbox collides with a single pixel of said object. Just why. Also fuck the 800 dash challenge, I stopped trying after 769.\n\nArtistically I have no complaints. The game looks wonderful, what is there to say? Even though the themes of sci-fi/cyperpunk stuff and old temples/ruins aren't really my thing, they were still great to look at. I love me some pixel art. The OST, while nothing amazing or above and beyond like the art, was pretty nice too. The story, I didn't really understand, and that is more on me than the game. I already struggle getting a grasp of Souls-like story telling, and in a game that didn't even have item descriptions, I was quite lost despite all the cutscenes.\n\nWhile thinking about this game, though, here is what I realized. Other than gorgeous pixel art and the games unique atmosphere, this game doesn't really have a strong suit, especially when it comes to gameplay. \n\nDo you want to play a metroidvania with breathtaking exploration? Hollow Knight and Rabi-Ribi are some of the best metroidvanias when it comes to huge interconnected worlds and their non-linear world design gives extreme freedom to the player. If you want something more linear, the Ori games are a great pick and Souls games need no explanation. \n\nIs hacking and slashing everything like butter your thing? Katana Zero is far more fluid and faster paced with great enemy placement. If Katana Zero is too simple and/or you want isometric gameplay, Hades is a great game with far more variety in both enemy types and weapon options. \n\nAre you really into the bullet hell aspect of the game? Rabi-Ribi comes to mind again. If you want isometric gameplay with scattered enemy placement, go for Enter the Gungeon, Binding of Isaac, most roguelikes/lites really. If you aren't really into roguelikes/lites, you can always pick up an actual bullet hell game. The newest Touhou game and some old classics like Ikagura can be bought on Steam.\n\nHyper Light Drifter is one of those games you play after you finished pretty much every revered title in the genre you like.", "timestamp_created": 1659563649, "timestamp_updated": 1659563649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588905930519104004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120014727": {"recommendationid": "120014727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031502854", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1679105083}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldn't play the game, it got stuck at splash screen.

When I first looked at the game and the beginning cutscene was playing, the first thing I said in a discord call with a friend of mine was that I already knew that I was going to love the game unless the actual gameplay was really terrible. The soundtrack and visuals stay consistently great throughout the game, and the storytelling through images really adds to the experience. 10/10\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\n\nAlright, so the gameplay is where things get a little more rough for me. While I enjoyed the combat at its basics, there were a few problems I had with it, although they were by no means dealbreakers, and I still overall enjoyed the combat. My biggest gripe with the combat comes whenever you take damage. Taking damage knocks your character back and to the ground, but does not give you I-frames to get up and react, which leads to many cases of an enemy, boss, or environmental hazard throwing you into something and cause you to essentially get partially stunlocked. Maybe I'm bad, but this kept happening during a few of the bosses. A much smaller gripe I had was from a lack of auto aim on the gun. This is mainly a skill issue, but I wish there was a soft auto aim because it's difficult to aim with precision while dodging attacks from bosses and such. This leads to many shots fired missing by an inch, which soft auto aim would fix, although admittedly this became less of an issue as the game went on. Overall though, the cycle of combat using a sword and a gun with dashes is very satisfying, so I can't dock the combat too hard. 7/10\n\nTLDR / OVERALL\n\nI personally value the experience with a game much more than the core gameplay, as long as that gameplay is at least okay, which Hyper Light Drifter surpasses. Because the atmosphere of the game is so perfect and the gameplay is pretty satisfying, I'm gonna have to give Hyper Light Drifter a 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1659561322, "timestamp_updated": 1659561322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120013324": {"recommendationid": "120013324", "author": {"steamid": "76561199192086339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1660833035}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1659559672, "timestamp_updated": 1659559672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120005524": {"recommendationid": "120005524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859790114", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1664059112}, "language": "english", "review": "Very deep game, awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1659549656, "timestamp_updated": 1659549656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120003388": {"recommendationid": "120003388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059187966", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1467470964}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know why steam didn't log my hours correctly. \n\nI played this game daily for hours while struck with Covid, it's fantastic.\n", "timestamp_created": 1659547041, "timestamp_updated": 1659547041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120002399": {"recommendationid": "120002399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394944232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 344, "last_played": 1659974964}, "language": "english", "review": "a souls-like indie game which your \"hold x\" attack actually does damage", "timestamp_created": 1659545702, "timestamp_updated": 1659545702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119997367": {"recommendationid": "119997367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815934388", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1659716553}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Con la \"z\" te sent\u00e1s. :)", "timestamp_created": 1659539005, "timestamp_updated": 1659539005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62711864709854126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119993541": {"recommendationid": "119993541", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960321336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1663602656}, "language": "english", "review": "Real good!

Like, the game definitely has its moments, but there are many points that are just so frustrating because your character does things that feel like they are straight up out of your control. If you choose to set it so that you dash in the direction you are facing using WASD, you miss out on a LOT of the finer movement when using the infinite dash upgrade or when platforming due to the 2d nature of the game, but you can dodge and do combat better. HOWEVER, if you choose to have it so that you dash in the direction of your mouse cursor, you get way more accurate movement BUT, because placement of your mouse cursor is also the direction that your character swings their sword, it happens to make you have much less control during combat. This tradeoff with the two dash control styles between movement and combat just makes the game so much more draining and unfun and it makes me sad because I really thought I would love this game. If the mechanics of hyper light drifter were slightly tweaked in a way that made the movement/combat more intuitive on mouse and keyboard this would most likely be one of my favorite games of all time. However, this game has been out for years and that is not going to happen; the story, while interesting, (despite how vague it is) the art, while beautiful, the music, while great, are altogether not nearly enough to justify the gameplay being as unintuitive as it is at times given that it's the main reason I bought the game thinking that it would be extremely satisfying. This game is like on the very edge between casual and not casual and it's really not a good balance. It isn't so much hard as it is annoying, the combat and movement can be picked up and have the basics learnt pretty easily but you have to master them to enjoy them. Many times the only reason you take damage or die is because you do not have complete comfortable control over your character and you end up just brute forcing your way through it and playing carefully,(which is stupid because the game is based on fast paced movement) so it feels like you're just cheesing the entire time. This would be justified if the game was longer or had more replay value so you got better the more times you played but given that that you can discover most things in one playthrough if you just spend time looking for them, this is not a good approach for it as there's really no reason to play after you beat it. If the controls were at least hard to pickup and easy to master it would probably make learning them satisfying but in the state they are, it really isn't and given that the combat and movement are two of the most important pieces of the game and pretty much the main reason I myself bought it, the game is spoiled due to said controls as they are pretty much the only thing that makes the game 'difficult' imo, the bosses and enemies are otherwise fair if you fix the controls.\n\nOh yeah also, another annoying thing about the combat, there are two dashing attacks in the game that you can buy, and they are both some of the best upgrades in the game, one requires you to press attack and then dash, dealing an AOE attack, and the other requires you to dash and then attack, knocking targets back in the direction you hit them and dealing extra damage to them if they bounce of objects or other enemies. This would be fine if the timing on these attacks wasn't so bad and made it so half of the time trying to use either ability in combat would make your character do whichever of the two attacks they felt like, causing you to get punished as a result.", "timestamp_created": 1659088426, "timestamp_updated": 1659088426, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516780197620391846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119638236": {"recommendationid": "119638236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363460754", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3575, "last_played": 1684265405}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a game, this is a work of art.", "timestamp_created": 1659012222, "timestamp_updated": 1659012222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119619956": {"recommendationid": "119619956", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987074661", "num_games_owned": 864, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 545, "last_played": 1619621783}, "language": "english", "review": "One of those games I really wanted to like but didn't.

It's grim and vague, yet inspires wonder and curiosity.\n\nThere's a lot to love in this game; if it isn't absolutely obvious, the art direction, animation, and music (more Disasterpeace!) are all top notch. \n\nCombat feels fantastic as enemies have good wind-up animations with many upgrades allowing you to more easily manipulate arenas and deal damage quickly. The greatest part? There's enough high-end technique (even with the starting kit) that you can really master it. There's the normal game, a new game+, a boss rush mode (with three difficulties), and a horde mode in the normal game, which means there's a lot to challenge yourself with\u2014 I recently completed a no-death run, which was actually very fun because the game is very nonlinear\u2014 there's four zones, with three of them being completely open to begin with.\n\nThis is a game for explorers. You are [b]heavily encouraged[/b] to explore every nook and cranny to get upgrades. This is fantastic because the game hints quite clearly where secrets are by a symbol that once you see once, you'll never unsee it. The healing system is forgiving, with three full heals (which can be upgraded to five) and with the amount of exploring to do, you'll find an abundance of resources to keep you topped up.\n\nThere's no text in game (other than the tutorial and a language to translate/google), and the game heavily relies on cryptic storytelling\u2014 the world and its few characters that talk in pictures are all there are to go off of, which means there's a lot to interpret. With just how beautiful the world is and how you're asked to fill in the gaps (or ignore entirely), there's a story to make your own with enough retrospection. I really enjoyed Harrison Consoli's \"The Beautiful Metaphor of Hyper Light Drifter,\" a near hour-long interpretation of the game and its themes, which I highly recommend after you've beaten the game and digested it.\n\nFor its one downside, its cryptic nature can [i]really[/i] hinder a player who doesn't know some of its strange quirks, for example:\n\nGear can be unlocked in many ways, with the cloak, weapon, and robot all being separate\u2014 and each set can provide different buffs. So it's possible to have three bonuses from three different sets by equipping one of each, which is never told to the player. You'll have to google the benefits of each as well, as the game won't tell you.\n\nA fantastic game in all of its parts, while it can be difficult, the game really gives you many avenues to explore to gear up if you're ever stuck.

Compact and tightly paced, there's an even spread in the sense of exploration and combat; I particularly like how all upgrades are up to you to get and prioritize, making the gameplay system catered to your interests (even if a few upgrades stand out much more than others). \n\nThe real standouts are the graphical direction, visual storytelling and OST, however; especially the OST, which perfectly sets the game every step of the way of this ominous, dead world and mysterious main character. There's no words either; only illustrations and environments, which prod at your imagination and let you come up with whatever you think the game is about (I think it's about a post-nuclear apocalypse, personally). \n\nIt's got some flaws, however; the combat system is missing some juice to really make it engaging, some of the content feels a bit repetitive, and the game doesn't have as much underneath the surface as it presents. Still, it's an enjoyable game that doesn't overstay its welcome, and still has some good content to chew through if you want to 100% it. I personally recommend the experience, but if you're someone who needs their money spent to equate to a particular number of hours, you'll probably want to wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1658683274, "timestamp_updated": 1658683274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119342228": {"recommendationid": "119342228", "author": {"steamid": "76561199190095907", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1049, "last_played": 1641855605}, "language": "english", "review": "i cried", "timestamp_created": 1658607202, "timestamp_updated": 1669542267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119336916": {"recommendationid": "119336916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281736776", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1777, "last_played": 1609723902}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game I have ever played - hands down.

I especially love the way that the game introduces itself to you. i do not like to play games where everything is handed to you or is just grinding or quest a to b and is the same etc. I love the fact that when you start the game you have 3 paths to choose from going north, west, and east each containing its own unique theme and enemy's as well as other rewards that are only obtained in that area. It's also nice they have optional objectives in each area that you cannot complete immediately as it adds so much more replay ability to it. Especially the difficulty being difficult i love how vulnerable you are but are capable of finessing battles quickly and smoothly. It may have some unfair moments where you get punished and even just die for simply one mistake but i like that kind of aspect it makes it more enjoyable but that's my opinion i understand not everyone wants to play challenging games that may prove too difficult and that's fine but this game is something i will remember the experience for and i will be looking forward to playing the other games that heart machine has and will be creating", "timestamp_created": 1658371413, "timestamp_updated": 1658371413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69872206449508667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119172064": {"recommendationid": "119172064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074871865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1567999393}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is underrated...", "timestamp_created": 1658368367, "timestamp_updated": 1658368367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50641024112701416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119115421": {"recommendationid": "119115421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110205363", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 823, "last_played": 1658291990}, "language": "english", "review": "great game ya", "timestamp_created": 1658292053, "timestamp_updated": 1658292053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50641024112701416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119095905": {"recommendationid": "119095905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043220684", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 348, "last_played": 1658260006}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty damn good!\nExemplary sound design, very pretty graphics, and tight snappy gameplay.\nExploration ias, for me, just okay.

Easy was definitely the smoothest experience but making the enemies easier really only helped me highlight problems I had with exploration or challenge solving. I want to say that enemies play by different rules, but I think its more that the rules your character plays by don't feel up to par with what I want or expect from a fast paced game like this. Enemies attacks felt faster than my dodge can handle and it made for an experience that felt like I was being cheated rather than challenged.\n\nFor a Dark Souls reference point: The fluidity is similar to Dark Souls 2 where it can feel like you are being cheated a lot of the time by enemies or the environment, as opposed to Dark Souls 1 or 3 where the rules your character and enemies live by are on the same level. \n\nIf you can adjust and be in tune with the mechanics and pacing of your character in relation to the enemies, you might like the combat. I could not get in tune with it, so it is not for me.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1657560830, "timestamp_updated": 1657560830, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472527474164962769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118610765": {"recommendationid": "118610765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254623454", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 568, "last_played": 1657512055}, "language": "english", "review": "It's drifting time", "timestamp_created": 1657512125, "timestamp_updated": 1657512125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118586516": {"recommendationid": "118586516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261351735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1657673361}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to like this game, I really do. When I first got this game, I played for about 3 hours and stopped. Now, a while later after playing a similar game I absolutely adored, I returned to try it again, and I still struggle to have a good time. The game isn't really bad, but it's just okay. \n\nIt feels unrefined. It heavily lacks visual clarity in what of the decoration does and doesn't have collision, many enemy encounters just toss a ton at you with no real coordination that just serve to swarm you until you get lucky and manage to slice through them before they take out all of your health, attacks can vary in the amount of damage they deal with no visual indication to how much they'll do until you learn from being hit by them, bosses do their little animation every time you challenge them which really adds up over time, and my greatest concern is that nothing ever really tells you what to do or how to do it, nor does it show you. It's very difficult to pick up because nothing is explained and, unlike other games that don't use dialogue, it doesn't really show you how to do things either. It just adds up to a great laundry list of things that collectively bring down the experience until it stops being enjoyable.\n\nThis game has its moments where it feels good, of course. Arenas that are more carefully designed and complex usually have really fun encounters, and in terms of visuals, it looks incredible. However, there are so many flaws that add up over time that it's hard for me to enjoy.\n\nIf you love the genre, this game probably won't disappoint you too badly so long as you find the option to make dashes go in your movement direction rather than your mouse direction, but if you haven't played a similar game such as Death's Door, this game would serve as a very poor introduction.\n\nAddendum: I finished the game, and I had a good enough time with it, though I spent 75% complaining to my friends in a group chat about questionable design decisions. Most of the game's presentation is great, albeit vague, but the at times awful level design coupled with somewhat clunky controls really brings down the experience.

However that's kind of how it stays. The story, whatever it might be, is told entirely through a few images with pretty much no explanation as to how or why anything is like it is. After I beat the game I have literally no idea what happened, what my goal was, if I accomplished it and if things are better or worse for the world now.\n\nThe world is small but surprisingly frustrating to explore as the entire games is filled with hidden paths with little to no indication as to where they are. This means that you have to spend the entire time headbutting every wall, bush and tree to see if maybe there is a path there, dashing off cliffs to see if the other side is close enough, or if there is a hidden panel to land on. There are two maps to help you along this way and both are equally useless.  \n\nThe gameplay and combat is simple but fun for the most part except where the game decides to be difficult. Then the whole health mechanic is shown to be a poorly thought out afterthought. Healing in the game is hard to find but dying has no penalty and usually spawns you right before you died so what's the point? Not to mention that you can never upgrade your health but enemies do get increased damage to the point where you have to heal after taking a single hit just to be safe but even that is thrown out the window when the game decides to introduce knockdown.

From the moment I started the game I was already blown away by the incredible artwork and music, which made for this eerie and kind of somber atmosphere.\n\nThroughout the entire game the amazement at the environments stayed present. Every area has its own identity and all of them are a lot of fun to explore. You'll be moving through a number of zones to activate beacons and eventually... do something.\n\nIn terms of story this game is a bit unclear. It starts out strong and mysterious, but it never really gets any more clear. There are NPC's in the game that tell you small stories through images (there is no dialogue at all, which is pretty cool) and those stories are pretty intriguing. There are certain secret paths to what seem to be lore tablets of sorts, but there was nothing I was able to gain from that. Maybe I just haven't been interpreting it right, or maybe it's just purposefully very vague, but I think if it was a little more clear it would be even more compelling.\n\nThen finally the gameplay. Hyper Light Drifter can be quite tough. You're going to be dashing around rooms, dodging attacks and bullets while slashing back at hordes of enemies. Throughout you'll gather materials for upgrades so you can get extra skills like a chain-dash or deflection of projectiles. The boss-fights are pretty vicious but not insanely hard. Still, there are some moments where your dash isn't working with you which makes some hits feel a little unfair. It doesn't happen a lot, but when it does it's frustrating. Overall though, the combat is smooth and traversing the world works very well.\n\nI would definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested, as long as you realize it can be difficult and the story is a bit too vague, but outside of that those 8 hours I spent to beat it were all worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1656932547, "timestamp_updated": 1656932547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118168220": {"recommendationid": "118168220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255392475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2475, "last_played": 1673491670}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games out there!", "timestamp_created": 1656899678, "timestamp_updated": 1656899678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118138211": {"recommendationid": "118138211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353682029", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 488, "last_played": 1656863195}, "language": "english", "review": "hu", "timestamp_created": 1656863688, "timestamp_updated": 1690716239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46647229790687561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118126800": {"recommendationid": "118126800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125414204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1684402571}, "language": "english", "review": "Best art style I have ever seen and the very little amount of context the game gives you really makes it worth getting", "timestamp_created": 1656851393, "timestamp_updated": 1656851393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118106250": {"recommendationid": "118106250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206185727", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1008, "last_played": 1673066331}, "language": "english", "review": "Cryptic story but amazing gameplay.

Its nostalgic and goes beyond just being a Zelda game with a bit of Diablo. It is closer to Hotline Miami and Nioh, than it is a Miyazaki game.\n\nIts subtle, unspoken narrative is one of its strongest points. A great soundtrack.\n\nI more or less completed the game the hardest way possible by accident. Starting in the west, then the north, then east. Should say, new players would be wise to try out east first - as going into either north or west without knowing the game logic... can be a bit brutal.\n\nCheers, big ears.\n\nAlso, the Drifter himself reminds me of Raziel from Soul Reaver.

It stands out from the crowd of other pixel-indie titles with it's zero-dialogue story and it's exceptional atmosphere.\n\n[h1] Combat [/h1]\n\nI really enjoyed the combat of this game. It's the first hack and slash I've played where the rhythm of your actions benefit you, which I found very engaging. If you dodge multiple times in sync with the dodge sound effects, you have less time in between your dashes. I really enjoy this mechanic, as it takes away a bunch of the mindlessness that tends to arise from hack and slashes. \n\nEnemies were also a joy to fight. Only two enemies are repeated between areas, so enemy variety is quite high, and they are all different and fun to fight. My only gripe is that the respawn points for some encounters could be better. Having to open a door every time I die or wait through the 2 second respawn animation gets quite tiresome, especially when I want to get right back into the action. There are also several simple, yet challenging bosses. You can fight 3 right off the bat, but some are certainly more challenging than others. I fought what I considered to be the second hardest boss in the game as my first boss, which made the later bosses kind of disappointing. Spending >15 tries on one boss only to first try the next left me quite irritated. After all, I play these kinds of challenging games for the challenge.\n\n[h1] Exploration and Story [/h1]\n\nThe environments of Hyper Light Drifter are extremely well done. There are secrets all over the place, and you always feel really clever when you discover them, as there are very well done indicators of their locations. The post-apocalyptic civilization that you traverse is vivid, each area is distinct and yet all feel part of the same kingdom, and the synth soundtrack just pulls it all together so perfectly. The story, a minimalistic, zero-dialouge one, fits these environments and music near perfectly. Hell, it's worth playing this game just for the environments and story alone. Especially for the pricetag.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nHyperlight Drifter is an exceptional Hack and Slash with incredible atmosphere that I recommend even to those that don't particularly like difficult games.", "timestamp_created": 1655865780, "timestamp_updated": 1655865780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117362244": {"recommendationid": "117362244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048499976", "num_games_owned": 799, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 979, "last_played": 1655681070}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game but I struggle to say it's amazing. \nThe combat is fun and addicting for sure but if you took the combat away you would be left with a skeleton.

I can get some fun ideas from what I've seen so far, but it doesn't feel... particularly inclined to assist you, if that helps. \n\nThe gameplay can be fun, the sounds are chunky as hell, but my main frustration is with control latency and deeply unforgiving stun-lock. Dashing doesn't activate for at least 0.2 seconds after you hit space, which is extremely frustrating at times as there are sections where precise dashing is absolutely mandatory and will result in insta-kills otherwise. Attacks will stun-lock you for up to 1.5 seconds, during which time you can be targeted and hit by almost everything and almost everything has a ranged attack that does at least 2 hp each time. In a game that spams enemies at you, that's simply brutal to deal with, and has made me quit with frustration at least twice. \n\nEnemies are well-designed, with great telegraphing and easy reads. This is vital: as mentioned, enemy spam is a big part of this game and that telegraphing makes it possible to dodge otherwise-undodgeable attacks. That said, there's not a lot of guidance on enemy mechanics at first, so there's a slight learning curve around that. Stick through it, I do think it's worth it. \n\nBattle arenas will dynamically change around you, which is absolutely fine except occasionally the shifting-walls animation will lock your character in place without locking enemies, leading to unavoidable insta-kills. I'm fairly certain this is a bug, and I'm also fairly certain it will never be fixed. It's not common, but it's frustrating as hell.\n\nSWITCH. TO. MOVE-DASH. By default, you dash to where your cursor is pointing: this is lovely for allowing you to move and dash in separate directions - how often do you actually do that? Not often, as it turns out - and for allowing precise dashing... but that's it. For sections where precise dashing is needed (which are several, even in early game), switch to mouse-dash... but combat flow is severely disrupted without move-dash. Turning around to slash with your weapon while running the opposite direction, hitting dash to dodge the enemy's projectile and... dashing right INTO that projectile?! Deeply frustrating. Move-dash is in settings and is absolutely necessary to avoid getting bodied by enemy spam. \n\nAll around, I really enjoy this game. It feels chunky, it feels like a classic hack-and-slash with some gorgeous stylings and excellent music and sound design. Slashing every box to find a treasure makes me feel good! That said, control latency actively killing me literal dozens of times, slow and annoying respawns in sections where latency kept killing me over and over, and stun-locks that make death literally unavoidable unless you are sub-pixel precise, means that there are frustrating elements to this otherwise-outstanding game. \n\nI still recommend this, but go in with a warning that if control problems are not for you then this game will make you rage-quit and wish for a refund. If you can work around it or are willing to retrain your brain a little for it, then this game is absolutely worth it on sale. \n\n---\nGrab this review template here! \ud83d\udc49 https://vojtastruhar.github.io/steam-review-template/\n", "timestamp_created": 1654339360, "timestamp_updated": 1654339360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463580161333084106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116441091": {"recommendationid": "116441091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027001277", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1207, "last_played": 1665948987}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid mechanics and ambiance, well worth a play!", "timestamp_created": 1654289565, "timestamp_updated": 1654289565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116430358": {"recommendationid": "116430358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027369766", "num_games_owned": 829, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1654400428}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is full of beautiful art and amazing atmosphere.

Amzing soundtrack, gameplay and visuals. Generally challenging but fair, altough some of the challange modes are a little much (currently playing new game plus after beating everything else, you can tell the game wasn't really made with it in mind). Some difficulty spikes but since you have plenty of freedom in the order you do things, you can always come back with a couple of upgrades. Absolutely love the completely wordless storytelling, the world feels very lived in and deep without a single word being spoken.

Strong emotions with brutal kills. Exploration and relaxation with the struggle to improve your skills and reflexes. \"Hyper Light Drifter\" is a game that does all these along with a technical perfection. It offers gorgeous pixel graphics, a majestic multilayered world, fantastic music, fluid gameplay, fast combats, good rhythm, deep emotions. A game that can be both challenging and poetic. A masterpiece not only for hack n' slash funs that you have to try.\n\n\nManometer: 9/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- It's pure art. Outstanding orthographic, pixelated graphics with tons of nice details. Gorgeous CMYK chromatic palette with touches of neon lights.\n- Fantastically designed post apocalyptic world. Strong dystopian atmosphere full of misery and dirtiness. Great level design with lots of different locations to discover in a multilayer array that encourages you to explore more. It feels full and alive, populated with various animals, NPCs and enemies.\n- Pleasant gameplay. Movements with great flow along with fluid animations. You'll never get bored of dashing forward. Tensive, fast paced battles with great rhythm. It gives you the ability to shoot and slash at the same time so you can try various attacking approaches.\n- Extremely rewarding kills even when you're dealing with the smallest and most insignificant enemies. Destroying objects around you is satisfying too.\n- It's a clever idea to tell you a story just with pictures without a single world. Although it gets too abstract it mostly relies on you personal feelings and interpretation replacing the traditional narratives with moods.\n- Great, unforgettable music. It's mostly calm and ambient but has something weird in it giving the game an out of space and time atmosphere.\n- Good, minimalistic audio design. The environment feels alive. Enemies' sounds are convincing. Electronic sounds at the menus fit perfectly to the cyberpunk mood.\n- Gorgeously designed protagonist. You'll love him, although he doesn't say a single word and you barely see him closely. But everything he does seems heroic as he struggles with his illness.\n- Good variety of nicely designed enemies. Each of them seems unique both visually and at their movements. Bosses are great and memorable too.\n- The world has so many hidden things to discover. Extra levels, guns, clothes, collectables, upgrades and more are scattered everywhere in a very creative way. You will want to explore more.\n- Well balanced difficulty. At normal level it's challenging enough without getting too harsh. By the time, as you get used of the enemies and the controls everything becomes easier.\n- There are some nice upgrades to acquire and improve your skills. It hasn't the depth of an rpg but the upgrades can affect the way you play pretty significantly.\n- At the beginning it throws you inside the game without explaining much. You have to figure out by yourself how everything works and what you are looking for. This makes it even more mysterious and gives you a, kind of, survival feeling.\n- It's fairly cheap for a perfect indie art / combat combination. Also it has good duration and decent replay value.\n\nThe bad\n- Deceiving perspective. Trying to decode the 3d environment can be confusing. A lot of times you're not sure if beside you there is an upper or a lower level, if there's a passage or not, if you're seeing an actual wall or the projection of something at the background. It would be very helpful if there was some kind of (at least prefixed) camera rotation.\n- Story is too abstract to motivate you play. It gives you some undefined strong emotions, but you don't care about what's really going on. Your main purpose, to collect the scattered pieces in order to open the door and fight the final boss, is too generic and well worn at platform / metroidvania games.\n- The map could be better. It shows your character in a general area and not his exact position. Also it isn't clear what is connected to what.", "timestamp_created": 1651032744, "timestamp_updated": 1651032744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114516202": {"recommendationid": "114516202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079899852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2852, "last_played": 1650949628}, "language": "english", "review": "With this game following along RoR in bring a 3D version, figured I would go back and drop a review while I am finally finishing it. \n\nLiteral diamond in the ruff here.

Still though, there are issues where the game prioritizes art and aesthetic over functionality and gameplay, like how the map isn't one-to-one to your in-game location. Combat is better than i remember, and i don't think controls are that sluggish and unresponsive; you're just committed an action through animation lock. For bosses, it was more about rushing them down with big attacks than properly learning their attacks and how to dodge. There's not a lot of opportunity or time to punish bosses after they do an attack, they just move on to the next attack. Also, hitboxes feel so unintuitive, which doesn't help.\n\nAnother criticism is with the story and npcs. You meet various npcs while exploring, but they felt hollow when interacting with them; i don't even think there are any sidequests to influence them in any way.

It\u2019s the gameplay, the story, the atmosphere, the depth and detail, the themes, ext, ext.  But as I\u2019ve grown older I\u2019ve realized that\u2019s not really the case.  We might look for these on a surface level but subconsciously we want something else.\n\nWe look for a feeling.  Regardless of the physical quality of the game we want it to evoke an emotion.  Whether it be the cathartic blood pumping action of Doom, the sense of adventure and discovery through Breath of the Wild, the constant stress and disillusionment in Dead Space, maybe even the melancholy and sorrow of walking through the desolate ruins of Bioshock.\n\nSomeone who plays Ghost Recon might find its open world to be monotonous and boring while another will get a rush from executing a plan perfectly, becoming one with the environment in a hostile world.  The game is only as good as its ability to invoke that feeling.\n\nEvery part of HLD is created to invoke a feeling.  The feeling of loneliness.  Sure you\u2019ll meet a few characters on your journey, you have a hubworld full of them but you never say a word to them.  They all see you, but they don\u2019t know you.  Even your robot companion is little more than a string of code weaved together to keep you alive.\n\nYou travers empty cities, abandoned tunnels and temples.  Drifting between the old engines of war, corpses of a long dead world.  There is no dialogue to share with the people there, only pictures.  Short views into the lives of those that remain.  The remnants of that ancient war still tar the fields and splatter the walls.  They awaken from a stilled sleep to inflict misery on the inhabitants left behind, their war is over but the battle still rages behind their eyes.\n\nIt is your duty to stop it, whatever it is, before your body shuts down.  A strange illness affects you, causing you to convulse blood.  Were you created for this?  Were you like the dead machines that surround you?  Reanimated to fulfill this one final purpose?  Made whole just to fall apart again?  It\u2019s impossible to say.\n\nWalking between the machinations of war you dredge the ground with another layer of blood.  You march onwards towards the unknown.  Your own mortality weighs heavily on you as with each consecutive fight you grow stronger, and weaker.  The sickness becomes more consistent, your breath more constrained as your blood splatters to the floor below.  Your sickening wretches echo around the empty foundries, the corpses of the past look on in silent judgment.\n\nStop for a moment.\n\nAmidst the etchings of an old artillery piece sits an outcrop.  A valley sinks forward before you, its lush green canopy spotted with rusted pillars spill out across the plain.  A mountain lifts out of the ground like a grand spire beyond it.  Creating a natural wall to hold in the sea of trees.  A giant mechanical beast rests against its side.  It\u2019s body stilled, eyes rusted and mouth agape.  One hand clasping upward, grasping at battlements long since turned to dust.  Forever stuck in a final moment of pain.\n\nThe wind hums by you, whistling softly in your ear.  You feel the soft grass beneath you, its green strands glisten in the afternoon sun, waving back and forth to the silent hymn of the wind.  You sit there a while and listen.  For a moment you almost forget about the dead, the blood you\u2019ve spilled, the visions of destruction.  It\u2019s all beyond you there.  They can\u2019t touch you here.  They can\u2019t hurt you.\n\nBut you know you have to keep moving.  To take up arms against the assailing darkness for no other reason then that you were born to.  You pick yourself up.

It is incredible to behold.  Contour, resolution, colour, sound effect, music, and animation all come together to make an incredible work of art.  The soundtrack by Disasterpeace {Fez, It Follows} emphasizes and also greatly enhances the visuals and animation incredibly!  Animal people talk to you in pictures instead of words, and this emphasizes the ambience of the place, as well as the space this game puts your imagination in.  There are moments the aesthetic falls. After hours of soaking in a unique fantasy setting, bouncy shrunken ninjas certainly seem cartoonishly out of place.  It seems all indie developers can\u2019t live without shoehorning in an out of the blue feudal Japan enemy, because Japan makes video games and animated tv shows [there is also a mini boss like this]. Each place you go has different animal people that got attacked by mean animal people.  This just seems a bit too children\u2019s cartoon for the setting.  Although this does have deeper implications to the emotion of the piece.  \n\n\tThe entire game leans heavily on pain, sadness, and inescapable despair.  Why?  Is this done in a cool fantastical Bloodborne/Darth Vader/Mordor way?  No, this is because the developer suffers from heart disease, and he wants to spread his pain into you.  Anthropomorphic animals from your childhood being slaughtered, their decapitated bodies lying everywhere, just like like his childhood happiness was taken from him. Each time you make a certain amount of progress you start coughing up blood and watch the same exact flashback you already saw in the beginning of the game over and over, seeing yourself get bloodily stabbed through the chest, with a loud sound effect that suddenly gets clipped.  \n\n\tThe game progress structure is that of Dark Souls, you are placed in a hub able to choose a few directions to go, and where you go first will shape your experience based on what your learn and what items you get.  This makes the land feel more real, and makes the exploration feel like a real adventure. There are many secrets to find, though there is an annoyance.  There is a subtle symbol on the ground that tells you where a false wall or path may be, but you are never told this.  This leaves you to realize it eventually, giving you that deep frustrating feeling of \u201cwow now I have to back track everywhere I\u2019ve been.\u201d  That just sucks, this could have been told by an npc in town at the very least.  Especially when a lot of the secrets are stone blocks with writing on them that don\u2019t do anything.  After beating the game I found out you were supposed to decode a language yourself to get some vague lore out of it.  This was disappointing.  \n\n\tGameplay is pretty smooth, though don\u2019t expect this to be Bloodborne.  There are a number of annoyances.  Your dash is not tied to your stamina, therefore you don\u2019t know how much you have in an instant, instead it has this odd \u201cyou can do 3 dashes in a row and then there will be a cool down we won\u2019t indicate\u201d system that can leave you growling.  Standing around a corner from an enemy could be safe, or that enemy could land a hit.  Hyper Light Drifter seems moody on which it decides for you, and this matters as the game is greatly difficult.  When it first came out there was no difficulty setting, trying to go the From Software route, but there were a huge number of complaints as the gameplay was unfair.  So many times difficulty feels faked by simply swarming you with lots of enemies instead of presenting you with a fun foe.  This lead to the developer giving into an easy mode, which is an outright lie.  There is no easy mode in Hyper Light Drifter.  Why anyone feels the need to lie about having an easy mode is far far beyond me.  If you intend the experience to be hard, you could simply indicate that Hard mode is the intended difficulty, no need to lie to customers about an easy mode.  It doesn\u2019t make you cool or next level.  Oh and they don\u2019t let you change difficulty in a playthrough, so if you chose normal thinking it would be, you have to start all over to play \u201ceasy\u201d. This is all compounded by it\u2019s autosave-only system.  It autosaves when you enter a new area, sometimes.  This leaves you backtracking to places you remember it autosaving to save progress in hard areas where you\u2019ve already completed the first part a few times.  The game also refuses to explain how your upgrades work, leading to much frustration in fights and platforming alike. \n\n\tOverall Hyper Light Drifter is one of the most aesthetically pleasing things to come out of the medium.  Though emotionally it feels like a sad lament to memories of a very tuff time in your life, which is as painful as it is nostalgic because of how intense that part of your life was.  It is perverse in its indulgence of fatalist powerlessness.  Ultimately it feels like a cry for help.  \n\n\tIf the art design interests you, it may be better to watch some game footage, as that will make it easier [due to lack of playing frustrations] to take in the fantastic artwork without absorbing the pain it tries to spread.  \n \n-Dinobeam, April 24, 2022\n", "timestamp_created": 1650256459, "timestamp_updated": 1650835232, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114038900": {"recommendationid": "114038900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030454681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 502, "last_played": 1681490922}, "language": "english", "review": "I am hopelessly in love with the aesthetic of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1650245048, "timestamp_updated": 1650245048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488126635551452637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114024503": {"recommendationid": "114024503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202148971", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 801, "last_played": 1650207164}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Obra maestra, y muy dificil", "timestamp_created": 1650223204, "timestamp_updated": 1650223204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495175182819366455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114006826": {"recommendationid": "114006826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091349976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1650220537}, "language": "english", "review": "I just cleared two of the 4 areas, thinking I probably beat around half of it now.\nA flawed, but still very good game. Inspired by the trailer for the sequel, I gave this game another chance.\nArtstyle and art direction are unquestionably superb, as is the game's unconventional approach to storytelling through mostly visual cues. A very ambitious goal that works - most of the time.\nThe UI is also very nice, an often overlooked aspect and tied with the attempt to mostly avoid written text and use only pictograms is a cool choice but as I mentioned above, not always without issues.\n\nThe game's flaws lie in its controls and level design and a few gameplay mechanics that feel a little off.\nControls and Combat:\nGenerally very fun, just sometimes it feels like you're fighting the controls more than the enemies.\nChain attacks and chain dashes feel very inconsistent, even after 8 hours of play. Hitting an enemy or getting hit gives a tiny time freeze effect that can really mess up your timing on chain attacks, costing me precious HP because my Drifter just stood there instead of executing the next attack in the chain or dashing.\nSome fights are also very visually cluttered that it becomes hard to even see where you character is on screen because it can get very heated and fast paced at times.\n\nLevel/World design:\nAesthetically very good, no question but from a player's perspective exploration can be a chore. The first time going through an area is fine because everything is new and fresh. But you will miss things and some secrets can only be found after revisiting an area. - and that can be very tedious. The map - especially the underground map is very barebones and while the aboveground map gives you plenty of landmarks to orient yourself, the underground map is only abstract boxes and lines and your relative positon IS NOT tracked so it's a lot of guesswork. Now getting back to that singlelocked door once you get enough keys can be daunting without a wiki. All enemies respawn, many doors get locked again and there's many one-way street sections where you DON'T unlock the shortcut like you would in Dark Souls for example. \nThis means you basically have to completely re-play old areas from bottom to top just to find that one pesky locked door which is impossible to find on the map.\nThis is very disappointing because the overall exploration and level design IS really good. The levels are diverse in combat and platforming, finding secrets is fun. But since re-visiting areas is such a chore, I'm totally afraid of missing even a tiny upgrade point because I know that I will have to redo entire sections again. Some inspiration from Dark Souls' shortcut mechanic would've improved this with no downside or effort. Some shortcuts are basically already in place, just when you re-visit the area, it's locked again. Why?\n\nMechanics:\nCombat is tight and satisfying to get good at. The upgrade system is kinda meh however. There's basically one very essential upgrade which should've been a default ability because without it, entire areas become inaccessible and you can spend dozens of upgade points elsewhere before using it, essentially locking you out of much of the content. Most other upgrades are situational at best and I end up just using my bread and butter dash/attack/shoot. Deflecting bullets is cool but with the aforementoined chain issues, it's an unncessary risk most of the time. The charge attack sounds cool on paper but the game is too fast to use it in situations where the extra damage would actually help - especially when you can find a gun that does MORE damage than the charged attack but instantly and with no ending lag.\nThe dash attacks are cool and protected dashes are a nice extra but not really necessary.\n\nSometimes the picture-only descriptions weren't clear enough either. With every upgrade you get a little animation to show what it does, but for health and gun upgrades you only get more ammo/charges yet the stores show a little animation of the Drifter using the items which made me assume that the actual usage changes with upgrades. That's not the case.\n\nLast but not least: The healing/medkit system is wierd. It feels like they wanted to go down the dark souls route of limiting your healing, yet they make you go look for medkits. Upon going to a warp point, you restore all ammo and health but NOT your medkits. Which is odd because you can just teleport to an easy area and get them there because they respawn and many are in non-hostile areas. So if you wanted to explore a new area with max medkits, you're forced to pick the easy medkits up elsewhere and then return. this is just tedium that could've been prevented by either giving us full medkits on reaching a warp point or by letting us store up medkits over our maximum and take them from there when resting at a warp point.\n\nEdit: Just found out that this used to be a future and with Update 18/04/2016 they took it out for some reason...\n\nThis all sounds very nitpicky and like I hate the game but the game is still fantastic despite these flaws. They just bump it down a few notches in my rating and unncesserarily so because many of these would've been very avoidable.\nI really hope the devs think of QoL-mechanics with their sequel :)", "timestamp_created": 1650201425, "timestamp_updated": 1650219379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488126635551452637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113989523": {"recommendationid": "113989523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394220506", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1650697135}, "language": "english", "review": "disasterpeace", "timestamp_created": 1650172816, "timestamp_updated": 1650172816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721405744552612305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113986162": {"recommendationid": "113986162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047294743", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 833, "last_played": 1650166873}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played countless hours on the Switch version of this game too.

The game has decent highs and some glaring lows. I think it's still an enjoyable experience and the bosses are mostly fun challenges, but there are a lot of flaws in the level design and enemy placement designed solely to be difficult without consideration for whether or not it's \"fun\" or an interesting challenge.\n\nA lot of areas in the game decide to challenge you by spamming dozens of simultaneous enemies that track you relentlessly and give you very little room to breathe in incredibly narrow platforms while the player has very few tools to handle this once you get overwhelmed - pre-planning and trimming early mitigates this but you aren't afforded that liberty when you're running through an area for the very first time. You might think the grenade would offer crowd control but it often just goes over enemies and is incredibly difficult to properly aim, not that this is a problem itself but it makes the only reliable tool a more casual player has to handle large quantities of blatant enemy spam... Not so reliable. I'm personally not a fan of games that throw gauntlets with you that are designed to kill you the first time you encounter it because you couldn't have prepared until already knew what was coming. In addition to this the controls are great when they work but incredibly clunky and frustrating when they don't, and I often found myself getting caught on terrain or enemies and losing myself in the visual chaos on screen because of it.\n\nOverall in spite of my criticism I'd still recommend the game for its fantastic OST and an interesting world portrayed by some amazing pixel art visuals, as well as an engaging gameplay loop when it does work.

This game is also sprinkled with beautiful music and a gorgeous art style that I haven't seen replicated anywhere else. This game is full of charm and easily gets you attached, wishing for more to play. If you're a fan of challenges in your video games, and you love games that have what I said earlier, then this is the PERFECT game for you.

I bought this game when I started out as a game dev in my first full time job. Took me many years to actually play it haha.\nThe level design is solid. There's a few moves but they work well together to make really fun gameplay. Dashing, Whacking and occasionally healing, shooting or throwing bombs. Although some of the combat and levels can be frustrating but it's still satisfying. I really hate spikes. Spikes PTSD.. The final boss.. very hard to dodge..\nThe feeling of finding new pickups is satisfying because you have to search the areas well. But it did add a lot of backtracking to the game. Although there is fast travel, most of the map is made up of respawning monsters and segmented land, so it still feels like when you first played the levels.\nThe progression is mostly skill based and the upgrades don't feel very satisfying as they don't impact combat much. There's only a couple that had impact.\nThe art and the level design are the strongest parts. Not a fan of the dash mechanic, because it felt more like luck. You never know which way an enemy will go, and sometimes you dodge twice with a boss and it gets you anyway.\nI guess dash challenges did give me rythm? I had to just stop thinking about it and learn the timing using muscle memory. The boss fights were fun, although some I had to retry many times while others I beat straight away. Even in end game it's very easy to die still if you are not careful with dodges and attacks.\nOverall, glad I played it, definitely worth a play if you like exploration, tight pact combat segments or collecting things.

Honestly, I would recommend just buying it and trying it and if you like it keep rolling but if not just return it. I loved this one because the art style and sound design really hooked me. I was surprised at the combat for a game called \"hyper light drifter\". With a name like that i was expecting more of a hades type combat where you fly around and just smash baddies with a super fast sword. While you can fly around, the combat is much more dliberate and if you go in just button mashing you're gonna have a bad time. You do get a dash move that you can chain but it is difficult to do so and once you lose your dash you skid to a halt, making you vulnerable during that skid. There aren't any invincibility frames and dodging enemy attacks takes some serious precision. However, the game counteracts this with solid respawn spots. However however the game design if very obtuse and leaves you to figure it out on your own through trial and error so I could see why that would turn people off. I did google where to go at the start of the game and that helped me get rolling. \n\nBut yeah. Great game. Not for everyone. I'd recommend trying it out and grabbing it on sale if possible.

How? Because in words its hard to convey the wordless vagueness of the whole experience. While it is a fun little Zelda styled Metroidvania, its absolute dedication to it being completely wordless will be the decider of if its worth it or not for most. There is a lot to unpack and it is an interesting game, but if you want crystal clear information as to what is going on, this may be best avoided.\n\nSo, Hyper Light Drifter: a top down, pixel-art stylised adventure where you go about and do\u2026 something involving unlocking cores that lets you get to the centre of the world because\u2026 to be truthful I\u2019m not fully sure. I\u2019m unsure if the main character, who seems quite ill, is trying to save the world before they die, or are they trying to save themselves? Still, they go around unlocking crystal pods that permit them to move onwards, but even then the vagueness makes even Dark Souls seem clear and to the point as to what is happening. The entire story of the game is presented via images with zero decipherable language being used anywhere. The scant few NPCs who will \u2018talk\u2019 with you tend to show one or more panels depicting some form of actions that occurred. Even then, a lot of these text bubbles do little to fully explain what is actually going on or what they want you to do. Granted the action going on in game is usually quite basic, and most interactions are done via combat or simply activating an object, so you can quite happily ignore all the things people try to communicate to you.\n\nInstantly it is very clear: You will likely love or hate Hyper Light Drifter. Its arty flair for letting the player interpret the ongoing events is so self-indulgent, or even smugly self-satisfied, one can imagine the most dedicated playerbase of the title will likely look down their noses at any criticism and simply state \u201cOf course a person as uncultured as yourself would not understand it! This was made for people with refined tastes!\u201d Similarly the aesthetic, which has some phenomenal visual flair, has the pastel colouring that would tie very well with the vaporwave movement, mixed with the warm and fuzzy post-something-or-other synth soundtrack you have to ask yourself: Do you like Vaporwave or maybe are you an art student? If the answer to the prior is either \u201cno\u201d or \u201cI bloody hate that pretentious crap\u201d, then you should avoid HLD.\n\nDespite that rather polarising take, the game itself is not bad. Unlike a number of Zelda / Metroidvanias, HLD here allows the player to more or less explore any area of the world in whichever order they wish to. There are no moments where a section is cut off due to not having the right equipment, so the mystery of not knowing what is up a cliff that seems unscalable is not there. However there are TONS of secrets! So very many secrets that its almost a criticism as a wall passed a tree could well be a secret hiding spot as it could be\u2026 well, just a wall. Thankfully these are signposted well if you keep an eye out as they all have a tell-tale mark nearby. These usually contain crystal pods that can help speed up an area, health packs, extra weapons or keys and sometimes upgrade chips to help boost your character. The upgrades are, in a very Dark Souls manner, not essential, but help a lot, ranging from the mundane heathpack upgrades to new dashing moves and attacks.\n\nGeneral gameplay is a mix of ranged and melee. While nothing ground-breaking, and in most cases not massively satisfying, it mixes things up by having the ranged weaponry charge when you do melee attacks. This is a nice twist as it keeps the action moving along and encourages forward movement rather than backtracking for ammo. That said I cant imagine folks would be buying this purely for the combat though.\nOverall Hyper Light Drifter is a tough title to advise correctly. As a game its generally fine, and I would say at its core its an interesting game, but its tone in aesthetic and storytelling is so utterly niche you will either love it or hate it. I\u2019m erring on the side or recommend, but just only on one, TL:DR condition:\n\nTL:DR \u2013 Can you tolerate something that could be considered \u201carty hipster indulgence\u201d?\n\nYes? Grab HLD! You\u2019ll love it to bits!\n\nNo?

For me there's simply nothing outside of the \"art\" that stands out in this game. It's just a medioker 2d game where the art and design choices seems to have taken precedent over gameplay in ways I cannot understand. \n\nMany things in this game seems to take unnecessary long time and many animations are slow like dying and returning. The color theme of the game is whack to the point where it affects gameplay. Too much single colors that melt together making it very hard to distinguish pathways and different surfaces. I also hated the fact that it's so difficult to see different heights and they way the game uses platforming with this atrocious height/color problem. Hiding secrets into these indistinguishable pathways are just icing on frustration. \n\nBlocking the view of the character is unforgivable and the game practically forces you to fall off the map again and again when you check behind edges or if you can move on some oddly colored/invisible surfaces.I did not enjoy cheap instant death traps nor the punishment of loosing health from falling down from any gaps in the map. The big square crushing blocks (what civilization would actually build something like that) added as cheap puzzles/traps in the maps environment are laughable relics from games past and stand out in the game as beacons of lazy recycled gameplay from early games when traps/puzzles were made in blocks from limitaions of hardware.\n\nThe worst offence of all is the lack of story where you move from area to area without any reason or motivation behind it as a player. The game tries really hard (too hard) to be mysterious giving you no information or backstory at the start. You basically run around and fight things with your nameless avatar you know nothing about while moving through closed corridor spaces in linear fashion without much motivation other than to explore/fight. You then received a complete world map painfully early with every linear corridor marked out revealing the small world of this game, only to discover that the map is drawn in a artsy manner making it completely useless. Dodge used with mouse and keyboard uses the direction the mouse is facing rather then to use the directional keypads. Meaning that you dodge into enemies a lot because you have to \"look\" at them to attack. A mouse user has to move his/her mouse towards an enemy to attack then quickly swipe away to dodge.

Individual people will tell you their stories, but you have to piece together why everything has gone to Hell. If you're looking for an exploration game with some brutal but stylish combat I can't recommend Hyper Light Drifter enough. It is true that you start off fairly weak, but not weak enough that you don't want to figure out what is going on, or what lies down one more forbidding tunnel.

This is one of those games that tells you next to nothing about it - besides a few pieces of tutorial text, everything is learned by trying it out. \"How do I read this map? What are these yellow things? Where do I get all these keys? How do I get to that area over there?\" All of these questions are things the game never gives an answer to. Instead, you explore, figure things out, and learn what does what. It's not just a feature - it's the entire game.\n\nAs for the combat, it's a mix of both swordplay and gun fighting. Dealing damage with your melee or breaking objects give your gun ammo, which lets you deal damage from afar. However, precision aiming is a bit finicky, especially since you have to stand still to do so. Because of this, it's often better to just quick-fire, thus making melee weapons a better option overall. Besides this, though, the combat is fun and fast-paced, with dashing around to dodge enemy fire being a key part of it.\n\nThere are tons of secrets to find in the game world, although most of them are not necessary. You can beat the game with very few collectibles found, and the minimum you need are marked on your map when they become relevant. Of course, anyone looking for 100% will have to scour every corner of the world to find everything - which also means doing some backtracking once you have something you needed before. Sadly, there is no way to mark the map when you find something to come back to; you just have to remember where it is. This is one of my biggest gripes with the game, but at the same time you need very few of these collectibles to beat the game, so it isn't a big issue for more casual players. If you do go out of your way for 100%, be prepared...\n\nThe game also has multiple difficulty options, achievements, Steam trading cards, and all those other goodies you would expect from a Steam game. Unlike what you would expect, though, there are no \"progression\" achievements - that is, there is nothing for beating certain bosses, nor is there anything for reaching certain points in the story. After my first playthrough, I only had 4 achievements, all of which (except for beating the game) were from miscellanious tasks.\n\nOverall, a fun and enjoyable action game, fitting for anyone who likes pixel graphics and \"NES-hard\" games. I'm writing this after beating a casual playthrough, so there's probably lots left for me to do, but even then, it's a relatively short game, clocking in at 5 hours (which includes going for lots of side collectibles and deaths).", "timestamp_created": 1639196514, "timestamp_updated": 1639196514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489614516496658325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105612662": {"recommendationid": "105612662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252053750", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6312, "last_played": 1691898053}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this game. It is probably one of my favorite games on Steam to date. After playing every game mode and while I'm still grinding for all achievements, this game has been such a relaxing experience to enjoy. While some may find its simplicity in mapping a hindrance, I find it quite enjoyable. A lot of this game's mystery comes from its exploration factor and the visual tricks played on you as you the player learn more each time you play it. With a lack of dialogue there can be moments of feeling lost if you set the game down for a period of time and pick it up later, however the visuals the NPCs display for the worlds history paint a beautifully graphic and dark story that could be compared to Dark Souls. \n\nThis games combat is very distinguished, akin to other games, it requires precise timing and focus. (Unless you're playing the Alt character, in which case you just kinda spam attack and pistol for the frame cancel and near permanent stun on bosses.) \n\nBoss rush as a separate entity from the save files is probably the best feature that is external from the core gameplay. Other titles, such as Binding of Isaac or Hollow Knight have the Boss Rush modes as a part of the gameplay or a part of the game save files, making the point of having the boss rush as an inclusive part of the game. Having the boss rush as a separate menu option is very unique and genuinely a nice option as you can change your difficulty and not have it be based on your items or equipment from a specific game file. \n\nAll in all, I truly love this game. I constantly pick it up if i have an hour or two to kill and will speedrun getting to the final boss. As of right now, while it may not be a world record, I can achieve this in 1:15:00. I look forward to playing more of the game to improve this time and share the game with my friends and hopefully make a positive impact on someone deciding to buy the game. \n\nEnjoy the game!", "timestamp_created": 1639194238, "timestamp_updated": 1639194238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509622514247894287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105545216": {"recommendationid": "105545216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856661455", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1234, "last_played": 1639014587}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!!

It's visual style of pixel is astoundingly beautiful, and the game revels in this moment by providing moments to just sit and watch. There are hiding places in the game that you can sit down and watch the world move in, the Sea, the snow, the mountains and more are there for your viewing pleasure. The buildings are wonderfully animated and dedicated to each area, nothing feels the same when you go to a new place, everything is fresh, the building style especially. \nThe player is a Drifter in a fading world, full of creatures of malice and death, war has long been a tragedy in this land, and that fact hides itself in every corner of the world. The fields outside the hub-world are full of corpses in the gaps, tombs lay abundant about the land, and there's a corpse long dessicated laying in many areas, rotten to bones. The atmosphere of the game is rich and beautiful, hiding darker undertones that aren't built upon but provide backdrop to the story. The vibrant colors and swift and fun gameplay distract from this darker realization.\nThe gameplay is swift and highly challenging, there are many ways to play the game with the toolset offered. Your sword is a tool of destruction, able to cut through most enemies with ease, however, the same applies to you. Your ranged weapons provide much needed variety that your sword lacks, allowing your playstyle to be varied and flowing between ranged and melee attacks. The enemies are rich and challenging, and everything is out to kill you. Though there is an achievement for dying a thousand times, you may feel like you do so, you won't reach it because though the game pulls no punches, its combat is highly rewarding.\nThe content in the game is deep and highly rewarding, you can play the game without going into any secrets, and in fact beat it within 8-10 hours, but there's still twice as much content left hidden throughout the game, it's not only a secret filled game, but one worth exploring and cataloging for all it's worth. The challenges within the game are tough, unforgiving, and require sometimes absolute skill to succeed at. But the game never pulled punches with you in the first place. \nThe story, while only told through visual dialogue, is rich and complete. It provides a simple narrative, told extremely effectively, it truly encapsulates the themes of what Alx Preston hoped to achieve.

I gotta say, every fight feels a lot more tense and thrilling when one slip-up means starting over from the very beginning. \n\nSo yeah, I had a lovely time with this game and I feel like it still has replay value for speedruns or challenge runs like beating it with no upgrades.

The primary gameplay loop revolves around combat and exploration. Both of them are pretty engaging. The structure is simple, you go in one of the four directions and explore. You kill enemies, find the ground switch thingies, keys, and currency to buy stuff in the hub town, and end it with the area boss. Repeat the same in other 3 directions. I personally enjoyed my first area, East, a LOT, playing 6h at a stretch following almost every secret and going through stuff again with a sense of wonder - but as I progressed into the other areas, that sense of novelty waned into repetition. Apart from that, I found the checkpoint system a little off, with long stretches without one and bursts of too many together - similar with health packs. And apart from some other issues I describe below, this is a solid, solid game.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Narrative[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n\t[td]The storytelling is done in a really creative way, replacing dialogues with pictures. The character is looking for a cure to his sickness, as can be seen in some portions in bw, which is actually a parallel to the game's creator having a fatal illness. It certainly has a very personal and warming touch to it, and it almost makes me wish those bits had seeped into the gameplay mechanics in some way too. Loved it.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Visuals[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n\t[td]This game is pure atmosphere. The pixel art is gorgeous, the imagery in some of the cutscenes really seem to go into abstract territories which is really interesting. Somethnig that I will later elaborate in the mapping portion doe, is that the visual design can sometimes make it confusing which portions you can actually walk/jump to. Another thing that I felt was that the animations of enemies and the hitboxes themselves felt slightly off in a lot of cases. Apart from those issues doe, a really pretty looking game.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mechanics[/td]\n        [td]5[/td]\n\t[td]I def enjoyed the movement and combat, but I would be remiss not to mention some issues. The rhythm of the chain dash was initially weird to get ahold of but then I literally had it in my muscle memory. It's a great mechanic that could've made traversal really fun. I say \"could've\" because the game puts too many roadblocks in bw to actually let you enjoy it. You slip after the 4th chained dash, which makes it non-viable for combat, but even during exploration that can lead to  you just slipping off a corner and dying. I'll describe that in \"Mapping\" ahead. Another issue I had was that the game has omnidirectional dashing but doesn't let you play with dpad. So I might want to dash into a certain direction but it'll round the direction off, which, again, can lead to fall deaths when trying to navigate the world - but also make you miss enemies during combat. Speaking of, there's certainly a certain amount of input lag, or like a cooldown with the combat mechanics, which to me contrasted with the quick nature of it, the enemies' attacks and quantity. Another thing I failed to understand was why I sometimes crashed into enemies while dashing, but other times I had complete iframes. IDK if I missed something there, but in the end, whatever system it has in place makes it feel a little unreliable.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Challenge[/td]\n        [td]7[/td]\n\t[td]The game can def be pretty engaging when it's at its best. While some deaths can feel out of hand owing to the issues with mechanics/controls - it was still fun. I do think it gets progressively easier doe, as I found it hardest only at the beginning while learning, but that's not a huge deal. I did feel in some instances though that this game's idea of difficulty ended up boiling down to just increasing the amount of enemies, but it contains that to a reasonable level. I did find it really annoying though that you can't destroy the turrets. Like why?? If it wasn't for the mechanics/mapping issues, it could be an even greater experience than it is.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Variety[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n\t[td]There's 4 directions the game sends you in. And I personally think that was a great opportunity to explore a lot of regional individuality through enemy variety, terrain challenges etc. And while they were sorta diff, I still noticed the same enemies everywhere, and it all easily meshes into each other rather than feeling like different areas. The core combat is fun. I do think the guns other than the shotgun are pretty much useless during combat though, and I never felt the need to use bombs. The boss fights were fun, not too challenging, but to be completely frank, I really don't remember any of em standing out to me. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Mapping[/td]\n        [td]6[/td]\n\t[td]On one hand, I really love the exploration and the atmosphere that it certainly has a place in my heart - on the other there's def some issues I had that came in the way of it enough that I couldn't ignore them. The main one being - fall deaths. The levels are designed in a way that sometimes it's very confusing what places I can actually jump/walk into and which I can't - which ended up making me die by falling much more than during combat lol. For a game that has this dash chaining, the level design had seemingly too many roadblocks to ever actually use it much. Not to mention that the slipping thing I talked about ends up killing you a lot of times as well. While I enjoyed finding the secrets, a lot of times they ended up being medkits which felt counterproductive in both ways - someone who needs em might never find em and someone who does find a secret would be a tad disappointed. But yeah, that's a minor issues vs the map design that leads to one too many fall deaths. Sometimes you can actually go inside bushes/structures that look like a border and fall-die there lmao.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]9[/td]\n\t[td]Loved the music.

The control scheme is weird though. It uses the same analog stick for both aiming and movement, which affects game-feel negatively. It wouldn't have been a problem if the game simply allowed me to rebind but I couldn't find the option to do that either. The game does convey its currency, and even the buying of stuff in the shop without the use of text very effectively though, so it easily has a +1 from me for that. What did end up becoming an annoying part for me sometimes was the map. The underground map feels very incoherent to understand, and even the normal one won't update your live location at all a lot of times. IDK if I missed something here, but it def felt like the map was a fairly useless part of the game outside of fast travel.

I think I may have it in my Switch library as well.  I'm glad I did.  Hyper Light Drifter is well made, and well worth your time. \n\nHLD is a three quarters view action/exploration game with impressive pixel graphics and excellent sound design.  There is a central hub area, and the world is broken up into four sections.  Each section has 8 triforce-esque pieces to collect, but you only need to collect 4 to move on.  There are many, many hidden paths, some absolutely deviously hidden away, and you will need to find them all to get all the pieces, and keys, and stone tablets, etc.  \n\nThe reason I have to make up names for everything in HLD is because there is no text in the game.  Everything is told via cinemas, or pictures, or diagrams.  It's an interesting choice, and goes along with the spartan/melancholy mood and design of the game, but there are a lot of times it gets in the way.  At times it can be difficult to piece together what is going on, which sort of lowers the stakes of everything.  Additionally, figuring out some of the advanced moves, and what buying certain upgrades does, can be perplexing.  I would say the choice is a net negative overall.\n\nThe combat in HLD is great.  You have a dash, a sword, and a gun.  You need to use them well, the combat is difficult, but fair.  The bosses are excellent as well.  \n\nI enjoyed my time with Hyper Light Drifter.  Its post apocalyptic aesthetic is remarkably well done, it is beautiful, and lonely, and foreboding in equal measure, while staying varied as well.  I did not 100% complete the game, as it is difficult to find all the secrets, and I do not like using guides, but I did beat all the bosses and get the credits to roll.  \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1637090564, "timestamp_updated": 1637090564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534591197967529297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102879369": {"recommendationid": "102879369", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979612150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 973, "last_played": 1637544667}, "language": "english", "review": "daddy drifty", "timestamp_created": 1637069002, "timestamp_updated": 1637069002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102853999": {"recommendationid": "102853999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070726040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 937, "last_played": 1637025428}, "language": "english", "review": "A polished 2d action adventure game.

It offers a singleplayer and a split-screen co-op.\n\n[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ Interesting exploration with lots of well-hidden secrets\n+ Intense combat encounters\n+ Good pixel art, that doesn\u2019t hurt your eyes\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Upgrades only make the game easier without opening paths to new challenges\n- Because even the setup of the story is unclear, there\u2019s not enough motivation to overcome difficulties\n- If you want to use chain dash ability, you must play on 30 FPS\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story follows a nameless protagonist and his robot side-kick on their quest to restore power to an ancient machine. Or it can be about something else, because the game has no text at all. You can gather something from the pictures some of the characters show you and that\u2019s all you get. Anyway, the story isn\u2019t the focus of the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAfter a short tutorial you are thrown into an open-world consisting of four locations. You have to find four artifacts in each location and defeat a boss. The game doesn\u2019t hold your hand, so you can do your objectives in any order you like and there are multiple paths to get to each objective as well as some secrets hidden along the way. Some of which are very well-hidden. The combat is very fast paced and has you jumping around battlefield evading enemy attacks and jumping back to do some damage. \n\nAs you progress you can unlock different abilities that will make your life easier. Like the ability to reflect bullets or invulnerability while dodging. There's a very fun chain dash ability that allows you to travel very fast, but it is very hard to pull off. Seems like the problem is tied to FPS, it only works well when you play in 30 FPS mode. Keep it in mind if you have trouble. There aren\u2019t any abilities that unlock new paths in the world or greatly influence your playstyle, which is a bit disappointing.\n\nI was very much in love with this game at first, but around halfway through it became too easy, because of all the abilities I\u2019ve acquired and the game just didn\u2019t want to up the challenge.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf you like exploration games with a bit of combat, then get it.

To be clear, I'm not saying they specifically ripped off any of the games I compare it to, since I think some of them are newer than HLD, but this is just what I felt was similar.\nThe art is trying to be Celeste but it doesn't actually look good in my opinion, and it's pretty bad in terms of visual clarity where Celeste is amazing at providing information. Also, the pastels feel out of place in the bleak world that the plot seems to portray as far as I can tell.\nThe gameplay is trying to be Hades with the sword, but lacks a lot of the nuance and the controls don't feel good to use, mostly due to the jarring pauses after every dash or sword swing, and the visuals occasionally making it hard to tell what's going on. The design decision of making the sword charge the gun is interesting, but it's not enough to salvage clunky controls in a game with demanding enough combat to make clunky controls unacceptable, and Hollow Knight did the same idea vastly better anyways. And before you tell me I just need to git gud, I would like to point out that I've beaten Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, and Celeste\nThe exploration is trying to be hollow knight, but the simpler art style and uninspired level design mean that areas don't stick in the mind as well, leading to a lot of the bad kind of backtracking. Even aside from barely working, the map feature is also unclear enough that it's barely a help in navigation. It also didn't get the memo about what kinds of content are suitable for secrets, as critical progression is often gated behind finding things in the sort of out-of-the-way spots that would maybe net you a Wanderer's Journal or an interesting charm in HK.\nThe pacing is trying to be Enter the Gungeon, but the characters annoyingly slow walking speed and the amount of time I spent blundering around lost, through areas where the bad guys usually wouldn't respawn between visits meant that I spent most of the time I was willing to invest feeling more impatient than actually tense.\nI feel like there's a comparison to be made for the storytelling, but it escapes me at the moment. Suffice to say, they took the idea of \"show, don't tell\" a bit too literally, and the result is that a story which seems like it might have been interesting just feels like more trouble than it's worth to decypher, and that's coming from a Dark Souls fan. The storytelling seems to present a lot of mysteries that its visual-only style of communication just doesn't seem equipped to answer. Questions like who I'm playing as, what those giant dead people are, what killed them, what I'm trying to accomplish, or why my own vomit keeps trying to kill me. All in all, it made me unwilling to get invested in the game for its plot.\n\nI've enabled comments on this review.

Things like I-frames, controls needing responsiveness tweaks, etc. \nI liked the combat though, but I'm not a very avid or hardcore gamer, so being a bit of a casual, I guess I just kinda brute-forced it through trial-and-error, which I can't say is the best way to enjoy something.

While the visual and auditory aspects of this game are phenomenal, it lacks heavily in others.\n\nThe achievements (as a completionist myself) are just terrible, and are preventing me from genuinely recommending this game, with one of them in particular refusing to unlock despite me having done everything right.\n\nSome of the combat controls are also buggy and inconsistent, I've noted that the \"bombs\" function occasionally does not work. The dashing is abysmal. Might just be me, but it isn't that \"good\" of a game design (probably because I've played Hades for quite some time) It's frustrating to be honest. \n\nThe achievements are, again, laughable as well.

I came in straight off of playing hollow knight and wanted to sink my teeth into a world filled with intricate lore and characters and mountains of dialogue to sift through. But instead I got just about the opposite. There was NO dialogue to speak of, the near nonexistant plot only served to move the game forward, and after I beat the final boss I understood just about as much as when I had started. And then that was it. I got hints here and there of what MIGHT be going on and what MIGHT have happened in the past but little more. So I walked away disappointed my first time. the gameplay was fun but I thought that the stripped back storytelling and lack of ANY dialogue was pretentious. I went on to play Celeste, OneShot, and Shovel Knight. All the idie gems. Then one day I found out there was a multiplayer mode and played this game with my brother.\n\nSince then I have 100% this game 6 times. This game is absolutely BRILLIANT in just about every aspect. You play as a wandering medic/warrior of sorts in an unfamiliar land with no means of communicating with anyone, and are plagued by a mysterious ailment. Everything about this game seeks to put you in the shoes of this character as much as possible and immerse you in it's world. The visuals are gorgeous, filled with vibrant pinks, deep blues, and lush greens. The sound design makes unfamiliar and futuristic surroundings into immersive, tangible worlds. And I'd be crazy if I didn't talk about how great the gameplay is. The core mechanics of this game are always the same (drifting, slashing, and shooting) but it's builds on it with upgrades that keep it fresh without being overpowered. It's very tight, responsive, and fast paced. It's difficult but never overwhelming. While fighting the hordes of enemies this game throws at you, you have to strategize and try to keep track of who's doing what in order to methodically chip away at them. It's incredibly rewarding and I never got angry while playing, no matter how many times I died. It's nothing but fun and engaging all around.\n\nAll in all I cannot recommend this game enough. Usually, even for my favorite games, I play them through once and rarely come back. This game is different. No matter how many times I comb through the world in this game I always have the same feelings of wonder and excitement whenever I discover a new area or beat a tough battle. And whenever I'm not doing those things, the slow, peaceful ambiance of the worlds keeps me going onto the next thing. And Ironically, by playing the game multiple times I have wound up figuring out some of the lore I was so hungry for in my first playthrough. All just theories and ideas though. Every time I've tried to look up any solid answers it feels wrong somehow. Like knowing more than I've found in the game by myself as the drifter hurts the immersion. \n\nIf you haven't yet, PLAY HYPER LIGHT DRIFTER.", "timestamp_created": 1635271326, "timestamp_updated": 1635271326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588752031326293945", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101581364": {"recommendationid": "101581364", "author": {"steamid": "76561199137478040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1634940684}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know who I am, what that is, or how any of this happened, but It's time to button mash because these controls are ass and I'm gonna die 20+ times to see a new area, go \"Ooh, pretty.\" and feel like I've accomplished nothing.", "timestamp_created": 1635120604, "timestamp_updated": 1635120604, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.364578455686569214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101562138": {"recommendationid": "101562138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001318276", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 631, "last_played": 1663804295}, "language": "english", "review": "Things I love:\n-Music\n-Art\n-Story\n-Mechanics\n\nThings I hate:\n-The one prompt with words for the health tutorial\n\nYes you should get this, get it now!!!", "timestamp_created": 1635092858, "timestamp_updated": 1635092858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101544849": {"recommendationid": "101544849", "author": {"steamid": "76561199022270271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 794, "last_played": 1635080050}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game (on Windows), not recommended on Linux since the controller support is nonexistent and the game sometimes crashes.

The gameplay is tight and fairly challenging, the world is fun to explore and and the art is amazing, especially is the couple of vantage points you can observe.\n\nThe story is the not very explicit type. Stuff happened and I'm not sure why. You could probably understand better than me by investigating but I enjoyed the ride non the less.\n\nMy biggest complain (which is a nitpick and doesn't devalue the base game) is the way 100% the game and finding collectables works.\n- First of all, 99% of hidden collectables are [spoiler]marked by a little symbol on the ground[/spoiler]. It's not hard to figure out and once you do, it takes away any challenge from finding them. It's especially boring if you're doing a second run through the map just to find them.\n- To complete the game, you need to find 4 out of 8 thingies in each of the 4 regions. The first 4 are marked on your map and there are 4 more you need to explore a little bit more to find. I'm guessing there is some kind of secret once you find them but you have absolutely no lead to find the last ones. I'm at 31/32, I went through the region where I'm missing one all over again and I don't know where to look anymore.\n- There are also [spoiler]a couple of hidden obelisks around the map which probably reveal a secret too but there is absolutely no lead to find them. After going through the whole game twice (once for first play trough and once to look for secrets) I have less than half of them and no clue where to begin looking for the others.[/spoiler]\n\nMaybe Supraland spoiled me but I don't like when the road to 100% is just aimlessly running around to see if I missed something.

I love the graphic style, which reminded me so much of the game Moonlighter, that I had to check to see if it was the same Developer (it's not). The mechanics for the controller are fairly intuitive, even for someone who prefers turn-based play over active battle. Exploring is interesting, especially trying to determine which platforms you can jump to (and which will end in you falling just short into the abyss). \n\nUnfortunately, there's also a few sticking points that make it hard to fully immerse me. \n\nThe first issue: What's the Story Here? \nYou get an opening cinematic that gives you the sense that you're probably supposed to be doing something important and story-worthy, but heck if I can tell you what that is. I know the character coughs blood intermittently, and that there's an NPC that you're somehow connected to, as he saves you in the start of the game when you pass out, and shows up in the different areas, having slaughtered a section of mobs. I can't even figure out what's going on by talking to townspeople, as they just talk in 1-3 symbols in response. The most explanation I've gotten about what I'm supposed to do is having a projection in my house show me that I'm supposed to get some triangles, and it seemed to want to point me in a certain direction to start the hunt, but with zero context, it made no sense, so I'm flying blind through the North, East, South, and West sections, with no clue if one is meant to be played first.\n\nBattle: For the most part, random encounters are feasible, but too often the game throws 10+ mobs at you, especially in fights where they've locked the room on you.

It borrows a lot of its core concepts from Zelda, while changing enough to not be considered a clone. However, it has a couple of annoying flaws that kept it from keeping me engaged enough to explore it fully and discover all its secrets. \n\n7/10\n\nThe good:\nThere are lots of impressive things about Hyper Light Drifter. Starting from the visuals, Its pixel art is very detailed, especially in the cutscenes, its animation is fluid, and the art style and character designs are very good. The combat is based on a genius mechanic, which incentivizes switching back and forth between melee and ranged attacks, and the dash move is very satisfying. The pace of the combat is very fast, and the controls are precise enough to facilitate that. These things are best exemplified in the bosses, who are all very fun to fight. The music is very fitting to the world of the game, and definitely one of the game's greatest assets. It's not very memorable in terms of melodies, or rhythms, but its ambiance really adds to the melancholy of the setting. All these things are not just good in this game, they are TOP NOTCH.\n\nThe bad:\nThey say that a picture is worth a thousand words, and that was probably the mantra behind the narrative design of the game. Hyper Light Drifter does not have a single line of dialogue, no text within the world, leaving a huge chunk of the story to be inferred by the player. The few characters that you can talk to speak in sets of 3 pictures, which although interesting and ambitious, left me grasping for meaning, and context to what I was doing, why I was doing it. I understand that the developers wanted to leave things vague, and open to interpretation, and some people really like that, but the total lack of information kept me from becoming invested in the game's world, and the narrative. Another major gripe was the map screen. Hyper Light Drifter is a game that's heavy on exploration, and finding secrets, so a detailed map is to be expected. However, in a baffling choice by the developers, the map screen only shows the room the player character is in, with no accurate positioning available within it, no details and a very confusing layout, that made traversal very tedious, as I struggled to find my way to each area's boss.\n\nThe meh:\nThis point might be valid for some players, and not for others, depending on a number of factors, so it lands its spot here. Hyper Light Drifter is non linear, in the sense that you can take on the 4 main areas and their respective bosses and any order you want, with the game only hinting at one of them as the preferred first area. This non linearity leads to some very wonky difficulty, especially when you factor in character upgrades, which affect the core gameplay significantly. Some areas can be hell to traverse through with lots of enemies to fight at once, dodging projectiles all over the place, only to make it to the area's boss and beat him easily on your second try. Due to the non linearity, the game's difficulty doesn't progress linearly with character progression and player skill, making it feel somewhat unbalanced.", "timestamp_created": 1632071730, "timestamp_updated": 1632071730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99612485": {"recommendationid": "99612485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820761841", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 473, "last_played": 1692949990}, "language": "english", "review": "very visually pleasing", "timestamp_created": 1632044930, "timestamp_updated": 1632044930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99598326": {"recommendationid": "99598326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299156443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3711, "last_played": 1630284070}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most different and unique metroidvania there is, i can compare this game with hollow knight with pride, totally worth it", "timestamp_created": 1632022621, "timestamp_updated": 1632022621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537480056285858154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99586885": {"recommendationid": "99586885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353866599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3242, "last_played": 1662498579}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game", "timestamp_created": 1632003996, "timestamp_updated": 1632003996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99552582": {"recommendationid": "99552582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056668665", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2434, "last_played": 1656838829}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic title, its minimalistic narrative and creative art direction aged well.

You'll notice the game doesn't support cloud saves on any platform. It's even worse than that. The game makes it so each save file is specific to a single computer. You can't copy a save from one PC to another. Want to play in two places, or upgrade your machine? Tough, you have to start again (or look up the tedious method of hex editing the data). This is completely inexplicable BS for a single-player game. Just unfathomable. No surprise the devs turned to satan, really.\n\nI loved elements of this and hated others. Couldn't be bothered to do the final fight or hoard mode as the combat, while good at times, is also deeply flawed and annoying at other times, like both of those. The main thing to enjoy in the game is the exploration and finding secrets, but there's no more of that once you reach that stage, so why bother?\n\nThe exploration really is great, although it's tempered by asking you to take loads of leaps of faith where if there's nothing quite where you jumped then you take damage (and health packs are a PITA to get back at times, while ridiculously abundant at others).\n\nThe story, and a lot of the game mechanics, are not presented in a way you can make any sense of without going outside of the game. This made me not care about the plot, but the fact I had an ability that was needed and yet I didn't know I could do that thing or how to activate it until I gave up in a part that required it and looked on forums... that's just bad game design. There's being obscure, and then there's failing to give the player information they need.\n\nIt's a little ridiculous that the game has a fairly broken input system that completely ignores button pushes at times, yet also requires you to maintain sub-second accurate rhythm to do certain things. It just felt broken in that regard. (And it really is broken, not just me. I used an AutoHotkey script to do a certain challenge which is a complete piss-take with the broken controls, and found it was impossible to get beyond a certain point, whether using the script or doing it by hand, if I was moving up and down instead of side to side on the screen, which shouldn't matter. Something is wrong with the game, yet it has challenges which are essentially impossible without exploits or outside knowledge.)\n\nReally nice music by DisasterPeace. If you've played Fez, you'll instantly know it's by the same person.\n\nThe developers have taken Satan Sweeney's money and made their next game exclusive to his personal games shelf that no one wants to use because Sweeney is an ahole and his store is even more half-baked than Steam (which is saying something!), so the devs and anything else they ever do in their careers is all dead to me anyway.

Everyone has their own story in this, because while there is a canon, most things are just summarized so you can have your own interpretation.\n\n- Player Exploration: It's rare to see games from this decade without quest logs, indication on where to go, or even dialogue. It's like combining the old Kings Quest games from the 80s and Hollow Knight. Hollow Knight especially seems like a good canditate on a similiar game designs, because a player driven, non-hand-holding, open for interpretation games are kindof a goner these days. Most games of this era are often rely on straight narratives, telling what you need to fight, why and showing no contrast between all of them. They're there to be killed without hesitation. Yes, this game also has enemies but they make you think as to why you fight them, most of them are the same species or just neighbouring animals gone rampant. It's genuinely an ingenious design that is dead in most cases, and mostly found in other indie games such as the aforementioned Hollow Knight. There isn't much of a boundry in this one either. You can go where ever you want to go exept the last 2 areas. You don't see this design either, even in Hollow Knight there were boundaries that the whole \"Metroidvania\" genre made up, but here it's glorious. Everyone has a different first experience because of it.\nAlso on the exploration note: lots of things to find, so many in fact that I just couldn't find it all. Many collectiables and such, outfits, weapons, keys etc.\n\nGraphics: Not going into a long tangent, this is one of the most beautiful games I've played in a while. You, have to experience it. It would be a downplay on all levels to just try and say: \"oh it good looking because\". But yeah absolutely toptier Design.\n\nMusic: Also not going to describe this: you have to hear to make conclusions. It's very good though.\n\nGameplay: Fast, skill based, perfectly blended gun and sword combat. Hard bosses and enemies, parkour and mostly exploration. It's genuinely amazing. Not spoilering much in this aspect either.\n\n\nNeutral:\n\nThe whole exploration and collecting is amazing at first, then it gets repetitious, amazing again, and then you either give up or just google the rest. Some of them are so hidden that I couldn't even find the way to get to them, but this changes person to person. You might like it, I liked it, and it got kinda boring.\n\n\nCons: Very, VERY short story mode without the whole collecting aspect and other difficulties. It differs to most, but I would estimate around 6-10 hours. Maybe a few more contients would've made it better, or just more replayability, but right now and I guess forever it will be way too short.\n\nDashing with mouse is kinda bad, might be preference but yeah.\n\nSome places are very cheap, such as the whole parkour dodging thing before the [spoiler] Heirophant [/spoiler] boss.\n\nGetting everything without google is a chore, so I didn't.\n\n[spoiler] The Judgement boss while cool and kinda difficult could've been much better, like imagine if he reactivated a titan and you could reenact the opening scene [/spoiler]\n\n\nConclusion: A Beautiful, vast and ruined world full of dangers and lost technologies. Good story, graphics, gameplay, music, and emotional attachment. It's like Hollow Knight, but a wee bit shorter. i guess if you really are a maximizer I would recommend full price, but a sale would would be much better.

The game's story telling point of view is ambiguous visions that your character gets along with the tales of people who have been affected by the recent events in world. No words are Spoken in HLD, the NPC's that do tell you things do it in pictures vignettes if you will, and the vibe of the story that is the surface level obvious stuff is that, well everything is just bad everywhere: you have the hierophant and their cultists, the hermit and the whole deal with the otters, the last general who probably has lost it all ready and believes that you are the enemy, and then you have the things created before the decline designed to trick you, or other's with similar goals and to kill them. Then you have the specter of death, Judgement, who follows you in your visions and murders you in every one of your dreams, who seems to not want you to complete the task set out for you by the character refered to by the fandom as Anubis, or as I like to call him, Space dog, who wants you to end this strife and turmoil and remove the pestilence that is Judgement from the world. That's just the story and only the barebones, if you dig deeper there is much more, a tail about imortality and hubris, about a civilization that lived before the events of the game but does no longer. Every aspect of this game is as finely crafted, the beautiful atmospheric music that elicit the themes of the game, the gorgeous art style and color palet which can only be describe as watermelon / sunset.

I have been meaning to write a review on this for awhile, and I finally think I should do it. \n\nI really liked this game at first. The story was enticing, the intro sequence completely hooked me. The art is gorgeous, and the combat is fun and challenging (but not too hard). It seemed like the perfect game to just sit at my computer and enjoy alone. \n\nBut there is one thing that makes this game COMPLETELY unplayable. And maybe it's just me, because the other reviews seem to be good, and I know I'm a bit.... navigationally challenged. But the map is completely unusable. It seems to serve moreso as an artistic rendition of the cities, rather than a usable tool. \nSo, while I still check it often (and realize how little it's helping me), I switched to just trying to remember where I was and where to go. I soon realized after an unbearable amount of time wandering around over the dead bodies of enemies I defeated hours ago in areas I had already explored, that I would never be able to progress. I figured that perhaps I was just not MEANT to progress in that city yet (maybe I just needed an upgrade) and moved onto another one. Alas, the same thing happened and I gave up in a fit of exasperation. \n\nI WANT to like this game. I came back to it many times because it really just seemed so fun, but I can't for the life of me understand how to DO anything. \nIf anyone has tips, please let me know. I will change the review.

Disasterpiece has produced yet another masterpiece in music, alongside FEZ. The pixel art graphics are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen, they bring a tear to my eye with the colors and readability of the sprites, it is simply gorgeous.\n\nThis game has very little story, and not a single word of dialogue to tell it. It is all told through visuals and music. And what a wonderful job the developers have done. Even when the NPCs talk in simple pictures, you can imagine an entire tale being told about whatever it is they're talking about. Usually they you about a boss that you need to look out for and eventually conquer, but sometimes they talk about lore.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly intuitive and clean, and (usually) the controls are very snappy and feel really great. You can move really, really fast in this game if you want to and you can just plow through dungeons with enough experience, but that requires a great understanding of the enemies, dungeons, and all of the moves available to you at any given time. All of the enemies have such striking designs, I love them all. After one, maybe two encounters, you know exactly how they work and how they will attack you, and none of them fight you in a similar way to any other enemy.\n\nBosses are also a great challenge. While at times they can be frustrating and feel very unfair with their attacks, it can still be very fun to fight them over and over. I personally recommend defeating the East boss first as I found that one to be the easiest. And just like the enemies, I absolutely love the designs. They each feel so distinct and share virtually nothing in common other than that they can hurt you.\n\nBut even with all this praise, there's still a number of issues I have with this game. First: It has a collect-a-thon element. There are items scattered all throughout the world that let you gain new abilities, but some of them you REALLY need to search for. If you don't search every nook and cranny using every ability you have up until that point, I guarantee you are missing at least half of the collectibles the game has to offer. I wouldn't recommend grabbing them all unless you are the Completionist, as they mostly serve as \"bragging rights\" after you get most of the abilities in the shops.\n\nThe main issue I have with the game is that sometimes the controls absolutely fuck me over. I'm not sure if it was because I decided to use a controller over bluetooth or if it was the game, but sometimes I got so incredibly frustrated that I had to quit the game and do something else.\n\nI do highly recommend this game. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1626099169, "timestamp_updated": 1626099169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95581621": {"recommendationid": "95581621", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999101023", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2922, "last_played": 1626066278}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with great soundtrack, very satisfying combat system, and a nice atmosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1626066853, "timestamp_updated": 1626066853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95568607": {"recommendationid": "95568607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040129569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1144, "last_played": 1626045344}, "language": "english", "review": "You ever feel like someone made a game specifically for you?", "timestamp_created": 1626046339, "timestamp_updated": 1626046339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840572774410247803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95554404": {"recommendationid": "95554404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198852048739", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 1734, "last_played": 1699726879}, "language": "english", "review": "Que jogo lindo, velho pqp", "timestamp_created": 1626027308, "timestamp_updated": 1626027308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95497888": {"recommendationid": "95497888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089656550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1698011379}, "language": "english", "review": "Speedy, Slashy, Dashy, Zoom, Died. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1625953474, "timestamp_updated": 1625953474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95490216": {"recommendationid": "95490216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283726524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1318, "last_played": 1625943934}, "language": "english", "review": "Gud", "timestamp_created": 1625943955, "timestamp_updated": 1625943955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95443019": {"recommendationid": "95443019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140870214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3576, "last_played": 1627185056}, "language": "english", "review": "The atmospheric ambiance really puts you in the mindset of the game.

The soundtrack is absolutely god-tier and the gameplay is really fun and it's an enjoyable game to play through a couple times. It\u2019s really amazing to see how great this game is as it was a Kickstarter funded indie game and imo is a lot better than various bigger titles from bigger development companies. Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is this game has a lot of great detail and heart put into it and is really fantastic. Various portions of the game and just in general at numerous times the game is quite challenging which I initially didn\u2019t expect and on a normal playthrough no problem but doing several of the side activities and additional gamemodes serve to be very frustrating at times.\n\n+Great art style even with being a low bit game several locations and the cutscenes look really good and if anything is one of the best looking 8-bit and or 16 bit games\n+God tier soundtrack just completely amazing\n+Lots of secrets hidden all throughout the game\n+Collectibles\n+Different outfits\n+Multiple save files\n+Boss Rush mode which is an alternative gamemode after beating the game which allows you to just fight all the bosses as fast as you can\n+Horde Mode which is a hidden challenge unlocked after beating the game where you have to fight against waves of enemies and try to survive as long as possible\n+Tons of upgrades, various guns, and lots of attack styles\n+Remote Play\n+Local co-op which if anything seems to make the game 100x easier as the co-op partner and just keep respawning again and again\n+Full controller support which imo this game is better with a controller\n+Short but has a lot of side activities and side gamemodes you can do\n\n-Initially struggled to get the chain dash upgrade to work properly as now I can do it so easily but I was pressing A\u2026 A and it wouldn\u2019t activate and I understand that you have to sort of pause and or press the button slower than normal beside mashing it yet, still struggling initially to get it to activate. This was one of the things I liked and disliked about the game is how vague and ambiguous it is on explaining things in the game as it pretty much expects you to figure out everything yourself with no real tutorials besides the initial one in the beginning. Yes it tells you to press the A button twice but it still wouldn\u2019t work for me at times and struggled as several other discussions and YouTube videos did a great job at explaining how to do it poorly.\n-The West Side boss as a whole made me cry more than I\u2019d like to admit\n-NG+ reduces your health to 2 health states and about the vast majority of the enemies and bosses can use an attack that deals 2 damage basically making the entire NG+ playthrough an insta kill playthrough. It was just really frustrating at times, especially going against the Northern boss who just felt completely unfair on NG+ as he would attack so fast and every attack was a 2 damage hit so you had to go through his entire fight without taking any damage whatsoever. He would use multiple attacks at once and leave barely any room to deal any damage to him. Just a god awful fight imo hated every moment of it every other boss on NG+ I had no legit issues with.\n-In regards to certain achievements the hidden one to \u201ctame\u201d an animal I feel may be broken and doesn\u2019t seem to unlock or the requirements don\u2019t seem to be explained well enough, the achievement to die 1000 times is a nice waste of time imo as even after playing through the game 3 times and doing several side related content I still didn\u2019t get it which simply required me to just keep running into a room and killing myself about a couple hundred times which was a lot of fun. Then of course you have the infamous \u201cbeat the entire game without dying once\u201d achievement which I think in any game is just the developers way of torturing their players and anyone trying to 100% the game as I don\u2019t see how anyone could really find an achievement like this fun imo. After doing a similar achievement in Outlast 2 and giving 30+ attempts and spending about 10+ hours for a single achievement I really just hate achievements like this lol\n-Horde Mode is cool however, I just wish they didn\u2019t spam the 2 damage enemies everywhere which just made things so difficult as there would also be 2 enemies spamming projectiles and about 1-2 charging you at the same time. Even better was when they\u2019d spawn and immediately charge into you giving you no time to react or prevent being hit.\n\nI really liked Hyper Light Drifter I remember seeing it on the store page awhile ago and it just looked so cool and knew I had to get it even though it doesn\u2019t seem like the typical kind of game I usually play but, I\u2019m really glad I got it as it\u2019s really fantastic in pretty much every way although several portions I would say are very difficult. Don\u2019t buy this game if you aren\u2019t expecting a challenge as this game is definitely frustrating when regarding several of the additional content besides just playing the game normally which is for the most part no problem. The game even has a \u201cSouls Like\u201d tag so yeah I guess this game is similar to Dark Souls. I also think this game feels a bit overpriced imo as I\u2019m sure most players probably just play through the game once and quit so 3-4 hour game for $20 seems like a lot even with its additional content. Ik that it's an indie game and I\u2019m not bashing it for being so much I personally just feel like it's kinda a lot.", "timestamp_created": 1625805732, "timestamp_updated": 1625806452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674335360527038574", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95360414": {"recommendationid": "95360414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041846863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1625782578}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent game.

Rather the complexity emerges from choosing the best weapon, tools and approach for a combat situation. No i-frames here! You are a glass cannon, deadly and mortal. You will have to be careful and decisive in you actions.\n\nHyper light drifter is the diamond in the rough, a gem of artistic inspiration.

This game demands patience, and I sometimes found myself taking long breaks between play sessions, but it always drew me back in. The worst thing about this game is the lack of invincibility frames. While this seems to be an intentional design choice, it can lead to you getting stunlocked and cause cheap deaths. Checkpoints are fairly generous, though, so you never feel too angry. Most of the time you can be back where you died in under a minute. The soundtrack is incredible, changing and adapting to in-game elements. I personally listened to the soundtrack before I played the game, so every time I heard a song I recognized it felt like a grand revelation, and going back and listening to them, now knowing the context behind them, was almost like hearing a different song. The story is told entirely through visuals; the only written text is in the tutorial and menus. This might not work for everyone, but I found it deeply impactful. Almost nothing is overtly explained, but I liked it that way. The ending knocked my socks of and literally gave me chills. Overall, this game is a masterful combination of beautiful visuals, immersive soundtrack, mesmerizing atmosphere, crunchy combat, and minimalistic style, all coming together to make a truly incredible ride from start to finish.
