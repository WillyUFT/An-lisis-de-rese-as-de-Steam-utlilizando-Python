The story is simple but the main attraction of the game is its humor and its colorful art style. The game has no voice acting; only having dialogue prompts, but that dialogue is also laced with good humor. Along the way in his rescue his crush Juan meets a bunch of helpful characters who teach him the moves and powers required to become a luchador. It turns out that Juan must become a fully fledged luchador to save his beloved. He also meets a cast of enemies who are also similarly hilarious. Overall it was an enjoyable story that was wonderfully inspired by Mexican culture. \nThe only complaint I have is regarding the ending of the game. The game requires you to find about 6 hidden items in order to get the good ending. This only becomes apparent after playing the game and receiving the bad ending. The game doesn\u2019t tell you that you need to find all these hidden areas (in addition to the hidden chests), at least I don't remember any prompts or hints about these hidden areas. Thankfully a good auto save point just before the final boss battle allows players to backtrack through the maps, collect the hidden items and thus get the good ending. I did not fulfill this task as I did not have time to backtrack.\n\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThis is my first Metroidvania style game and so I played on Normal difficulty. The gameplay was very entertaining because it had a healthy mix of platforming and combat. Platforming and exploration required creative use of the various luchador powers as well as excellent timing. Because of this getting to some hidden chests required a lot of retries and button mashing. I was not able to get to all the hidden chests but I managed to get at about 75% of them. The combat was very satisfying, supported by a great enemy variety. The enemies are also colorful and have a variety of attacks. The luchador costumes were also very amusing in their functionality and they are unlockable after earning special coins through gameplay: as it should be! As I remember when it comes to backtracking, all the enemies did not respawn; which is so refreshing, because I was dreading the grind. But fortunately only some of the enemies respawned or was it the enemies I skipped? I don't honestly remember. But either way backtracking wasn\u2019t a slog. Out of all the powers I think Pollo power is unmatched. I won\u2019t spoil what that is but it matches the game\u2019s humor and themes very well. \nAs mentioned I did not backtrack to find all the hidden items required to get the good ending of the game. I tried out one of those hidden areas and got the hidden items but backtracking felt tedious. I understand that one of the draws of Metroidvania games is backtracking to previous areas to collect the hitherto inaccessible areas or show those tough bosses who\u2019s the hero of the story. But this is not my choice so I did not backtrack much; I found it tedious after a while. The only annoying part of platforming were the portals. There were some parts at the end where quick reflexes were needed to move forward through the portals. I found this tedious and unenjoyable compared to all the other excellent platforming sections.\n\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe art style was colorful and lovely and subsequently the graphics were also vibrant and refreshing to look at. This is one of those game that will look good regardless of whether you have a low range or mid range graphics card. Backgrounds, enemies, bosses and allies have the same lively color theme. An absolute treat to look at.\n\n\n[b]Controls[/b]\nPlayed using the Xbox controller attached to the PC. A controller is mandatory for this game. Some button mashing was required at times and at times attacks did not register correctly. So there were some frustrations but they did not prevent me from finishing the game. \n\n\n[b]Side Missions[/b]\nThere are a few side missions in this game. I was only able to complete a handful of these. For most of them I couldn\u2019t find where to go to complete them so they were simply forgotten as I progressed.\n\n\n[b]Music/Soundtrack/Voice[/b]\nThe game has no voice acting which I did not find to be a negative. The soundtrack was thematic and adequate and all the funny sounds accompanying power ups encounters and combat filled out the gameplay experience nicely!\n\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\nExperienced no crashes and the game ran smoothly on my PC (which is a mid-range PC). It did not cause undue heating of the CPU and GPU.\n\n\nOverall Score 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1694709359, "timestamp_updated": 1694709359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146247076": {"recommendationid": "146247076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140665582", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1694979147}, "language": "english", "review": "Si", "timestamp_created": 1694640572, "timestamp_updated": 1694640572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146247004": {"recommendationid": "146247004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067582995", "num_games_owned": 1082, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1044, "last_played": 1694891036}, "language": "english", "review": "Bueno", "timestamp_created": 1694640454, "timestamp_updated": 1694640454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146150049": {"recommendationid": "146150049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075202999", "num_games_owned": 795, "num_reviews": 327, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 504, "last_played": 1436681337}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1694489042, "timestamp_updated": 1694489042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146069030": {"recommendationid": "146069030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067233064", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1694290486}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty unique metroidania.

You play as Juan Aguacate, a simple farmer from a small town. One day El Presidente\u2019s daughter was kidnapped by Carlos Calaca, an evil demon, and poor Juan tries to stop him, but dies in the attempt. He wakes up in the Land of the Dead. There, he is gifted a magical luchador magic by a mysterious female luchador. He puts on the mask and is transformed into a powerful luchador himself, and is promptly returned to the world of the living. His goal is to rescue El Presidente\u2019s daughter before she is sacrificed as part of Carlos\u2019s plan to merge the worlds of the living and the dead and rule both with a bony fist.\n\nJuan still has his wrestling themed attacks which you will use throughout the world to reach certain areas and take out certain enemies. It is still major fun racking up huge combos by pounding on enemies over and over again. As you progress through the game, you unlock new skills and attacks you can mix into combat, adding some great variety to the battles. Some enemies actually require certain attacks to defeat, so you are forced to adjust your tactics accordingly. Similarly, certain coloured blocks require certain skills to break and progress, so parts of the levels become unlocked over time, and back-tracking is encouraged.\n\nLater in the game you gain the ability to switch between worlds of the living and dead, first through special \u2018portals\u2019, and later whenever you want. This comes into play during much of the tricky platforming challenges the game throws at you. If I had one issue with the game, it\u2019s that some of these platforming sections can feel almost too difficult at times \u2013 however, it feels fantastic when you finally execute the right sequence of moves to get through successfully. Check-points are quite generous too, so you are rarely set back too far if you die.\n\nWhat is new this time around is a new \u201cIntenso\u201d skill, which adds another meter next to your health and stamina bars. This bar will fill during battle, and once full enough, you can unleash its power, doubling your damage and speeding you up slightly for a short period. It can certainly come in handy when things got crazy.\n\nAlso new to this version are some new elite enemies, including a new boss that is three times the threat \u2013 you will see what I mean when you finally come across him. The world of Guacameele! also got a bit bigger too, with some new regions added to the map, including \u201cEl Infierno\u201d, which acts as a challenge area to test your skills and reward you with money, experience, and upgrades.\n\nThe overall look of the game is the same glorious colourful cartoon like style from the first time around. I love how the game looks from start to finish with its Mexican and Mayan overtones, and there are many funny references to other videogames and memes in the backgrounds. Everything is well-animated and the characters are full of life. The game itself is crying out for its own cartoon series in my opinion.\n\nThere are alternative costumes for Juan and the mysterious female luchador (Tostada) that can be unlocked during the game. Also the fan community has been creating their own costumes for the game on PC. Some really cool designs can be found on the Steam Workshop.\n\nWhile traveling the world of Guacameele! you will still be treated to some great music and audio. Punctuated by Mexican guitars and trumpets, this is a soundtrack that suits the game perfectly, and I\u2019d honestly like to add it to my collection. It will have your heart pumping during intense battles, your pulse racing at epic boss battles, and have you grinning ear-to-ear at the more humorous moments of the game. There still are no voice-overs for the characters, but honestly I don\u2019t feel the game needs it.\n\nIn the end Drinkbox studios took an already great game, and made it that much better. So lace up your boots, pull on your mask, and dive head-first into the action! This is a must-buy that will be enjoyed by all.

The game keeps throwing new enemies, new mechanics, new traversal methods and areas at you but it never feels overwhelming because the difficulty curve rises at just the right pace.

He's very big, too big for all of him to fit on the screen at one time, which make the tells for his attacks kind of hard to read sometimes.

[b]Choozo statues[/b], yes this game wears its inspirations on its nonexistent luchador sleeve).\n\nAll of your BASIC fighting moves (standard attacks and grab/throw attacks) are available from the start, but you CAN buy some little side upgrades for those from the shops on every savepoint.\n\nYeah, you get money (Pesos, fittingly) from beating up enemies, as well as silver coins as unique collectibles that can be used to unlock [b]costumes[/b] that (mostly) give special effects and act as sidegrades (one good effect, one bad effect).\n\n\nSpeaking of pesos... Yeah, it's a mexican-folklore-themed game. A [i]VERY[/i] mexican-folklore-themed game. You can probably tell from the artstyle and screenshots already, but both the visuals and the music [i]heavily[/i] help carry that vibe along.\nIt's a weird mix of that type of theming with 2013-era humor. Obviously not everone is going to [i]like[/i] that type of humor but it's honestly inoffensive enough to not really detract from the overall story and writing (and hell, it's a bit [i]nostalgic[/i] in its own way).\n\n\nObviously like any good Metroidvania there's a TON to explore. All the areas are interconnected, and you can unlock teleport spots in (almost) every area to quickly warp from one to another. The map also handily marks walls that require specific abilities to break (the ones you unlock as you go, which are all color-coded for convenience) and keeps track of your item discovery percentage in every area, so you can comfortably head back and check for any small paths you might've missed on your first run through.\n\n\nThis isn't a TERRIBLY long game, you can beat it in about 3-4 hours. I know [i]my[/i] Hardmode run just now to finish 100%ing the game was a little over 4 hours, including all my deaths from... it being hardmode.\nWithout doing any sidequests (yes, those exist) or going for all collectibles, anyway.\n\nBut that's for the [i]BAD[/i] ending.\nYes, without spoiling anything, this game has MULTIPLE endings. You'll be expected to get the bad one on your first go, as [I]right[/i] before it ends it introduces an entire SEPARATE set of Macguffins to collect, all of which will be on entirely new parts you hadn't even THOUGHT were there before. Adds a GOOD chunk of extra playtime. My 100%ed savefile with all the extra content done ended up being about 11 hours long or so.\n...Some of those collectibles are also kind of CBT to collect, or even to FIND [b](looking at [i]you[/i], Forest del Chivo)[/b] but hey, that's the point of it being extra challenges to earn the better ending.\nYou [i]might[/i] need to look up a guide for that specific one though.\n\n\n\nAnyway yeah I've rambled on enough, it's a good game and it's cheap.

(GM) Super Turbo Championship Edition was a local coop game that I played over at a friend's house. It's a title I already owned, but when you're trying to find any Steam game with local coop, there's only so many options available. Based on how it went playing with friends, I was slightly concerned about trying it on my own, because even when we juggled health and lives, we kept failing to clear certain fights. Surely I'd be screwed by myself. \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] \nTaking the role of a luchador, you might assume that GM would be a beat-'em-up or brawler of sorts. With respect to the combat, it more or less plays that way, as you combo and grapple your foes. However, it also has Metroidvania aspects, as you'll return to previous areas with new abilities, unlocking paths that were blocked off before. Most of the moves revolve around combat to some degree, such as uppercuts and headbutts, but they also have relevance to platforming. For instance, when you can switch dimensions, this is needed to create and pass through floors and walls, but also puts you into the same plane as the enemy. Otherwise, they're apparitions you can't hurt, while they can still attack you. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2961799363\n[h1]Controls[/h1] \nThere aren't many situations in GM where you'll be dealing with platforming and combat at the same time, but with abilities covering both matters, your move set is pretty consistent in either situation. After acquiring so many moves, it can be easy to mix them up, though the mistake I made most often was whether I changed into a chicken or switched planes. It's also theoretically possible to pull off some complicated combos, but I tend to use simpler ones myself. Overall though, I think the controls worked quite well. \n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1] \nHaving been cheated out of his glory, after making a deal with the devil, Calaca overthrows him and plans on becoming the ruler over life and death. After invading the mortal realm, he kidnaps the main character's love interest, kills him, and creates his own adversary. For it was written that a recently murdered agave farmer would become the luchador of justice. In some ways, I think the villain is overshadowed by his more eccentric followers, as he's a pretty generic foe. Although I enjoyed the story overall, I was bummed that there wasn't an overview of what happened to all of the characters after beating Calaca. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2964826628\n[h1]Visuals[/h1] \nHonestly, I love the presentation of GM. It's flashy, colorful, and really invigorates me while I'm playing. You always know when you find a secret or clear an arena battle, because the game does a small celebration. Plus, who can really hate smashing a pinata? Also, with the alternate dimension, every screen has two variations, though its not always much of a difference. Sometimes it's just water being swapped out for lava or a color swap, while other times a destroyed village is inhabited by several skeletons. \n\n\n[h1]Sound Design[/h1] \nInspired by its Mexican theme, the instruments used for the music consists of items like trumpets, guitars, drums, and I believe the harp for some of the underworld tunes. Since you'll swap back and forth throughout the game, there's a version of the music for both dimensions, with some of the underworld interpretations being pretty creepy. Otherwise, a lot of the music is fairly bright and lively, favoring the idea of a celebration more than the skeleton army's invasion. Ah well, they died once, surely they'll do so again. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2964826018\n[h1]Pros[/h1] \n\ud83c\udf1f White knights might complain about supposed racism, but they're just projecting. GM is awesome because it celebrates Mexican culture, not lampoons it.\n\ud83c\udf1f I enjoyed the game's sense of humor, although I didn't need an old goat hitting on my mother. \n\ud83c\udf1f There's a fast-travel and mini-map system that helps players navigate around the game. \n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1] \n\u274c Due to some insta-kill obstacles, a few checkpoints can be a bit annoying. The fast-travel system also would be improved if you could move from checkpoint to checkpoint. \n\u274c Sometimes, I wasn't always clear what color the shields were around enemies. I'd mix up the blue and green or yellow and white. \n\u274c A faster run would have been a nice way to get around quickly, as your move-set doesn't always help with that. \n\n\n[h1]Tips[/h1]\n\ud83d\udd0d I preferred saving my money for the more expensive upgrades, or ones I knew would be immediately helpful. For example, increasing my stamina regeneration. \n\ud83d\udd0d You have invincibility while grappling, but there will be times when you need to dodge attacks. When I forgot that was available, I always paid for it. \n\ud83d\udd0d Due to how many abilities there are to unlock, I wouldn't bother exploring too much in the early game. \n\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] \nGive me a Metroidvania game set in the dark ages or a sci-fi landscape, and I'll likely enjoy it. However, with so many cultures and options available from our own world, it's refreshing to see something different. Wrestling isn't what would normally come to mind for a platformer, but such moves were incorporated suitably for a game like this. There's some rough spots where a quality of life change here and there would be nice, but aside from a few nuisances, I enjoyed my playthrough of GM, earning most of the achievements from getting all of the optional content. For those who have difficulty with platforming, I could see a few portions being roadblocks, so you might want to have a ringer who could join you in coop in case they're not your forte. Otherwise though, I'd recommend getting GM. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]PC Specs[/th]\n[th]Performance[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Ryzen 2700\nRTX 2070\n16GB RAM\nADATA SSD\n1920x1080\n[/td]\n[td]The game ran without incident on default settings.\n\ud83d\udc96 - GM is healthy\n\n\n[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1682167614, "timestamp_updated": 1682167614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653150379657745361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136899410": {"recommendationid": "136899410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092726414", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1568309334}, "language": "english", "review": "Metroidvanis + Wrestling = Love", "timestamp_created": 1681814384, "timestamp_updated": 1681814384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136819048": {"recommendationid": "136819048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838684942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 704, "last_played": 1681669370}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1681669403, "timestamp_updated": 1681669403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136653596": {"recommendationid": "136653596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198443709574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1653773271}, "language": "english", "review": "pollo power", "timestamp_created": 1681429143, "timestamp_updated": 1681429143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136324346": {"recommendationid": "136324346", "author": {"steamid": "76561199057611587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1680990834}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente", "timestamp_created": 1680941375, "timestamp_updated": 1680941375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136242100": {"recommendationid": "136242100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163886370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1525, "last_played": 1533594081}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1680829819, "timestamp_updated": 1680829819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136133927": {"recommendationid": "136133927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336568658", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1304, "last_played": 1644033871}, "language": "english", "review": "Platinumed this one since it's easy as far as i remember.

The art-style has a cartoonish angular look, which may look a bit weird at first, but it fits well and establishes the game identity, since it\u2019s immediately recognizable. It has a lot of charm and humor as well. The story is basic, with the game shining in the gameplay. To be honest, it\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t seen before, but it\u2019s well implemented. The game is fun, and the controls feel right, both in combat and platforming sections. Combat is melee focused, where you combo normal attacks, throws and specials moves. A clever design choice is that these special moves are also used in movement and are needed to access some optional areas, and in true metroidvania style, some areas aren\u2019t accessible during your first visit. The map does a great job marking those spots, so you can easily return later when you have the necessary abilities. The soundtrack is also great. Given the setting, I was afraid it was going to be very Mexican, but to my surprise, it\u2019s way more modern and videogamey, while still being Mexican inspired. I was humming along a lot of times. It\u2019s also a great game to hunt 100% completion. Some optional challenges can be a bit harder, but there\u2019s nothing hardcore in here. More importantly, it doesn\u2019t feel like a chore. The Super Turbo Championship Edition is also the definitive version of the game, with more content added. Not only that, but that content is seamlessly integrated. I only played this version, and I couldn\u2019t tell what was the original and the new content. It was all great. And there\u2019re also more good stuff, like 4 player co-op and a Steam Workshop for custom costumes. I had a great time with this game, and it\u2019s an easy recommendation.

Es realmente divertido. De 11 en este sentido. Y tambi\u00e9n es el juego que he desinstalado con m\u00e1s rabia nada m\u00e1s terminarlo. A\u00fan as\u00ed es un juego sobresaliente (a pesar de la est\u00fapida decisi\u00f3n de dise\u00f1o tras su final), que seguro reinstalar\u00e9 (o cuya segunda parte comprar\u00e9) y que recomiendo por 10, 15 \u00f3 20 euros, lo que estimes conveniente. Porque los vale.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nLo mejor:\n\n* Inteeeeennnsoooo!!!\n* El chivo.\n* La locura y la alegr\u00eda general que contagia su gameplay.\n* Que no deja de a\u00f1adir mec\u00e1nicas hasta casi el final del juego.\n* La mezcla de g\u00e9neros y estilos.\n* El arte gr\u00e1fico (le va como anillo al dedo).\n* La banda sonora (y los efectos de sonido).\n* El dise\u00f1o de zonas, mapeado, habilidades. \n* El control del personaje, magn\u00edfico.\n* Divertido a rabiar.\n* T\u00e9cnicamente excelente.\n* Casi cualquier cosa que se diga de \u00e9l.\n\nLo bueno:\n\n* Todo es excelente.\n\nLo malo:\n\n* Nada.\n\nLo peor:\n\n* Su final.

Esto ya lo hemos visto muchas veces antes y en muchos juegos. Y siempre es una mala decisi\u00f3n. Pero bueno. El final de Guacamelee! es lamentable, sobre todo, porque sus desarrolladores decidieron que es OBLIGATORIO conseguir ciertos objetos y superar ciertas zonas ocultas (y bien ocultas, ojo).. si quieres alcanzar un final (que no s\u00e9 si ser\u00e1 el \u00fanico) aceptable del juego. Y no te lo indican en ning\u00fan momento del juego. Aunque lo hicieran, es como si Hollow Knight, para \"sentir que lo has terminado\", cuidado, te OBLIGARA a superar sus zonas opcionales, como el Sendero del Dolor. Esto es un sinsentido y una decisi\u00f3n de dise\u00f1o EST\u00daPIDA en un juego, que por lo dem\u00e1s, es redondo. De 11 sobre 10.

Is it fun?  Yes.  Is it Well made?  Absolutely.  Is it hard?  Let's put it this way.  Checking the achievements - which you get some of for standard actions such as completing boss fights or areas - only 40% of all people playing this game have made it past the first boss area.  Only about 20% have made it as far as the last area, and less than that have finished the game.  These stats roughly apply to both this version and the gold version.  So, all these reviews saying the game is easy to average difficulty - no it isn't.  Not even remotely.  This is pro level stuff.\n\nExpect to die.  A lot.  And I mean a LOT.  Expect to find many areas where your average player will just give up and quit playing from sheer frustration or genuine lack of knowing how to proceed.  Which is a shame, because it really is fun and well made.  And it is generous with power ups.  But it's hard.  Very.  Only masochists, people with endless patience, or pro level platform gamers need apply.\n\nDo I recommend it?  Yes.  Just know the truth of what you are getting yourself into.   The one thing I will say helps is that it is sometimes forgiving where you continue from when you die, and it's not a game over kind of death, just a teleport back to the last save altar if you die from damage (with whatever fight scenario you were in respawned), or last ledge you happened to be standing on if you die from falling.

Is a mediocre Metroidvanina, there's plenty of other games that do this better, which may put some players on the fence about this game, such as myself. It hasn't got many downsides but the gameplay tends to play it safe with the combat, which to me, is a very important part to this type of game.\n\nThey did a fantastic job with the jumping puzzles, this is where I think the main enjoyment is at and it's very rewarding when you complete the puzzle. The next thing that should be mentioned would be the artwork, it's so colourful and vibrant that it kept me interested for a while.\n\nOverall Guacamelee! Does deserve to be played but know that other games do this a lot better, getting it on a sale would be the wisest move.\nTotal Score = 58/100.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nGuacamelee! is a hybrid 2D Metroidvania style action platform and brawler. Players control the luchador Juan and explore an open, non-linear world to complete the central story objectives while collecting necessary character upgrades and battling enemies. Coins collected from defeated enemies are used to buy new skills at shops, which also double as checkpoints. The game features drop-in co-op play, with the second player assuming the role of Tostada, Guardian of the Mask.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nHollow Knight, Rain World, Dead Cells.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 5 / 10\nNachoooooooooo!\n\nRECOMMEDED SPECS\nIt'll run on anything.", "timestamp_created": 1677273322, "timestamp_updated": 1677273322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133386911": {"recommendationid": "133386911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025522562", "num_games_owned": 1486, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1677287970}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable metroidvania with a twist.

The game name is pun! There's posters that reference other games and overly festive music every time you learn a new ability. And yet, plot cutscenes don't even contain an ounce of humor.\n\nI expected something fun to play. Fighting enemies at the start was fun; trying to aim for a higher combo by throwing the enemies around and all. But by the end of the game, I felt like combat arenas were just mindless enemy spam, and although I got new abilities, I was worse at fighting them off.\n\nThere's also a difficulty spike where the game suddenly expects you to complete really long screens that include platforming and combat without dying in lava. Because falling into lava or running into blades kills you and respawns you at the last checkpoint, but falling into poison or falling into the void teleports you back to the last platform. You go from being able to retry the last jump you missed, to having to do harder platforming without failing once.\n\nSimilarly, there's that one screen where you need to do dodge, double jump, air dash, switch dimensions and up-B in a very short amount of time. It's the only instances where the game asks you to do that; and no it wasn't in a sequence of levels with increasing difficulty, it just happened to be there. Also, there's two autoscrolling tower levels. That's one too many.\n\nOther annoying points were that the controls were too tight for me (the up button *must* be pressed before B or the ability doesn't activate) and that the final boss is different from all the other fights: [spoiler] it's more of a puzzle where you need to figure out what you're supposed to do, while all the other boss fights were hitting the boss until it died[/spoiler].\n\nFor a game that I expected to make me smile, I ended up feeling frustratingly weak.

It takes every lesson from prior titles, and iterates on all of the worst aspects, while removing anything good. This process is done, as they constantly reference other, better media, reminding you of precisely how bad this game actually is. \n\nI think the worst aspect of this, is that you don't truly understand how bad it is until you can no longer return it, as it unfurls into some twisted lovechild of the worst metroid puzzles, and pieces of actual, factual, Kaizo trash.\n\nThe game's incredibly slow controls and sluggish response time feels more at home in a souls title, but enemies there move at compensatory speeds; unlike this title.\n\nThe boss that finally killed this for me was (I believe) the second boss, the angry lady along with the design of everything between her and (the genius tbh) small hole upgrade.\n\nAny room and space I entered I could hear myself asking \"Would it be possible to make this room more infuriating than it is right now?\" the answer was always no.\n\nher design was so annoying and opaque with endless frustration exponentially compounding with every phase that I genuinely wanted to break my controller. The final phase, which I assume was built to make you use the previously introduced shield mechanics, requires RNG to ensure both are in a vulnerability phase at the same time, near enough to hit, reachable, and with you not in some 2 second long knock back, or in the middle of doing literally anything.\n\nI should have tapped out at the Bowser boss in temple 1.

Especially with the variety of slowing mechanics that were layered atop a boss where you would be given almost no time to escape from.\n\nI spent most of my play time unable to control my character, or waiting for my character to get back up after some random thing happened. \n\nFurther; floaty platforming controls, without a reliable double jump, on platforms barely wide enough to have hit detection, right at a timed switch...

Very addicting! Action-packed! This game gives you a range of abilities and combos that seems overwhelming as every single button on the Xbox controller does a different attack/move but you adjust to it and I would say it is easy to catch on. \n\nAtmosphere:\nThis is really where the designers nailed it. The design is absolutely stunning and really gives off what Mexico would look like in a video game. Many cultural references were nailed beautifully in this game. The catchy music, bright visuals, and character designs are well done, to say the least. The designers were clearly passionate about this game and it is easy to see.  \n\nStoryline:\nThis is actually where the game is weakest. The story is pretty bland, very much of a Super Mario game in which you have to go save the princess type of thing. In fact, there was a couple of Mario references in the game which I thought was hilarious (also a reference to Metroid so these designers love Nintendo). There is an ending and an alternative ending...but the amount of work you have to do for the alternative ending for what you receive...not really worth it. You could beat the game and then watch the other ending online without the hassle. You gain only one extra ability if you wish to continue playing and collecting orbs which you will pretty much only use to break purple barriers. I expected a new suit or at least something other than just a new slideshow for going to the extra mile. \n\nPrice:\nIt's worth it! However, it's an older game so you may as well wait for it to be on sale if you waited to this point.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is a reason this is a well-known indie title. The design and gameplay push this game to be one of the best metroidvanias I have played in a long time. This game can beat around 8 hours which is the perfect time frame in my opinion (10 hours if you want the alternative ending). If you want to give a friend a game, this is a great present for Cinco De Mayo. \n\nScore:\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1675639660, "timestamp_updated": 1675639968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132158965": {"recommendationid": "132158965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141821684", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1046, "last_played": 1688232245}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gran metroidvania!", "timestamp_created": 1675475046, "timestamp_updated": 1675475046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132153775": {"recommendationid": "132153775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055216902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1675466628}, "language": "english", "review": "You'd think for a game about luchadors the combat would be the best part.

Las ciudades son preciosas y est\u00e1n cuidadas hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle. En un goce visual. Por otra parte, tiene un combate bastante entretenido y conforme avanzas en la historia puedes hacer m\u00e1s convos, a la vez que aparecen nuevos enemigos con distintas debilidades. En este sentido el combate es muy entretenido. El apartado musical tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 muy bien conseguido, tiene canciones populares que conjuntan perfectamente con las ciudades. Conforme avanzas, no todo es pelear, hay partes de la historia donde tienes que hacer parkour y utilizar tus habilidades para continuar. Tiene unas cuantas misiones secundarias que son bastante entretenidas pero son cortas. Tambi\u00e9n, hay lugares donde puedes probar tus habilidades haciendo desaf\u00edos. La historia est\u00e1 bien y los personajes tienen bastante carisma. El problema que yo encuentro es que, en el nivel final, empieza a empeorar visualmente y es muy tedioso. Tambi\u00e9n que los bosses son bastante faciles, tiene un modo dificil pero no lo he probado. Aunque si quieres que sea un reto puedes ponerte el traje de pi\u00f1ata y sufrir. (Se pueden comprar mejoras y trajes con el dinero del juego). \n\nEl juego en s\u00ed, dura unas 9 horas yendo con tranquilidad y completando algunos lugares al 100%. Para completar el 100% supongo que son unas 20 horas aproximadamente. Con todo esto, recomiendo el juego porque es bastante bueno y no dudes en probarlo si lo tienes gratis. Si tienes pensado comprarlo te dir\u00eda que lo puedes comprar perfectamente al precio al que est\u00e1, aunque si no tienes prisa, puedes esperar a las rebajas. Tambi\u00e9n tiene multijugador local de hasta 4 jugadores. Por \u00faltimo, hay otra versi\u00f3n del juego pero esta es m\u00e1s completa. \nOverall: 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1674584020, "timestamp_updated": 1674585048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131393120": {"recommendationid": "131393120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360617251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1674835121}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, containing everything you would expect from the genre.\nFun combat and interesting platform sections.", "timestamp_created": 1674466138, "timestamp_updated": 1674466138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131218480": {"recommendationid": "131218480", "author": {"steamid": "76561199150779958", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1026, "last_played": 1674233364}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2611 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2611 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2611 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1674235444, "timestamp_updated": 1674235444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131121661": {"recommendationid": "131121661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099458236", "num_games_owned": 1587, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1653524818}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic of modern platformers.

A sleek, textured backdrop displaying a beautiful, hand-drawn, 2D animation of the currently speaking character, while adorable gibberish mimicking human speech plays over every rapidly appearing letter, it's so fun! Guacamelee, despite having so much personality otherwise, really drops the ball in the text box department, giving us little more than a solid-color shape with no animation, and a single, mediocre sound effect, maybe I'm weird, but it is honestly the worst part of the game for me\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt any rate, don't let the fact that the cons section is the longest part of this review fool you!\nGuacamelee is overall a delight to play through and complete\n\nIf you're a fan of goofy, energetic escapades, that don't take themselves too seriously and are just laughs all the way through, definitely give Guacamelee a shot!", "timestamp_created": 1671000823, "timestamp_updated": 1671000823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128392622": {"recommendationid": "128392622", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977450814", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 416, "playtime_forever": 974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 534, "last_played": 1693802292}, "language": "english", "review": "Best luchador simulator ever, suplex your way to victory!\n\nRevised: 9/3/2023", "timestamp_created": 1670797453, "timestamp_updated": 1693803204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485611498355865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128136802": {"recommendationid": "128136802", "author": {"steamid": "76561199221734090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1083, "last_played": 1671158554}, "language": "english", "review": "s", "timestamp_created": 1670468092, "timestamp_updated": 1670468092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127975971": {"recommendationid": "127975971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120110051", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1672656841}, "language": "english", "review": "fun!", "timestamp_created": 1670243370, "timestamp_updated": 1670243370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127943923": {"recommendationid": "127943923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271852711", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1704, "last_played": 1670294856}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game!

Going through the diverse towns and environments with NPCs directing you and cheering you on gives you a sense of progression\n- With all the humor and bright colors, the game is very inviting. Those aspects make you want to keep playing it, if that makes sense\n- The humor deserves special attention. There's some clever writing in here (i.e., Fray Ayayay)\n- All of these factors contribute to what feels like a cohesive, well-crafted world to play around in\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- The attention paid to the other aspects of the game should clue you in to how good the gameplay is. It's outstanding\n- This is much better on a controller. I found myself naturally fighting with the d-pad and platforming with the analog stick\n- The fighting mechanics are quite good. By the time you pick up all the skills and abilities, fighting feels like you're playing Smash Brothers with additional platforming options\n- Being a 2D platformer in the Metroid vein, a lot of those skills you pick will also help you solve platforming challenges and reach previously inaccessible areas\n- Some of those puzzles are really quite challenging, and fit in well with the excellent level design\n- I absolutely want to pick this one back up for a 100% run someday.

Sin embargo, se queda en ello, un plataformero exigente que te pone a prueba, pero que no quedar\u00e1 grabado en tu memoria como un juego memorable y digno por conseguir. \u00bfQuieres un reto y pasarlo bien mientras juegas? C\u00f3mpralo sin duda. \u00bfQuieres un juego que trascienda y rompa los esquemas de los plataformeros? Quiz\u00e1 hay mejores opciones en el mercado. \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nA pesar del trabajo que conllev\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n del juego y los diferentes escenarios, en ocasiones esta misma construcci\u00f3n hace que no se sienta inmersivo. Es decir, las misiones y mec\u00e1nicas dan una sensaci\u00f3n de \u201c\u2018ve al punto A\u2019, \u2018oh, ya fuiste y aprendiste una nueva t\u00e9cnica, es momento de que vayas al punto B\u2019\u201d, y as\u00ed sucesivamente durante gran parte de la trama del juego (por no decir toda, ya que para el 100% s\u00ed hace necesaria la exploraci\u00f3n aut\u00f3noma). Esto le quita atractivo, ya que, por sus din\u00e1micas, y hasta cierto punto su dificultad, ten\u00eda todo por delante para convertirse en un juego que te llama, engancha y te exige jugarlo. \n\nPersonalmente siento que esto es producto de una historia m\u00e1s bien floja, utilizando el t\u00edpico recurso de la damisela en peligro y el pobre enamorado que debe convertirse en alguien lo suficientemente fuerte como para afrontar el peligro y rescatar a la doncella de las garras del mal. Esto conlleva a que el juego pase sin pena ni gloria en cuanto a trama se refiere. Un ejemplo de este apartado podr\u00eda ser el personaje femenino, al que uno accede por medio de la m\u00e1scara. A pesar de que uno la utilice en todo momento, y juegue con el \u2018personaje femenino\u2019 (que lo \u00fanico que var\u00eda es la skin, m\u00e1s no la jugabilidad, ya que es id\u00e9ntica) durante el desarrollo de la historia se hace evidente que uno contin\u00faa jugando con Juan, nuestro h\u00e9roe primario. Esto le quita seriedad y raz\u00f3n de ser a las skins entre masculino y femenino, ya que siempre el protagonista es el masculino. Si quisieron implementar el personaje femenino debieron darle el protagonismo que merec\u00eda, de resto me parece simplemente una p\u00e9rdida de esfuerzo por parte de los creadores del juego. \n\nQuiz\u00e1 una respuesta a este fallo en la trama podr\u00eda atribu\u00edrsele a que es un juego independiente, y que por tanto no posee los mismos recursos que un triple A del cual se espera que sea lo mejor y lo m\u00e1s esperado. Si bien esta podr\u00eda ser una raz\u00f3n, siento que ser\u00eda brindar excusas a esta falencia que posee. El hecho de que sea independiente no implica que tenga que ser lo m\u00ednimo. Al contrario, como la creaci\u00f3n del juego requiere de un esfuerzo gigantesco para poderlo publicar y comercializar, se hace necesario que se pula hasta los m\u00ednimos detalles con el fin poder continuar con secuelas. Aunque, puesto que existe Guacamelee 2, parece que s\u00ed cumplieron los m\u00ednimos y eso represent\u00f3 esos frutos. Espero puedan continuar mejorando. \n\nUn aspecto en el que s\u00ed resalta y que lo hace un juego llamativo e interesante es la dificultad. El juego es accesible para cualquier persona acostumbrada a jugar juegos de plataforma (tipo Super Mario Bros), y gradualmente comienza a hacerse exigente en algunos apartados. Ahora, si eres una persona completista, que busca encontrar cada opci\u00f3n que te permite el juego, buscar todos los secretos y llegar a cada lugar disponible, en otras palabras, completar los logros y llegar al tan anhelado 100%, tienes un excelente desaf\u00edo por delante. Los apartados de los retos del Infierno ponen a prueba de ensayo y error, concentraci\u00f3n y precisi\u00f3n a cualquiera que lo intente. Fenomenal, excelente punto para el juego.\n\nLos enemigos son variaciones de uno mismo: los esqueletos. Estos son los que conforman el ej\u00e9rcito de Calaca (enemigo a derrotar). Una idea base y acorde con la trama del juego son los esqueletos, los cuales se relacionan f\u00e1cilmente con la muerte. Adem\u00e1s, las diferentes formas en que se presentan, as\u00ed como la manera en que hay que derrotarlos, hacen que sea una idea sencilla pero bien desarrollada. As\u00ed es como debe ser. Quiz\u00e1 uno esperar\u00eda gran variaci\u00f3n de enemigos, pero la forma en que presentan a los diferentes esqueletos responde a lo que uno demanda en cuesti\u00f3n de adversarios. Este aspecto de los enemigos, tambi\u00e9n se relaciona con la mec\u00e1nica del cambio de las dimensiones, la cual se utiliza en su justa medida, incrementando la dificultad y forzando la pr\u00e1ctica con el fin de pulir y ser preciso a ala hora de utilizar alguna habilidad y/o golpe. Excelente. \n\nEn lo personal el mejor plataformero que he probado es Hollow Knigth. Pero siento que este \u00faltimo no hubiese sido posible sin la existencia de Guacamelee. Los de Hollow identificaron, explotaron y desarrollaron ese tal\u00f3n de Aquiles que tuvo Gucamalee y crearon uno de los mejores juegos que he podido conocer.  \n\nPdta: Rese\u00f1a realizada despu\u00e9s de jugar un total de 29 horas seg\u00fan Steam, y luego de haber completado la totalidad de los logros.

That game was Guacamelee. I was kinda surprised and saw that others also got it for free. Now I didn't have any interest in this type of game so I didn't play it for years. But now I have finally come around to it.\n\nOverall the game isn't half bad but not great either. It doesn't have that many outright flaws, it's just that it doesn't do anything special to make it stick out from other Metroidvania's.\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\nStory-wise the game isn't good at all, it rushes the player towards a plot point. None of the characters are interesting.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nThe combat quickly wears off its charm, for me at least, it's a bit too simple and easy, there's no real challenge in combat arenas until they start throwing some instadeath mechanics in the mix, which are more frustrating than anything else. Also, the combos, there's pretty much one combo, there's going to be a new ability here and there but not change much in terms of combos. \n\nBoss fights are pretty good, I loved the one against 'The Terrible Trio', it felt very unique and fun to play. It's just there are barely any of them here, there are 5 in total and 2 of those are so bland and forgettable.\n\nThe controls are kinda clunky. Especially the later areas are sort of frustrating because of this, all the special moves are bound to 1 button, the only difference is the input of the analog stick. Now, this is way too easy to miss input since a thumbstick isn't the most accurate thing there is. Platforming suffers heavily under this, again at least for me. In the later areas, you have to quickly switch between worlds, use specials, et cetera. So this was rather frustrating than rewarding.\n\n[h2]Sound[/h2]\nThe audio is decent, hits feel rewarding, and so on. The music is alright, it repeats the same handful of tracks over and over which eventually gets tiring, but at the start, it's quite charming, except for one track that sounds like it's made by some mentally defective child.\n\n[h2]Visuals[/h2]\nVisually the game looks good, as you can see by the screenshots. It has its charm but, again, it wears off after a while. Enemies do look unique throughout the game.\n\nThere's one major complaint I have with the visuals and that is the top bar. When playing solo there's no reason to constantly see \"Press > to join\" times 3. It just looks ugly and obnoxious.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nAll in all, it isn't a bad game, not even close. But the thing that stops me from recommending it is that it's very bland and quickly wears off the charm it has going for it. Combat gets stale fast, the story isn't interesting in the least, and the soundtrack or visuals aren't strong enough to carry it. \nI don't want to say you can't enjoy this game, it's just that I didn't enjoy it enough to give it a recommendation.\n[h3]Rating[/h3]\n4,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1654084281, "timestamp_updated": 1654084395, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43918919563293457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116271730": {"recommendationid": "116271730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049825548", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1653968143}, "language": "english", "review": "619!", "timestamp_created": 1653968152, "timestamp_updated": 1653968152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116073066": {"recommendationid": "116073066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100211395", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1653708270}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know if I and so many others had lower standards when Guacamelee originally launched or something changed in some updates, but I have never been more frustrated with the controls and overall design in a game in my life.

Which is frustrating for me, someone who doesn't like metroidvanias, because i would much prefer that the developers made a linear action game instead. I ended up just rushing to the end without doing any optional content or side quests. It took me about 4 hours to finish the game.\n\nThere are too many platforming elements. They are tedious and it gets bogged down with gimmick after gimmick. The combat is more enjoyable and it would've been preferable if that was the focus of the game.\n\nThe combat starts out OK, but it also gets bogged down with gimmicks very quickly. By the end of the game, the player is forced to use about half a dozen different skills and abilities to even damage enemies. It doesn't make the combat challenging or varied, it just turns the whole thing into an unfun, overly complicated slog.\n\nThere's little story in the game and infrequent cutscenes (unskippable). However, the small amount of story and cutscenes that are in the game are quite terrible. Would've preferred that there was zero dialogue and the story was told through animations. The developers, in particular, have a terrible sense of humor.\n\nThe difficulty is all over the place.

I think this game is like, the perfect candidate for a \"Maybe\" recommendation tag on Steam. I've bought both this and the older Gold Edition and probably have 20 hours as a whole across them both and I've bounced off them each time. \n\nThe core gameplay is fun: grappling and throwing enemies around, including into other enemies is a neat twist on the usual combat for these kinds of games. The graphics are colorful and vibrant. The music is catchy. It's not terribly long or the sort of game that pads out its runtime. Some of the dialogue can be funny. \n\nIt's also the sort of game that trades story for gaming references and jokes that are kind of run into the ground like an episode of Family Guy. I would've appreciated a little more story or worldbuilding for as colorful as the world is, it's mostly a vehicle to give \"hey I recognize that thing\"-style references to other video games. This doesn't always have to be a dealbreaker, but in a Metroidvania you should want to explore the world because that's a big part of the genre's concept and Guacamelee's world isn't...interesting enough on its own to want to explore. \n\nIt's also kind of exhausting to play: by the end, the final dungeon, once all the mechanics are unlocked, enemies have a laundry list of things you have to do to be able to kill them (gotta be in the right dimension, gotta attack them with the right color attack, gotta dodge X and Y attack, but you can't dodge Z, etc) and the fights themselves turn into chaotic clusterfucks once 3+ enemies are on the screen where the action can be difficulty to follow and I just wasn't having much fun with the core combat anymore. The mechanics seem to build on in a way that's there to make it harder to kill enemies rather than to create any kind of fun variations on the core combat loop, such as giving them the ability to teleport away from you mid-combo to break up your all-important combo stack or the ability to be immune to all damage except certain attacks. \n\nAnd then little problems like some really questionable hit detection or a boss bugging out and changing attacks mid-animation, etc.\n\nIt's also a really platforming-heavy game with some puzzles that require precise timing and a section midway through the game (the volcano) where they throw in a lot of instant-death mechanics that just...grate.\n\nSo...it's a \"maybe\" game. Maybe it can be a game you really dig, if the above doesn't really bother you.

The mechanics for some of the platform based challenge are borderline awful, and their increasing frequency near the final portion of the game, made this game insanely frustrating. The kind with one-hit kill traps, annoying enemies with unblockable attacks and unfun mechanics tossed in for no apparent choice other than making the challenge just straight up hard. I think this is the main problem with a lot of metroidvania style games in this vein, but the unique issue with Guacamelee is that all of the abilities require precise input. If you've ever played a fighting game for the 5th or 10th time and you're trying to nail the exact input to get a special move done, you know the pain, but the makers instead went, man what if it was that fight, plus we add a bunch of exploding guys on a countdown over a pit of instant death?", "timestamp_created": 1649873654, "timestamp_updated": 1649873654, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113632859": {"recommendationid": "113632859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059955896", "num_games_owned": 1149, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1649591574}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gets too much praise. Although it's not a straight up bad game, it's not as good as people try to tell you. It gets very repetitive really fast and the game elements are not that much fun to hold your attention 'til the end of the game. The fact that the game isn't very long but still too long to be fun for it's whole playtime was very exhausting for me. From the half point on i hadn't much fun with the game and was already anticipating the end so that i can be done with it. Combat is really simple but get's only more annoying. Especially in the later areas, where you're thrown with encounter after encounter, consisting of enemies which are mostly the same but in greater numbers. Don't get me started with enemies which instant kill you if you don't kill them fast enough. Endgame enemies have the mechanic to randomly teleport away, which kinda breaks the flow of combat and doesn't do anything except wasting your time & combo.\nAlso there are some irritating checkpoints where you have to go through another area again just to reach the point where you died, which just wastes your time. This is in particular annoying in areas where you die instantly from environmental hazards. The game doesn't do very interesting stuff with it's metroidvania elements, you just get additional attacks for color code blocks which are destroyed by those attacks - apart from wallrun or the goat fly near the end of the game there isn't anything shaking up the gameplay, and backtracking for items which are not very rewarding isn't much fun either, also because the world isn't that interesting. There is a Teleport system, although the spots are often not in smart areas which led to me not using it for the most part.\n\nAll in all i can't say that this should at all be a metroidvania, and those element feel rather forced. Could be replaced with doors & keys, this game does nothing interesting with the formula - especially as the world doesn't change as you progress the games.\nIf you're looking for a metroidvania, play sth else.

Interestingly enough, I absolutely loved the sequel but was left very divided on how I felt about the original.  The sequel expands upon everything that is introduced in the first game, and cleans up every problem area that I ran into.  It's a true labor of love, and a clear example of how an Indie team can turn a promising yet deeply flawed game into a true work of art.  Unfortunately, the first Guacamelee can't compete w/ average beat 'em ups and offers very minimal metroidvania elements, while also being very rough around the edges.  This is a shame b/c there is so much charm, humor, and love put into this game, but it just doesn't quite all come together in the end.\n\nWhat's Good:\n-There is a ton of creativity and charm in this title.  I can't think of another beat 'em up metroidvania that offers bright colors, Mexican folklore, and breaks the third wall w/ humor constantly.  There are a ton of bright, likeable npcs throughout the game that really add life to the world.\n-One of the smartest choices that the devs made was to make most of the major mechanics act as duel functions.  The uppercut is essential in combat, but also plays a role in breaking red bricks that block pathways, and is essential in platforming and secret hunting.  The dash punch also will be used in combat, platforming, and gatekeeping.  \n-The impact when punching, dodging, and slamming enemies is perfect imo.  This is another area that this game really shines.  One of the biggest disappointments of Ender Lillies was how lifeless some of the attacks and dodges felt.  When you perfectly dodge an attack, the game slightly slows down to emphasize that movement.  When you hit an enemy, you really feel the impact, which adds weight to every combo.\n-The dimension swapping ability, although underutilized, has so much potential.  This is another use of duel functionality.  The dimension swapping ability allows for every biome to have two different biomes w/ unique secrets and enemies.  It also adds another layer to every platforming section and becomes a focal point of late game content.\n-Secret hunters will be delighted, as there are tons!  Most of the secrets are in fairly obvious locations, but there are quite a few secrets that are very difficult to find.\n\nCould Use Some Changes:\n-The biggest complaint that I have, is that this feels like a game w/ a lot of great ideas, but they just aren't executed to their full potential.  Combat feels great, but the enemies and even bosses are so easy, that they never feel like a real threat.  You can see that this could be a really unique metroidvania, but it's just not an organic, interconnected world that gives a sense of wonder during exploration.  The chicken power is basically only used for a few secrets and some mandatory tunnels.  This game kind of reminds me of Ori and the Blind Forrest.  I saw incredible potential, but it kind of felt like an extended tech demo instead of a fully coherent game. \n-This isn't really a metroidvania.  It's a beat 'em up w/ some very light metroidvania elements sprinkled in there.  It's exceptionally linear, and the game always tells you exactly where to go.  Even if you try to go out of your way to go to a different location, you will likely run into a literal brick wall.  The world doesn't feel interconnected, it feels much closer to a stage based action platformer.\n-The pacing of this game feels off.  The first 3-4 hrs are extremely slow and dull.  If you are remotely experienced in this genre, then by hr 5, you will be so overpowered b/c finding health and stamina upgrades are really easy early on.  The game starts to hit it's stride near the 7-8 hr mark, but just as that happens, the game abruptly ends.  \n-This is an extremely easy game.  All of the secrets are either health or stamina which is really helpful, but very boring.  Not every game needs to be challenging, but outside of the final boss and some optional secret hunting and side quests, there are close to no real threats in this game.  You can brute force your way through pretty much everything, especially all combat situations.  The platforming is the only area that is even remotely a challenge, but even that is fairly simple the first 2/3 of the game.\n\nThoughts:\n-So I got this game for free during a giveaway about 2 years ago.  I then went and bought the sequel for a couple of bucks, but both have sat in my backlog ever since.  I want to make it clear, that I will be giving an absolutely glowing review of Guacamelee 2 and that I highly recommend it.  However, I can't recommend this one.  There are so many average beat 'em ups that are simply better than this, and this doesn't even compete w/ middle of the road metroidvanias.  I can't think of a single thing that this game offers that the sequel doesn't expand upon in a better and more creative way.  The sequel fixes every issue that I mentioned above and feels like a truly finished project.  So, the only ppl I would feel comfortable recommending this to, are ppl that loved the sequel, but just want more Guacamelee.  I personally, would rather just play the sequel over again.\n\nConsensus:\n-Bottom Shelf Gaming (Tier 5 and makes up 10% of my reviews).  It pains me to do this, b/c clearly this is an Indie studio that deeply loves this gaming franchise and put so much love in both of these games.  This is one of the rare cases where the sequel is so much better than the original, that the original becomes a game that is hard to market to players.  I review games based on a curve and compare them to everything that I have played b/c I think it's important to evaluate whether there is another title that offers better value.", "timestamp_created": 1642345079, "timestamp_updated": 1642347579, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480874329805374146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108138156": {"recommendationid": "108138156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372926237", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1624039500}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a metroidvania in looks only, it's rather charmless and boring.

I kinda like games like Celeste, but they seem quite difficult and frustrating to me, too. Guacamelee, however, gives you the right amount of precision platforming for those who like to casually play precision platforming, but don't like when it becomes too hard. In other words, the precision platforming elements of this game are kept to a minimum, and are well-balanced in terms of difficulty: neither so easy that would make you bored, nor so hard that would make you quit (although you might be at the brink of quitting a couple of times).\n\nHaving said that, sometimes you might get frustrated and quit it after a few attempts, but it's often the case that when you come back to the game the next time, you'll manage to do it.

The story is kinda basic yes but even that aside, it has so much great on its corner that I can't help but recommend it\n\nFor starters, the look and feel is so obviously influenced by Mexican culture. It's just so beautiful to look at. Everything is just infused with this colorful and lively style which I really like. Fair warning tho but sometimes it may get too colorful to the point that the creators had to put an epilepsy/seizure warning for the game. \n\nThe difficulty is just the right kind of piss me off hard that I'm looking for. I wouldn't say it's the most difficult MetroidVania I've played (Hollow Knight still holds that honor cos I can't finish it to this day huhu) but that does NOT mean it's easy. There are a lot of parts that need split-second decisions and then it does the wrong move and then you blame the controller for not reading it right! It's that kinda difficult. But still I was able to finish it. It took a few good hours of work and determination to get what I needed especially for the True/Good Ending.\n\nThe gameplay itself feels just right at home with most modern MetroidVanias in the sense that it doesn't have a levelling up system akin to CastleVania or BloodStained. Instead, it's all about getting new moves or augments to your arsenal to make you stronger. One more thing, in this edition, it has something called Intenso mode which was not available in the Gold Edition. It's a neat addition but I rarely found the use for it. It's cool and you're stronger but I feel that it drains way too quickly anyway and it's just as much a bitch to refill it. Very rarely did I use it like when enemies were too difficult for one part so it made the task easier or go faster but for the most part, it was unnecessary for me. I used it about 5 times max throughout the game. It's also probably cos the control for it is pressing down both the analog sticks. Why not use the L+R trigger instead? Maybe it's meant to deter players from using it so that they don't need to depend on it so much? But whatever, gameplay is still rock solid\n\nHighly recommended if you just love the look of Mexican culture and a right amount of difficulty.", "timestamp_created": 1637984322, "timestamp_updated": 1637984322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104122609": {"recommendationid": "104122609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349266573", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2491, "last_played": 1631169220}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Como olvidar a la versi\u00f3n definitiva de Guacamelee!

Then slowly and steadily over the course of the game adds new simple moves into your movelist that slowly and steadily increase your overall power and allows you to push a combo further on a single enemy or multiple groups of enemies which are varied and allow you to continue to utilize your 3 hit combo when you'd normally be stopped.\n\nThe platforming puzzles and the map are perfectly tuned for what you need, sure at times you may be wondering where to go but know that any area without a chest is the way forward to your next objective. You could also get secrets and do side quests on your way to the end of the game but they aren't required to actually do well.\n\nOverall this game has done phenomenally well to keep me engaged and at the edge of my seat to figure out what happens to Juan to the end and I will highly recommend this to anyone looking for a real gem of a game that hits all the right beats and utilizes it's genre mixture to the fullest.", "timestamp_created": 1634662888, "timestamp_updated": 1634662888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101298492": {"recommendationid": "101298492", "author": {"steamid": "76561199048238596", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1643649412}, "language": "spanish", "review": "chido", "timestamp_created": 1634656346, "timestamp_updated": 1634656346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101171059": {"recommendationid": "101171059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848553700", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 3579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1455, "last_played": 1667931465}, "language": "english", "review": "very awesome chicken game", "timestamp_created": 1634430975, "timestamp_updated": 1634430975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101131399": {"recommendationid": "101131399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161134147", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 500, "last_played": 1634334908}, "language": "english", "review": "Guacamelee is a fun lighthearted metroidvania that I really enjoyed, however it does have some small issues spread throughout.

And also transform to an unbeatable animal the chicken!!!![/b]\n\nMy first step with Guacamelee was the psplus gift for vita, ps3 and ps4, ive played it first on vita but at the first time arriving at the tule tree level I\u2019ve hopped on ps3 (the controls are ok but with controller it is much easier!), ive played it over 3 years (no I didn\u2019t need 3 years just 8 hrs. but over the time another games where played). And I finished it last week on PS3, but I\u2019ve saw that I have it also on Steam the super turbo version and I want it clear there also with all the dlc\u00b4s and the other stuff. For my thoughts this game has so many good things but there is also the frustrating jump stages that get my controller hurt. Yeah maybe the 15 meters that I throw against a wall to break it, didn\u2019t get the controller better^^) But now the review:\n[b]\n1)\tGameplay 08/10:[/b]\nMetroidvania with many uppercuts and wrestle feelings. Its in a good balance between Enemy hurting, climbing walls, fly goating, turning dimensions and puzzle thinking with the head of a Pollo. There is also Backtracking included but not in a Metroid way(in that frequency). But I hate the Jump Stages, I hate the Devil torture Chambers, not because the difficulty, its because you must learn the right strategy, the right timing, every stone where it stands & I don\u2019t have the time for this shit, this is the reason why I don\u2019t get the true ending. (ive watched it on youtube, don\u2019t throw a stone on me^^). You need approx. 8 hrs to finish it, the length is totally ok for this price.\n[b]\n2)\tStory 08/10:[/b]\nWell its funny, it has a nice story, the characters are well written. But its self explaining, you are the hero, the one an only luchador, the men of the hour, the chicken in the pot. It is a classical hero story and it is good so! The good thing is also it is a Parodie to many games out there, but Mario you get the most attention!\n[b]\n3)\tAtmosphere (graphic) 7,5/10:[/b]\nThe levels looks great, the environment have shadows, some stages have a 2,5d effect, the developer makes here and there some ideas like zoom out zoom in, but nothing breathtaking, this is cause it gets just 7,5/10, don\u2019t misunderstand it it is a beautiful graphic but nothing outstanding.[b]\n4)\tAudio 08/10:[/b]\nAhh el trio de la muerte, Mexican meats metroidvania would be my suggestion. There are some mucho mucho mucho tracks, the background music is also very well done. But comprehended to other metroidvanias (like Axiom Verge; inexorable takes my heart) there is less there. Overall a good music/sound. \n[b]\n5)\tContent 06/10:[/b]\nThe World is filled with a few maps that aren\u2019t huge, you have some movements, with the turbo version you have elite skelet enemies, that are difficulter to master, but all in one there is not much content, I gave 6/10 cause you must master your gameplay to get items, chests and the satisfaction to be a true luchador.\n\n[b]Great Game overall 7,5/10:[/b]\nI love it, it was  a pleasure to play through after beating the normal version on ps3, but the intensive training to get through all torture Chambers, or the tule tree highest platform or the yoku blocks (I hate you mega man, I hate you!!) takes me in my personal INTENSO Rage mode, and I must say the ps5 Controller did well, the wall has some scratches, the controller works fine^^..\n\n[b]Muchas gracies drinkbox, you are a huge Pollo!!\nHasta luego combastandes!!\nYeah I would recommendet the game for 13 bucks you get much fun![/b]", "timestamp_created": 1631976932, "timestamp_updated": 1631977112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99451169": {"recommendationid": "99451169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239720408", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1631569342}, "language": "english", "review": "LUCHADOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1631805411, "timestamp_updated": 1631805411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99349461": {"recommendationid": "99349461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384718882", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1629857737}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game.

There are still a lot of rough edges here which get cleaned up in the sequel. Its a bit shaky In terms of level design, enemy design, map design, and especially progression. It sometimes feels like the developers didn't properly know how to deal with a certain part or how to make certain sections more engaging. Thats why this game constantly jumps between really fun and fantastic to sort of ok. Especially the early sections can feel really slow and simplistic for a game like this. \n\nBut at its core its still a fantastic game with a really unique setting (Middle and South American culture are incredibly underrated in the gaming industry) and a lot of personality to stand on its own.

Avoid at all costs. \n\nFull review: this was one of the most frustrating experience at playing a game ever. Art is good, combat is reasonably good, could have been a fun game, but game-design is among the worst imaginable when it comes to the platforming sessions, and there's no way to avoid them. Part of the problem is that every ten minutes, a new control key or key combination is added, and soon they exceed the number of fingers or appendages of any human. Key combinations are particulary bad as the order in which you press the keys matter, and is not responsive, so at best you get them once every three attempts.\n\nBut the biggest problem are the unreasonable, unavoidable platforming sessions. Navigating across platform can be a bliss in other games, in this one is just a pain. For some reasohs, they decided that it would be fun to force the player do a predefined robotic sequence of too many actions. Thet stops being any fun quite soon, and becomes just a challenge of patience. You'll have to alternate between 50 different moves in a quick unforgiving succession. There is no joy in failing 1000 times, or in succeeding alike. \n\nIt boils down to a matter of pressing the right action in tight sequences, so it basically feels like a Hasbro Simon electronic toy game for brain dead people, only instead of being 4 buttons there is like 20 and sequences are way, way too long. How on earth they could image this could be considered even remotely fun to play. You want to see the rest of the game you paid good money for, so you try with patience to surpass a section or two, or ten, or twenty, hoping they will stop the nonsense and let you play the game, but no, it gets worse and worse until it stops being worth it. There is one point, for example, where to progress you need to jump swap-plane jump, jump, double jump, swap \"plane\" twice, dodge, upper cut, side smash, append to wall, double jump.... the list goes on it basically never ends, one key out of sequence and you are out, one millisecond away and you have to redo it all. Of course, there is not way to avoid that sequence. I dunno what to say, it is the opposite of fun. \n\nI see positive reviews but I'm guessing they wrote them before ever getting this late in the game. At the beginning, nothing makes you suspect levels will be so poorly designed later. \n\nI finished the metroidvanias that are considered the hardest ones on the market, but I never encountered this level of frustration. \n\nVote 2/10.", "timestamp_created": 1626746938, "timestamp_updated": 1626747240, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96002629": {"recommendationid": "96002629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158368581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3465, "last_played": 1637982024}, "language": "spanish", "review": "This game has good playability, it's just a matter of getting used to the combos.

Having just spent 10 hours running through the game, I can see now why it's rated so highly. While I'm definitely not a fan of the 'brawler' genre, the way they've fused that with the metroidvania formula so seamlessly makes for a stand-out, excellent title. \n\nVisuals: I dismissed this game a while ago over what at first seemed like bizarre looking visuals. Looking closer, it's actually a really nice visual style, character models look good and are expressive, backgrounds look vibrant and inviting. A great looking game, and one that runs on low-end hardware no less!\n\nPlatforming: Besides following the metroidvania formula of side-scrolling exploration very well, the platforming itself is some of the most engaging I've encountered in any platformer, period. Every new combat/traversal move learned throughout the game is used to the fullest, and even gets downright diabolical, in some of the more secret areas.\n\nCombat: The combat could be a challenge for me at times (brawlers aren't really my thing), but I couldn't deny that it was fun, even if I did get frustrated at times (a couple of times having to consult a walkthrough to teach me a winning strategy). Almost every traversal move has a combat application as well, so the combat gets ever deeper the further into the game you get. The bosses are all very well designed... although each one just boils down to pummeling them into submission, I found them all nonetheless to be unique and engaging each in their own way.\n\nStory: While not an overly deep story, it's delivered quite well, at times in a very humorous way, at other times slightly more serious. There are, if I counted right, four towns you come across during the course of game, helping the world that's been designed here not to feel empty... every town has at least one side quest for you to do as well, though none of the quests are that deep or engaging.\n\nGot it on sale for $4.37 CAD, was definitely well worth the purchase!

There's a lot of Spanish peppered into the dialog, but it feels more like how people write bilingual dialogue rather than how bilingual dialog actually is. Some beats hit super hard, some whiff, and there's a lot of 2010s era nerd culture references scattered throughout (Castle Crashers, Rooster Teeth, Strong Bad, etc)---all with unexpectedly high effort in-game posters.\n\nThe setting's mythology feels interesting, and the art makes it feel grounded and mystical and lush.\n\nAt no point was I able to figure out whether the game was making a caricature out of Mexico or an earnest homage.\n\nTaken as a whole, I think I have to say that I liked Guacamelee. There are better metroidvanias, but the art here is so good that it's impossible not to recommend it on visuals alone.\n\nIf you're on the fence, it's worth a try.\n\nEdit: The platforming gets a little bit Path Of Pain towards the end, to the point where there was a progress-essential room in the last 1% of the game that I couldn't figure out. I'd done all the optional stuff and had the chicken flight final upgrade, but the room was built specifically to block it from working. So, idk. I'll never see what the last bit of gameplay was like.

The graphic is very pleasant and colorful and it takes inspiration from mexican floklore. I found the gameplay very smooth and it isn't a punitive game as many similar games where you have to make 100% accurate jumps or you have to repeat the same point 1000 times until it leads you to frustration.\nIn the game there are several save point and custumes so you can change your main character aspect whenever you want. During the game you can unlock new special moves and combo to beat enemies.\nMusic is very nice if you like the mexican traditional Mariachi style even if sometimes it could be just a bit repetitive. There is even the co-op mode to play with your buddy on same computer or with remote play, but I never tried this mode.\n\nIf you like eating burritos with guacamolee and mexican wrestling luchadores this is the game for you!\n\nItalian review:\nGuacamalee \u00e8  un gioco indie di tipo platform metrodvania.

Nel gioco ci sono diversi save points e costumi aggiuntivi che ti permettono di cambiare l'aspetto del protagonista. Nel corso della storia si sbloccheranno nuove mosse aggiuntive e combo per poter far fuori gli scagnozzi. Le musiche sono piacevoli se vi piace lo stile Mariachi della tradizione messicana anche se alle lunga pu\u00f2 risultare un pochino ripetetiva.

I definitely recommend it for fans of the genre. However, there are a number of negatives I have with the game, and other games I would recommend over it. I got Guacamelee on sale for ~$4 and found it well worth it at that price, but much more than that and I may have been hard to recommend.\n\nNote: I played this game single player, and thus my review is for a single player experience, but if you are looking for a multiplayer game in this genre, this this game is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because there isn't as much quality competition.\n\nI would recommend these games on Steam before Guacamelee:\n- Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom [single player 2D platformer]\n- Wonder Boy The Dragon's Trap [single player 2D patformer]\n- The Shantae games (Half-Genie Hero, Pirate's Curse, Seven Sirens, Risky's Revenge) [single player 2d platformers]\n- Streets Of Rage 4 [multiplayer beat-em up]\n\nHere are some of my negative opinions of the game...\n\nThe sound in this game sucks. The music all feels like stock music and doesn't really elevate the game in any way. The sound effects (or lack thereof are even worse than the music). Sound effects are really important in beat-em ups so that your attacks feel impactful especially considering how much you will be mashing the attack button. But the sound effects of the basic attacks sound like whooshing noises rather than the typical beat-em up sounds. There is also no voice acting. There is more dialog than you might expect from a game in this genre, and that makes the lack of voice acting hurt a bit.\n\nThe game is fairly short. I was able to beat the game on my first blind play though in ~4 hours. I did NOT 100% the game, so if you want to 100% the game that will add a lot of time, but I don't really have an urge to do that myself. Guacamelee DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD COLLECTIBLE MAP. It shows you collectibles per area, but it does not show you the locations/which you already collected. Compare this to \"Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom\" that has a map that shows every collectible location on it.\n\nThe game is too  easy. Not once did I struggle with the game. That goes for both the platforming and the combat. That doesn't mean it isn't fun, but more challenge would have gone a long way. I didn't even realize you could buy upgrades from save spots until nearly the end of the game. I just never needed any buffs because there was no challenge.\n\nThe character is a bit sluggish. There are a lot of actions that require a lot of frames for the character to recover. After every special move that is a a fraction of a second before you can attack or dodge again. When you get hit, your character must fall all the way to the ground before you regain control. You can change your trajectory mid jump, but not very much without using a special. The character clings to walls ALL THE TIME. Sometimes I want him to get off the wall but he just won't let go of the walls. You can also only use each type of special once (except for the vertical wall run) before stepping on horizontal ground again. Specials also kill your momentum. I understand why they made some of these decisions, but it would have been nicer if the character felt a little faster/smoother.\n\nThe graphics could be better. The animations usually look fairly cheap (but this isn't a AAA game to be fair). A few spots in the game the enemies were similar colors to the backgrounds and I didn't actually notice them at first. Also when there are a lot of enemies on screen, they will overlap, and your attacks have an effect, so it just becomes a jumbled mess sometimes that you can't follow because everything is overlapping.\n\nThe hit boxes. This is pretty minor, but I found that a lot of hit boxes don't really match their visual representation. An annoyance, but once you trial-and-error the hitbox it isn't bad.\n\nThe comedy.

Can say it's pretty great. Story is pretty straightforward. I know quite a number complain about the [spoiler]combo chicken[/spoiler]. It's kinda hard, but still manageable. A bit pointless though since you're not going to use most of those [spoiler]combo[/spoiler] anyways, but if you treat it as \"doing this to get items\", then still ok.\n\nThe challenges are hard, but that's why they are called challenge right?\n\nHowever, there are 2 kinda frustrating parts:\n1) The first one is the [spoiler]disappearing platform on the mountain[/spoiler]. It's hard, but the worst is, it's not even matching the style of the whole game. You can feel pretty clearly that this part was merely added to make the section really really difficult.\n\n2) The difficulty spike at the final final battle. [spoiler]The second form of Calaca[/spoiler]. To me, the whole game was almost a walk in the park. Maybe I will die randomly when I'm being too relax. Most of the bosses was beaten on the first try (which mean I walk into it without knowing but still managed to just win) or at most second try (after learning the pattern), but when it come to the last one, suddenly it took me like 10~20 tries. \nI'm not complaining that the boss fight is hard or if you should tone it down. I'm complaining about the difficulty surge. Unlike some other game that ask you to \"git gud\" from the start and that the boss difficulty increase as you go, this one feel like everything was way too easy then suddenly the last one is a massive road block. Maybe balance it a bit will be better so at least we got to train along the way.\n\nAnyways, good game still.

It doesn\u2019t exactly try to push the genre\u2019s boundaries, but it does carve itself a nice, comfy and memorable corner within them.\n\nDespite being rather straightforward and linear, it has a nice progression of upgrades that feels like you gradually get access to every nook and cranny (starting from a single jump and going up to wall-running and even a sort of flying). There\u2019s a decent amount of combat where you throw the enemies all around the place (as is suitable for a luchador hero) and perform some nice aerial combos. The controls might feel a bit unresponsive at first, with a slight delay before most actions, but I got used to it very quickly.\n\nBetter yet, I think the game truly captures the genre\u2019s signature feeling of discovery thanks to the collectibles you need for the good ending. Placed in particularly well-hidden areas, each locked behind a unique challenge, they do a great job at communicating \u201cHey, you\u2019ve found something really special!\u201d without using a single line of dialogue. Furthermore, the good ending itself is indeed quite happier than the standard ending and manages to provide heartfelt closure even to such a simple comedic story, so the reward truly carries weight.\n\nGetting all achievements is fairly easy here and took me around 20 hours, though it does require you to replay the main storyline on Hard.

The scenery is amazing .\n2. Short but well written story. The story is funny and sad. \n3. A LOT of references to other games!\n4.

The stages take forever to traverse if you are trying to get every box. Even with the teleporting statues.\n3.

Guacamelee es muy sencillo y, aunque no es f\u00e1cil, es poco desafiante, otra cuesti\u00f3n es que quieras sacarte el 100% y ah\u00ed es donde el juego aprieta pero de una forma un tanto injusta. Sacar el final bueno recolectando las esferas esas raras y pasarse con oro todos los desaf\u00edos del Infierno te aprieta las tuercas y estoy seguro de que la gran mayor\u00eda pasar\u00e1 de todo esto porque ah\u00ed s\u00ed que se hace tedioso. Las pruebas esas del Infierno son dif\u00edcles y algunas est\u00e1n muy ajustadas en tu contra de modo que superar la marca que te indican cuesta y mucho. Pero lo dem\u00e1s es un paseo incluso en Dif\u00edcil.\n\nLo bueno:\n-Su est\u00e9tica, aspecto visual y ambientaci\u00f3n musical te transportan a este enorme estereotipo mexicano con forma de juego que es Guacamele\u00e9. Supongo que a alguien de ese pa\u00eds le puede parecer hasta ofensiva esta colecci\u00f3n de clich\u00e9s o tal vez le haga gracia, no s\u00e9, pero no se puede decir que el juego no representa a ese pa\u00eds y habr\u00e1 que destacar eso.\n-Es entretenido, a m\u00ed no me ha convencido del todo y no es un juego que me haya divertido en especial pero entiendo que, objetivamente hablando, te gustar\u00e1 lo suficiente como para seguir jugando por su sencillez y r\u00e1pido avance por el juego, est\u00e1s cada poco consiguiendo cosas, peleando,... es ameno.\n-Las peleas est\u00e1n llenas de posibilidades, hay muchos combos, poderes y habilidades tanto ofensivas como de desplazamiento r\u00e1pido por los escenarios. Al final siempre acabas usando las mismas cuatro t\u00e9cnicas y se acab\u00f3 porque recordar todos esos combos, algunos bastante largos y poco intuitivos, es algo casi imposible y que no merece la pena.\n-Tiene dos finales, desaf\u00edos, plataformeo, secretos, muchas peleas, skins,... no est\u00e1 escaso en contenido pero tampoco es un derroche.\n-Hay quests secundarias, pueblitos, gente con la que hablar, tiene cierta vida el mundo aqu\u00ed representado.\n\nLo malo:\n-Su historia es una tonter\u00eda pero no s\u00e9 si realmente contar esto como algo negativo porque por un lado dudo que sea as\u00ed porque sus creadores no tengan capacidad para inventar algo mejor sino que es algo premeditado y por otra parte a nadie que juegue le va importar lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo la trama.\n-Muy simple en mec\u00e1nicas y jugabilidad. No inventa nada ni lo mejora y se queda por debajo de muchos otros juegos del g\u00e9nero porque parece m\u00e1s un plataformas mezclado con un juego de peleas tipo God of War (salvando y mucho las distancias) y todo ello muy simplificado y es por esto que a m\u00ed no me ha gustado mucho, no me ha aportado nada.\n-Es un clich\u00e9 andante.\n-El control, siendo decente, es fall\u00f3n. No siempre responde a lo que ordenas y muchas veces los saltos son bastante falsos m\u00e1s alguna que otra cosa de esas que hacen que no conf\u00edes en el juego, sabes que vas a fallar bastantes veces por culpa de no estar pulido este aspecto.\n-Algunas pruebas del Infierno son bastante injustas e insufribles. Menci\u00f3n especial a una en la que debes llevar un pollo por un circuito peg\u00e1ndole y lanz\u00e1ndolo por ah\u00ed, horrible. No s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo fui capaz de sacar todos los oros.\n-Personalmente creo que tiene muy baja rejugabilidad, solo si eres muy completista repetir\u00e1s y probablemente resignado.\n-La m\u00fasica est\u00e1 bien pero es muy protagonista en el juego, quiero decir que casi todos los temas son m\u00e1s bien fuertes y tambi\u00e9n de melod\u00edas cortas que se repiten una y otra vez hasta que sales de la zona, a m\u00ed me cans\u00f3 bastante y le baj\u00e9 el volumen, algo que no suelo hacer en otros juegos.\n-Hay habilidades y sobre todo combos que parecen estar ah\u00ed m\u00e1s por parecer que hay mucho contenido que por ser \u00fatiles.\n-La dificultad es muy irregular.\n\nAlguna cosa m\u00e1s hay pero bueno, eso es lo que quise destacar.

[/h1]\n\nI really wanted to be able to write a positive review of the PC port. I was willing to look past a lot of things, like STCE being late, and enjoy the game. That's the kind of gamer I am. As long as I get all the gameplay elements in the end, I'm happy. Unfortunately, this is not the case here, minor as some folks will probably call it. \n\nThe reason I cannot recommend this port is because it never properly got a DLC pack the console versions did called \"Frenemies\". Instead, Drinkbox put the cosmetic half on the Steam workshop and called it good. Problem is, those skins had unique modifiers that changed how the game played on consoles that for some reason, never reached PC. This is especially confusing considering the sequel did the same thing but [i] did [/i] include it for PC. Given half the material needed was already there, there's no excuse the first game can't have the full package either. I could see putting the skins on workshop as a freebie for people who just wanted that part and had to wait so long, but that doesn't excuse Drinkbox from being lazy. And this was pretty dang lazy.\n\nI do recommend this game. The atmosphere is great, the soundtrack is full of catchy Mexican beats, the story and characters are funny and well-written and the gameplay is a fun combo of metroidvania and light fighter. I just recommend doing so on console so you get the whole gameplay package. Plus, the One-Two Punch pack has a neat manual like in the old days, all the DLC and Bandcamp links to the OSTs along with the added benefit of portability if you get the Switch version. \n\nJust don't give your money to the port that pulled an unbelievably lazy move.", "timestamp_created": 1600149755, "timestamp_updated": 1606861832, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523894250392913818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75977834": {"recommendationid": "75977834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054611720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 339, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1670167223}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1600116700, "timestamp_updated": 1650106721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75937433": {"recommendationid": "75937433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265530578", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1608504416}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty solid metroidvania, and pretty good controller game\npretty funny too\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1600047311, "timestamp_updated": 1600047311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75772129": {"recommendationid": "75772129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405151845", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1559940571}, "language": "english", "review": "suc", "timestamp_created": 1599783892, "timestamp_updated": 1599783892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75761792": {"recommendationid": "75761792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313671924", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 514, "last_played": 1599792429}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Delicia, la jugabilidad es mas disfrutable con teclado un estilo decente y bonito una historia entretenida y como tal un juego adictivo y para mas cooperativo, que mas necesitas saber JUEGALO", "timestamp_created": 1599765731, "timestamp_updated": 1599765731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75739539": {"recommendationid": "75739539", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993202989", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1599731878}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sencillo pero divertido metroidvania donde hay que destacar su apartado art\u00edstico, con mucha personalidad y divertido.

This game gets slept on pretty often, as I haven't really heard anyone recommending this game before, and so here I am recommending the game to you.\n\nThe story of the game is simple. If you're familiar with Day of the Dead (or you watched Coco), then basically the story will be pretty easy to follow. People that are dead come back to life and try to take over the world of the living, it's pretty simple. The dead people's leader is called Calaca, and he has abducted Juan's childhood friend and probably his current girlfriend. The game is incredibly light in tone, and has the right amount of humour so it won't be forced. I absolutely love the references to different games, in particular Mario. There were several Mario references in the game, such as a poster, and the classic quote, \"Sorry your princess is in another castle!\" The music in this game is also absolutely phenomenal, it fits within the game and it sounds light and awesome.\n\nGuacamelee is a game focused on combos. The nature of the game is to avoid losing your combo streak and try to sustain it as long as possible. The gameplay is incredibly satisying. Seeing skeletons smash to bits with that loud crunchy sound effect is awesome. It's hard to explain how awesome it is until you play it. The game is also very color coded, so colorblind people will need to beware. There are 5 types of \"energy punches\" in the game. Some enemies will have a coloured shield around them, and you need to use an energy punch of the same color to break that shield in order to deal damage. This mechanic works nicely in the game, so that each combat encounter won't be a mindless sequence of mashing buttons, but you would actually need to think and strategise each move.\n\nThe gimmick of Guacamelee comes here. Around 2-3 hours into the game, you will get the ability to swap between worlds - the world of living and the world of the dead. Well so what's the difference? It's a little hard to explain, but I will try to explain as best as I can. Basically in a level there will be some hidden tiles, if you switched to the other world then those tiles will appear. This system is often used in platforming, but it is often used in combat as well. Some enemies will be in the world of the living, some in the world of the dead. If you're in the world of the living and your enemy is in the dead and vice versa, you will not be able to damage the enemy. Again, this is color coded as well because enemies that cannot be damaged yet will be entirely black. Personally, I like this mechanic a lot too. As I said before, this turns a mindless sequence of mashing buttons into something more fun and interesting.\n\nUnlike other metroidvanias like Hollow Knight, Guacamelee is very small in nature. There will be backtracking, but they will not be tedious at all. Checkpoints are incredibly close to each other, so if you die don't worry about traveling for like a long time to get to your previous spot. As a metroidvania, Guacamelee will also involve collecting skills at one point, then backtrack to a previous location to use that skill to unlock a new area.

I have heard that the Gold Edition may be a bit better but I believe I would have many of the same problems. I wanted to hate the combat but the move set started to grow on me a bit by the end of the game; however, throwing enemies around and racking up big combos is the only thing keeping the game from being an absolute bust for me. The game claims to be a Metroidvania but I really do not get the feeling of a Metroidvania. I don\u2019t feel that it was ever worth exploring other than when I found pieces of a Luchador mask because the game gated me so hard from exploration early on that when I was told I had 15 statues of power-ups by the old man, I always thought I was going to hit an impassable obstacle. A typical atmosphere of a Metroidvania is lonesome and even fearful. So, when a developer differs from that typical story formula, there needs to be a good reason. There was a good reason to differ and make the story more colourful and light but my god the humour is terrible with some really weird jokes and way too many minor characters. The side quests make this game feel like Zelda where the player is literally rewarded heart pieces. At least the side quests do not tell me exactly where to go like the main game did. I finished this game in one sitting because it just tells me where to go.  Some Metroidvanias have waypoints on a map that are not painfully obvious how to navigate to but the segmenting of the map DOES make it painfully obvious where to go. The world design has no depth! The player gets a blue punch power up; walk out of the room and follow the immediate path with the blue block in the way. Only play this game if you want a more complicated Castle Crashers because it is worthless as a single player experience.\nThe bosses were pretty bad. There was one cool boss but it ended up not very hard after I got the hang of it. I do not even want to talk about the bosses much because they were just short, straight forward, and the final boss literally made me shed tears of disappointment. I played the entire game to see what was at the end and I wish I had ANY reason to want to look for the pieces of the Luchador mask for the good ending (I presume that is what it is for)\u2026 and I do. When I am feeling lifeless, I will try Gold Edition and I might try to get the Luchador mask pieces. For Gaucamelee Super Turbo Charged Edition, the final boss was so terrible with an unfair first phase and only a slightly better second phase that is just as garbage as most of the other bosses in the game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1592197519, "timestamp_updated": 1592197519, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51943671703338623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70685370": {"recommendationid": "70685370", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023892738", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1326, "last_played": 1591983706}, "language": "english", "review": "great game very fun!", "timestamp_created": 1591983767, "timestamp_updated": 1591983767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70671796": {"recommendationid": "70671796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797789984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1591899399}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a great platformer with a distinct metroidvania style to it.

My SO is a Day of the Dead enthusiast and as such I'm around it a bit, so I found the Day of the Dead theme of Guacamelee! to be interesting and enjoyable.  The game also made a ton of references to old retro platform games like Super Mario Brothers, Mega Man and Metroid, plus a number of pop culture references to wrestling, and oddly a large number of Star Wars references, which while amusing, seemed out of place in this style of game.\n\nThe Luchador's abilities, that are earned in the same vain as Samus from Metroid, were all fun to use and a blast to chain together into combos during combat or use to get additional air/distance when jumping between platforms.  I'm not good at completing Metroidvania style games, but this one was enjoyable enough that I was able to finish the game within an okay time frame.\n\nThe only thing that kept Guacamelee! from being a truly standout game to me was that there were a couple areas that required pinpoint precise jumping that included powers that required such precise timing that I couldn't get past, so it was more preferable to ignore them instead of get frustrated trying to get through them.  I am okay with jumping challenge mechanics, but when the required precision is measured in pixels then it turns from challenging into frustrating tedium then I'm done at that point.

Super Turbo Championship Edition[/u] is a hybrid beat-em-up / Metroidvania game based on Mexican culture, with a large emphasis on combo-based combat, intelligent approach, and platforming. The story revolves around a farmer named Juan, who is killed by the main antagonist while attempting to save his friend, only to come back possessing the power of a magical mask, which turns him into a powerful Luchador intent on punching, suplexing and bodyslamming his way to victory.\n\nAs the player progresses through the game, they unlock more types of powerful attacks, such as large uppercuts and bodyslams, or utility abilities like clinging to or running up walls. Many of the combat abilities end up playing critical roles in platforming segments for their mobility, increasing the depth of the system. Additionally, some enemies can only be defeated by certain attacks, preventing the player from simply using brute force to make their way through any and all situations.\n\n[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] The combat requires adaptability and precision from the player, making it a welcome challenge.\n\n[*] Co-op with up to four players is supported, and is Steam Remote Play compatible.\n\n[*] The art style and music is a pleasure to experience, both centered around Mexican culture.\n\n[*] The combination of platforming and solid combat mesh well together, often overlapping for even more entertainment.\n\n[*] The story and dialogue are entertaining throughout, and are definitely not a detriment to the experience.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Metroidvania\u2019s style of backtracking can be a major turn-off for many players. Getting a lot of the upgrades requires backtracking, as does the \u201cTrue Ending\u201d. Both can rapidly become tedious if you choose to pursue them, but they are not necessary to complete the game, and can be ignored if desired. However, you are missing a large amount of content if you choose to do this.\n\n[*] Playing with more than one player can quickly become absolute chaos during platforming, as the game has a few key mechanics that all players can control, but need to be precisely handled for successful platforming. Intense coordination can be required to surpass even the simplest of obstacles if playing with friends.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Short Conclusion: Recommended[/h1]\n\n[h1][u]In-Depth Analysis[/u][/h1]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGuacamelee is a beat-em-up first and foremost. It primarily focuses on the combo system, encouraging the player to chain together as many hits as possible for the maximum amount of damage. This is fueled by the combo meter, a bar that shows the player how many times they can use their upgraded combat abilities before having to recharge. This, just like the health bar, is made larger by gathering upgrade pieces scattered across the game. \n\nMany enemies are coated in a colored shield that requires the player to use the matching ability on them in order to do damage. Multiple enemies can appear in a single area, each with a different shield color, and all shields eventually regenerate if not damaged for a few seconds, meaning Guacamelee expects the player to be a fast strategist and a good brawler. Combos are satisfying to pull off and deal large amounts of damage, helping to secure a kill before moving on to other enemies.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2114577601\n\nThe platforming is what you would expect from a platforming game, but gains extra depth with the implementation of the same abilities one would normally use for combos. A jump can be made higher with an uppercut, or longer with a dash. Many times a specific color-coded block requires a specific move to destroy, just like shields. This makes the platforming more enjoyable than the vanilla jump-n-climb every veteran gamer has become accustomed to by now.\n\nUnfortunately, in order to unlock the \u201cTrue Ending\u201d of the game, the player must backtrack to reach multiple additional areas that are filled to the absolute brim with pure challenge platforming and combat. Two of them in particular are very, very time consuming and can be a major pain for players that don\u2019t care much about challenge for the sake of challenge. I\u2019ve been told [u]Guacamelee! Gold[/u] does not have these problems, as it was released before this edition, but as I have not played Gold or the original, I cannot speak on these problems.\n\n [h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is entertaining in execution, but simple in overall plot. You are the hero going to rescue the girl. The player interacts with a wide variety of characters in this quest, some more interesting than others, and nearly all very entertaining to listen to. \nThe game is absolutely riddled with comedy and references to other forms of media, making it almost worth playing for the story alone. But this story is merely the glue that holds all the combat and platforming together to form the Guacamelee experience.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nGuacamelee takes inspiration from Day of the Dead culture and Aztec designs to form a pleasing hybrid of rugged, chiseled shapes and decorated displays that I wholly enjoy looking at the entire time I am playing.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2114582753\n\nThe design of the game is very angular and sharp in nature, avoiding a lot of curves on important pieces. This strong and stylized form of art helps it to stand out among other games. The visuals are definitely a plus for Guacamelee.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nPunches have impact and abilities give satisfying thumps, but the real winner of audio for Guacamelee is the music. Just like the art, it takes a heavy influence from traditional Mexican music, with a focus on guitars, trumpets, and vocals that are a joy to listen to. There\u2019s just something about that combination of instruments and vocals that I can\u2019t seem to get enough of. If you like mariachi music, like me, you\u2019ll like Guacamelee\u2019s music.\n\n[h1]Technical[/h1]\n[u]Specs:[/u] GeForce 840m 2GB, 8GB Memory, i7 CPU, Windows 8.1\n\nI had zero problems running Guacamelee at 60fps, 1080p. However unlike most games, I experienced very noticeable and very annoying amounts of screen tearing with V-Sync turned off. Thankfully, the game is easy enough to run that turning on V-Sync had no impact on my ability to play at 60fps.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nWhile the Metroidvania nature may turn away some prospective gamers that dislike the focus on backtracking, most of the backtracking can be safely ignored if desired, allowing the player to focus solely on the solid combat / platforming gameplay, engaging story and culture-rich atmosphere. While it is perfectly fine solo, beware some gameplay complications if playing with a friend. \n\nOverall, at $14.99, I would say it is worth the price if you are a fan of the Metroidvania style, but it also goes on sale quite often at 50% or more.

Mas que del lado intenso de jugadores experimentados este juego apunta un poco a lo casual, pero sin duda hay algunos retos dif\u00edciles y un poco frustrantes.

Anyway onto the pros and cons of buying this game, cause although this is probably one of my favourite games it still had me very conflicted at some points.\n\nPROS\n-Cool art style with unique looking characters and creatures, one of my favourites being Alebrije\n-Love the soundtrack and unique boss sounds\n-Mostly a good level of challenge that isn't frustrating\n-Can play as casual and get through the game in about 8+ hours or for achievements, which for me was 32 hours\n-People often say the humour is outdated, such as the references through signs but considering the game is older, is still refreshing to see\n-Anyone can play, I think some younger kids would also quite like to play with some help from parents or siblings as the game is suited to both younger and older audience\n-Can play local co-op\n-I like being able to turn into a chicken\n\nCONS\n-Flashing lights when you finish a upgrade (this gets worse in guac 2) can become a bit much after playing the game a while\n-Furthering my last point- I wouldn't play for long periods at a time as the game is bright\n-Definitely wouldn't recommend playing with a key board, if you're going to buy this game, have a controller you can plug in\n-I also wouldn't play too long because it can become irritating to play some of the rooms (where enemies spawn and you have to kill them all before you can leave), especially if it involves the red lava which is basically a restart for that room, also those stupid exploding fly's are a bit excessive and pissed me off but its a challenge I guess\n\nOverall I would recommend this game, it's really fun, I love the story and endings. If anyone is trying to chose between Guacamelee and Guacamelee 2, I promise you Guacamelee 1 is better. Not to diss on 2 but it gets impossibly hard to the level of the optional disappearing platform room in Guac 1.

Let's explore the ups and downs of the game (+, +/-, -, ?):\n\n+Guacamelee's art style is great. Great use of colours, nice designs.\n+The soundtrack and sound effects are great.\n+The gameplay is tight. Kicking ass feels so good! Skeletons flying and dying everywhere! Yes!\n+All power ups and mechanics work well.\n+I love all the characters! Beautiful stuff, great monologues!\n+This game can definitely make you laugh out loud.\n+/-The story is almost interesting. I kept zoning out from time to time. When it comes to the story, the writing could've been better. It's a telenovela, right?\n+/-The dungeon design is okay. Going back and forth can suck a lot. But, you know, fast travelling is well done and it makes this less of a problem.\n+/-The game is quite short. If you're a speedrunner, you might like this a lot.\n-Why's there so much emptiness? At times, I felt like something was missing from the game or maybe the levels could have been designed better.\n-The map sucks. Yes, you can see almost everything you need to but... Zooming out? Nah, why'd you need that? The again, zoom iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin! Yeah that's useful! *Hotel Mario voice: \"No\"*\n-The boss fights are way too easy. I had more trouble with regular enemies and platforming than any of the bosses.\n-I just finished my first playthrough and I have to say, I don't feel the game. This is one of those games that is fun to play, but you'll forget it soon.\n? Is this the best version of the game? I've heard that Gold Edition is better. I feel I can review this version better after playing that one.\n\nGuacamelee STC Edition is fun, but it's missing stuff, especially something that would make it really stand out. Great artwork and theme alone just isn't enough for me. For you, this might be a treat, but to me, this game feels similar to Shantae: Half-Genie Hero; It's a good, but flawed game and it is easy to forget.

Super Turbo Championship Edition.\n\nI'm not sure exactly why this \"Super Turbo Championship Edition\" needs to exist as a separate listing on Steam, especially when the original version of the game had already been upgraded to \"Gold Edition.\" In other cases I'd assume it was done to wipe away all of the negative Steam reviews and start over with a fresh slate (as usually tends to be the case) but my understanding is that most everyone loves Guacamelee. And with good reason--it's one of the best and most refreshing metroidvanias in years.\n\nWhich I guess makes my opinion on the game pretty obvious: I love Guacamelee. It's got a snazzy art style, catchy music, fun characters, a world that's fun to explore, and really solid combat mechanics that are only very rarely frustratingly difficulty (usually when they combine combat with platforming). The only real complaint I have is that the game supports two-player co-op, and as part of that has a secondary protagonist: a female luchador. So far so good--the problem? Even though you can play the game as the other character, the story is still written with Juan as the hero: it would have been much more fun if the game reacted to the player character, using the appropriate nouns and pronouns and so on. Oh well: plenty of other games have missed better opportunities, so I suppose I shouldn't be too harsh here.\n\nSo, yeah: it's a brilliant, imaginative metroidvania with a unique setting and confident humor. If you're fond of the genre, it's most definitely worth your time.\n\nNote: also played on Sony Playstation 4, Sony Playstation Vita and Nintendo Switch.", "timestamp_created": 1582120855, "timestamp_updated": 1582120855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580929756164550781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63746282": {"recommendationid": "63746282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105641976", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 845, "last_played": 1582067405}, "language": "english", "review": "A suprisingly great experience.

He has continued, over the past few days, to intermittently remind me that he hated this game, which frankly is as passionate as I\u2019ve ever seen him about a piece of media.\n\nUgh, I don\u2019t even know where to start. Probably the worst thing was the level design. The levels were confusing, obtuse, and recursive. Neither of us had any idea where we were or where we had to go in the dungeon at any point, and using the minimap didn\u2019t even help. The puzzles were unintuitive and uninteresting. The way the screen suddenly flashed as you moved from room to room instead of a smooth transition was jarring and disorienting. The button-mashy combat was repetitive and unfun, and button combos were infuriatingly unreliable. The whole thing was a chore to experience.\n\nThe game was also stupidly misogynistic. The three women are a) the damsel in distress, about whom everyone says it\u2019s sad she\u2019s in distress because she\u2019s hot; b) the non-story woman second-player character whose tits bounce around; and c) the evil woman who speaks in double entendres and starts freaking out because she\u2019s omgsojealous of the bad guy capturing a hot woman, because women, so emotional. All the male characters, including townies, do nothing but talk about screwing women. Like, the mentor guy who gives you powers introduces himself by talking about fucking your mom and then like, threatens to have sex with her when he thinks you\u2019re slacking off? It\u2019s so goddamn weird. I am also HIGHLY suspicious of three guys named Chris Harvey, Ryan MacLean and Graham Smith writing Mexican people as lecherous assholes. (It also makes the obsession with women\u2019s bodies feel like a fetish thing.) I\u2019m suspicious of them writing a game based on Mexican culture in general, but honestly I couldn\u2019t even get far enough into it to complain about that.\n\nAnd this is beside the point but also indicative of the amount of thought it feels like was put into this game in general: the title has nothing to do with fucking anything. This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime-sentences: This game is completely unrelated to guacamole. They just chose a random ~Mexican~ thing and made a stupid portmanteau out of it. They didn\u2019t bother to find an actual word in Spanish and make a clever pun, they just went HUR HUR YOU CAN GET GUACAMOLE AT MEXICAN RESTAURANTS SO LET\u2019S CALL OUR GAME THAT.\n\nI\u2019d be very curious to know if there are any games out there about Mexican/South American culture by a Latinx team/head writer/etc., because this seems like a cultural moment in which that kind of art is super necessary, but this is very very much not that game.

It's so strong that it almost became one of my favourite Metroid-vania games of all time. Unfortunately, the game doesn't build upon this foundation to any significant degree. In fact, it actually detracts from it and therefore ends up just being a great game rather than a fucking awesome game.\n\nThe foundation of this game is very simple. You have your 3 hit attack combo. When you hit enemies with your attacks enough time, you can \"grapple\" them. This grapple has 3 functions:\n\t\u2022 AOE attack: After you grapple an enemy, you can throw an enemy in any direction. When thrown, the enemy will knock down any other enemies in the way.\n\t\u2022 Attack reset: Right after you throw an enemy, you can repeat your 3 hit attack combo. Surprise surprise, most enemies can be grappled after 3 hits.\n\t\u2022 Invulnerability: While you're grappling an enemy, you're invulnerable to any damage. This allows you to dodge attacks and carefully aim enemies to fly in the direction you want them to.\n\nBecause of how useful the grapple is, the developers have been able to create a combo focused system witch just 2 attacks (3 hit combo and grapple). Simple and effective.\n\nAs you progress in the game, the combat slowly gets built upon using special moves. These special moves are basically heavy attacks that attack in a certain direction (up, down, left/right, stationary). These special moves ALSO reset your attacks. This is very useful for big enemies that can't be grappled. So far so good. You can use grapples to take on multiple small enemies and special moves to take on large enemies.\n\nI thought the combat would progress to link all of these attacks together so that you would be doing really long combos while fighting many enemies all at once. That would've been really cool\u2026.. But unfortunately the enemy design stops this from happening. The small enemies' health pool is too small, so they die in like 2 combos (e.g. 3x attack --> special move ---> 3x attack = dead enemy). You can't do a long ass combo on an enemy that dies so quickly. The big enemies' don't get stunned, and they attack in the time it takes you to do 2 combos. Therefore, unless you want to take damage, you're forced to dodge and restart your combo. \n\nWhile the above is limiting, the late-game enemies are the worst. This is where the foundation of the game starts deteriorating. Late-game enemies, including bosses, automatically dodge after taking a certain # of hits in the MIDDLE of your combo. This was a really bad design decision. Note that it's the # of hits, not the damage. Therefore, combat against these enemies is all about spamming your special moves since they do the most damage per hit.  You almost never want to use your regular attacks OR grapple and so combat is actually more boring in the late game compared to the early to mid-game. Keep in mind that special moves take energy, so you'll be spamming your special moves, waiting until your energy recharges, and repeat the process.\n\nTo be fair, combat definitely becomes more challenging as the game progresses. This is because of the way fights are designed. You're not really fighting enemies 1 on 1 as you move throughout the world like in most Metroid-vania games. Instead, most fights happen in square arenas (e.g. you can be exploring and then walls appear to the left and right of you. Enemies start spawning in and you can't leave until you beat all the enemies). These arenas can have various hazards and multiple enemies can spawn in an arena, forcing you to take on multiple enemies while being wary of your surroundings. Furthermore, late game enemies have \"shields\", which require a very specific special move in order to break the shield. Late game enemies also have some attacks that can't be dodged, forcing you to double-jump/wall jump over them. So while YOUR attacks get more limited (i.e. you're just spamming super moves rather and not normal attacking and grappling), the enemies' attacks and defenses get more varied and interesting. I died multiple times on certain groups of enemies and got a great feeling of achievement when I beat them.\n\nThere's only 5 bosses in the game, but they're all very distinct from each other and require mastering their unique attacks. I particularly liked this boss that's 3 skeletons combined into 1. In the second phase, each skeleton covers a portion of the screen (1 in the top, 1 in the center, and 1 at the bottom). They attack with laser beams that can't be dodged, and always attack 2 at a time. In order to dodge them, you need to use your super moves to stay in the 1 portion of the screen that the skeleton is not attacking. This was a great way to make \"spamming super moves\" an interesting affair and I wish all of the bosses and enemies made spamming super moves as interesting as this. \n\nWhile the combat gets slightly stale near the end, thankfully the platforming stays engaging throughout the game. This is some of the best platforming I've seen in any 2-D game. Your character can wall jump and double-jump. Also, the special moves are worked into the platforming since the move that makes you attack up is effectively another jump, and the move that makes you go left/right is crucial for certain platforming sections. Furthermore, your character can dimension swap between 2 dimensions. In 1 dimension there are certain obstacles/platforms while in another dimension they're different. Swapping between these dimension quickly when platforming is crucial to succeeding, and it made the platforming sections so satisfying to beat.\n\nThe progression system is well done. Beating enemies awards you currency which you can use to buy stuff at checkpoints. You can buy health ups, energy ups, costumes, etc\u2026 You can also find health ups and energy ups in chests while exploring. There are a LOT of chests to scattered throughout the world, so it's always rewarding to go off the beaten path and explore. So you're rewarded for adventuring, so that's fun.\n\nThere's a story that's fairly typical. A villain kidnaps a girl and you as the main hero have to save her. What's not so typical are the characters themselves and their dialogue. This game doesn't take itself too seriously and the characters can be genuinely hilarious sometimes. They have unique personalities and there's a lot of pop culture references. There's a scene straight from Star Wars in one scene and I laughed out loud when I saw it. \n\nOverall, this is a great game with a very strong early game. It's unfortunate that the late game was not as engaging, but what's here is still a great package.", "timestamp_created": 1575218449, "timestamp_updated": 1575218461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58765619": {"recommendationid": "58765619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272999799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1460218969}, "language": "spanish", "review": "I do not think this is a good game.

Also, it does not focus a lot on finding your way, since just following the map and the indicators, you'll basically never get lost.

Since I was a little impatient at the time, I liked it. But at the same time, the other paths leads to not only powerups but fun platforming. I ended up going after almost all powerups.\n\nOne very fun thing is the jokes.

This is... frustrating, and the game isn't very forgiving about it, with some lengthy precision combat requiring areas sending you way back at start if you make a single mistake. The combat is kinda better since it comes off more close to fighting games than metroidvanias there, but some boss fights and intense battles still require really precise combo-ing to get things done. Honestly this is exactly why I can't recommend the game and have little to not interest in sequel (which I heard is pretty similar in this regard), it's just too frustrating.\n\nNow, the good part: the world is pretty fun, it's like this caricature of Mexico with lots of stereotypical aspects like sombreros and skeletons and, well, the luchadore masked wrestlers play a crucial role in this world, wielding mystical powers and fighting injustices. You end up as one, too. I'm not sure if all these stereotypes and cultural symbols could be considered offensive, if you ask me the game blatantly doesn't take itself serious while at same time shows these cultural aspects in a pretty affectionate manner, everyone from country bumpkins to other strangers are pretty sympathethic even if they portray some negative stereotype. The music is also really on point and memorable. What is a bit annoying is how full of pop culture jokes this game is. Like, very single advertisement or business banner is a reference to other game, which I can forgive as this solidarity with other indies and desire to subtly promote their game, but it doesn't stop at them and the pop culture references are endless.\n\nOverall, I feel like it could have been more forgiving, and while I am sure there will be people who enjoy pulling off precision combos, I really cannot recommend the game.

The artstyle is great, the movement and combat flows well and the music is pretty nice.\n\nMy problem with this game, however, is this: \n\nThe Repetition. This game is just repetitive in the worst way. It is (supposed to be) a metroidvania, so you go through areas, fight enemies, collect new powers. Fighting enemies is very repetitive, platforming is simple and - well, that\u00b4s it. Puzzles and platforming consist of 90 % walljumping, whereas combat consists of \"mash X 3 times for the basic combo, then use one of your 4 special moves, and maybe occasionally grab an enemy\". The game is also incredibly easy, and it is one of those wonderful games where you don\u00b4t unlock the harder difficulty unless you play through it once (always a genius move in any game!)\n\nWhile the artstyle is great, the areas are just boring and badly designed. Go through linear hallway, arena appears, fight a couple enemies, walljump up two walls, go through another hallway, arena appears, fight a couple enemies, rinse and repeat. There is never a challenge in the game, you never have to think. The \"metroidvania\" part of the game is also very light; you learn 4 special moves as the game goes on (as well as two movement abilities), allowing you to break coloured blocks in earlier areas. But the actual discovery aspect of this game is so light that you only find one of four objects behind those walls; health and stamina upgrades, money, or orbs for the different ending.\n\nReally, my problem with the game is just that it is so boring and without drive. It just goes through the motions. Everything is just way too easy and repetitive. Boring forest, lifeless volcano, some snow mountain, a town with 4 buildings you can enter, boring combat, boring bosses, boring story with a bad ending that can only be upgraded by finding 6 hidden orbs.\n\nIf the game would be a little more challenging, more creative, would consist of more than just hallway to enemies to simple puzzle/platforming to hallway, then I probably would recommend it; the artstyle and music are the reason why it stings a little to downvote it, too. But I am rating a game here, and it was very hard to find one under the pretty facade. Maybe you will like it more than I did, but buy it on sale if you do.\n\nAs for me, it was a boring, uninspired metroidvania-supermegalite, especially compared to some really good similar games like Hollow Knight.", "timestamp_created": 1566931083, "timestamp_updated": 1566934447, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482088744640350342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54835318": {"recommendationid": "54835318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007769187", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1050, "last_played": 1566892640}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the most fun I've had playing a platformer.\n\nGreat humor\nAmazing visuals and color (with there was a colorblind mode though)\nLovable characters and goats\nWrestling moves make you feel awesome\nGood challenge + enough to explore\n\n10/10 actually wanted to play through and finish a game for once", "timestamp_created": 1566892739, "timestamp_updated": 1566892739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54835187": {"recommendationid": "54835187", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974484281", "num_games_owned": 2308, "num_reviews": 1398, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1683316621}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay", "timestamp_created": 1566891990, "timestamp_updated": 1566891990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438549339771270752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54819563": {"recommendationid": "54819563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031059556", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1566655397}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Guacamelee!, es un juego de plataformas y \"Hack and slash\" en scroll lateral.

Guacamelee! follows the classic \"save the princess\" trope, with a striking visual style, framework dipped in Mexican culture and humor that lands more often than not. There's not a whole lot to say about it; combat is simple button mashing with the option for combos if you're feeling particularly skilled, as well as power moves for both combat and exploration. The campaign takes anywhere from 5 to 8 hours, depending on how much of a completionist you are and the whole thing is just really fun. The side-quests aren't too demanding and add character to the world, there's a whole lot of pick-ups to challenge your OCD and the game is just smooth and amusing from beginning to end.\n\nIt's not perfect, though. For one thing, running the game fullscreen causes constant stutters, which means I had to play the game on windowed mode (and borderless doesn't exist, due to the game's age). In fairness, this same issue appeared on Giana Sisters recently as well (when it wasn't a problem before), so there's a chance some accursed Win10 update just broke the game.\n\nAlso, the difficulty curve leaves something to be desired. The game is perfectly beatable and it's not overly challenging; however, in its third act, it's choke-full of excruciating platforming sections that rely on split-second reactions with utilizing a number of different moves to traverse the environment and dual-world switching on the fly, which can get tedious. The game has the decency to (usually) not kill you when you fail (it just puts you back on a platform to try again), but it can get frustrating, especially as the controls can screw you over. Same goes for some combat arenas, the design of which can be especially asinine (I'm looking at you, bombs).\n\nLastly, as beautiful as the game is, it's perfectly possible to lose track of the player character when there are too many enemies on-screen or even during boss battles. The final boss, for example, has a very easy to decipher pattern, but took me way too many tries because the screen got too busy to keep track of what was going on.\n\nHaving said all that, I really enjoyed Guacamelee! despite its shortcomings. I picked it up for free (I believe it was a Humble giveaway) and I'm so used to giveaways being utter trash, I was surprised with the level of quality on display here.

Combat feels very rewarding while you find new ways to string long combos on enemies and being able to dodge at any time keeps fights fast and engaging.  Despite the game's content primarily being fighting it never felt too gratuitous due to the various platforming and side-quest objectives sprinkled about.  \n\nWhile I appreciated the fact that each area displays it's own separate completion rating of 0%-100% there were times where I felt the unexplored secret areas could have been vaguely shown on the map screen better.  The colored blocks were shown on the map very clearly while narrow tunnels are practically invisible.  Save/Warp icons on the map also caused me to miss progression / secret areas due to the game occasionally placing branching paths near them. \n\nThe difficulty of the game is very easy overall, deaths only reset your progress to a 1 minute progression loss at most, auto-save locations are found on practically every facet of the map + fill your health back to max. Hard mode does a decent job at encouraging a second playthrough of the game.  I appreciated the extra care that went into bosses in that all of them (save from the final boss) play differently in various ways.  The earlier parts of the game are practically the same as normal mode until it ramps up near the end.\n\nHad fun with this and would recommend it as a good starting point for those looking to get into Metroidvanias.   Guacamelee does a good job with it's short and legible map layouts that tells you all you need to know about a level, constant progression via ability unlocks, and very fast loading screens.", "timestamp_created": 1565225814, "timestamp_updated": 1568569967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491491615772247314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54508661": {"recommendationid": "54508661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271916016", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 686, "last_played": 1563469098}, "language": "english", "review": "Guacamelee is an extremely stylistic Metroidvania game and It\u2019s great. This game highlights the beauty of Mexican culture so absolutely well in it\u2019s Aztec/Mayan Style of art, clever cultural integrations (Olmec heads as teleporters), and most prominently to me the Soundtrack. Holy shit if you like Mexican music you\u2019ll love this game - very unique twists using D minor in the soundtrack as well. The art design may not be for some though, and is overall simplistic. This game also features a LOT of references to other games which are really fun to find and read.\n\nThe game features an ability to swap between the world of the living and the dead which in turn changes the ENTIRE surrounding areas with incredible attention to detail to both art AND sound design. This combined with the other abilities creates some pretty unique puzzles and timing obstacles. However, a few rooms simply don\u2019t have a world of the dead version and thus force you back into the real world. Animations can be a bit unnatural when this happens as well as with ability use near odd geometry, but it\u2019s a decently old game so It makes sense.\n\nCombat is incredibly combo based and really fun to mess around with. There are a multitude of ways to beat up and manipulate your enemies and furthermore manage your intenso bar. The major complaint here are the boss fights. In all honesty they felt extremely drawn out and unfitting to fight. Enemies range from annoying to extremely annoying, which ultimately adds to the pleasure of beating them up like a luchador.\n\nThere are a decent amount of collectibles to find and costumes/upgrades to buy, as well as steam workshop integration so you can import your own skins if you want to. Guacamelee does have a simple but charming story and as well as local co-op integration. NPC dialogue is also pretty funny at certain moments.\n\nGuacamelee is the Mexican Metroidvania nobody asked for and I love it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1565219861, "timestamp_updated": 1565219861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54448938": {"recommendationid": "54448938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129961090", "num_games_owned": 442, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1554231103}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juego Metroidvania, con una historia que cumple, habilidades bien integradas en el transcurso del juego, uno de los combates mas satisfactorios y divertidos que he probado, contenido post game y rejugabilidad gracias a la dificultad dificil, desbloqueada al pasarse el juego por primera vez.

You will play as Juan Aguacate, a simple agave farmer who now becomes a Luchador, with a task of saving her! \n\nGameplay is a combination of metroidvania and brawlers. Like all of the games from metroidvania subgenre, Guacamelee has open and non-linear world you can fully explore. Obviously some of the areas are not available at first and you need to progress before entering them, to keep the difficulty and progression system on track! In those areas you can progress in storyline, or start looking for secrets, yet it is better to do that later when you have decent amount of skills. Secrets vary from stamina/health increase, to chests with coins. It's fun to collect them, and they really help you! \n\nGame has a ton of platformic elements. At first it might look simple enough, as you just have to jump from ledge to ledge, but later on as more abilities are gained, you use them to boost your jumps, wallrun, double jump, dodge specific objects, the usual when it comes to those types of games, so it's not for everyone. \nCoordination is required, and for some, a controller aswell. There is a reason game recommends a controller everytime you launch it. It simply offers better mapping of combos you need to perform, and smaller chance of missing specific buttons because of stress. It's easier to hit bumps and triggers rather than small keys. But it dosen't mean it's impossible to beat it! Look at me, I played the damn thing on keyboard and my fingers are mostly fine, can't say that about mental health so better pick a controller to avoid frustration. \n\nCombat has same difficulty curve as platforming. At first, enemies are pretty weak and feature two or three types only, you can easily dodge their attacks and defeat them. As you progress, game adds shields, attacks you can't dodge, bigger and tougher enemies, and so on.\nEnemies drop coins after being defeated, health orbs to regenerate health!\nBecause you are a Luchador, there is a ton of combos you can perform, like in most of the brawler games. Throw enemies in the air, combine abilties, avoid attacks!\n\nAbilities you collect are used everywhere. Need to climb onto something? Destroy a specific block or shield? It requires a specific ability. To use them, you need to have stamina, if you run out of it, just wait few seconds and it will recharge! \nSame can't be said about health, to recharge it you either need to hit a checkpoint, or you need to collect health orbs. \n\nCheckpoints in the game are also shops, in which you can spend coins you collected. Game features two types of those-normal coins are used to upgrade Juan and his skills and silver coins, used to buy costumes, those change the way you look (duh) but also have pros and cons. Regenerate slowly health, but regenerate slower stamina? Deal, yet take more damage\nat the same time? It's your choice which costume you will pick!\n\nYou need help? Ask a friend to play with you! Game features coop for 4 players, but if I recall, it's only local and you need, obviously, 3 other controllers.\nBesides coop you also have Hard Mode, which as name suggest, increases difficulty of the game. And while I didn't notice improved platformic difficulty, fights are definitely harder, with enemies packing a punch. \n\nIt's optimized very well, I had no issues when playing so I can't really complain, can I. \n\nBecause it is set in Mexico, soundtrack composed by Rom Di Prisco and Peter Chapman is filled with traditional Mexican music. It really adds to the game, I loved it! And you can focus on it even more as there is no voice acting in the game. \n\nRelentless yet enjoyable combat, great platforming gameplay, and fantastic soundtrack, Guacamelee is a must play for metroidvania fans! A bit short. 8/10! \n\nIf you enjoyed reading that review, check out [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/] my curator page!

If you like platformer-metroidvanias, and don't mind punishing difficulty and a more linear experience, this game does have some clever puzzles, interesting combat, and eccentric characters.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game because of issues with its controls and difficulty, which drain the fun from what would be an otherwise light and well-paced game.\n\nProbably the first thing you'll notice, is that the player character has binary movement. Either he's sprinting, or he's standing still.  The result is that your control of the character feels imprecise. This isn't a great start for a game that is at least 50% platforming.\n\nThe second thing you may notice, is that the inputs seem sluggish. Timing jumps or attacks starts to become very frustrating, since you'll have to do every action what feels like 1/3 of a second in advance, because the game can't keep up. Eventually you get used to it, but this is one of the only games I've experienced this problem with. Tack on overly punitive hit boxes on hazards like spikes, and you'll really start to grind your teeth.\n\nLastly is the difficulty. The two above factors wouldn't be such a issue if the difficulty of the game wasn't tuned so tightly. By tight, I mean that around 20% of the puzzles in the game are basically tuned with no margin for error. You execute them exactly as the designers intended, or you fail and start over. Each puzzle still feels like it could have been good, but either the timing is too tight, or the number of steps is too many. The result, is that frequently you can complete 90% of the puzzle flawlessly, but you'll end up smashing your face on it repeatedly trying to get though that last 10% over and over.

It starts out simple enough, and does a very good job of easing you into new moves and what to do with them.  That said, it gets to be quite challenging by the end, especially if you're trying to grab all of the game's treasures.  This leads to some really cheap moments, and some of the move inputs clash a bit with general design, so there is the occasional frustration.  The combat gradually gets harder, too, especially if you're trying to rack up big combos.  Though the time between hits is very forgiving, and you can get extra hit bonuses for killing enemies or hitting them with special moves, take one hit and your combo ends.  Luckily, they're mostly for personal gratification, and if they do increase the amount of money that you receive - I didn't take notice - it doesn't matter much, because you'll likely have enough to buy all of the upgrades by the end, so long as you're diligent.\n\nBeyond the dynamic combat and clever puzzles, what stands out is the Mexican theme.  It's not too often that you see this in a game, and they did a great job with it.  The way that it's presented is a good way to really get interested in the culture, even if it's not exactly educational; over the few days I played this, I kept subconsciously slipping in and out of Spanish, without being overly tired or stressed.  The music helps with this, too, because it's traditional music that's been remixed to give it an exciting new feel.  The visuals are neat, too, starting out with the usual yellowy desert, but getting into some mysterious ruins, and a whole other world, where all sorts of strange visual phenomena come out to bloom.\n\nThe humor's a little hit-or miss, unfortunately.  It's a pretty funny game, overall, and when a joke lands, its over-the-top presentation really makes it pop; by the end, I was still chuckling every time I got a new ability.  A lot of it, though, is semi-funny, but mostly pop culture references (the majority of which are to video games) that don't make any sense here.  Sure, with the luchador theme, a Strong Bad reference makes sense, but there's a broken wall with exposed bricks in the shape of a Mega Man sprite at one point.  Every once in a while, they're funny, just because they come out of nowhere, smack you upside the head, and fly off into the distance before you even figured out what happened, but there are so many that they start to just seem out of place.\n\nAll in all, a few unreasonable expectations aside, there isn't anything wrong with it; if you're looking for a fresh, new experience, and don't mind a challenge that's especially high for this subgenre, then give this a go!", "timestamp_created": 1562647101, "timestamp_updated": 1562647101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526749014854431152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53979091": {"recommendationid": "53979091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287698045", "num_games_owned": 721, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2447, "last_played": 1562634232}, "language": "spanish", "review": "-Guacamelee es un plataformero al estilo Metroidvania con much\u00edsimas referencias a memes, otros videojuegos, cine, arte; entre otros.

He meets a slew of whacky and comical characters who will aid the luchador in his journey by either teaching him new abilities or guiding him to the right path. Although there is a linear and coherent story that anyone can understand the game itself is open to the player in a more semi metrovania styled open world game where some places require certain abilities and power ups while others don't. You could in theory go wherever you want from the very start although you won't go far. To my surprise I thought that the game would have to heavily rely on the gameplay which I expected to be the average metrovania type but in reality it has a nice balance of story and gameplay. The story being a wild adventure across the desert, rivers, and jungles to save the president's daughter all while facing off with other luchadors and criminals. There are side quests you can partake in but it's all optional in fact none of the ones I've played have really given me anything which is unfortunate because helping the local grandmother in town make her specialty was honestly fun enough to have warranted at least a stupid joke reward. For the gameplay I was pleasantly surprised with the combat; I like the grappling which admittedly I'd use a lot despite it not always being a reliable way to cause damage. I also found the combos interesting but they never really felt like I had to learn them in order to play and win it had always felt like I could just wing it but having the option is still nice. Although the achieving of these combos was rather annoying and cute. In order to learn combos you have to find a luchador chicken (which is just a regular chicken that can speak for some reason) to teach you using the skeleton of a dead luchador. It's hard to master and annoying just to unlock the entirety of a combo move of which I'll probably never use the entire sequence of if not never use it at all. The platforming can be just as difficult at times but thankfully they aren't too hard that it ruins the experience of the game I just think they went a bit too far with the things they expect you to be able to pull off. One thing I really enjoyed about the game was the inclusion of being able to play as a girl luchador to which I did and still am playing only as her. I love those inclusions because although I don't need it to enjoy the game I enjoy it a little more with the inclusion. Don't get me wrong I can play a game where your only playable character is a man but if I had to choose I'd choose a woman. Overall I feel that this game is worth the money it takes to play this game; whether you buy it on sale or simply buy it at full price. I enjoyed it and I know others will and others won't. It's a cute little game about whacky characters in a fantasy cartoon violence world filled to the brim with Mexican culture.", "timestamp_created": 1562364836, "timestamp_updated": 1562364836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53718806": {"recommendationid": "53718806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198222172928", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1619395239}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1562364223, "timestamp_updated": 1562364223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53714807": {"recommendationid": "53714807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142933971", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1567533248}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic for a single player adventure", "timestamp_created": 1562361615, "timestamp_updated": 1562361615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53712827": {"recommendationid": "53712827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009583566", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1197, "last_played": 1688113962}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un gran metroidvania, relativamente f\u00e1cil en un inicio y rabiosamente complicado para completarlo al 100%", "timestamp_created": 1562360425, "timestamp_updated": 1562360425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53706220": {"recommendationid": "53706220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339604554", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 827, "last_played": 1573350038}, "language": "english", "review": "its a great beat`m` up with a great story but its pretty short", "timestamp_created": 1562356515, "timestamp_updated": 1562356515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53702818": {"recommendationid": "53702818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198874486224", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 903, "last_played": 1562352072}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite a fun game, I used mouse on it even though it was recommended that a controller was used.

It has a set path that is dictated by various abilities that are necessary for breaking different colored blocks.  The game play is simple but, as the combo teacher will teach you, it can get pretty intense and complex.  Personally, I went the easy way and relied on grappling, but each of my friends found their own play style.  Play styles can be further developed with the addition of various costumes which give buffs and debuffs like better throws but your punches deal less damage.  One of the greatest points, and weakness, of the game is the multiplayer function.  It is always amazing to finally find a game my siblings and I or my friends and I can play together without buying four copies.  However, with Guacamelee, the difficulty drops exponentially with the number of players in the game.  The enemies remain at the same strength and number whether you have one player or four.  This makes it more friendly to players who don't want to learn the 27 hit combos from the teacher but can be boring if you are that one hardcore gamer in the group.

this one, Humble Bundle. And now, for something completely different.\n\nEs casi dif\u00edcil demostrar cu\u00e1nto ha crecido este juego desde que lo instal\u00e9 y, para ser honesto, al principio no sab\u00eda qu\u00e9 esperar. Honestamente pensaba que con un nombre como Guacamelee, pensaba a medias que ser\u00eda como un juego tipo Smash Brothers, solo para sorprenderme gratamente de que estaba m\u00e1s en la l\u00ednea de un juego tipo Metroidvania, pero se aferraba a elementos como luchadores enmascarados, El d\u00eda de los muertos y cosas que realmente muestran la cultura mexicana.\n\nAbandonando ese tema, el juego comienza contigo jugando como Juan, tu t\u00edpico hombre que solo estaba atendiendo su campo de agave cuando una figura sombr\u00eda destruye la casa del presidente y luego un grupo de matones secuestr\u00f3 a su hija con la intenci\u00f3n de fusionar la tierra de los muertos con la tierra de los vivos. Durante esto, intentaste detener a este grupo, solo para ser enviado r\u00e1pidamente, pero el destino conspirar\u00eda de otra manera. Una m\u00e1scara reluciente en la cabeza de una estatua le da a Juan una nueva oportunidad de vida, por as\u00ed decirlo, y desde all\u00ed, se te da la fuerza, las habilidades y el misticismo de un luchador, donde puedes infligir movimientos da\u00f1inos como un suplex, patea tu Los oponentes se alejan, los acumulan en la tierra o les dan una patada como si fueran un bal\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol.\n\nA pesar de todo esto, este juego comienza bastante simple, pero se incrementa con una curva de dificultad de construcci\u00f3n lenta hasta que te enfrentas a todo tipo de peligros locos, como cuchillas de sierra, p\u00faas, lava, enemigos con c\u00f3digos de colores y m\u00faltiples golpes. Los enemigos blindados, los que vuelan, los gigantes, los explosivos, algunos que llevan espadas y esquivar\u00e1n r\u00e1pidamente cualquier cosa que intentes lanzar, incluidas muchas otras, por lo que es mejor que est\u00e9s preparado para comenzar a derribar. Pero bueno, no tienes nada de qu\u00e9 preocuparte porque en el camino, te encuentras con varias mejoras para tu salud, resistencia e indicadores de intensidad que puedes comprar en la tienda, o encontrarlos en el enorme mundo as\u00ed como mejoras para tu arsenal de movimientos, as\u00ed como una variedad de disfraces que pueden agregar beneficios o aumentar el desaf\u00edo. Sin dar demasiado lejos, comienza a acumularse en un punto y lo dejar\u00e9 as\u00ed. Otra cosa que olvid\u00e9 mencionar es que cuando se agrega Steam Workshop, incluso puedes agregar disfraces que la gente haya creado.\n\nAhora, \u00bfrecomiendo esto? Apuestas tu culo a que yo hago. Esta es una agradable sorpresa que no debe perderse. Lo \u00fanico que puedo decir en contra es que solo hay multijugador local, as\u00ed que si quieres reunir a algunos amigos de todo el mundo, necesitar\u00e1s un programa llamado Parsec para que disfruten de la experiencia.\n\nThe only joke part about this is that the main body part of the review was written and then translated with Google Translate.

It shows you your percentage completion of each area (based on number of treasures left), the color-coded blocks and treasures you encounter but don't break, and even a quest marker that points you in the general direction of the next story objective.\n\nThe game also has co-op, but unfortunately, it's only for local play.

is a metroidvania meets beat em up with a unique art style that is charming and really fun to play. This is videogame at its purest form, great fun with no paywall whatsoever\n\nThe Good:\n+ The artstyle of this game is just breathtakingly beautiful. The use of color palette in the environment really make this game stand out.\n+ The soundtrack is downright amazing. The lively environment is supported by the uplifting music that always plays through the entire 5-6 hours campaign. It might get repetitive to some, but i was too busy enjoying the music to notice.\n+ Platformer meets beat em up gameplay that is a cross between castlevania in terms of platforming and streets of rage in terms of fighting. Where other games might have one aspect that is better, Guacamelee! excels in both areas. The controls for this game is excellent, easy to learn but hard to master. Platforming is straightforward in the beginning but as the game progress, Guacamelee! gives the players a lot of platforming-puzzle sequences that are enjoyable and frustrating, but never impossible. Combat is also another thing of highlight for the gameplay, as it can be pretty deep. Like platforming, combat seems like just another button mash at the start but in a few hours time, you'll be using long combos to defeat that gigantic skull titan.\n+ The story is really good. Without spoiling anything, it tells a revenge story meets end of the world scenario that is enjoyable to watch from start to finish. A bit of a shame that our main character doesn't talk. The cast of characters that we get to meet on the other hand are laid in variety and hilarious personalities. The goat-man is my personal favorite, reminding me of Rafiki from The Lion King\n+ Comedy in this game is just pure gold. It doesn't try too hard to be funny, but tells jokes and lays hilarious scenario at just the right moment.\n\nThe Bad:\n- A part from a few frustratingly annoying platforming sections and enemy types, this game have very few flaws\n\nThe Verdict:\nBuy it. Even at full price I feel it is worth every cent. I got it for free and I feel guilty for not spending anything to play this game", "timestamp_created": 1561827908, "timestamp_updated": 1568318284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52072854": {"recommendationid": "52072854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427138356", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1611201971}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego muy divertido", "timestamp_created": 1561827420, "timestamp_updated": 1561827420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52067034": {"recommendationid": "52067034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048893711", "num_games_owned": 630, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1023, "last_played": 1561766445}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego super divertido, con un plataformeo muy entretenido.

They're also needed for breaking enemy shields, doing some sweet combos and going through some very well-made platforming sections. So the game gets better and better with more power-ups, and ends with one final level which will throw everything at you.

Throughout the game you unlock new moves to both aid you in combat and make new areas of the game accessible through platforming challenges.

It will likely take 6-10 hours to finish the game if you are picking up collectables such as health and stamina upgrades throughout.\n\nThe game works well when using a controller or a keyboard.  A small possible issue is that controller bindings cant be modified in-game, though using Steam's controller setup tool this can be fixed.\n\nOverall a solid game which I would recommend to most people who enjoy platforming.", "timestamp_created": 1561803096, "timestamp_updated": 1561803096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51823219": {"recommendationid": "51823219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397928137", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1590568292}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game i play on keyboard but stfu .
