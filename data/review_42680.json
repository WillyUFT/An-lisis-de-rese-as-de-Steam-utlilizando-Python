success of COD:MW2 and its cliffhanger ending called for a sequel. \nCOD:MW2 is the long-awaited climax of the Modern Warfare saga.\nHow can I summarize this episode in a few words? \"Always more\".\n\nAlways more conflicts.\nModern Wafare 3 picks up directly after the end of the previous game.\nThe war between the USA and Russia is on the verge of escalating into a global conflict.\nMakarov, the leader of Russian ultranationalists, orders an attack on the most important Western megacities.\nWhat a good opportunity to visit France, Germany, England, but also Africa, Russia and the USA (among others)...\nPrice, Soap, Frost and Yuri set out in pursuit of Makarov in order to stop the war as quickly as possible.\n\nAlways more spectacle.\nThere is no chance of getting bored because the game wants to impress so much.\nThe levels are full of explosions and effects of all kinds.\nThe atmosphere is apocalyptic...\nThe player always has more means to destroy his enemies, more weapons and equipment,\nsuch as a heavily armed remote-controlled vehicle, or a light underwater vehicle.\nA large number of epic sequences follow one another,\nsuch as a train chase, a submarine assault or a plane hostage situation.\nAnd to all this is added the traditional helicopter combat and the bombing of targets by plane.\n\nAlways more content.\nFans of MW2's \"Special Ops\" co-op mode will be happy to know that it's back in MW3.\nHalf of the missions are available as DLC, and both players must own them to play them...\nThree modes are available:\n- Mission: Various levels with multiple objectives, based on the main campaign.\n- Survival: players must survive successive waves of enemies as much as possible, by purchasing weapons and equipment.\n- Chaos: Four maps in which players must kill as many enemies as possible by making combos to earn more points.\n\nAlways more flaws.\nMW3 is ultra-linear and overly scripted.\nNo freedom is possible, everything is dictated by the game.\nThe enemy AI is ridiculous, which is offset by the power of their weapons (especially in \"veteran\").\nThe graphics and effects seem really dated for 2011, we feel the desire to make something new out of something old.\nTo be honest, this third part of the saga seems to be a big DLC \u200b\u200bof MW2.\n\nCall of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is the game of excess.\nThe game is one of one-upmanship in all areas.\nIt is also a perfect synthesis of the saga, but which really takes few risks.\nInfinity Ward really sticks to the achievements of the saga, to appeal to an

The game was released worldwide in November 2011 for Microsoft Windows, the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and OS X.It is the sequel to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009), serving as the third and final installment in the original Modern Warfare trilogy and the eighth Call of Duty installment overall. A separate version for the Nintendo DS was developed by n-Space, while Treyarch developed the game's Wii port. In Japan, Square Enix published the game with a separate subtitled and dubbed version.\n\nThe game's campaign follows Modern Warfare 2 and begins right after the events of its final mission. Similar to Modern Warfare 2, it is centered around Task Force 141, which contains Captain Price, Soap MacTavish, and a newly introduced playable character, Yuri. Alongside the Delta Force and Special Air Service, they hunt Vladimir Makarov (the main antagonist of the trilogy), a Russian terrorist who leads the Russian Ultranationalist party. He leads several terror attacks across Europe, triggering a large-scale war between the Ultranationalists and friendly forces. For the game's multiplayer mode, new mode types and killstreak choices were brought in. Improvements were also made to the mode that solved issues that appeared in Modern Warfare 2.\n\nUsing an enhanced version of Modern Warfare 2's IW engine, development for the game began in 2010 with more than one developer studio. Prior to development, Infinity Ward co-founders Jason West and Vince Zampella left the company to form Respawn Entertainment. Other members had been fired or had left the company following the duo's departure. Sledgehammer Games had joined the Modern Warfare 3 development force, with Raven Software also developing the game's multiplayer mode. Following a large leak containing detailed information about the game, multiple teaser trailers were released, with each showcasing a location featured in the game's campaign, leading up to a full reveal.\n\nModern Warfare 3 received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its gameplay, campaign, and multiplayer, although there was some criticism for its story and lack of innovation. It won the award for Best Shooter at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards. It was a massive commercial success. Within 24 hours of going on sale, the game sold 6.5 million copies in the United States and the United Kingdom and grossed $400 million, contemporaneously making it the largest entertainment launch ever.", "timestamp_created": 1696479903, "timestamp_updated": 1696480449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147647349": {"recommendationid": "147647349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083179149", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 636, "last_played": 1664561786}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Jugar las 3 campa\u00f1as de los Modern Warfare del tir\u00f3n sigue siendo una gozada, pero, y es un gran PERO...

My favorite part of the game is eating dog crap while I try to make it look like I'm not the reason my teams losing. The game is still fun tho whether you suck at it or your the best player in the entire world. This is one of thos games were you'll finally get into a server and see that you're level 5 and everyone else is either level 80-90 and you'll go \"Oh well, I best just play.\" and try to play off having 1500 points while the enemy team has 3000 and then it'll all ways some how you don't get bullied for being the reason your team lost. Also I want Activision to bring back the fun old school CoD like this one where it adds so much story to just shooting people in the face and stuff (I know there is more). It's all ways nice to have a game where people aren't having to pay $70 U.S. dollars to play the \"Brand new\" CoD III which if you're an absolute idiot is 3 in roman numerals. I think Activision should come out with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 or smth, but no it's just instead of 2 it's 2.0 such a \"big\" difference. Like srsly tho come on there has to have been at least 7 CoDs now and its still been the same old Call of Duty 2 and 3 there has never been a 4 or 5! Can we please get a new name for Call of Duty already! If you're still reading I very much love this game and the community is so amazing I rate this game an 20/10 I recommend it to everyone as long as you can handle that one mission where you kill civilians or is that MW2?

Culmination of Epic Warfare[/h1]\n\nIn the pantheon of iconic first-person shooters, few titles have left as indelible a mark as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. As the highly anticipated conclusion to the critically acclaimed Modern Warfare trilogy, this game delivers a tour de force of explosive action, gripping storytelling, and intense multiplayer gameplay that cements its status as a pinnacle of the genre.\n\nFrom the very first moments of Modern Warfare 3, players are thrust into a world on the brink of all-out war. The narrative picks up immediately after the events of its predecessor, propelling players into a globe-trotting campaign that takes them from the chaotic streets of New York City to the war-torn alleys of Paris and beyond. The sense of urgency and high-stakes warfare is palpable, creating an immersive experience that keeps players on the edge of their seats. The game's ability to seamlessly switch perspectives between different characters adds depth to the storytelling, allowing players to witness the global conflict from multiple angles and fostering a greater understanding of the interconnected nature of modern warfare.\n\nThe hallmark of the Modern Warfare series has always been its cinematic presentation, and Modern Warfare 3 continues this tradition with aplomb. The game boasts stunning visuals that capture the devastation and chaos of war in meticulous detail. Whether it's the crumbling buildings of New York, the snowy landscapes of Russia, or the neon-lit streets of London, each environment is painstakingly crafted to evoke a sense of realism and immersion. Coupled with a pulse-pounding musical score and top-notch voice acting, Modern Warfare 3's presentation draws players into a world of high-stakes conflict that feels both authentic and emotionally charged.\n\nGameplay-wise, Modern Warfare 3 doesn't miss a beat, delivering the fast-paced and responsive gunplay that the series is known for. The campaign offers a diverse array of mission types, from heart-pounding stealth sequences to explosive set pieces that rival the best action movies. The game strikes a satisfying balance between intense firefights, vehicular combat, and strategic decision-making, ensuring that each mission feels unique and engaging. The series' signature \"Ghillie Suit\" mission, which tasks players with infiltrating enemy lines undetected, stands out as a prime example of the franchise's ability to deliver memorable and immersive gameplay experiences.\n\nHowever, it's the multiplayer component that truly elevates Modern Warfare 3 to legendary status. The game's robust multiplayer suite offers a wide range of modes, maps, and customization options that cater to both casual and competitive players. The addictive progression system, which rewards players with new weapons, attachments, and perks as they level up, keeps players invested and motivated to continuously improve their skills. The diverse map design ensures that every match offers a unique tactical challenge, from close-quarters combat to sprawling outdoor environments. Whether players are engaging in intense firefights, strategically coordinating with their team, or engaging in high-stakes one-on-one duels, Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer captures the essence of addictive and adrenaline-fueled online warfare.\n\nIn addition to the campaign and multiplayer, Modern Warfare 3 introduces the highly popular Spec Ops mode. This cooperative experience challenges players to complete a variety of mission objectives, from neutralizing enemies to defusing bombs, all while working together to achieve victory. Spec Ops provides a welcome change of pace from the main campaign and multiplayer modes, encouraging teamwork and strategic thinking in a distinct and enjoyable way.\n\nIn conclusion, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a triumphant culmination of the critically acclaimed Modern Warfare trilogy. Its gripping narrative, cinematic presentation, and addictive multiplayer combine to create an unforgettable gaming experience that pays homage to the intensity and spectacle of modern warfare. As a testament to the series' enduring legacy, Modern Warfare 3 stands as a shining example of what a first-person shooter can achieve when it combines expert craftsmanship with heart-pounding action.

Super immersive and really fun. What I hate, and this is ultimately the reason I have left a negative review, is two-fold; the mouse settings suck, and the achievements are DLC-locked (spoiler, you cannot 100% this game without buying all the DLC).\n\nFirstly, the mouse settings. Look up online at the amount of issues people have had trying to get their mouse to work on this game. I entirely understand that MW3 is an older title at this point, but that's not really a valid excuse when the game is still for sale. If you're expecting people to put money in your hand, you should at least be able to give them a working product they're paying you for - especially when you're still charging $60 for a game that came out over a decade ago (which is appalling)\n\nAnd secondly, the achievements. I'm a bit of an achievement hunter (I know, loser alert) so obviously my goal is to get 100% completion. When games purposefully create achievements that are hidden behind DLC's, that's a complete red-flag for me. I shouldn't have to give you money to 100% complete a game I own. It's partly Steam's fault for not giving developers a way to separate DLC achievements properly, but it's also a developer issue for simply taking advantage of that system.

You can tell that another studio took over development of the game. The story works well but doesn't hold up too well to scrutiny. Some character moments are huge leaps in logic. The product placement for some guns is very in-your-face. The balancing is hit-or-miss when it comes to guns. Still, it's a solid game with an exciting campaign, an addictive and fun survival mode, and a decent multiplayer (even if the MP isn't very active). It closes out the Modern Warfare trilogy on a high note.\n\nSet shortly after the events of Modern Warfare 2, Soap and Captain Price are on the run from Russian ultranationalists and disavowed by their own allies. While Russia continues to wage a misguided war of vengeance against the United States, Soap and Price work to covertly track the operations of Vladimir Makarov and uncover his plans to expand the scope of war beyond the USA. As varying protagonists, you'll sneak through the outskirts of African villages, get into street battles in the Czech Republic, and take on invading forces in New York. The scope of the game is huge, and it never fails to deliver summer blockbuster-style action sequences.\n\nYou already know how a Call of Duty campaign from this era plays, so no need to waste time. If you enjoy a two-weapon system, enemy guns with unique attachments, intel to track down, aggressive foes, and grenade markers, you'll like MW3's gameplay. The occasional stealth levels, vehicle segments, and aerial gunner scenarios help break up the monotony and keep the gameplay fresh. The number of unique locations also keep the environments from getting too scale. Despite there being more than a few city levels, they all have some distinct element to set them all apart - for example, there's a section where you sneak through the Paris Catacombs.\n\nThere's some good attention to detail in MW3's story levels. Most of them take place in highly populated areas, and as a result, you'll find civilians fleeing from gunfights or dead from the aftermath of a battle. MW3 doesn't shy away from showing how destructive the \"cool\" battles can get, or how innocent people can get caught up in warfare or acts of terror. Enemy weapons mostly make sense now, with Russian soldiers mostly using Russian-made guns instead of mostly NATO equipment (like in MW2). Not every protagonist makes it out alive, showing just how brutal and unforgiving modern war can be. Player characters are as vulnerable to bullets as any other soldier on the battlefield.\n\nThe way that World War 3 plays out in MW3 is fairly confusing, though. There are signs that Makarov is exploiting tensions to push Russia into a global war, but this flies in the face of the Russian President trying to arrange a ceasefire early on in the campaign. This gets muddled when Russia launches a full-scale invasion of Europe despite apparent efforts to sue for peace by its government. Did Makarov's associates take charge during the chaos? It's also weird how the game insists on inserting Makarov into every past event in the series. Having him be present during Zakhaev's near-death incident makes sense, but having him be the one to [spoiler]detonate the nuke in Shock and Awe[/spoiler] is a nonsensical choice.\n\nSurvival Mode is an absolute blast to play - it's arguably as fun as the classic CoD Zombies mode. The player gains experience and levels from fending off waves of increasingly well-equipped enemies. Between waves, you can purchase perks, guns, attachments, and air support options. Surviving for a long time requires careful planning, choosing a position to defend, setting traps, and picking the right moment to unleash bombing runs and drone strikes on enemies. What starts out as a cakewalk against lightly armed enemies becomes a frantic defense against dogs, suicide bombers, soldiers in riot armor, and juggernauts. It's addictive, rewarding, and absolutely worth playing.\n\nMultiplayer isn't very active due to the game being over a decade old. Still, if you liked MW2's multiplayer, MW3 will deliver more of the same. I'm not big into the CoD multiplayer experience, so this wasn't a selling point for me. I wanted the game for its campaign and survival mode, and those two were well worth the price of admission. I haven't tried out its Spec Ops mode, but that seems like it will also be a fun time.\n\nModern Warfare 3 is a solid entry to the Call of Duty series and a good game in its own right. However, its asking price is excessive. 40 USD is too much for a game that came out in 2011. I would wait for it to go on sale - 20 USD isn't perfect, but it's a much fairer deal than the game's regular price tag.", "timestamp_created": 1689199733, "timestamp_updated": 1689298045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141907158": {"recommendationid": "141907158", "author": {"steamid": "76561199388100180", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1700309495}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever, this also shows the situation of france rn so its hyper-realistic", "timestamp_created": 1689170838, "timestamp_updated": 1689170838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141870303": {"recommendationid": "141870303", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101399866", "num_games_owned": 930, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 991, "last_played": 1692193342}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn i love soap hope nothing happens to him.", "timestamp_created": 1689121304, "timestamp_updated": 1689121304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822900533676147461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141827650": {"recommendationid": "141827650", "author": {"steamid": "76561199206190690", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1695236332}, "language": "english", "review": "OG :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1689077492, "timestamp_updated": 1689077492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141819560": {"recommendationid": "141819560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183486727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1678816600}, "language": "english", "review": "Do NOT buy or play this game.

The game features a well-crafted campaign that is grounded and surprisingly emotional, with a certain character's death hitting especially hard. The storyline culminates in a peaceful moment with Captain Price, providing a sense of closure to the trilogy.\n\nHowever, the game does fall short in a few areas. Some of the missions, such as the opening in New York and the London terrorist attack, seem to go too far in trying to shock the audience. The reveal of the twist involving Makarov and Yuri's past partnership also feels a bit forced at times.\n\nDespite these flaws, the missions are generally enjoyable and varied, with some truly memorable moments. One of the standout missions is \"Blood Brothers,\" where the player controls Yuri as he helps Soap and Price track down Makarov. During the mission, it's revealed that Yuri was once a member of Makarov's inner circle, which adds an interesting twist to the story. However as I said before, the reveal of the twist does feel a bit forced and doesn't quite fit naturally into the narrative.\n\nAnother notable mission is \"Black Tuesday,\" where the player controls Delta Force operatives as they fight to retake Wall Street from Russian forces. The mission is intense and action-packed, with a great sense of urgency as the player races against the clock to reach their objectives. However, the mission also goes a bit far in trying to shock the audience, as it takes place in a modern American city and shows civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe mission structure isn't quite as tight as in previous games in the series, but there are still plenty of fun missions to enjoy. One of the most memorable missions is \"Mile High Club,\" where the player must fight their way through a hijacked airplane to rescue the Russian President. The mission is challenging but rewarding, and it's a great example of the game's well-crafted missions.\n\nThe game's Spec Ops mode is a fun distraction that is reminiscent of the Zombies mode from Treyarch's games or the Mercenaries mode from the Resident Evil series. However, the multiplayer is more of the same and, while good, may not appeal to everyone.\n\nIn summary, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a good game and a satisfying end to the Modern Warfare trilogy. While it has some flaws, particularly in the campaign's attempt to shock the audience, it's still a fun and action-packed experience that's worth playing.

the popular first-person shooter Modern Warfare 2. The game takes place immediately after the events of the previous title and continues the epic story of a global war against terrorism.\n\nThe campaign mode of the game is action-packed and thrilling, with intense set pieces and a gripping storyline. The graphics are also top-notch, with highly detailed environments and realistic character models.\n\nThe multiplayer mode, which is the main attraction of the game, is as addictive as ever. The addition of new weapons and perks keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. The old killstreak system has also been replaced with the Strike Packages,  which allow players to choose between Assault, Support, and Specialist pointstreaks. Each of these packages offers a different style of play and allows players to tailor their pointstreak rewards to their individual playstyle. However, the game suffers from some balance issues and glitches that can be frustrating at times. Additionally, I have some complaints about the lack of innovation in the game compared to previous titles in the series, as I feel that MW3 played it too safe and did not offer enough new content\n\nDespite these flaws, Modern Warfare 3 is a great addition to the series and is sure to satisfy fans of the franchise. With its solid campaign mode and addictive multiplayer, the game is a must-play for FPS enthusiasts.\n\nDue to the game's old age, I recommend picking it up on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1680025781, "timestamp_updated": 1680025781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135617797": {"recommendationid": "135617797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167299920", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1014, "last_played": 1685814886}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1680024479, "timestamp_updated": 1680024479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135613152": {"recommendationid": "135613152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394626001", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1680020652}, "language": "english", "review": "POKOK E JOSS NDESS...

respectable entry to finish off the original Modern Warfare series. This game has a pretty cool campaign, along with a still exciting multiplayer and some neat singleplayer/co-op modes.\n\nStarting off with the campaign, I won't go into much details because of spoilers, but the game still keeps hitting hard at a large scale war, along with some remarkable scenes from the series. You're mostly playing the campaign throughout 2 different characters, although you'll also have some missions with others. Overall, a pretty crazy plot with enough variety in environments and objectives to not feel too repetitive.\n\nMultiplayer is... Pretty neat, sadly you'll have to forget about DLCs since most players still kicking won't use them. Alternatively you could use external launchers (Such as Plutonum) if you really wanna go at it or play with mods.\nBeware that this is classic CoD, you're gonna be heading on against mostly veterans of the series who spent tons of hours in the game, so be ready for a hard one.\nAs for mechanics themselves, most weapons are fair, with the obvious 3 main choices every cod has, still you're able to go at it with pretty much anything since TTK is quite low with anything.\n\nYou'll be mostly playing the standard TDM mode since everything else is long dead, including community modes.\n\nAs for the co-op stuff, you've got a variety of survival maps (Probably the best the game has to offer compared to the rest of series since it's the only game that has it), along with a bunch of spec-ops. The latter could give you some mixed feelings. Some missions are quite cool, while others might be boring or not as enjoyable to some players.\n\nAll in all, the game is still classic CoD, fun, exciting, simple yet complicated enough to let you show off your skills while not feeling completely useless if you lack the experience. I can't recommend this game enough if you like arcade military FPS, though keep in mind the game has this \"super modern\" feel to it. You'll get what I mean after you throw a couple of hours into the game.\n\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. As good as it is, considering it's 12 years old, it definitely doesn't deserve the 40 bucks, wait for it to go on a sale or just check for 3rd party sellers. It's good, but that doesn't mean it should cost 70% what the newest cod costs.", "timestamp_created": 1678463902, "timestamp_updated": 1678463902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1,

The story picks up right where Modern Warfare 2 left off, and it's just as intense and action-packed as you'd expect. You play as various characters throughout the campaign, and each mission feels unique and challenging in its own way. The set pieces are absolutely jaw-dropping, and the graphics are some of the best I've seen in a first-person shooter. But the real standout here is the pacing. The campaign just flies by, and it's an absolute blast from start to finish.\n\nNow, let's talk about the multiplayer. This is where the game really shines. The maps are varied and interesting, and there's a ton of different game modes to choose from. But what really sets Modern Warfare 3 apart from the other Call of Duty games is the weapon customisation. You can tweak just about everything on your gun, from the sights to the muzzle attachments. It's a great way to make your play style your own, and it adds a ton of replayability to the game.\n\nAnd of course, we can't forget about Spec Ops. This is the co-op mode where you and a friend can take on various missions together. It's a lot of fun, and it's a great way to test your skills with a buddy.\n\nSo, what's the verdict? Well, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is definitely worth playing. It's got a great campaign, fantastic multiplayer, and tons of replayability. If you're a fan of the series, or if you just love first-person shooters in general, you should definitely check this one out.", "timestamp_created": 1677320403, "timestamp_updated": 1677320403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68454355001449585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133546493": {"recommendationid": "133546493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405231170", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 595, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1700775343}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ESTA BIEN NOMA\n", "timestamp_created": 1677294870, "timestamp_updated": 1677294870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133533362": {"recommendationid": "133533362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198896811730", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1697393307}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor call of duty para hacerte el milico con una itaka", "timestamp_created": 1677280561, "timestamp_updated": 1677280561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133532926": {"recommendationid": "133532926", "author": {"steamid": "76561199466195433", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2792, "last_played": 1691290852}, "language": "english", "review": "its a really good game to play!", "timestamp_created": 1677280137, "timestamp_updated": 1677280137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133485371": {"recommendationid": "133485371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259479007", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1447, "last_played": 1676395913}, "language": "english", "review": "Still one of the Best Call of Dutys i have ever Played, i would recommend this to everyone.

I have lots of good memories associated with this game. But nostalgia can't cover up the fact that this game is broken. As of 2023, MW3 is a mess. Multiplayer is broken and overrun with hackers, player data gets lost (including all medals, records, ranks etc.). I guess the campaign is still playable but even that is forgettable compared to MW1 or MW2's campaign. Too many scripted sequences, no memorable missions plus the \"twists\" don't feel as impactful.\n\nI still enjoy playing MW1 and MW2. This game, not so much.

Tl;dr: Veteran Campaign is a mixed bag that ties up most of what it needs to for the story, and is doable if you're reasonably persistent.  Might disappoint, though, if you're hot off of its predecessors.  Buy on sale IF you've crunched MW2.  \n\nFinally picked this up after years of other life stuff.  I mainly run the campaigns on Veteran, having burnt myself out on the multiplayer during my teens.  A competent, if slightly rushed, finish to the story of Modern Warfare Classic, with the major focus resting on the trilogy-long battle between Capt. Price and Imran Zakhaev, through Zakhaev's mad proxy: Vlad Makarov.  The rest of the story is an on-the-ground (mostly) perspective on this world's WW3, through the eyes of a Delta Force member; this part of the story is one of my gripes.\n\nYou will find plenty of eyecandy from the time period, and a decent amount of variety in how you dispatch your foes (I was especially impressed by one mission which sees you switching back-and-forth between an AC-130 and the soldiers it is protecting), so your pew-pew urge will likely be sated.  Most of the important characters who survived MW2 return, and they take the story seriously enough that the frequent in-battle cinematics didn't kill my immersion.  Some in-battle cinematics are also quite good for what the level has been building up to (IE the final leg of the SAS mission, which I wish there was more of.)\n\nThat being said, the newer characters are a bit harder to become attached to.  This might be due to the setting, but I feel this game pared back the scripts on your allies, reducing the number of moments where you feel like you're part of a team in order to keep the allies from rivaling the player (or maybe production just ran out of time?)  AI also feels a bit peeled back on the allied side, perhaps for the same reasons, which led to me getting shot many times by enemies who walked right past my teammates.  \n\nTo compound this, this campaign's respawn system doesn't feel as carefully designed as past entries.  Though not often, I did encounter a few mission sections where I would get killed, respawn in the open, and immediately get lasered, sometimes before the game would even give me back the controls to move.  I could see this being a table-flip moment for some people.\n\nMy last gripe, mentioned at the start, is the WW3 setting, itself.  Hot on the heels of MW2, which shows both the US (through Gen. Shepard's CIA agent) and Russia engaging in merciless, civilian-slaughtering warfare, MW3 shows the leaders of both sides being oddly amenable to the idea of peace.  Spoiler, the opening Act of this campaign shows the US thwarting Russia's invasion of its mainland, and with MW2's last mention of US troops being Rangers sitting in the ruins of the White House asking when they can burn down Moscow (regardless of how few of them even *know* of Russia blaming them for the infamous No Russian massacre), you'd expect there to be an enormous amount of dissent at the notion of peace.  The ghost of what could or should have been a horrific blood-feud between two scapegoat nations snared by the ambitions of a few vain men *does* appear, but only in the Russian military, which seems content to massacre the population of *other* NATO nations following a major act of terror by Makarov against those same countries.  While Infinity Ward may have had their reasons to avoid depicting the US retaliating with an invasion of Russia, it's disappointing to not see in more detail how a mutually destructive feud might've been turned on Makarov, with more countries being roped into the story than perhaps needed to be.", "timestamp_created": 1675483621, "timestamp_updated": 1675483621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132160374": {"recommendationid": "132160374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145130693", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 159, "last_played": 1531927649}, "language": "english", "review": "insane", "timestamp_created": 1675477219, "timestamp_updated": 1675477219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132145072": {"recommendationid": "132145072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198958135391", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 340, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1700425800}, "language": "english", "review": "Price to kozak totalny", "timestamp_created": 1675455859, "timestamp_updated": 1675536812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132141229": {"recommendationid": "132141229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198992677335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1675449230}, "language": "english", "review": "ez game", "timestamp_created": 1675451087, "timestamp_updated": 1675451087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132125404": {"recommendationid": "132125404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821175486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1196, "last_played": 1675432253}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greateast game ever", "timestamp_created": 1675432834, "timestamp_updated": 1675432834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132090258": {"recommendationid": "132090258", "author": {"steamid": "76561199102109198", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1429, "last_played": 1699484952}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] DO NOT PLAY MULTIPLAYER!

It is not a issue with the game but specifically infinity ward's lack of care. I was playing the game and I get into a lobby with a hacker and he starts rage aimbotting. I tell him \"turn off the hacks and face me like a real man\" but instead of honoring my request he opens adult content in my browser, I then proceed to leave the game out of shock. I just sit in the lobby while I close the tabs until the cheater himself joins my lobby and starts screaming slurs. Eventually he screams \"SAY SORRY OR YOUR ACCOUNT GETS SOLD\" which I replied with \"lmao what\" I then see a cmd popup (its important to the story) and a steam authenticator code (also imoortant) meaning he had the correct username and password. 5 DAYS LATER I get a notification saying that there was suspicious activity on my google account (which I was skeptical of). I then go to sleep and 4 hours later I wake up since I have a terrible sleep schedule. I see that new epic free game!11!1!!1. I then try to log into my account (which I was unable to do), I attempt to reset my password knowing I definetely got my email correct, I enter my email into the reset password field and it says my account does not exist, my heart starts racing thinking that my account was deleted since they have been doing that recently. I check my email to see if there was any support emails warning me but I found nothing. I see the suspicious activity email again and realised it was real and reset my emails password. I realised someone HAD to have accessed my email in order to sign into my account to delete it since I had email 2fa verification. Meaning someone had used my hacked email to access my epic games account. I freak out since I had about 3 years worth of free games on there (and borderlands 3). I instantly contacted support and within 5 minutes they sent me an email verification link, I respond saying I have just verified then the promptly send me a password reset email where I got my account back only to find \"the hackers name has pwned this account!\". I do a virus scan because I can and find a keylogger made its way onto my system. Coincidence? I think not! The exploit is real! DO NOT PLAY ONLINE. THIS IS A WARNING TO MAKE SURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE. IF YOU PLAY MULTIPLAYER YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING HACKED. ONLY BUY THIS FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND SPEC OPS AND DO NOT PLAY SPEC OPS ONLINE.The game is amazing but my experience with the game has made me give it a bad review. FIX YOUR GAME!

I got banned from plutonium for 34 days presumably because of the aimb0t dll.

historia, entretenida como el 2 , no la empece mucho, el online, hay hackers, pero mucho menos que en el 2 , pude jugar de dia como 10 partidas seguidas y tranquilo.\nLo que me encanto de este juego es el cooperativo, si bien no tendra tantas misiones spec ops como en el 2, tiene el modo supervivencia, que uff es hermoso, tiene muchas perks , skills y mecanicas de supervivencia que hacen a ese modo de juego muy interesante.

Meanwhile, America and Russia have continued fighting, and eventually the US military engages in a counterattack at New York City, spearheaded by a Delta Force team codenamed \"Metal,\" who successfully manage to get the Russian military to withdraw from the United States. Three months later, Russian President Boris Vorshevsky starts flying to Hamburg in order to take part in peace talks with the US. \n\nHowever, Vladimir Makarov and his Ultranationalist terrorist cell, the Inner Circle, end up ambushing the plane and killing most of Vorshevsky's cabinet and security detail. He ends up demanding that the Russian President relinquish the codes to Russia's nukes, threating his daughter, Alena, if he does not comply. At the same time, he obtains chemical bombs from SIerra Leone, has several attacks done on various NATO-affiliated military bases and capital cities with them, and ends up having the Russian military, now effectively under the control of this madman, invade Europe. With the world teetering on the edge of collapse, it is up to Team Metal, the Russian Loyalists, and the remnants of the now-disavowed Task Force 141 (including a Russian man named Yuri who has become dedicated to getting revenge on Makarov) to rescue the Russian President and his daughter, stop Makarov, and put an end to his reign of terror, once and for all. \n\nWhile the gameplay is largely unchanged from Modern Warfare 2, and quite a few setpieces from the previous two games in this trilogy are re-used, I don't mind it all that much, considering the core gameplay formula is that solid! Guns still feel incredibly solid to use. As always, the voice acting and the soundtrack is great. The plot is very over-the-top, as you would expect. While it goes for a more standard \"America f*ck yeah, we're saving the day\" tone, the anti-jingoistic attitude from the first two games is still retained. If anything, this game really hammers in the civilian cost of war to show that war is a very awful thing for people to experience, not to mention that part of the crux of the plot is that moderates in both the Russian and the American governments have grown tired of the fighting. \n\nAll in all, this is a very gripping and satisfying conclusion to the original Modern Warfare trilogy, one that I highly recommend playing yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1672359372, "timestamp_updated": 1672419121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129645618": {"recommendationid": "129645618", "author": {"steamid": "76561199350053672", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1672341319}, "language": "spanish", "review": "comprenlo en oferta \nPUTA OBRA MAESTRA EN HISTORIA", "timestamp_created": 1672357965, "timestamp_updated": 1672357965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129638438": {"recommendationid": "129638438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272341448", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1691098871}, "language": "english", "review": "survival is just as fun as i remembered it being, feels so clean and fluid on pc with some game filters to brighten up the graphics. would recommend getting on sale if you have a friend to play with", "timestamp_created": 1672350999, "timestamp_updated": 1672350999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39682537317276001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129628569": {"recommendationid": "129628569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357982634", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1666820352}, "language": "english", "review": "Qte :)", "timestamp_created": 1672342346, "timestamp_updated": 1672342346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129623712": {"recommendationid": "129623712", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983568844", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1699495119}, "language": "english", "review": "Why do all these games have to be set in the dark?\n\nI know a lot of actual combat takes place in the dark... but this isn't ACTUAL combat.. it's a GAME... one that I  thought I'd actually be able to SEE... you aren't creating a spec op training platform...

it's over a decade old and the base multiplayer is completely empty, but when it's on sale it's worth buying, especially if you already own the first two entries in the original Modern Warfare series. The campaign is excellent, offering a satisfying and thrilling conclusion to the Modern Warfare story as well as some of the best level design seen in a Call of Duty game.

that. This one is just more straightforward and finishes the story in a pretty satisfying ending. There is not a lot of turns in the story, it pretty much goes forward all the time, but has little turnovers here and there. IDK, maybe cuz the writing is more down-to-earth, but out of the trilogy, it's kinda the best one for me in terms of the story.\n2) Missions are epic - just like MW2 there are some missions and moments that are just epic and stick in your memory for so long\n3) WW3 in Europe - when I was a kid I always liked the spec ops type of mission and hated the war mission.

MW3, after all these years i can still say i really, really love you.\n\nCAMPAIGN is fine, it's enjoyable, however it's a pretty big stepdown from MW2, the American side lacks the charisma of MW2, and while the 141 side is fun i would say the characters lack the charm they had in the previous game.\nThe levels are also pretty hit or miss, i would say they aren't as memorable as MW2, but they still pack a good punch.\nOverall a decent campaign and a fitting end to the storyline.\n\nMULTIPLAYER was good, i really became addicted to it back in the day, and i said \"was\" because it's completely dead on PC, unless you really like Crouch only servers. If you really wanna experience it play it on PS3 or 360, 360 is far more populated than PS3 from my experience. (also Wii is somehow still alive in 2022)\n\nSPEC OPS, wooo, that's the good stuff. probably the mode i spent the most hours on, not only you get missions like MW2 but also my favourite and most forgotten mode of the series, Survival. it's a pure blast, specially with a friend, and it's much, much better than zombies, you also get 16 maps as opposed to 1 map in other games.\n\nNow as for DLC, i bought it because i wanted all the maps in survival which i would say it's worth it, not at full price obviously, but if you like Spec ops missions and survival i would say go for it. (specially final assault since it has the best maps for that mode)\nChaos is also fun however it's only 4 maps, but it's still pretty damm fun.\n\nI would most definetly recommend this game, not at full price (seriously 40\u20ac for a 2011 game?) i would say go for it if you find it for 10-15\u20ac, and DLC for 5-6\u20ac each aprox.)", "timestamp_created": 1662938211, "timestamp_updated":

It was actually then that I told my parents that if they wanted to give me something for my birthday, which was coming up in two weeks or so, that game would be it. I was absolutely mesmerized at the time\u2014as I am still now\u2013so you couldn\u2019t convince me to want a unicorn, a million dollars, or anything else that wasn\u2019t this game.\nAs a kid, I was used to playing videogames on ps2, Gamecube, N64, all kinds of handhelds, etc., so when my birthday came up and my parents had actually gifted me my very first \"modern\" console, being the Xbox360, you can imagine how excited I was. To top it off, this very game was taped right on my new Xbox; I can literally still smell the fresh plastic that was wrapping the game. This game marked a huge stepping point in my gaming timeline; a step I would remember and cherish for the years to come.\nMW3 was the first CoD that I owned that had an active multiplayer, because as much as I played on the predecessors of Xbox360 and ps3, the servers on these older consoles weren't exactly appealing or simple to use\u2014and therefore, enjoy. Back then also MW2 was the main vibe and every one of my friends were playing it, but my parents refused to let me have a console because they had the old-school mentality that videogames were bad for you and whatnot. So again, my birthday came up, and what had been an allusion for many years became a reality\u2014I was finally able to be part of the cool kids! \nWhen my best friend found out I got an Xbox 360 with this game, he was as excited as I was because he claimed he didn't have anyone to play with before and now he would. At the time, I was overwhelmingly happy to get a console, plus I was used to playing by myself, so I didn't really think much of this.  \nWe played every. single. day. \u2013 literally. As soon as we got out of school, he or I would text the other and we would get online and play. We sorta became CoD freaks. Sometimes I would go to his house and we would split-screen a few rounds of Zombies. He was really good; like, he was the kind of kid to achieve prestige within freaking hours of getting the game. It is needless to state that he was always carrying me\u2026 \nI was already in love with the CoD franchise because I really enjoyed playing war games, so when I was able to enter the multiplayer world, with my best friend, it was mind-blowing, to say the least. I continued playing with him all throughout high school, up until we graduated in 2014 and we each went to our respective colleges. As college students, we didn\u2019t play as frequently\u2013for obvious reasons\u2013but we would still play at least once a week, if we were able to. I stayed home for college, but he went out-of-state, so gaming became even more meaningful for us because we were not seeing each other physically anymore. \nMy best friend had a heart condition, and in 2017, he had to undergo surgery; it was something he had to do every few months, so he was practically used to it. The surgery went well, and after it was done, it was procedural to just wait for him to wake up from the anesthesia. \nThe morning following the surgery, at precisely 5:08am, I was woken up by a text from my best friend\u2019s sister letting me know he had passed away. I remember I didn\u2019t reply, and I simply got out of bed to go to work. I was completely and utterly numb, feeling nothing, absolutely nothing. I remember I didn\u2019t cry at all that day; not a single tear. I carried on with my day, as if nothing had happened. \nIt didn\u2019t hit me until I had to tell my parents, who were out of town at the time. I called them the following morning, and I told them. As soon as I said, \"He's gone, mom,\" I could hear my dad rapidly pulling over, and I could sense my mom was starting to cry. She was stunned, literally, too stunned to speak. And all that follows you can already imagine. \nWhen I was walking away from that stage after getting my high school diploma, I never expected I would have to say goodbye to my best friend forever just three years after. Months before, we had literally just celebrated that he turned 21 and we were joking as we were envisioning what else awaited our futures\u2013if only we had known. \nI stopped playing MW3 after that, and pretty much all of the CoD multiplayers. Not because I was undergoing a sort of denial, but rather because life kept going on and my gaming interests had to be placed aside a little\u2013I was, after all, still a college student. \nAnd yes, as I had foreseen, life carried on. I sold most of my consoles as time went by because I got tired of carrying them everywhere and all. The Xbox360 servers eventually shut down, and I got rid of all my games, but my console is still with me, although it honestly just serves as a memento. Eventually I entered the world of pc gaming, and all consoles were pretty much obsolete for me. As I finished college, I started playing the more mainstream games, such as Fortnite, Rocket League, and of course, CoD. I never quite got around to appreciating Warzone because of many things I won\u2019t describe here, but I know he would\u2019ve loved it, and I know that just as he was alongside me with MW3, we would have been ceaselessly making people rage in Warzone\u2014or at least he would\u2019ve. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m indifferent towards the game, and for that bias, I apologize. \nWhat I won\u2019t apologize for is writing this \u201creview.\u201d What do you want me to say? I have already stated how amazing this game is without having to address it in the remotest of chances. This game gave me countless of memories alongside my best friend, and while I may never again find another person to share these kinds of memories the same way I did with him, my gratitude remains with CoD for giving us so, so, SO much. This game was, and is, perfect. I don\u2019t care what gamers say about MW2 being the best one, in my eyes they\u2019re wrong\u2013this is it, this is the best CoD has given us. \nSo thank you for \u201cInfected,\u201d for allowing us to get back at Makarov, and for adding the Terminal map as we expected back when it was still cool. Again, there are no additions, no corrections, no changes I would make. This was it, Activision\u2013this was your peak. Thank you. \nI realized two days ago that CoD games were on Steam, and to make it even better, they were discounted; so, naturally, I obliged, bought them all, and started making my way through this campaign first. And just as I was thrilled back then, I am still now, despite of the fact that a huge piece of my initial experience is missing. \nSo if you\u2019re thinking of buying this game, stop\u2013just do it already. I can\u2019t assure it will give you as much as it has given me, but I have a feeling you\u2019re going to love it perhaps as much as I do. Least you can do is try. \n\nThis is dedicated to all those players that have gone \u2018offline\u2019 forever. Your status will always remain \u2018online\u2019 in our hearts.\n\nIn memory of my best friend\u2014rest in peace, Dante.", "timestamp_created": 1661755566, "timestamp_updated": 1661755566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861653268337249756", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121409644": {"recommendationid": "121409644", "author": {"steamid": "76561199193848820", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1700310513}, "language": "english", "review": "The mouse skipping bug is really annoying.

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Now this cod goes right beside MW2 as the best single player experience (at least so far in my re-runs). The game has a bunch of callbacks to the first and second instalment as well as it keeps the same core mechanics from MW2 which feels amazing. This game is also even easier than mw2 as there was only one spot where i died 3 or more times. This was really refreshing coming off of my horrible veteran experience with black ops 1 (BO1 wasn't a fun, hard, challenge but a game that did not feel tested for veteran). The story here was excellent and it actually made me excited to play the reboot of the modern warfare series (i have not played them yet). Great series, best line up of characters ever, Would recommend if on sale to experience the campaign and spec ops with a buddy.\n\nTips:\n- Game is very easy, kill enemies before moving up, there is NEVER infinite enemies :)\n- Stay on left sides for open encounters and move up along the walls for team to move up (after clearing as many enemies as possible)\n- Do not panic on timed sections, its not tight at all. I learned this and went very slow and i never fell below 50 seconds left while playing it safe. If fast you could have upwards to 2 minutes left on sections.\n- Use predators or airstrikes whenever available, easy w\n\nThoughts:\n- Game was so easy there was not one level that stuck out enough for me to give specific tips like usual.\n- Makarov is a goated villain\n- Love Price, hope they didnt ruin him in the new instalment.\n- What Happened to Frost?\n- Sandman better come back in the rebooted MW3 down the line, likely since ghost is back for the new MW2\n- What kind of name is Soap?\n\nNot excited to go back to BO2 after my BO1 experience. I have thousands of hours in BO2 multiplayer from the xbox 360 days but im worries since i did not enjoy the BO1 campaign re-playthrough. \n\nModern Warfare series > Black ops series (mid-high difficulty in terms of quality)", "timestamp_created": 1661128082, "timestamp_updated": 1661128082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581409573554992676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121019016": {"recommendationid": "121019016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148553751", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1700263479}, "language": "english", "review": "fav cod campaign", "timestamp_created": 1661116308, "timestamp_updated": 1661116308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121016008": {"recommendationid": "121016008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381543611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1669040298}, "language": "english", "review": "Great ending to a beautiful storyline.

Price and Soap. This 3rd entry was criticized upon release date for not innovating and giving us more of the same, and that's true but MW3 is an immensely satisfying shooter with epic firefights that feels like an adrenaline rush every time you go through the campaign.\n\nThere are some dramatic moments that lost their bite or effect on us given the recycling of resources and scenes. Every bombastic piece that is new, is yet somehow familiar as they all feel the same as previous MW entries. Despite this recycling, the campaign is still a blast to play and the gameplay experience is still satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1660624619, "timestamp_updated": 1660624619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120705766": {"recommendationid": "120705766", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092281515", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1444, "last_played": 1694873634}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: This review is coming from someone who played the singleplayer only and not the multiplayer since this game doesn't have many people playing left.\n\nCod MW3 is the third and final installment in the original MW storyline. Its campaign is just as good the previous installments and its Survival mode makes it much more replayable. Even if its graphics have aged with time its gameplay is just as good as triple a shooters these days.  \n\nGraphics (7/10) The game's graphics are pretty dated so if you're all about graphics you won't like this. Personally I think the old and dirty aesthetic of the graphics helps compliment the game's dark depiction of war and terrorism. It also helps make the game easier to run for lower end pcs.\n\nGameplay (8/10) The gameplay is still satisfying and the game gives a large amount of weapons and gadgets to mess around with. Though it does feel very similar to Cod MW2 since its arsenal is mostly the same. Enemies aren't too easy or hard as they will take cover and take turns shooting but they don't have laser accuracy and are balanced. The veteran mode of the campaign also doesn't feel too hard or easy which is good if you're not a dorito snorting tryhard. \n\nSurvival Mode (10/10) The newly introduced Survival mode for MW3 is absolutely awesome and this feature alone makes the game worth it. Surviving endless waves of enemies in huge maps with lots of weapons and assets to choose from. The enemy will swarm you from every direction and the maps have lots of space making sure that every area has at least 3 routes. The weapons and killstreaks from the multiplayer return here. You can even get friendly ai to fight alongside you. The only problem I have with the ai is they follow you no matter what which can be annoying if you setup defenses then run across the map to buy ammo but they follow you out. It would have also been cool if allies were accurate with the setting like PMC soldiers for Sierra Leone maps. It would also be great if Overlord wasn't the only announcer for this mode. I like the enemies getting tougher with every wave its not too easy or too hard to handle as they get better weapons, body armor, tactics and equipment like dogs, juggernauts and claymore experts to balance your power. The map selection is very diverse from the streets of Paris to the Slums of Sierra Leone to the Mountains of Siberia and classic multiplayer maps like Terminal. The insane maps also help ramp up the difficulty if you thought it was too easy by throwing ground troops, juggernauts and helicopters at you all at once and I love it. Don't forget you can bring a friend with you in survival! You guys will kill together, spam flashbangs on juggernauts together and die together; a good game to play with your bestie.\n\nSpec Ops (10/10) Spec Ops also returns better then ever with new diverse missions. My personal favorite is one where you play as Makarov's goons on the president's plane opposite of where you start in the campaign's mission. This mode is a good way to challenge yourself or want just a quick burst of action. Just like with survival you can bring a friend with you here. Though some of the mission specifically require you to have a friend (if only all my friend's weren't broke as fuck) The dlc missions are especially fun as they introduce some characters that got barely any screentime like Baseplate (Macmillan).\n\nStory (9/10) The story is a very good finale to the MW trilogy as it ties up all loose ends and ends the war. The way information is presented during the mission briefings are quite satisfying. I like the diversity in world settings from New York to Germany to Somalia. I think this game's story is very underrated especially with Delta Force since they don't get as much recognition unlike the Army Rangers from MW2. Delta team in this game is one of my favorite factions in any video game especially because their announcer's voice (Overlord) is so satisfying to hear. Many people tend to overlook all the missions in this game but each one is memorable and distinct. You can really tell the people who made this game made it with love. The only complaint I have for the campaign is the Michael Bay level amount of explosions and repitition of previous mechanics (AC 130 mission, 50 cal sniper mission and machine gun turret section). I'm fine with explosion going of around you as you run but I hate it when the screen is constantly shaking it hurts my head and I get dizzy after only a while of playing.\n\nMultiplayer (?/10) I'm giving this one a question mark because I haven't been able to play it. If you're buying this game for its multiplayer I regret to inform you that not many people play this game anymore. More or less than 500 play this game these days so the chance of finding a public lobby is slim. I couldn't even find a single lobby (maybe cause my internet is crap). I also heard even if you do get a lobby its filled with hackers. Though if you have a friend you could just play face off 1v1 which could be some fun. One thing I do like about the multiplayer is it has different factions unlike the newer cod games with boring team names like \"my team\" and \"enemy team\". I also like the different announcers and themes it really makes each faction feel unique and have different goals and personality. I love hearing the GIGN announcer say \"servitas vitae\". If only the newer cod games like Vanguard were like this and not just the same generic dude for every team who sounds like he's trying to mimic the Halo announcer's charm. Call of Duty when this came out had a soul it wasn't just a lifeless money printer when the devs realized that people will just buy their products even if they sucked. Sad I wasn't able to play this game back in its day but at least I get a glimpse of its awesomeness.  \n\nMap Design (10/10) All of the maps in MW3 are unique, memorable and spacious. I like how big the maps are and their variance of areas like tight corridors, wide open areas, high ground advantages and flanks. This is especially noticeable in Survival as it opens the possibilities to hundreds of spots to hold out, defend or retreat to. The maps are designed so that almost all areas have at least one escape route in case you need to fall back. The vanilla maps are quite gritty, dark and mostly take place in abandoned towns and city skirmishes. I personally really like the city maps as you can hear the ambience of distant gunfire, sirens in the distance and miniguns filling the air with tracer rounds. The dlc maps however are more colorful since they seem to take place in more exotic areas like Central Park in NYC and a seaside retreat somewhere in Italy. \n\nMusic (10/10) Love the music of this game from the frantic music as you run to the rock and roll music as you mow down enemies running from cover. The music in stealth portions also help the gritty tone of the missions as you witness people getting executed or enemies shooting innocent civvies. The menu musics are also bangers as they sound quite intense, bombastic and terrifying hyping you up to play. The spawn themes in the multiplayer are awesome especially since each faction has a different spawn, victory and defeat theme. The rank up guitar riff is satisfying as expected and the challenge complete jingle is also really cool(no idea how they made it but props to the sound designers).\n\nBugs? I did not encounter any bugs playing in campaign and spec ops.\n\nPc requirements? If your potato pc can't handle it just turn down the texture quality and it should run smoothly. \n\nPrice? Wait for it to go on sale. Yes this game is good but 16 dollars? that's not worth it. Also the dlc of this game is pretty overpriced considering it only adds a few maps(though they look beautiful.\n\nConclusion: I give this game a definitive 10/10 lots of replayability and fun. Now I only need to get one of my friend's to purchase this game when it's on sale so we can bro down and go down in survival mode", "timestamp_created": 1660614982, "timestamp_updated": 1662293380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690759897232055664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120700642": {"recommendationid": "120700642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198861804864", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1143, "last_played": 1689856245}, "language": "english", "review": "fun spec ops survival", "timestamp_created": 1660606176, "timestamp_updated": 1689411904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120684299": {"recommendationid": "120684299", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094435798", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 425, "last_played": 1689545992}, "language": "english", "review": "A great acting\nA great Shooting\nA great voiceover\n\nAbsolutely one of a kind", "timestamp_created": 1660584457, "timestamp_updated": 1660584457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120654757": {"recommendationid": "120654757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141146609", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1668637934}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing the game for 100hrs now ( And with 2.5 KD) and with only 500 games played Here's my scuffed review:\n\n(Reminder: I haven't played other COD games AND and never once purchased DLCS for this game)\nI have been playing this game for 2 months now, And I like this game over any COD game (Which I have been playing on and off for 3 years). Mainly because of the introduction of 3 paths with 5th tier upgrades. It gives me more chances to try different strategies, and with the changes in sending soldiers you need to \"adapt\" on how you can gain eco.\n\n-> Pros and Cons for me\nPros:\n- More cross paths\n- Addition of soldiers\n- Multiple ways to gain alternative eco\n- Soldiers of towers is more apparent (IMO)\n- Addition of 5th Tier towers for late game\n- No energy is needed for power-ups\n- Less reliant on power-ups\nCons:\n- How grindy to gain exp (But still less grindy than leveling/getting new powers up for MW2)\n- Unbalanced towers (In the current Meta) I.e: Farms, bombs, Mortar, Ace, etc.\n- Less/fun game modes\n- No sandbox\n- Terrible servers\n- Laggy/FPS problems when it is in the late game\n- Higher ranked matches heavily relies on meta towers therefore less variety of gameplay. I like that there is meta every season it gives the season more charm when you look back, Like oh that's the season where Xyz towers are everywhere in each strategy. But when there are only like 5 strategies when there are 24 towers in the game and 12 heroes it kind of sucks (if my math is correct, 12 heroes x 24 towers on the first slot x 23 towers on the second x 22 towers on the third slot there will be 145728 possible ways of combining the towers) not mentioning the 3 cross paths available for each tower\n\nBut overall I still enjoy the game and using non-meta strategies to beat meta and using meta against meta is fun But using meta against non-meta is not fun. So my MAIN problem is unbalanced towers, server issues, FPS Drops, a little bit of grinding exp and that's it. The game modes currently is not the main problem, the need to fix the game first before adding new game modes, Because I know more game modes will come.\n\nOverall 7/10 If you like MW and other COD games at least try this game once.", "timestamp_created": 1660537909, "timestamp_updated": 1660537909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493421077728271484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120652767": {"recommendationid": "120652767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024939048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3979, "last_played": 1660534390}, "language": "english", "review": "Immersive", "timestamp_created": 1660534342, "timestamp_updated": 1660534342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120647127": {"recommendationid": "120647127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113845516", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1660534025}, "language": "english", "review": "Great end to the Modern Warfare era", "timestamp_created": 1660524869, "timestamp_updated": 1660524869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120643179": {"recommendationid": "120643179", "author": {"steamid": "76561199195913041", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1663305558}, "language": "english", "review": "cum", "timestamp_created": 1660518499, "timestamp_updated": 1660518499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 13353, "total_negative": 1946, "total_reviews": 15299}, "cursors": {"AoJ4q7Cnz4IDe+abzAM=": "Thu Nov 23 22:38:11 2023"}}
