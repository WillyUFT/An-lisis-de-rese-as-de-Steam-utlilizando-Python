undisputed classic from the Xbox 360 era. This game, a beacon of excellence in the superhero gaming landscape, seamlessly combines a gripping narrative with innovative gameplay that redefined what it meant to be the Dark Knight.\n\nFrom the moment you step into the menacing halls of Arkham Asylum, the game immerses you in a dark and atmospheric world. The narrative, steeped in Batman lore, unfolds with cinematic flair, introducing iconic characters and unraveling a story that captures the essence of the Caped Crusader.\n\nThe gameplay is a masterclass in superhero mechanics. The fluid combat, intuitive detective work, and strategic stealth elements create a dynamic experience that mirrors the versatility of Batman himself. Arkham Asylum's success in this regard set a new standard for superhero games, influencing the genre for years to come.\n\nWhile my PC experience was unfortunately marred by crashes, the memories from the Xbox 360 days are filled with admiration for the impeccable design, the engaging puzzles, and the stellar voice acting that brought the characters to life.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to experience Batman: Arkham Asylum on PC without technical hurdles, I envy the journey that awaits.

"review": "This is a fantastic game.\n\nEverything from the visuals to the audio to the dialogue are all excellent. The performances of the two leads are fantastic, the story and ambiance are very good, and perhaps most notably, the combat system is a lot of fun.\n\nThis game is right up there with the original Gears of War and Resident Evil 4 as one of the most innovative games of the 2000s. It introduces so many clever gameplay mechanics, the combat has depth to it (later emulated in the excellent Sleeping Dogs), and it's just a fun game. The use of gadgets is also pretty fun, although there are so many of them, and some I never used.\n\nYou can see just how much effort went into every aspect of Arkham Asylum, with the art design and even with all the character bios and audio tapes. It's just a really impressive game. And the Riddler secrets are actually fun enough that I went through and collected all 240 of them.\n\nI also appreciate the game's length. You can probably power through the story in 12 hours, but it's realistically a 15-20 hour game for most people, which is a good length for this. It doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThe one major criticism I have is the level design. It looks beautiful (especially for a 14 year old game), but some of the levels are mazes that can be a real pain to traverse, especially after you've finished the story and are going back for the Riddler secrets. Finding all the sealed doors and remembering all the alternate paths to get around the Caves and the Medical Facility can be a real annoyance.\n\nAlso, while I enjoy the Detective Mode mechanic, sometimes I felt the game wanted you to use it too much, which caused a FOMO because it masks the game's excellent visuals and art design.\n\nAll in all, this game is a classic. I'm giving it a 90%, but I would have given it a 95% if it had not been for the maze-like level design.\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1700211528, "timestamp_updated": 1700211528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150266044": {"recommendationid": "150266044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005217111", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 361, "playtime_at_review": 2430, "last_played": 1699710944}, "language": "english", "review": "I just recently played and beat this game.

game the visuals will make you feel like this is not a game that was released over a decade ago with no bugs whatsoever.\n\nThe gameplay is not like MKX or Injustice where you have to learn the combos but instead you fight with the option to evade,counter and stun which is a lot easy than learning which buttons to mash to get the fight going on brutally.\n\nThe length of the game is around 21 hours(on normal whch does not feel like a challenge) if you also collect the riddles left by the riddler side by side.I did just that and my total game progress is 82% and I have collected more than 70% of the riddles.\n\nOverall the game play is pretty straight forward and you will hardly find yourself stuck in a pickle.\n\nIf people reading this review are wondering whether their PC is compatible then do not worry,any PC under Rs 40k will suffice. \n\nNOTE-If you do not have a nvidia graphic card then keep the NVIDIA STEREOSCOPIC 3D option off because it will lead to performance issues if turned on\n\nSpecs-\nCPU:Intel core i3 115g4\nGraphics:Intel UHD graphics(Which is a integrated graphic card for people new to the gaming community)\nRAM:8GB\nStorage type:SSD\n\n",

I had it on XBox 360 and started it a few times before life got in the way and I didn't get to finish it. Last time I tried, I got most of the way through, then got stuck and took a break. When I came back, my save file had been deleted... I couldn't bring myself to start it all over again. \n\nBut having switched to PC and wanting to finally play Arkham Knight, I purchased it here. And now I've finally finished the game. It's so great. The combat is less refined here than it would be in City, and from what I've heard and seen, Knight as well, but it's still incredibly satisfying to beat up some goons or to pick them off one by one from the shadows. There's also a really smooth progression in terms of the complexity of the gameplay, as new gadgets are added, allowing access to new areas and new combinations of moves; and new variables such as snipers and the roaming lunatics keep you on your toes and force you to adapt your play style.\n\nThe story is very simple, but it's excellent. Joker gets himself captured by Batman on purpose, and then takes over Arkham Asylum - he also plans to poison Gotham with the Titan formula to create an army. It's a well-paced story that kept me wanting to know what happened next, meaning I found the game quite hard to put down.\n\nThe only things I would knock in this game is that it's rather easy, and the ending is a tad anticlimactic. The boss fights are big set pieces in terms of presentation, but the bosses are not too hard to beat. I died once or twice on each one, but didn't struggle too much. Other parts of the game are also fairly easy. I didn't play on hard, mind you. I'll probably do that next. And the Titan Joker fight which ends the game is an example of a fairly easy fight.

These films captured my imagination as they didn\u2019t require a considerable suspension of disbelief to immerse yourself; Bruce Wayne, and all his enemies, live inside vulnerable human bodies which are easily beaten and broken. They are supplemented often by high-tech gadgetry, but these are built from supposed military designs and follows, at least on the surface, known scientific concepts. For example: The Dark Knight shows Batman\u2019s night-vision developed from sonar technology, indicating that his only real power is his wealth.\n\nSuch realism helps us view the human stories behind Batman and his enemies. Batman and Joker are reflections of each other: both faced historical traumas but instead chose two different paths in life, yet both operate above the law and with a dictatorial authority. There\u2019s a sense that these characters could feasibly exist in our world, and perhaps show a reflection of two extremes that either of us could fall into. Whereas characters like Thor and Dr. Strange transcend reality and time at a whim, highlighting and boasting the fact that, at least biologically, they are nothing like us, the viewer.\n\nThat\u2019s why it took a few hours for Arkham Asylum to really win me over. In this game, Batman\u2019s spandex clings for dear life against the absolutely ripped body of Bruce Wayne, and the Joker morphs into several inhuman entities which stretch far beyond the realms of realism that attached me so closely to the cinematic series. One of the villains first introduced is a giant animated Crocodile, which immediately broke my immersion despite the game\u2019s incredibly detailed graphics.\n\nHowever, after taking a conscious effort to drop my traditional thoughts of what Batman is, I started to find enjoyment in Arkham Asylum\u2019s world. Despite Batman\u2019s voice actor lacking the gruff aggression and edginess of Christian Bale, Ben Affleck and Robert Pattison, Mark Hamill does give a genuinely funny and energetic performance as The Joker. The best voice acting comes from the audiotapes scattered across Arkham, which record psychological evaluations of Batman\u2019s various villains as they\u2019re posed questions of simple ethics and world views. \n\nBatman uses Metroidvania-esque exploration which encourages you to revisit areas to unlock additional paths once you obtain the corresponding skill. For example: half way through Arkham you obtain a hacking device to blow out control boxes, opening up previously locked doors, as well as a zipline to traverse long gaps. What makes exploration so compelling is the tangible feeling of progression, as you obtain new ability, combined with the comfort of backtracking to previous locations. Most areas won\u2019t take longer than 5 minutes to travel to, and will reveal trophies and audiotapes to further reveal backstory, all of which are genuinely interesting, including stories of Arkham\u2019s warden and the events which shaped his life.\n\nThe game\u2019s stealth system, on paper, feels the most \u201cBatman\u201d of all encounters as you pick off enemies one by one from the shadows. These sections are fairly difficult as armed enemies clump together, particular when they notice their fallen comrade hanging from a stone gargoyle or unconscious near a control panel. Some elements feel underbaked: for example, the inability to drag bodies into the shadows feels like a clear omission which causes enemies to go onto high alert with little you can do about it. \n\nThe games hand-to-hand system feels too rudimentary to be fun. Most fistfights consist of button mashing with very few combos to learn, a somewhat unreliable counter attack system, and no real opportunity to think creatively or adjust your approach. There were additional combat rooms to complete at the end of the game, which is the only piece of content I didn\u2019t feel compelled to complete. \n\nOverall though, Batman: Arkham Asylum faithfully taps into a wealth of comic book source material to deliver a satisfying Metroidvania explore-a-thon served with a rather mundane combat system. If, like me, your perception of Batman is shaped by recent onscreen outings, try view this as an alternative take on the series and play through with an open mind. There\u2019s plenty to explore, and it provides a great introduction to the wider Batman universe.", "timestamp_created": 1699723027, "timestamp_updated": 1699724082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

I didn't like the achievements. I found them annoying rather than challenging. I hated that I had to constantly go back to areas to find Riddler trophies and interview tapes. I also really HATED the boss battle with Poison Ivy. Overall I think the vast majority of people are going to love this game, for me I found it to be middle of the road and it felt like I was always doing busy work with it. I'd give it a 7/10 overall and not something that I'll ever play again after I 100% it.", "timestamp_created": 1699499812, "timestamp_updated": 1699499812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149790055": {"recommendationid": "149790055", "author": {"steamid": "76561199099378799", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 822, "last_played": 1699318532}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la verdad muy buen juego,me gusto todo 9.5/10\nhistoria:10/10\ngraficos:9/10 por la \u00e9poca es pasable\nia: 8.5/10 podr\u00eda haber estado mejor para las tecnolog\u00edas de la \u00e9poca\ngameplay: 9.5/10\nsinceramente este juego lo disfrute,sent\u00ed que volv\u00eda a la \u00e9poca de los 2000.\nuna de las mejores sagas de juegos basados en superheroes, un juego que realmente revoluciono la industria de los v\u00eddeo juegos por aquel estoces,si tiene la oportunidad de jugarlo componerlo no los va a defraudar, REALMENTE \u00c9PICO", "timestamp_created": 1699496466, "timestamp_updated": 1699496466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149789776": {"recommendationid": "149789776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041802310", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 914, "last_played": 1699495779}, "language": "english", "review": "Still the golden standard for superhero games 14 years later, including the Spider-man games, and this game's own sequels.

Enemy AI progressively gets smarter and slightly sporadic as you dismantle the stealth puzzlebox, so they'll start moving in pairs, dart their vision backwards, and even start checking grates/vents. There's just so much to love in this game -- and UGH I almost forgot to mention the backtracking dopamine just hits the right metroidvania cog in my ape brain.\n\nI loved my time in Asylum, and I can't wait to play Arkham City next!

Obviously, this was first in line and did not disappoint in the slightest. The concept was so cool, typically you see inmates breaking out of Arkham so being trapped on the island with the villains for a change was super cool. The music was dope, the atmosphere was tense and it was an awesome experience to play. The gameplay was fairly simple, not too hard or complicated (though I really need to learn to counter better). I will say, playing on Normal mode, the bosses started out really good but I think they got continuously repetitive which kinda became a drag, especially later on with some particular bosses. I'm just starting my second playthrough on hard so if that changes with the mode I'll write that here, but overall the bosses were pretty tough which was nice. However*********SPOILER*********the final boss is very underwhelming compared to bosses played previously. It was almost pathetically easy how quickly the final battle came and went compared to how many times I died trying to beat other bosses********END SPOILER*********\n\nIn the end, this was a fairly

Now, the combat absolutely redefined the genre, a lot of games have copied this type of combat, but its not entirely polished, the combat is kind of junky, it sometimes works sometimes doesn\u2019t, with this said, this DOES NOT affect the story or campaign whatsoever, but it turned out to be sometimes frustrating in challenge maps, from what I experienced the game often ruins your combo even after taking down every enemy, and it has a clunky feel to it.\nWith all this said BUY THE GAME, yes its sometimes clunky, the story is kind of short and there is a huge lack of side quests and freedom, but its BATMAN, it\u2019s a beautiful game, the atmosphere is amazing, Arkham looks beautiful yet terrifying, you even feel bad for the inmates, you wonder if that\u2019s supposed to help them with their mental illnesses or if it just makes em worse, and the characters are great very fleshed out, its not a game about batman, you DON\u2019T dress up as batman, YOU ARE BATMAN and feel like you are, so buy the game, you won\u2019t regret it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699186614, "timestamp_updated": 1699186614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149581442": {"recommendationid": "149581442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013340554", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 804, "last_played": 1608921238}, "language": "english", "review": "How he became the detective!", "timestamp_created": 1699184901, "timestamp_updated": 1699184901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149576487": {"recommendationid": "149576487", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100576327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1114, "last_played": 1699259217}, "language": "english", "review": "\n", "timestamp_created": 1699178459, "timestamp_updated": 1699178459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149569870": {"recommendationid": "149569870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847110094", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1699168797}, "language": "english", "review": "bamn", "timestamp_created": 1699168818, "timestamp_updated": 1699168818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149563043": {"recommendationid": "149563043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198978084625", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1699158036}, "language": "english", "review": "Why did Jerkler turn himself into a Ben?

No soy mas que un internauta mas pero, a pesar de ello, no puedo contener mis ganas de expresar lo grandiosa y gloriosa que ha sido esta aventura.\nProbablemente, lo mas caracter\u00edstico de esta obra es su sistema de pelea \"Freeflow\". Un sistema que, a base de un creciente combo junto con la habilidad y sagacidad del jugador, permite a Batman ejecutar movimientos cada vez mas exc\u00e9ntricos, efectivos y satisfactorios. Este sistema hace sentir al jugador como una pluma en el viento, saltando de maleante en maleante de forma tan libre que puedes apreciarte como el verdadero Batman. Al continuar la historia y por consecuente dominar el sistema de pelea, puedes llegar a disfrutar de un espect\u00e1culo marcial incre\u00edble con poco y nada de esfuerzo.\nEn este juego, los titanes han sido explotados al m\u00e1ximo. Por consecuente, las batallas de jefes no se sienten tan impactantes y \u00fanicas incluyendo incluso al jefe final. Sin embargo debo destacar a las batallas contra Killer Croc y Scarecrow, magnificas y \u00fanicas batallas que realmente cumplen su cometido. Por un lado: Las alcantarillas se sienten mas peligrosas que nunca con la presencia del merodeador cocodrilo, quien estar\u00e1 asechando desde las profundidades en busca de la mas m\u00ednima perturbaci\u00f3n en las aguas. Puedes sentirte aterrorizado realmente, ya que no sabes en que momento ser\u00e1 que Killer Croc saltar\u00e1 sobre t\u00ed. Scarecrow, por el otro lado, ofrece una divertida secci\u00f3n de plataformas cada vez que te lo topas. Debes tener mucho cuidado con tus movimientos, ya que puede que seas visto por el villano y tu partida termine.\nLos trofeos de acertijo son algo que odias o amas, hay un total de 240 acertijos siendo algunos literales adivinanzas, otros trofeos y tambi\u00e9n los dientes de Joker destruidos. Si te gusta completar las cosas en su totalidad, estos peque\u00f1os acertijos van a desafiar tu inteligencia, memoria y hasta conocimiento del mundo DC. pero de tal forma que no se hace tedioso ni aburrido (por lo menos para mi).\nCon todo esto dicho, puedo decir que ha sido un placer completar este juego al 100%. No me arrepiento de nada, y espero que este juego nunca sea olvidado. Se trata de nada mas ni nada menos que de una de las obras mas gloriosas de la historia de los videojuegos.", "timestamp_created": 1699131719, "timestamp_updated": 1699131719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149541532": {"recommendationid": "149541532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077066151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1095, "last_played": 1699129966}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first Batman game I played and WOW what a great game it was! I got hooked instantly and the combat gameplay is probably one of the best combat systems i have seen in a game. It was just very fun to punch the living crap out of the henchmen and bosses.\n\n I don't know if the AI is different in other difficulty settings but i played on hard (which is the most difficult one) and the AI for just simple thugs could sometimes kill the Batman, which often made for some good laughs. Nothing was as amusing as thinking you made an cool escape only to get sniped by a thug in the back. I might think that hard difficulty would not be so enjoyable for some players, but i personally really liked it. But i still suggest trying on medium on your first time.\n\n I never really delved into the Batman universe that much before but after playing this game i re watched the Nolan Batman trilogy and bought the other games in the Arkham series when they were on sale. I really liked finding the extras stuff like Character BIOS and voice logs which really got me interested in the Batman lore. \nThe setting, the characters, the story feels sometimes very raw which i really like and it doesn't treat you like a helpless kid. Its gritty, atmospheric, entertaining and most of all fun to play. \n\nThe only complaint i would have is that the ending kinda came out of nowhere and could have been a bit longer. It could feel a bit more climactic.

At this point I was a little worried they would not hold up or would have issues running on modern hardware, as some older games do. Thanks to a recent bundle, I\u2019ve discovered that both of thees worries were unfounded.\n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum has aged fantastically well. Sure, no one is going to look at this and think it is a recent game, but it still looks very good and for the most part controls quite well. While models, textures, and lighting may look outdated, none of them look so outdated that I would have thought this game was almsot 15 years old. I guess part of that is the slow and minor graphical year to year improvements we\u2019ve been seeing lately for the most part. On the other hand, the way Batman\u2019s cape flows and moves looks quite good, even by today\u2019s standards.\n\nAs far as controls go, for the most part the game feels like any other new game. The thing that stands out to me as odd is how sprint, climb, interact, and dodge are all bound to the same button. It definitely ages the game, but it\u2019s also not that hard to adjust to.\n\nMap area\u2019s may be small, but they feel fairly detailed and thanks to the quick loading, I barley noticed most of the loading screens when going between buildings and rooms. Combine that with great performance, other than the occasional stutter, and the game actually feels better than many modern games when it comes to fluidity of the world.\n\nAs for gameplay, you play as Batman, exploring Arkham Asylum and defeating a bunch of escaped criminals who are helping Joker do some evil plan. To do this you do standard video game stuff like fighting enemies and solving environmental puzzles. I don\u2019t think any of this was original even when the game first came out, but for the most part its executed quite well so it feels fun.\n\nBy far the worst part is fighting enemies with guns. Even with maxed out armour upgrades, they kill you in under 5 seconds, usually before you can get a single punch in. Your only really option is to stealth kill them, which can be quite finicky at times. You also pretty much have to kill them all in stealth without getting caught. While you can go back into hiding, if you are seen, you are pretty much always killed before you have the chance to hide again. Luckily most combat does not have any guns, but every time I see a room with gunners, I just want to give up and stop playing. They are that frustrating to deal with.\n\nOverall, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a great game that holds up very well that I would very much recommend, especially considering you can pick it up for under 5 bucks.", "timestamp_created": 1699110001, "timestamp_updated": 1699110001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557195544242858887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149511769": {"recommendationid": "149511769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289143383", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 758, "last_played": 1668265032}, "language": "english", "review": "Batman.

THE GAME WONT WORK FOR YOU AND IF, IFFFF IT DOES IT WILL TAKE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET GOING. I have followed every instruction there is, I know it all, and each trail I have followed searching for a fix comes up unsuccessful; This should not be a thing. You Steam Employees should not be able to sell this to the working man like me I just did 9 hours of work like you all, like everyone one else in this world I'd appreciate if when I buy something off your site it just works. I'm exhausted from buying this game trying to get it working last night (spent the time I shoulda been going to bed trying to get it to work) this morning before work I tried, and now after. My only fix is to buy it off EPIC GAMES store because apparently thats the only way the very few people like me who have tried everything PhysX, DirectX, XqcX, XXXAdultfilm to subside the stress and even trying to find and buy X off the street; and nothing works they all say you gotta go to epic games store. Even going to nvidia website looking for all these old drivers or whatever, no avail. Ever.

If you've ever wondered what happens when you mix the World's Greatest Detective with a madhouse full of the craziest villains Gotham has to offer, look no further than Batman: Arkham Asylum. Spoiler alert: it's a riot!\n\nThe Bat-tastic Adventure:\nSo, picture this: Batman, looking all broody and cape-y, decides to take the Joker for a leisurely stroll to Arkham Asylum. I mean, what could possibly go wrong, right? Well, everything. It's like the Joker planned a surprise party for Bats, and by \"surprise party,\" I mean he invited all his Arkham buddies to play a game of \"Let's See Who Can Give Batman the Biggest Headache.\"\n\nBat-nanas Gadgets:\nLet's talk gadgets. Batman's utility belt is basically the Swiss Army Knife of superhero accessories. Need to hack into a security system? Batarang! Need to take out a bunch of henchmen without breaking a sweat? Explosive Gel! It's like Batman went shopping at the \"Bad Guys Be Gone\" store, and everything was half off.\n\nArkham's Got Talent:\nNow, let's talk about the inmates. Arkham Asylum is like the talent show from hell. You've got the Joker, who's basically a stand-up comedian with a really twisted sense of humor. Poison Ivy is there, making plants do her bidding. And let's not forget Killer Croc - a guy who takes \"going green\" to a whole new level. It's like the Justice League went on vacation, and Gotham's rogues' gallery decided to throw a party.\n\nDetective Mode:\nOh, and Batman's Detective Mode? It's like his version of Insta-filter for crime scenes. He just puts on his super cool glasses, and suddenly, he can see footprints, analyze trajectories, and probably even tell you what the Riddler had for breakfast. It's almost unfair how good he is at crime-solving.\n\nThe Bat-voice:\nLet's take a moment to appreciate Batman's gravelly voice. I mean, seriously, if I tried talking like that, I'd need a throat lozenge within five minutes. But Batman? He growls, and bad guys quiver in their mismatched socks. It's like having Clint Eastwood and a chainsaw in the same room.\n\nConclusion:\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is like a wild night out in Gotham - full of crazy characters, mind-blowing gadgets, and enough bat-punching action to make you question why Batman doesn't have his own cooking show. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and dive into the madness.

Afton was a dad, had a daughter named Elizabeth, a son named Micheal, and an unnamed (probably had name, was just never brought up) younger child, of whom is known as crying child, due to his constant crying in literally any situation. Now Afton and his buddy were geniuses that somehow created machinery centuries ahead of its time (fnaf starts in the 1980-2000\u2019s), and start a new diner of which had two functional kiddie entertaining robots, those being fredbear (a bear), spring Bonnie (a bunny), and the security puppet (a marionette).Considering the amount of restaurants that existed, they were pretty successful. now another thing to mention, is that Afton (and only afton) is also a psychotic murder, and murdered what is possibly his first kiddie victim, although maybe not, some voice lines in UCN prove that chica (Susie) was the first victim. But this is the first victim shown in game at least, maybe he killed Susie but only did (stuff that is spoiling to the plot later on) after animatronics were able to be used, with that out of the way, mofo killed his buddy Henry\u2019s daughter for some damn reason, his actions may or may not have purpose, but yet again, that\u2019s later. There definitely was security puppet, but the kiddies inside the diner had seemed to use her (probably the puppet\u2019s gender) aesthetic design against her, stacking boxes on the giant present she peeks out of to check the area, of which she was able to push off, yet a bit too late considering the kiddies locked out Henry daughter (I forgor her name srry lol), of which gave afton a perfect time to kill. The puppet then went outside in search of her, of which it was raining, and since the puppet was an early design, water screwed her up, of which she broke down while laying near (Henry\u2019s daughter) corpse, of which seemed to somehow get her to possess the puppet. Now I could be screwing this all up, and it may have happened in the revamped location which is until later, but my brain isn\u2019t functioning properly considering it\u2019s 2:48 AM rn and I am doing this from memory. With that out, now we go to crying child\u2019s pov. He was severely bullied by his older brother of who would terrorize him with a mask of the future face of foxy, for no (yet) explained reason. Another thing to mention is he had an attraction to Fred\u2019s, yet was also terrified by it, and would at times try to sneak into Fred\u2019s without his father\u2019s permission. He had some weird ass plush of faz bear that would talk to him in full length sentences To prevent this, Afton had the genius idea to use genius tech ahead of even modern times, on his child, and make him have horrific hallucinations/nightmares of the future Freddy gang, and of fredbear, to deter him from trying to go back there, and that fazbearbplush? It seemed to be controlled with a microphone or something that William would talk to him or something like that. this didn\u2019t seem to work, and for some odd reason, Afton thought it would be a cool idea to also have his birthday party there. Micheal was also there, and with some of his own buddies, and they all had the great idea of grabbing crying child and put him inside of fredbear\u2019s jaw so that he could \u201ckiss him\u201d, of which caused his frontal lobe to get bitten off, or something like that, and no, this is NOT the bite of 87, since it happened in the year 83(television showing the show \u201cfred bear and friends\u201d proves this). now, it is uncertain if crying child died or survived, and for a period of time it was considered that he was the protagonist we play as, of which is now false, but it seems to point towards him dying, and semi possessing golden Freddy. Now, another thing to mention is that his sister may or may not have died before him, but I am currently not functioning, and have no clue which goes first. After loosing a child, he promptly closed down the diner, but then also had the genius idea of opening a few more restaurants. Now this is where I am uncertain about things, there seemed to be another location, but some stuff are screwing up my brain, yeah, srry. During or if not very closely after opening Fred\u2019s diner, he opened another chain of restaurants, with the iconic Freddy gang that includes Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. Now he also murdered kiddies I\u2019m this pizzeria, and instead of leaving the bodies back in an alley way, he had the luxury of putting corpses of children that decay, inside of entertainment robots, of which the puppet somehow caused them all to get possessed, and start acting aggressive to security guards, as they resemble their murder. It was closed down after the odor of decaying corpses became visible to the human nose. Then he decided to make yet another chain, and from the looks of it, it wasn\u2019t he who did it, but his good ol pal Henry, with even crazier tech, revamping old designs, and causing an entire fan base horny for a chicken who resembles a human more than it\u2019s respective animal, hence forth causing people to be semi furrys, yet not at the same time-ish? And the old animatronics were just tossed in the parts in service for no reason at all. now, Afton wasn\u2019t just gonna let Henry play him that easily, and then created yet more crazy tech, with animatronics that can blow ballons with their fingers, and fucking ice cream aswell, the Funtime animatronics, of which he also specifically designed to kill kiddies and stuff their bodies inside themselves without his action. Specifically programmed to get kiddies who are by themselves, far from the crowd. Afton also prevented his daughter from coming in contact from the child\u2019s dream, so she inevitably sneaked to the specific robot known as baby, of which she had to do so by being far from human contact, and got killed by baby, and none of the kids knew because they was in another room shouting and stuff. So the dumbass lost two kids to his own creations. He coped through it though, moved the Funtime animatronics down to his (what is speculated, and also probable) giant ass basement under his house,made them into rentals from then on, and decided his next best action was to go to a newer, yet seemingly lower quality tech pizzeria, of which I am currently confused of considering I\u2019m doing this from my own damn memory, to break down the og fnaf gang with his own damn bare hands, and this is where I may have screwed up, the scrapped gang of Freddy in fnaf 2, but what I do know is that Afton had seemingly tore them down to become to become\u2026 immortal? This is lore coming from the books, where he tears the robots down for \u201creminent\u201d or something like that which somehow causes you to become immortal (I mean, if children posses the suits they were stuffed in, this isn\u2019t too far fetched for the story), why he didn\u2019t get their reminent right after killing them, I have no idea, maybe it only worked after they possessed something, idk, but either way, doing so caused the spirits of the kiddies ended up loose, and then cornered Afton down to a room, in which (I forgor whose spirit in specific) starts to chase hi around in. Now I didn\u2019t mention this before, but I will now, Afton lured all the kiddies he killed by dressing up in the spring Bonnie costume, of which was a spring lock costume, which allowed for the robots endoskeleton to be removed and some stuff to be cranked back for enough space for a worker to get inside and preform, with also a huge risk of dying a horrible death. This very suit was in the room he was getting chased into, and for some reason he put it on for protection or something. Now, to explain it fully, animatronics have and endoskeleton of which has all the functioning stuff, and since the earliest version wasn\u2019t as advanced as the others, and didn\u2019t have the same fudged, they decided to make a mechanism [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Reading the last page first?

beyond that I've not been huge into Batman since then, maybe that's my problem, but the amount of praise the game gets I'd expect it to hold up even without being invested in the franchise. Apparently not (for me at least).\n\nIf I had to use one word to summarise it all I'd say the game is \"Repetitive\" because so many times I found myself saying \"oh this, AGAIN\".\n\nHow many times do I need to fight enemies that need to be Batarang'ed as they charge, dodge and punch? How many times do I need to beat up wave after wave of random low level nobodies?\nHow many times do I need to fight [spoiler]Scarecrow[/spoiler]?\n\nHonestly the idea that this game was a Game of the Year is more a damning statement about the quality of games the year it came out than about the quality of this game. I nearly uninstalled after the second [spoiler]Scarecrow[/spoiler] section because I just could not be bothered anymore, but I checked to see if I was anywhere near the end and apparently there wasn't too much left so I pushed on to see if it got any better and Jesus Christ the final boss fight was the most anti-climactic fight I think I have ever played.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that got this game so many good reviews (not just on Steam but in general) was because it was a super hero game and it was being judged against the quality of previous franchise tie in games.", "timestamp_created": 1698518975, "timestamp_updated": 1698518975, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477250963449478149", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149067927": {"recommendationid": "149067927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199445996337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1698602498}, "language": "english", "review": "goatred\n", "timestamp_created": 1698515716, "timestamp_updated": 1698515716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149067199": {"recommendationid": "149067199", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076355388", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 300, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1699887520}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is great, level design amazing, the joker is genuinely a terrifying villian, keeps you on your toes and keeps you wondering what he's going to do next, some of the villians are just terribly designed (Bane in particular) but some are just absolutely amazing (Scarecrow, Joker).

Of course, Batman's arch-enemy, Joker, is incarcerated here, and the story revolves around progressing through the prison, dealing with his henchmen and other super-villains such has Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and Killer Croc.\n\nThe environments you move through are extremely well done, from the open spaces on the island between the prison buildings to the depths of the prison itself, which are dark, spooky and in some cases downright terrifying!  The Grapnel Gun allows freedom of movement to get to places where you can observe and plan your next encounter using your \"detective vision\".\n\nYou gain a formidable arsenal of toys to deal with you enemies, and they're all fun to play with.  The combat system allows you to chain together combos as you deal with groups of enemies.  It can be frustrating at times, but you soon get the hang of it.  The boss encounters will probably also take you several attempts as you learn the timing of their attacks, either countering with an attack of your own, or just getting out of the way!\n\nBeyond the combat there are many collectables scattered across the game, including Joker Teeth, Riddler Trophies and interview tapes with some of Arkham's inmates.  Finding these gives you experience points that can be used to unlock weapon upgrades.", "timestamp_created": 1698490929, "timestamp_updated": 1698490929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149037330": {"recommendationid": "149037330", "author": {"steamid": "76561199141483049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1698512943}, "language": "english", "review": "Why didn't he call robin for help?

I love boss fights, especially Scarecrow, Killer Croc and Poision Ivy.\n\nThis game is really underrated, especially since this game was the first Batman game out there, people need to remember that without this game, the Arkham series wouldn't exist at all. This game is my favorite in the series along with Batman Origins. \n\nI wish people would remember that even if City and Knight are top of arkham series list, Asylum and Origins are amazing games and

arkham games i really enjoyed this one, the combat was quite entertaining and presented a decent challenge at times, the environment was good and there was plenty of secrets and go and find, my only bad things are that the game lacked a deep enough story for me to be fully invested into it, it seemed rather basic in that there wasnt many moments in the story that took me by suprise, also the joker boss fight let it down a bit, i say this because the build up to is good in that you fight the goons and titans in the room where joker is then he takes the titan formula, but the whole fight is just batman fighting goons and hitting joker a couple of times when he gets pulled down, \n\noverall however i think the game is very good considering its age, and look forward to playing the other

So naturally my expectations were high, and suprisingly they were met. For a game that got released in early 2010, Arkham Asylum does so many things right and even better then many games today.

"review": "Greetings, citizens of Steam! It's the one and only Caped Crusader here, and I've taken a brief respite from patrolling the mean streets of Gotham City to share my thoughts on Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition.\n\nReview:\n\nAs I descended into the eerie depths of Arkham Asylum, I couldn't help but think, \"Why don't the inmates ever stay put?\" But that's beside the point, and now, it's time for a Bat-review.\n\n\ud83e\udd87 The True Batman Experience \ud83e\udd87\n\nArkham Asylum GOTY Edition is the closest thing you'll get to becoming me without, well, becoming me. It's as close as you can get to patrolling the rooftops and grappling onto gargoyles, all without breaking a sweat. I mean, I don't sweat. But you get the idea.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Gadgets Galore \ud83e\udd16\n\nMy utility belt is like a Bat-candy store, complete with explosive gel and the Batarang, perfect for knocking down pesky thugs and leaving them bewildered. I give it five Bat-thumbs up! Wait, I only have two thumbs, but you get the point.\n\n\ud83e\udde9 Riddle Me This, Riddler! \ud83e\udde9\n\nThe Riddler has left his little puzzles and trophies strewn all over the place. It's like he's got a competitive streak. Don't worry; I cracked those riddles faster than I can say, \"I'm Batman.\"\n\n\ud83e\uddb9 Rogues' Gallery Face-Off \ud83e\uddb9\n\nThe villains of Arkham Asylum are like a who's who of Gotham's criminal elite. Joker, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and more. It's like a criminal family reunion, but with more Batarangs and fewer awkward conversations.\n\n\ud83e\udd9a Stealth Mode: Like a Bat Ninja \ud83e\udd9a\n\nMy stealth skills are unparalleled, and you'll get to experience that firsthand. Sneaking up on unsuspecting henchmen is a bit of a hobby of mine. I like to imagine I'm the Batman version of a ninja in a cape.\n\n\ud83d\udca3 Exploding Fun \ud83d\udca3\n\nJoker's explosive surprises are just the kind of fireworks Gotham needs. It's almost as if he wants me to know he's always watching. And he's right; I'm Batman\u2014I'm always watching too!\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the grand tradition of the Dark Knight, Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition is a masterpiece. It's like stepping into the cowl, except without all the training and brooding. So, citizens of Steam, if you've ever wondered what it's like to be Batman, wonder no more. Dive into Arkham Asylum and unleash your inner vigilante. After all, I'm Batman, and I approve this game.\n\n\ud83e\udd87 Bat-Approved Rating: 9.5/10 - \"The game Gotham deserves and needs!\" \ud83e\udd87", "timestamp_created": 1698232169, "timestamp_updated": 1698232169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592592597007751465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148842966": {"recommendationid": "148842966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868380638", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 614, "last_played": 1698405686}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Despite that this game came out back in 2009, this game has a special place in my heart. The story is good, the combat and stealth game play is great too. The Joker is the best character of the whole game, he is hilarious and they got him pretty accurate to what the Joker is supposed to be. The first time I encountered Scarecrow, I thought he was terrifying design wise but as time went on, I got used to his design. Rocksteady did a really good job with Scarecrow in this game. Over all, I totally recommend this game. Be warned, you might have to do extra steps in order for this game to play.

I have no idea why its not verified, it even plays in the native aspect ratio. Smooth experience from my play time with no settings adjusted. \n\nI am not a DC fan (read as I really, really don't like DC), and I'm hardly interested in Batman. I am much more into Marvel (read as I really, really love Marvel). This game is borderline perfect. You don't have to be a Batman fan, just a fan of good video games to really enjoy Batman: Arkham Asylum. This game is from an era just before all the micro transaction/live services BS really started to take off and take hold of the mainstream market. It's a complete package from beginning to end with a solid amount of content that wraps up very nicely in the end. I got this game on sale for a meager 3 bucks, the price of a McChicken these days and had a blast. I bought it and gave it a shot more because I know the reputation it has and have heard great things about this game. Everyone was right, and I am horribly late to the party. \n\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is a metroidvania lite in a lot of good ways. This is a character action game first, and it really nails a good feel for the combat. The buttons make sense, the attacks thrown at you are well telegraphed, each combat encounter rewards your methodical approach rather than just button mashing. It feels great to control Batman. The developers did a great job of capturing \"feeling like Batman\". As you progress there will be areas and secrets inaccessible to you until you unlock certain equipment or upgrades. There is some clever back tracking, with a lot of surprising level design changes as you continue through your adventure. The enemy variety throughout the game is just right for the length of the total campaign and stayed fresh enough through my play through. Some combat encounters can be pretty boring, particularly against the over-sized brutes. But when you're fighting normal goons, exploring Arkham Asylum, and solving puzzles this game is amazing. The world design, art direction, and character acting are really good and serves to sell the immersion in a great way. Some cut-scene work is meh, but it never took away from enjoyment of the game and served just to be a quick stepping stone to the next thing.\n\nI give Batman: Arkham Asylum a 9/10 and I can see my self coming back to play it again. The only thing really holding it back from a solid 10 is some of the combat encounters I could do without or should have been made more interesting.

The guns are kinda op against Batman. \n\nSPOILER PART:\nBoss fights were... Okay but needed more of everything. \nBANE: Bane is a pretty easy boss once you figure out what to do and what not to do, which makes sense cause he's the first boss.\nThen they have like 5-6 bane remakes that you have to fight through the game which operate exactly like bane. Only difference between the drugged up goon fights and bane is that the drugged up goons normally have other goons with them. Got kinda boring having to keep fighting them.\n\nSCARECROW: His \"Fights\" Are pretty much you running forward trying not to be seen by his light... That's pretty much it. You fight skeletons every so often, but they are easier to fight than goons. They also have skelly's that fight the same as jacked up goons, but are even easier to fight cause all you gotta do is dodge them once and they explode.\n\nHarley Quinn: Legit just stay off the electro-floor and beat up goons.\n\nCROC: Croc's fight is pretty much just walk on platforms (can't run or you'll die) And collect stuff. He'll pop up every so often, but all you gotta do is throw one batatararaang at him. I wouldn't really call it a boss fight.\n\nIVY: Ivy has a lot of \"Power\" in  this game, and yet she's easy to fight. Legit dodge her easily dodge-able moves while spamming batarangs at her. Then place and explosive on her. You gotta do this whole things twice, but that's all her fight is.\n\nJOKER: Joker's fight is by FAR the biggest JOKE of the whole game.. It's the last fight and yet is the easiest.... Like super easy.. He turns into a jacked joker and all you gotta to is dodge his attacks (like 5 attacks) then he will jump off the arena and send his men in. After spending like 1-2 mins killing his men, you pull him down and punch him. You do that whole thing 3 times. Doesn't get any harder tbh. You also get more health between the rounds, so it's even easier. \n\n\nThat's the whole game, not very long.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The graphics still hold up even to this day, especially when you look up close to the characters like the Joker and the attention to detail with his facial features. This game does a magnificent job of making you feel like Batman, everything from the combat to the grappling to sneaking up behind enemies and knocking them out cold. All of the gameplay elements are fused together so beautifully - platforming, beat-em-up, puzzle solving, treasure hunt, stealth...there's never a dull moment. The music is top notch, and really adds to the dark and gritty atmosphere. To hear the legendary Kevin Conroy voice as Batman is like premium icing on the cake.

"review": "Batman:Arkham Asylum is a must-play for me. Combat, while easy for me now as I have been playing through this game so many times(which probably should explain my liking for it), still offers a satisfying experience in superhero battle design. Stealth can be enjoyed too. I will say that it's not as dynamic as say, Splinter Cell(the original), as for example the player is unable to hide bodies and noise can be avoided at all the right time if you know when to stop running and when to crouch. It's a simple system of stealth considering stealth-based games I've played in the past. However, gunfire from the armed guards Batman is up against will always pack a punch to the player's HP, even if they manage to barely survive the stealth room by fighting their way through which I don't is possible? I mean, at least not very consistently. Of course, here's a pro tip, singling out the guards will leave the one defenseless and completely open to a trial by combat approach. Try not to be in their line of sight however if you want to do him a \"PERFECT K.O.\". Overall, Batman:Arkham Asylum is a mechanically simple game when you narrow it down. Yet, it remains satisfying and there is also plenty of depth to be mined out of it. You will be punished appropriately if you approach groups of enemies incorrectly and sneaking can be heavily punished if done poorly. However, when those things are done right, it's incredibly satisfying. It always feels great whenever I am able to quickly and handily dismantle a room full of armed henchmen or defeat all enemies in an encounter with as little difficulty as possible. It, without question, can make you feel like Batman. Play it well, and you are for sure worthy of taking control of the Caped Crusader himself.

Well just that earns a recommendation from me, but lets talk a bit more about it.\n\nBatman Arkham Asylum is a cult classic, but hear my opinion on it as an outsider.\nI like the old batman movies, but I wouldn't class myself as a batman fan.\nHaving said that, I found the game to be good, maybe not amazing, but definitely good enough to warrant a playthrough.\nThe gameplay is interesting and varied, you unlock new tools as you progress that give you more options for traversal and the ability to reach places that you couldnt before. It all uses the same map, but you just get higher levels of access with time.\nThe story is relatively simple, but there is a lot of fan service for people that have read the old comics, so this will be lovely for fans of batman (though one could argue that there maybe was a bit too much fan service? I'll leave that for you to decide). \nThe graphics have aged like fine wine since the artstyle still feels very relevant for a comic book superhero game.\n\nThe only two real issues (albeit minor) I had were related to - the voice acting (seems like the audio captured was low bitrate or something else, but batmans voice specifically sounds scuffed) and the amount of one liner dialogue (honestly, a little cringe).\n\nHaving said all of that, I still enjoyed the game. It didn't overstay its visit, clocking in at around 12 hours for me (ignoring the idle time and bonus content) and was a nice change of cpace compared to big bombastic open world games of today.\nYou can usually get it at a huge discount as well so its a no brainer, give it a try!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1697794876, "timestamp_updated": 1697794876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

Tek hat\u0131rlad\u0131\u011f\u0131m 11-12 saat boyunca Joker'in pe\u015fine vermemiz. Oyun boyunca Joker'in pe\u015findeyiz. Ha arada ba\u015fka d\u00fc\u015fmanlar da geliyor. Hatta baya d\u00fc\u015fman geliyor. Scarecrow, Killer Croc, Harley Quinn, Bane, Zsasz gibi bir s\u00fcr\u00fc d\u00fc\u015fman var lakin oyunun bunlara ay\u0131rd\u0131\u011f\u0131 s\u00fcreyi toplasan\u0131z anca 1.5-2 saat eder. D\u00fc\u015fman bak\u0131m\u0131ndan kadro geni\u015f ama pek iyi de\u011ferlendirilmemi\u015f. Zaten boss sava\u015flar\u0131 rezalet.

The game\u2019s mature themes and intricate storyline were a refreshing change from the often simplistic storytelling found in many modern games.\n\nThe game\u2019s mechanics are well-designed, striking a good balance between challenge and accessibility. The combat system is intuitive and deep, allowing for strategic planning and execution. The stealth elements are particularly satisfying, requiring patience and careful observation.\n\nThe graphics are impressive, even years after its initial release. The dark and gritty atmosphere of Arkham Asylum is beautifully rendered, immersing you in the world of Batman. The attention to detail in the environment and character designs adds depth to the gaming experience.\n\nThe voice acting is top-notch, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and Joker, respectively. Their performances add authenticity to the game and enhance the narrative.\n\nHowever, as an older player, I found some aspects of the game to be a bit challenging. The fast-paced combat sequences can sometimes be overwhelming, especially during boss fights. Additionally, some puzzle elements require quick reflexes, which can be a bit tricky for some older gamers.\n\nDespite these challenges, I appreciate the game\u2019s difficulty settings, which allow you to customize the gameplay experience to your skill level. This feature makes the game accessible to players of all ages and abilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Batman: Arkham Asylum - Game of the Year Edition for PC is an incredibly well-crafted game that offers a rich narrative, engaging gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals. It\u2019s a game that caters to its mature audience and provides a rewarding experience for those willing to immerse themselves in its dark and complex world.\n", "timestamp_created": 1697528612, "timestamp_updated": 1697528632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148374199": {"recommendationid": "148374199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872568715", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1691519062}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10", "timestamp_created": 1697526443, "timestamp_updated": 1697526443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148371786": {"recommendationid": "148371786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995729233", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1981, "last_played": 1697935250}, "language": "english", "review": "First ever batman game besides lego batman, love it with a fucking passion!!!

Despite being late to the party, I was captivated by the unique combat system, the integration of Batman's gadgets, and the immersive storytelling, which collectively make you feel like the legendary Dark Knight himself.\n\nOne of the standout features of Arkham Asylum is its combat system. Even after playing numerous contemporary games, Arkham Asylum's combat remains a cut above the rest.

Every successful maneuver feels empowering, enabling players to single-handedly take on hordes of enemies with a satisfying blend of finesse and brute force. The combat is fluid and responsive, making you truly feel like the unstoppable Dark Knight.\n\nThe inclusion of Batman's extensive gadget arsenal is another commendable aspect of the game. From the Batarang to explosive gel, each gadget is seamlessly integrated into gameplay scenarios, providing dynamic solutions for both stealth and combat encounters. The game encourages players to experiment with different gadgets, adding depth to the overall experience and making you feel like a resourceful and strategic superhero.\n\nThe attention to detail in recreating the infamous Arkham Asylum is breathtaking. The asylum serves as an atmospheric and chilling backdrop for Batman's adventures, with its dark corridors, haunting environment, and uneasy atmosphere. Exploring the sprawling asylum feels like a genuine exploration of Batman's world, with secrets to uncover and mysteries to solve at every turn. The game's level design strikes a delicate balance between detailed architecture and player freedom, allowing for multiple approaches to each objective.\n\nFurthermore, the storyline and voice acting in Arkham Asylum are on par with the best in the genre, even when compared to modern games. The narrative unfolds in a tightly paced manner, keeping players engaged and invested in Batman's mission to thwart the Joker's sinister plans. The voice cast, including Mark Hamill's iconic portrayal of the Joker, is outstanding, bringing the characters to life and immersing players in a truly cinematic experience.\n\nWhile playing Arkham Asylum more than a decade later may result in occasional moments where certain aspects feel slightly dated, the overall quality and impact of the game's mechanics, storytelling, and atmosphere remain unparalleled. It is a testament to its excellence that it still holds up as one of the best superhero experiences even in the face of newer releases.\n\nIn conclusion, Batman: Arkham Asylum offers an exceptional and timeless gaming experience.

Characters have great designs that clearly showcase their personalities. The animations in this game also look pretty good. Sound design is pretty great. Hearing the crunches and cracks as you beat up enemies is greatly satisfying. Music here is really good as well and switch very smoothly from one another. The atmosphere presented by asylum is absolutely amazing and truly makes you feel the brutality of where you are. The art for this game is also pretty good.\n\nGameplay is good, but there are some flaws here and there. The combat is great, as it makes you feel like a dangerous martial artist. Attacks feel heavy and satisfying. Inputs are responsive, but sometimes when you throw a punch, Batman will just randomly swing a punch in the air when there is an enemy right next to him. The stealth sections are by far the best part of this game. Using your gadgets to gain an advantage over enemies and seeing their heart rate increase as the odds get turned against them truly makes you feel like a dangerous skilled assassin. Unfortunately these sections are few and far in between. The boss fights in this game are a mixed bag tho. Bane is way to simple to be fun, Killler Croc is way too easy, and the joker is just three waves of enemies. The only good boss is poison ivy. Puzzles are alright. Most of the puzzles that you will be solving is finding Riddler trophies. Luckily these are optional and they aren't as annoying and as common as they are in the rest of the series.\n\nThe story here is alright. Characters are interesting and well voiced by their voice actors. Unfortunately the overall story is a bit generic and weird decisions are often made by characters in the game. My favorite part though is the lore set up by this universe.

This is like a nice memory you keep revisiting every once in a while, which any Batman fan should experience at least once. The game features different difficulty settings to suit anyone, from casual gamers to more professional ones, we can also enjoy loads of hidden clues, Easter eggs and references to the DC universe which can make anyone smile. The game has aged well graphics and gameplay wise, and is not feeling dated even 14 years after it's initial release.\n\nThe game also gets serious, featuring the proper psycho nature of the Batman villains, which was watered down in the already mentioned Diniverse, but Paul Dini made the most of the nonrestrictive nature of this game and was able to do what Fox Kids won't allow him back in the day, when he worked on the Batman: The animated series or Justice League cartoons.\n\nEspecially in the lights of Kevin Conroy and Arleen Sorkin passing, this game stands out as extraordinary and offers us experiences we would never get again.

From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by its gripping narrative, stunning visuals, and impeccable gameplay.\n\nOne of the standout features of Arkham Asylum is its exceptional storytelling. The game kicks off with Batman delivering the Joker to Arkham Asylum, but things quickly spiral out of control as the Clown Prince of Crime takes over the facility. The plot is filled with unexpected twists, keeping players on the edge of their seats throughout the game. The dialogue and voice acting are top-notch, with Mark Hamill's Joker and Kevin Conroy's Batman delivering unforgettable performances that rival their work in the animated series.\n\nVisually, Arkham Asylum is a masterpiece. The attention to detail in the asylum's dark and foreboding corridors, as well as in Batman's suit and gadgets, is outstanding. The character models are incredibly lifelike, and the animation is smooth, which enhances the overall immersion.\n\nThe gameplay in Arkham Asylum is where the game truly shines. The combat system is both accessible to newcomers and rewarding for veterans, allowing players to feel like the caped crusader as they seamlessly chain together combos and counterattacks. Batman's arsenal of gadgets is vast and enjoyable to use, whether it's the grappling hook, batarangs, or the detective vision that lets you investigate crime scenes. The stealth mechanics are equally engaging, making it just as satisfying to stalk and subdue enemies in the shadows as it is to engage in all-out brawls.\n\nThe game also provides ample opportunities for exploration and puzzle-solving. The Riddler's challenges scattered throughout the island add an extra layer of depth to the gameplay, encouraging players to use their detective skills to solve riddles and collect trophies.\n\nIn addition to the main story, the game offers a plethora of side missions and unlockable content that extends its replayability. Arkham Asylum provides a rich and immersive experience that keeps players coming back for more.\n\nIn conclusion, Batman: Arkham Asylum is a triumph of game design and a must-play for both Batman fans and gamers in general. Its compelling narrative, stunning visuals, and impeccable gameplay combine to create an unforgettable experience that truly captures the essence of the Dark Knight. If you haven't experienced this masterpiece yet, do yourself a favor and dive into the world of Arkham Asylum; you won't be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1696835272, "timestamp_updated":

It's just too short. Arkham City fixes that issue a bit, except that it kind of does it by way of adding a bunch of grindy side missions. That said, I'd much rather solve Riddler's puzzles in City over searching through all of Arkham Asylum again. I really hated the map design and found Asylum kind of a chore to navigate. At times, it kind of made me want to quit and move on to City.\n\nThe aesthetic of the game holds up, even ten years later. This game is truly a piece of art, and I don't think many games are like that. The mechanics are pretty good, just unrefined. You can see why City became so much better. Directional jumping is problematic in this game, which is mostly fine... except that there are a few platforming sections where it's really bothersome.\n\nThe one area where this game has City beat is in its story, which I think is way more interesting. Joker gets himself locked into Arkham Asylum, escapes, and begins reaping havoc. That story is way more interesting than City, which is a kind of half-baked superhero plot about Strange trying to control Arkham City/Gotham. I also think that there are too many enemy types in City. But that's for a different review.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game that's worth playing. It's just definitely NOT worth collecting all of the Riddler trophies because it's not worth working your way through the maze-like map.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1695248204, "timestamp_updated": 1695248204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146654956": {"recommendationid": "146654956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321344676", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 924, "last_played": 1692316035}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games of all time.

This game (and its sequel) is one of them. 14 years later and this game still eclipses every single other superhero game out there. This is comfortably the best superhero game ever made. It is one of the best action games ever made. Its influence is still widely seen today.\n\nEvery once in a while a game comes along that innovates, changes up how things work, changes up gaming in general (e.g. Dark Souls - Soulslike genre). Arkham Asylum did just that back in 2009. Shortly after its release, we saw the first copycats emerge in the form of Shadow of Mordor and Mad Max, nowadays by the Spiderman games. All these games are imitators of the original. Not so impressive.\n\nOn top of that innovation, it still holds up visually, because of the stellar art design.

I missed this game on release because I was a broke college student, but have memories of everyone saying how good it was. And they were right! They're still right! This game aged remarkably and hearkens back to an era when we were drowning in solid new releases. An era that would soon be coming to an end. \n\n[h1]Where to Begin...[/h1]\n\nThere is so much to praise about this game: Fluid combat and movement. Good mix of combat, puzzle solving and platforming. Insanely good atmosphere. Great takes on classic Batman villains. Not too short, not too long. There's not a whole lot to really complain about (and I'll get to that). It's an all around good, engrossing experience that begs you to keep playing.\n\nBack in 2009, [i]Arkham Asylum[/i] introduced an innovative combat system. Everything was streamlined. No complicated combos to memorize. Everything was contextualized. By doing this, players can easily take \n control of Batman and acrobatically beat the pulp out of Joker's thugs. It just feels right as you see Batman effortlessly gliding through and between enemies, delivering punches left and right, occasionally having to counter, throwing the occasional baterang - or three. It all holds up nearly 15 years later. \n\nAs the world's greatest detective, you'll also be challenged to solve puzzles, mysteries, and riddles. This is again another area Rocksteady streamlined. Anytime you need to figure something out, you just go into detective mode and stuff gets highlighted. Admittedly, this got stale after a while, but the middle ground would be tough to find. If you make puzzles too challenging, a lot of players will get frustrated and quit. If you dumb it down anymore, you remove the challenge all together. It gives you something to do where you can put in minimal effort and get rewarded. For [i]Arkham Asylum[/i], it needs some mechanic like this, as otherwise there would be no incentive to explore the island.\n\nLastly, I want to throw some praise at the atmosphere and mood of this game. Arkham is a dark place. There is not one trace of anything other than evil and depravity. As you explore the asylum, you pick up interviews with inmates and messages from the founder. From these stories it becomes immediately clear that there are no good guys at Arkham. Coupled with the detailed environments around the island, which were clearly inspired by psychiatric hospitals c.1930, exploring the asylum fills one with a sense of unease.\n\n[h1]Minor Criticisms[/h1]\n\nThere isn't much bad to be said about this game, at least not from a design perspective. Fights with the Titan Henchmen, for example, were easily the weakest part of the game. One is introduced early on and then they aren't seen again for a while. The basic premise of these fights is simple, but they include my least favorite mechanic: Waiting.\n\nThe Titan Henchmen fight cycle is as follows:\n-Wait for Titan to charge\n-Quick throw baterang and dodge\n-Titan hits wall, gets disoriented\n-Avoid and wait for Titan to go back to normal state\n-Repeat until you can knock him out\n\nIt's a lot of waiting. And then you get sections where there are multiple Titans, or multiple Titans with 10 other basic henchmen. In these cases when you knock a Titan down you can at least ride it and make it thrash around and hit enemies, but even then it's not that satisfying.\n\nHaving said all that, while I was playing I realized that nevertheless, the design choice to make you square off against 2 Titans and 10 henchmen is interesting in theory. To fight a Titan you have to wait. But you can't wait when you 10 guys all trying to attack you at once.  I really commend the idea of making a player perform 2 diametrically opposed tasks at the same time. Love the idea. Hated it in practice.\n\nThe only other issues I had were technical and I chalk them up to this game being old. Problems I experienced:\n-Game freezing at start menu, forced restart\n-Occasional bad input lag\n-Stopped getting achievements for some reason\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nSolid game. Definitely recommend. Still amazing to me that this, a game that came out in 2009, looks, runs, and feels better than pretty much everything that's come out in the last 10 years.

was one. We get to see Arkham Asylum in all its gothic grotesquery, sneak around choking out perps dressed in tights and if that fails beating up hordes of working class goons that never got a fair chance to break the mold and join the wealthy middle class of Gotham.. The island where the titular Arkham Asylum is located is quite a sandbox filled with nooks and crannies where you can lurk upon your enemies or find the hidden psycho-paraphernalia. The story is nothing fantastic but fits the bill.. Joker gets put under lock and key, but wait! It was a master plan all along and now he controls the asylum! Luckily ManBat happens to be right there to save the day! On the way we run into a brief yet regular entourage of famous villains and monsters from the comics. It didn't bother me even though I always find body morphology in these kinds of games jaring..  \n\nSo yea, Batman Arkham Asylum is a great game and if nothing else a damn fine example of a stealth game done right. Combine that with a fluent, almost rhythm game based combat that looks truly cinematic at times and you get a dark and brooding ballet of chokeholds, batarangs, anti-shark sprays and mighty roundhouse kicks that put Chuck Norris to shame. If you like Batman on top of it all, I imagine it is even better. It\u2019s always great to find a game that acknowledges the sneaky rat that lives in my brain! \n", "timestamp_created": 1694367029, "timestamp_updated": 1694367029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146065390": {"recommendationid": "146065390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970994415", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 697, "last_played": 1700172520}, "language": "english", "review": "Nobody reads the reviews anyways, so i'll just say i'm straight", "timestamp_created": 1694362932, "timestamp_updated": 1694362932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472972989082336426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146062812": {"recommendationid": "146062812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799683618", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1698862121}, "language": "english", "review": "they turned r/batmanarkham into a real game", "timestamp_created": 1694360359, "timestamp_updated": 1694360359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146060638": {"recommendationid": "146060638", "author": {"steamid": "76561199519654253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1172, "last_played": 1692120430}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]In a nutshell:[/u] The Batman game, that started the Arkham legend.\n\nThe first game in the action-brawler Arkham series, laying the foundation on which the other three games are built.

The combat is not my favourite part of the game, but the Dark Knight's movement and the gadgets feel absolutely awesome. The story is fascinating, with lots of little twists and turns, and features one of the most mind-bending 4th wall-breaking scenes in the entire gaming industry (Scarecrow's fear toxin).\n\n[u]Recommended if:[/u] You like a dark detective story, an interesting take on well-known comic characters, and if you want to meet your favourite comic characters animated and voiced with

Oh, what a hoot it was! But I've got to say, Batsy, they should've renamed it \"Darkham Asylum.\" I mean, come on, you practically run the place, and they might as well call it the \"Batman Museum of Punchable Rogues.\"\n\n[BATMAN and HARLEY sit at a table, both chuckling.]\n\nBATMAN: (stoic) Well, Joker, I have to admit, \"Arkham Asylum\" was quite an experience. It captured the essence of the asylum and the challenges I face perfectly.\n\nHARLEY: (grinning) Puddin', I gotta agree with the clown on this one. The game was a real blast. The story was so engaging, and it made us all look... dare I say it... cool!\n\nJOKER: (grinning widely) You see, old chum, I had a blast making those insane riddles for you. It's like a demented version of \"Wheel of Fortune,\" but with more fear gas and fewer vowels. And speaking of fear gas, Harley, you really ought to share some of that pie with the rest of us. It's not like we're trying to take over the world or anything... oh, wait, we are!\n\n[BATMAN raises an eyebrow, and HARLEY giggles.]\n\nBATMAN: (calmly) The game captured the atmosphere of Arkham perfectly. The dark and foreboding tone, the intricate level design, and the clever puzzles all added to the experience.\n\nHARLEY: (nodding) Yeah, and the characters, Puddin'! They were spot on. I mean, who could forget that creepy Scarecrow? Even you looked pretty intimidating, Mr. J.\n\nJOKER: (feigning modesty) Well, you know, it's hard to capture all this fabulousness on screen, but they did an okay job.\n\nBATMAN: (smirking) And your hideouts, Joker, they were quite the challenge to infiltrate. The game kept me on my toes.\n\nHARLEY: (grinning) And the combat, Batsy! It was like a dance of destruction. You looked so graceful taking down those thugs.\n\nJOKER: (raising an eyebrow) All right, all right, I'll admit it was fun watching you two praise the game. But let's not forget that it's all about me, the Clown Prince of Crime, right?\n\nBATMAN: (smirking) Well, Joker, in \"Arkham Asylum,\" you definitely stole the show, just like you always try to.\n\nHARLEY: (giggling) That's right, Puddin'! So here's to \"Arkham Asylum\" \u2013 a game that let us relive our greatest hits and reminded us all that we're the stars of this crazy circus.\n\nJOKER: (grinning) Cheers to the game that proves I'm the real star of the show, and you two are just my supporting cast.

I played it after five years and it still holds up to this very day in the world where Spider-Man only stands as its competitor. If I am here to tell you about how good this title is I would be here all day but there are very indigenous flaws. Being the prototype and the blueprint of free flow combat it requires polish and some finesse. You get to have a pure skill if you want to go to a combo of 50 along with other aspects the traversal is also weak which is a minor gripe of mine as it harbors a metroidvania esque level design but overall this game is a masterpiece and ideal piece for the developers of the new gnereation.

Batman's boots after taking Joker into custody and sending him back \"Home\" to Arkham, but this time things are different, as this time the Joker has devised a plan to take over Arkham. \nHas the Joker trapped you inside with all of them? or are they the ones trapped in there with you?\nThis adventure will take you to meet and fight some of Batman's most iconic villains, Even getting to learn more about their story in the form of collectibles.\nWhile I played on keyboard and mouse (without the option to remap keys), the game felt well enough to play and enjoy, still I would recommend using a controller.\nThe idea of having real riddles to solve and not only puzzles or mini games really made you feel like a detective\u2026 most of the time.\n\nThere was no yank apart from the odd getting stuck in geometry, but it never became a problem.\nAnd while sometimes it felt like Batman had a mind of his own doing stuff unprompted or the wrong prompt thing being done, apart from it breaking a perfectly good combo or leaving an open for my enemies to attack me, I didn't rage as much as I thought I would so it wasn't that disruptive.", "timestamp_created": 1693861575, "timestamp_updated":

In the last boss fight, Joker gltiched out and was just standing there, menacingly. But a quick restart to checkpoint fixed it so it was fine. I didn't bother with the exploration of the map or rather the Riddler, he is a strange dude who makes the game more tedious, just ignore him.

Yet talking about the gameplay as a whole, it redeems itself with other features, especially the detective mode, for the first time Batman actually becomes the world's best detective, using tons of gadgets and tools to solve every mystery Arkham has, beating Riddler on his own game and making the search for his trophies a very enjoyable hunt.\n\nThe graphics while old, hold up pretty well, yet for some reason, as most games from around 2000's it has the yellow filter, but not so strong as to make it look like piss, the game being set at night helps a lot though.\n\nThe story wasn't really something truly new or unexpected, and to be honest I don't think Joker would become what he did at the ending, I believe it's not something he would do, but the whole adventure was fun, loved the performances of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy.

Easily one of the finest games ever made.\n\nThat might sound like hyperbole, but I assure you that everything comes close to making a perfect game.\n\nYou don't need to be a Batman fanatic to enjoy this, it'll show you all that you need to understand Batman, his allies and his enemies. The characterization on display is flawless with what it works with. Further, it does it without stopping the game and doing a lore dump on you. The people and their reactions to each other tells you everything.\n\nThe combat is the right amount of hectic. The different varieties of enemy have a good amount of variety while still being a reasonable challenge. Rifles, fists, stun batons...lunatics, maximum security inmates, hulking mutants, mutant plants...it all sounds like it should fall apart under its weight, but the game keeps things varied, interesting and, most importantly, doable. Beautiful...\n\nArkham Asylum might just be the best Metroidvania, too. The map isn't ridiculously huge, but it seems vast and imposing enough when you start. The story masterfully takes you through different locations and, as you get more gear and hence \"unlock\" new areas, it'll take you back through many places. Further, it'll keep things fresh as the island you're on steadily falls further into chaos through the night.\n\nIt isn't perfect or flawless, nothing is, but Arkham Asylum is must-play gaming. Nothing less.

I start the review this way because this is the most important thing to remember when you're playing this game. This game started the entire \"counter-punch\" system of combat that games to this day still use. And it feels almost as good in this game as it does in any of the games that copy it's design, even games made almost a decade and a half later.\n\nThere's a ton of great things to say here about the game. The story is a classic Batman romp. The graphics are great for the time. The voice acting, especially by Hamill and Conroy (RIP), is beyond amazing. And the music is just timeless. There's even a million and one collectables to collect if that's your thing.\n\nBut the biggest thing this game gets right is none of that. It's that this game makes you FEEL like Batman. You're big, your punches have weight. You are a complete badass. You can sneak and be stealthy terror. You can deduce (Detective Vision is yet another way this game shaped the industry, for the worse IMO, but still). You have an array of useful gadgets. But eventually you'll HAVE to punch. And when you punch, you feel the power behind those fists.\n\nAnd that's truly this game's biggest strength. Which makes it the biggest weakness from a modern perspective as well. This combat has been done better since. Of course it has. Companies have had almost 14 years to perfect it. But that should in no way diminish this game or what it accomplished and in no way means you shouldn't still play this classic.\n\nRecommended", "timestamp_created": 1692816718, "timestamp_updated": 1692816718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511627912521362305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144868558": {"recommendationid": "144868558", "author": {"steamid": "76561199186142603", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1699501325}, "language": "spanish", "review": "TREMENDA OBRA MAESTRA, 20/10 Y GOD", "timestamp_created": 1692810901, "timestamp_updated": 1692810901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144858901": {"recommendationid": "144858901", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125448993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 612, "last_played": 1692909433}, "language": "english", "review": "the combat is a little broken many times batman won't dodge for no reason", "timestamp_created": 1692799965, "timestamp_updated": 1692799965, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144830630": {"recommendationid": "144830630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198888631260", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1698818781}, "language": "spanish", "review": "god", "timestamp_created": 1692761575, "timestamp_updated": 1692761575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144816672": {"recommendationid": "144816672", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100723967", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 509, "last_played": 1697215711}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic story", "timestamp_created": 1692739450, "timestamp_updated": 1692739450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144815495": {"recommendationid": "144815495", "author": {"steamid": "76561199487942447", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 494, "last_played": 1699190633}, "language": "english", "review": "cool game\n", "timestamp_created": 1692737951, "timestamp_updated": 1692737951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144808086": {"recommendationid": "144808086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043545999", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1870, "last_played": 1692730155}, "language": "english", "review": "Still a fun game.

It has set the bar for so many games like it such as the recent spider-man games as well as non-superhero games such as Shadow of Mordor. The games story, while basic in the eyes of comic fans and superhero enthusiasts, is a solid way to introduce the characters, world, and lore in a way thar is a breath of fresh air for Batman fans. The gameplay and characters really build this game up in ways that I haven't seen done quite as well since. While some aspects such as the sometimes rigid ways the combat system throws you at enemies or the infamous poison Ivy Boss fight didn't age quite as well they don't hurt the game enough to do anything.

Esto fue terrible para m\u00ed, ya que ya era bastante dif\u00edcil para m\u00ed pasar tiempo con mi hijo, ya que \u00e9l siempre sale con sus amigos o simplemente mira videos en Tiktok. As\u00ed que decid\u00ed crear una cuenta de Steam y comprar este juego para ver si pod\u00eda jugar junto a \u00e9l. Cargu\u00e9 el juego, hice el tutorial pero estaba atascado en lo que se supon\u00eda que deb\u00edas hacer. Le ped\u00ed ayuda a mi hijo y organiz\u00f3 un juego para que yo me uniera. Me encant\u00f3 porque era el mejor momento que hab\u00eda pasado con mi hijo desde que mi esposa hab\u00eda muerto. Desde entonces, este juego ha acercado a mi hijo y a m\u00ed nuevamente y ahora tambi\u00e9n pasamos tiempo juntos fuera de la casa. Este juego me record\u00f3 que hay diversi\u00f3n en todo, y nos ha tra\u00eddo tanto a m\u00ed como a mi hijo muchos recuerdos felices.", "timestamp_created": 1692526486, "timestamp_updated":

Couldn't care less about the IP or superhero stuff in general. The story, admittedly, reinforced the reasons I don't generally care for the genre (vapid 'good' and 'bad' with flimsy backstories which fail to introduce any sense of moral ambiguity, with villains acting that way because \"they're fuckin' mental innit mate\". With that being said, my view on that probably shouldn't be of interest to fans of the franchise, or comics/superheroes generally, and I did enjoy passages about alteration of perception/loss of sanity involving the Scarecrow character.\n\nWhat you do have is an extremely solid action-stealth-fighter thing which caused my eight-hour playthrough to pass in a single sitting without me noticing it had become 2am. It's unusual for games to do all of those aspects well so the fact that you have stealth which feels rewarding when you get it right, intuitive and punchy (no pun intended) fighting mechanics and boss fights which feel (mostly) unique without inventing entirely new mechanics for the player to use is a real positive.\n\nIt's not a long game, but being \u00a314.99 when it's not on sale, it provides excellent VFM nevertheless. For those inclined there are collectables (with discoverable maps hinting at where they are and removing markers when found - I am now going to be disappointed whenever a game has collectables without a system like this), as well as an infinite challenge mode to play wish associated achievements.\n\nIn general, normal difficulty is probably a little on the easy side - I died/failed less than a dozen times during my playthrough and I'm far from an expert - but it also is worth noting that if a player wants to start on hard difficulty (which appears to just be a question of damage scaling), completion achievements dependent on difficulty unlock for every difficulty up to the highest one at once.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1691975350, "timestamp_updated": 1691975350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144134310": {"recommendationid": "144134310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245486772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 642, "last_played": 1691978416}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!

Except Batman Begins and Tim Burton Batman films I did not find any of them anything interesting and I have never read the comics.\n\nLet's start with the positive:\nThe game has an old school feeling, it doesn't guide you to do everything step by step like most modern games and you do need to do some exploration yourself which is something that is missing in modern gaming cause every path and objective is always marked 10000 times to make sure even if you are blind you still see it and won't lose your way to it.\n\nThe scarecrow encounters. These encounters are actually brilliant, it gives you a completely different type of old school 2D platformer feeling in the middle of a 3rd person game and it is basically fantastic and shows a really good game/level design behind it.\n\nThe levels that all the enemies are armed with guns forces you to find a stealth pattern to take them out in correct order and it also gives a lot of creativity to the player which is really impressive.\n\nAnd that is pretty much where the positive ends.\n\nTo the negative:\n1. Close combat is pain in the butt (I played the game on hardest mode) it is extremely punishing if you do one incorrect move during combat and that being said it actually is a good thing but the problem begins with the game not registering your input correctly when you wanna do something else and it does something else and you end up dying to an action you never wanted to make at first place.\nThe close combat moves are really simple and boring and repetitive. There is only one attack button and one parry button and guess what... NO BLOCK button! Yes you heard me right, in a game that is mainly based on melee combat you do not have ANY block button.\n\nNow let's compare other games like Metal Gear Rising to this, that game has stealth but it is not the focus, it is mainly and only designed for close combat and it is older than this game. You have maybe 10 different attack moves and 3 different defensive moves in addition of block button and parry button. And each of them on bound to different inputs not ONE for everything like this hot garbage Batman game here.\n\n2. Locomotion and movement is extremely terrible. Batman is always in \"slow walk\" mood, you are in middle of boss fight and well his default walking style is \"slow walk\" you need to press that sprint button with all your fingers to make sure this batbaby starts to run. And that is if you do not get hit by some goon and get a \"hit reaction\" which resets you back to \"slow walk\" mood and then another goon comes and hits you again and half of the game boss fight turns to you fighting your keyboard to make this sprint work.\n\n3. Level design and boss fights are extremely repetitive. I basically gave up the game right before Poison Ivy boss fight and watched the rest on YouTube to see the story. You get a boss fight with Bane and literally the rest of the boss fights except Ivy is exactly the same, some titan goon attacks you and 20000 minions spawn. Even the final boss fight is the same, Joker turns to titan and the same story again he sends his goons you need to fight the same guys over and over again until you have opportunity to attack himself then repeat for 3 more times.\n\n4.

Boss fights, thought not the main point of the game, are left to be desired ([spoiler] the scarecrow sections, if you consider them a boss battles are pretty much best, second being croc [/spoiler])\n\nStory is good, with some hiccups ranging from nitpicky to major(ending wasnt the end of the world, but it was really a major hiccup for sure). Characters are either very good(Batman, Joker,[spoiler] Scarecrow[/spoiler]) or some are kinda left to rot([spoiler]Bane[/spoiler]).\n\nMusic is okay-ish. There is a LOT of it, but only a few are memorable. The sounds its where its at. Cracking of ribs, the meaty fist fight sounds *chef kiss*. \n\nI do recommend this game.

Although I find Arkham Asylum the least interesting games from Arkham series due to its uninspiring story and quite small and very claustrophobic environment, I also have to cut it some slack since it was the first in the series. It laid out very important grounds for many great gameplay mechanics which worked quite well already in this one.

And of course, all the vocal performances are top notch. \n\nIt's not perfect, the asylum and level design can feel small and very claustrophobic (though you could argue that's the point), gliding is a great mobility tool, but it is very under utilized. And one problem that became annoying for me during the final stretch, is that m WiFi kept disconnecting cause the game to say there was no network connection. Now I'm positive you play this without an internet connection, and the networks features I don't really care about. However the issue was that whenever that happened, it booted me back to the title screen. Which is very annoying if you're doing clean up on the collectibles. And combined with how saving works in this, in that you can only trigger a save by entering a new area/room, then any collectibles that you got after it disconnected and it didn't save, then it resets those collectibles. Which can be annoying. It also made me want a manual save system. \n\nBut other than that, this game still holds up.

However both City and Knight don't replicate the experience that is Arkham Asylum.\n\nRocksteady had originally wanted to start their Batman series with something in the scope of City but Warner Brothers had them scale down to prove themselves first. Within these constraints, Rocksteady settled on the idea of Gotham's infamous Asylum. Because they couldn't create the open world they wanted, they had to wring and squeeze every ounce of content out of this loony bin. And the most suitable game design direction for this was the Metroidvania.\n\nAsylum being a Metroidvania seperates it from the rest of the Arkham series into its own little niche, Nowhere in the rest of the trilogy/quadrilogy do you get an experience quite like this. Throughout the course of this game, which should take on average about 10-12hrs, you will watch the island evolve and adapt as you venture to reclaim it from its tyrants. Poison Ivy will engulf the island in plants and vines, lunatic patients will rush and pounce you, Joker's snipers sweep from the towers, there's never a moment when the island feels static. And with the player backtracking a lot during those 10-12hrs, it better not be.\n\nAtmosphere is important and Asylum isn't lacking. The asylum itself is richly detailed and its level/room design seamlessly interwoven. Asylum is always changing things up so that you never get bored. You'll be stalking a room of goons from gargoyles, escaping the twisted world of Scarecrow, avoiding the jaws of Killer Croc in the sewers, or taking down waves of enemies aiming to knock the lights out of Gotham's savior. Walking around this claustrophobic, creepy ass place as its one and only hope is a feeling you won't get tired of. Especially with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as Batman and Joker. This dynamic acting duo really sell the Batman experience with their incredible performances. The game is also chock full of Batman references, collectibles, and easter eggs that fans of all kinds will greatly enjoy.\n\nThe game's prized exhibition is its gameplay, especially the combat. We're pretty spoiled nowadays but even now, having Batman's belt at your disposal along with his FreeFlow, bone crunching punches and kicks is incredibly satisfying. The Predator system along with the Bat's gadgets allow the player freedom of expression to take down rooms as they see fit. The progression of unlocking gadgets is well paced and never makes the player feel like they couldn't have played without them; only better with them.\n\nThe game does have some downsides and that's only because the later entries just kept getting better. Movement for example is not as fluid as City or Knight. Things like not being able to grapple or dive while you're gliding or the cape having a delay before fanning out after you jump from a cliff/ledge become immediately noticeable to veterans. This also applies to some combat, like the combo takedown animations in FreeFlow being uncannily slow, as well as ground takedowns taking way too long. The combat does feel great, but if you've played later entries, you'll notice that it'll feel a little stiff. Not a bad thing however, because this is Rocksteady level of stiff, which is nitpick status.\n\nI highly recommend you play Arkham Asylum, along with the rest of the Arkham series if you haven't, because each game is better than the last and are prime examples of masterful craftsmanship with visible love for the source material. I recommend you play this game with the Arkham Reborn 4K textures as it'll give this game a much needed face lift as well as color correcting the game to get rid of that god awful green tint that plagued the vanilla version. There are guides on how to do that in the community tab. This game and the rest of the Arkham games go on sale fairly often for a ridiculously cheap price (I got the trilogy for like $6) so you should definitely pick them up.", "timestamp_created": 1691396355, "timestamp_updated": 1691396355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143574940": {"recommendationid": "143574940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798355682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 696, "last_played": 1691399617}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game", "timestamp_created": 1691395498, "timestamp_updated": 1691395498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143572031": {"recommendationid": "143572031", "author": {"steamid": "76561199383828270", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 935, "last_played": 1696082894}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the best superhero games ever made, and it still remains entertaining even after 13 or 14 years.", "timestamp_created": 1691390158, "timestamp_updated": 1691390158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690576672554016113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143567916": {"recommendationid": "143567916", "author": {"steamid": "76561199524391836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 554, "last_played": 1691461433}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent fight mechanics, clever strategy, amazing graphics, and a fantastic story-line make this an incredible game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1691382526, "timestamp_updated": 1691382526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143565265": {"recommendationid": "143565265", "author": {"steamid": "76561199346872258", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2179, "last_played": 1694879328}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished the game to 100% all the way through within 36 hours of play, don't really remember much of it when i was little but still remember bits here and there 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1691378119, "timestamp_updated": 1691378119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143563690": {"recommendationid": "143563690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027282470", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1236, "last_played": 1663540304}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid entry into the modern gaming space for a beloved franchise, Batman: Arkham Asylum puts the best of Batman on display.

like the stealth missions because they felt like a break of pacing but that problem is fixed in Arkham City. although there is no open world the asylum is still very open and it works with the gameplay loop that doesn't get too repetitive. and there are new areas that Arkham Asylum introduces but I did go back to some areas but every time I returned it felt like a different experience every
