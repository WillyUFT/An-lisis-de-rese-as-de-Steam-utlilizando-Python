I strongly advise people over 25 not to play it. The sense of achievement is very low, and it's not entertaining at all. As I progressed, it felt more like a stubborn determination rather than enjoyment. That's why I worked hard to at least clear it once on my own.\n\nThe game seems designed for seasoned Spelunky players. There's no consideration for newcomers or players with less skill.

To be fair, the few issues i have are drops in the bucket compared to what the game does well, but once noticed they never quite go away. \n\nOne annoyance is the world generation, especially for the first area, the Dwelling. World generation in spelunky works on a sort of grid system, with hand created \"rooms\" being strung together randomly (with a few failsafes to ensure the exit is always reachable), and the ones for Dwelling often result in boring and samey levels with pointless dead ends, sometimes having most of the level not even accessible unless you use one of your precious bombs. Even then there's often nothing worth searching for. This issue is somewhat lessened in other areas, but still very much present, and if your hunting for secrets in a few areas, being constantly cut off from what your looking for and needing a bomb or item to get there is tedious.\n\nAnother is the ever known risk of getting \"spelunkyed\". Often Spelunky 2 is rough but fair, rewarding quick thinking and attention, but sometimes it will place you into true no-win situations due to no fault of your own, or a single slip up will send your battered body flying into multiple enemies and traps then finally into a boiling pool of lava, all with no chance of recovery. In these instance the most you can do is try to marvel at how horribly your life was just ended and try again, but if your luck is bad and the game is placing enemies and traps with no remorse it can get annoying.\n\nOne of my last issues involves the new \"Background Caves\" and the fluid dynamics, but is a bit of a nitpick. The fluid dynamics is mostly just interesting, but with lava you can sometimes end up screwed either by your own actions, or random things just happening around you (this ties in to the concept of getting spelunkyed). Meanwhile the background caves are just sort of... there. often they have nothing of interest, the small ones often having nothing but a bat or two, while the large ones MAY have a special shop. However, the shops include a caveman run shop who sells rocks and skulls more often then not, and while the other shop you can run into often has a few choice items for grabs the actual chances of FINDING the entrance to the back caves is seemingly totally luck based (I have seen nothing online about there being ANY way to reliably find the things if they exit past getting a bit lucky with an exposed entrance, if a way exists i dont know it)\n\nI front-loaded this review with the things that annoyed me, but i think my hours played can attest to what i think of the game overall. If you think you reach the skill floor for this game (I recommend starting out not really caring too much about finding secrets or playing perfect, just start building your skills to see if you can git gud) and are interested in this type of game, I 100% endorse this one and recommend you buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1699760164, "timestamp_updated": 1699760164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my husband had died.

I would, however like to stress that this frustration does not last as you will find yourself immersed in the never ending, never the same, side-winding caves that make up the fabric of this very game.\n\nAnother thing I would like to say about this video game is that losing to the game is a core part of the learning experience, and the main reason I do not play this game any more. There are plenty of players in Spelunky 2 which have completed the 7-99 challenge which is referred to as the highest accomplishment in this game! I am not one of these people and if you can see by the amount of time I have played this game, it's a rather sorry ordeal. Do not let this put you off from trying to beat the 7-99 challenge yourself though!\n\nThe core gameplay loop of Spelunky 2 offers a wide range of choices when it comes to your approach to how you play the game. You can choose to be fast and get the best time on the leaderboards or you can play slow and methodical to try and achieve a high score. The lightning-fast response time coded into the games mechanics offers a clean, consistent and fun game experience. The ways in which you can tackle each obstacle presented to you in a given level are almost limitless.\n\nThe art style of the game presents itself as an easy to look at, easy to understand interface in which you can decipher where you are in the game world with little to no effort. The jovial and childlike elements to the approach on the art side of things makes this game very accessible to all demographics of people.\n\nThe sound design present in Spelunky 4 is pleasant at times and at other times, leaves a lot to be desired. The soundtracks in this game are well composed, as the artists behind the soundtrack in Spelunky 6 is also the same one in Spelunky 3.\nEirik Suhrke's music is some of my favourite video game music in the original Spelunky, however I feel that due to the more atmospheric and ambient approach to the soundtrack in the new game, it lacks a certain charm which was found in Spelunky HD.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to say that this game is one of the games of all time. Spelunky 2 presents itself as one of the most challenging games of all time while also not taking itself too seriously. The developer himself, Derek Yu, maintains the viewpoint that this game is akin to that of a permanent learning experience where every death within the game is part of the game play loop, seeing which new wacky and funny way to die, one after the other.\n\nIf you are a person who enjoys a fun and casual experience, you should try this game because you will realise when you are not having fun anymore, you'll stop, like a normal person. However if you are a masochist you won't stop, and you'll continue to play the game for almost 1000 hours like me, all the while having nothing to show for it.\n\nThank you for reading my comprehensive review on Spelunky 2077.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1694696785, "timestamp_updated": 1694696785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584741115570068359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146258057": {"recommendationid": "146258057", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089155636", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 27048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 528, "playtime_at_review": 23200, "last_played": 1700733053}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no lo jueguen\n", "timestamp_created": 1694659241, "timestamp_updated": 1694659241, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146235853": {"recommendationid": "146235853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366062020", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6725, "last_played": 1698608999}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1694627053, "timestamp_updated": 1694627053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146227974": {"recommendationid": "146227974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008747892", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4808, "last_played": 1694617634}, "language": "english", "review": "Best platformer/rogue-like of all time.

The biggest issue - this game feels like it expects more out of its players than its devs are willing to put in.\n\nThis is for many reasons. Spelunky HD was punishing, and technically has its own issues, but after wrapping your head around it, Spelunky HD becomes very completable in a campy way (learning [spoiler]that you always should go for the worm sword if you're doing a secret route run, and figuring out how to game the pathing on the ghosts to generate enough money to complete a secret run without too much RNG.[/spoiler]). Also, Spelunky HD had multiple soundtracks that would generate for each level. Not so here.\n\nSpelunky HD's level design felt experimental, Spelunky 2's level design feels at times bloated, sometimes bad. With Spelunky HD, the [spoiler]mothership level is pretty much worthless except for very specific things, but it's a single stage that's easy to ignore.[/spoiler] With Spelunky 2 they throw in [spoiler]an entire temple world which is more difficult than the other world options, with no better rewards--but they do this sometime after giving a world selection choice in the same style that is actually meaningful[/spoiler]. Including the [spoiler] temple world [/spoiler], as it is, is touted like a feature, rather than an ugly piece of game design that should have been heavily reworked as soon as playtesting was underway.\n\nThe official devs have made excuse threads on Reddit about why there isn't a chat feature in multiplayer, trying to convince others to use their official discord as a 3rd party tool for communication on their game, and this is a problem. Why might a chat feature be important? Here's a very real example; if you use random lobbies to try and see more of the game for yourself than you could solo, eventually you'll get to some secret stuff, specifically with [spoiler] one room in the final world where a giant countdown may appear. This happens when at least one of the players initiates a boss rush, for extra HP. If you make the mistake of thinking that you need to leave before the numbers reach zero, you will be ~permanently hated by your lobby[/spoiler]. The ability to shoot off emoticons, and/or specific other messages, perhaps only unlocked after entering World 3 (to prevent spam and redundancy, the early levels should become muscle memory) would have been nice idea, but we do not have this here.\n\nIf you complete a multiplayer game in the style mentioned above, you will not receive the ending achievement. It would be nice if there was a multiplayer-specific separate achievement that the game could award, for seeing the ending this way - it would encourage this playstyle (using multiplayer with experienced players to figure out the levels). You could even build on this idea by giving out achievements to seasoned players for showing new players new sections of the map (would encourage participation in random lobbies). No such luck. Spelunky HD had an issue of not giving out incremental achievements for items between the normal and hard runs of the game, this issue is compounded here. INB4 \"of course the game doesn't have to give you anything for *several* hours of your time if you don't win, it's a roguelike,\" plenty of other roguelikes give you *something* for your work.\n\nDerek Yu would rather embark on book tours about how he reinvented game design than he would dedicate himself to crafting the perfect game. Spelunky HD was lightning in a bottle. Spelunky 2, aside from a quick run-through for visual and comparative purposes, isn't worth the effort. It's not worth returning to.", "timestamp_created": 1691357608, "timestamp_updated": 1691358600, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722",

I would not say it is the most \"fun\" i've had, but it is definitely infinitely entertaining. This is a game, perfect for those with a limited temperament who want a challenge (you WILL be infuriated). The roguelike genre of the game gives it infinite replay-ability, and since every round is pretty short, unless you're a god at the game, dying just takes you back a few minutes, and therefore you don't really lose anything by dying. Hours fly by in an instant as your brain plays an infinite chorus of \"one more round\".

The gold and gems, shopkeepers, bombs and items, physics, the dynamic procedurally generated levels are addictive and make you want to keep coming back to play. Co-op multiplayer both couch and online works well, and I can have a lot of fun playing with friends. However, over a broad time period of playing the game, the negatives seems to always outweigh the positives, and I end up getting frustrated and wonder why I keep playing. My problem with the game is really only in two areas which if fixed would make the game a lot more fair and a lot more fun. I don't mind difficulty, and I don't mind instant deaths, but for a game to be fun it should have good controls and be fair. \n\n1) The controls are terrible. 1/3 of the things you do in this game end up being accidental because of horrible controls. \nA) Player movement is extremely clunky and not analog. Why is a game designed for modern consoles in 2020 using a control scheme of digital pad with hold R to go faster? If the developers only want to have 2 movement speeds, just let the Joystick slightly pressed be 1 speed and joypad 50% or further be the running speed. I don't understand why they have to make the game so clunky and uncontrollable where holding and unholding R just to get the correct speed is required to do basic things... (one speed is useless to get over obstacles, but is uncontrollable in close combat, making you unnecessarily run into enemies and spikes). Mario for SNES in 1983 had better controls. \nB) Throwing items is a complete crapshoot and half the time you have no idea where the thing you are throwing is going to land. Up throw, hit the ceiling riccochet off and kills you. Throw standing still, flies super far and over the thing you're aiming at. Throw down, flies too far to the right. Basic bomb, flies through enemies and way too far behind blowing up a shop keeper in a room you can't even see. Some items fly in a forward arc, some items fly diagonally and up to the right even when holding right. Why would you make the game so frustrating? Again even Mario from 1983 had predictable throw patterns that made the game skill based and fun to play, not random and causing game ending accidents that are 100% due to shitty controls. \nC) Who the hell would ever come up with a gameplay mechanic that punishes the player and makes them drop the item they are carrying if you stand near an edge for a few seconds? Easy answer: a developer who is trying to piss people off. \nD) Why does the whip have to have a .5 second delay to hit???? This mechanic is so stupid and frustrating to no end. A basic enemy can hit you if it appears before your stupid whip has enough time to hit them. \n\n2) Fix the stun bullshit in this game!! It makes zero sense that enemies stunned can't be hurt, but you can get stunlocked by enemies and chain hit with no way to struggle, and press buttons or move the joystick to wake up. Pick one or the other! Stun while hit or invincibility while stunned. The best option would be to just remove the stupid stun mechanic completely from the game.

Each level is randomised, and belongs to an area which defines its enemies, hazards, merits and appearance. It has amazing replay value and multiplayer (Co-op and PVP). Gameplay is frustrating and quite difficult, but nonetheless very enjoyable.\n\nGraphics: Nice\nSpelunky 2 has unique, stylised graphics. They are not beautiful, but they are above passable and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the game.\n\nAudio: Also Nice\nThe soundtrack is very good, not as good as Spelunky HD but nonetheless acceptable. It also matches the game well.\n\nPlot: Satisfactory\nNearly all items, areas, characters and bosses have a degree of lore. Lore is not rich, but it is funny and fairly consistent (rarely seems clunky or patchy). Most characters have an actual legitimate reason to be in the mines. Spelunky 2 retains original lore, though it is greatly expanded upon.\n\nThemes: Very Mild\nIncludes animated blood droplets and a Hindu goddess (Kali) that you can sacrifice things to. You can kill things like snakes and bats. Shop keepers are capable of being robbed as well as dying (and yes, being killed), though the second two can be hard to achieve. Barely any dark themes. Watch the intro, anything you might consider inappropriate would most likely be featured in it.\n\nVery well done game, still reminiscent of the original but both expanded and refined.\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1688700559, "timestamp_updated": 1689858164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551200032234191895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141490764": {"recommendationid": "141490764", "author": {"steamid": "76561199093031964", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "playtime_at_review": 9259, "last_played": 1699914597}, "language": "english", "review": "the best 2d platforming roguelike i have ever played, this game is super hard and i love it more and more every run.", "timestamp_created": 1688693919, "timestamp_updated": 1688693919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141486267": {"recommendationid": "141486267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855301432", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 155, "playtime_at_review": 5022, "last_played": 1700689728}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: Try this game and don't let what people say dissuade you.\n\nPeople are afraid of Spelunky; thinking it's too hard, too luck-based, too bullshit, too scary, etc. From playing this game as much as I have, I can understand why people think that. However, I also believe that those people could not be more wrong. This game is fun at every turn. It's always new, always exciting, always entertaining, and the engine it runs in allows for an endless amount of creativity and ease. Movement feels very precise and smooth. Enemies feel very balanced and are fun to interact with. The game will present you with puzzles with multiple solutions and you, as the player, can decide which routes to take to solve them.

Also an odd choice, the 4th level isn't procedurally generated, making it a bit of a grind after 5 or 10 games.\n\nIf you're a superhuman who can speedrun Spelunky 1 then this review doesn't apply to you.

cosa que prolonga tu estancia en la experiencia pero que nunca trivializa el desaf\u00edo del juego.\n\nSin embargo, es una recomendaci\u00f3n cautelosa por su alto grado de dificultad, Spelunky 2 es uno de los pocos juegos que, aun siendo extremadamente dif\u00edciles, no encuentro frustrante ni tedioso; a lo largo de la experiencia el jugador puede desbloquear atajos que te permiten ignorar partes iniciales del juego sin tener que necesariamente sucumbir a la frustraci\u00f3n de sentirte como si realmente no estas desarrollando alg\u00fan tipo de progreso.\n\nEn general, es un excelente juego, uno de los mejores que he jugado, pero tambi\u00e9n uno de los m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles.\n", "timestamp_created": 1688440552, "timestamp_updated": 1688693126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141259698": {"recommendationid": "141259698", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122404679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14329, "last_played": 1696376346}, "language": "english", "review": "thelunky", "timestamp_created": 1688436951, "timestamp_updated": 1688436951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141249488": {"recommendationid": "141249488", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963372320", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 11097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 149, "playtime_at_review": 10439, "last_played": 1700345753}, "language": "english", "review": "I am re-writing my review. You see, initially, I f u c k i n g hated the new things. Most notably the cave moles and the horned lizards. It was my estimation that the entire game sucked, and there was really nothing great about it. But after many hours of the first Spelunky, I decided that I should at least try to beat both of the games. After that I started looking some things up that I was a bit clueless on, like how Olmec worked and things like that. I started to have a bit of fun once I knew how the game worked. It has since grown on me.\n\nI can't say I recommend it, for a few reasons, even though I really like it for the most part;\n1. The art style is f u c k i n g horrendous compared to the first one. Absolutely contrived.\n\n2. The music is if it were composed by someone with Parkinson's who had just been struck in the head by a giant wrecking ball.\n\n3. Most of the characters have some of the most boring designs ever devised by humans.\n\n4. It's just not Spelunky HD. \n\nSpelunky HD is my personal favorite, and Spelunky 2 just doesn't quite match up the way I would have expected it to.

The only memories of the original Spelunky I had was when I was a child; I played it once on my PS Vita, didn't like it, and got a refund. That was so long ago, however. My opinions had to have changed, right?\n\n[h1]The Review[/h1]\nThe things I like about the roguelike genre is that\n[olist]\n[*] You can do anything... If you want to steal the items from the shopkeeper you can, but you'll probably get killed.\n[*] The game tells you nothing. You have to figure things yourself. It was cool to see that [spoiler]I could blow up a turkey with a bomb to get an item that restores one health.[/spoiler]\n[/olist]\n\nEverything in this game can kill you. Threw a rock upwards to try and disarm that trap? Well, the rock has now fallen down right in your face, and you just lost a hit point. This game is extremely difficult, and that is not an overexaggeration. You will die [b]a lot[/b]. As of writing this review I did not make it to the third world yet.\n\nThe game is incredibly fun, however. The satisfaction from discovering a technique or a feature in the game to use to your advantage is a good feeling, as well as the confidence you feel when you are starting to get the hang of it (...only for it to be crushed by a poorly misplaced skeleton).\n\nSo should you play this game? It depends on the type of person you are. I will admit that this game is not for everyone.\nI don't get mad whenever I lose in a video game, but that likely makes me part of a minority. If an arcade platformer game with randomly generated levels and where you will die to the most silly chain of events sounds interesting to you, go ahead and try it.", "timestamp_created": 1688160749, "timestamp_updated": 1688160761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141000845": {"recommendationid": "141000845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055069798", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1568, "last_played": 1696616584}, "language": "english", "review": "Very tightly-made platformer, consistent rules and fair challenge", "timestamp_created": 1688158113, "timestamp_updated": 1688158113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140973171": {"recommendationid": "140973171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377670037", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 10648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5472, "last_played": 1699073660}, "language": "english", "review": "Kinda tricky to get into but fun to get good at.

(out of 6 to 7 depending on your choices in the game and many secret/bonus areas) I highly recommend to any person who likes rogue-likes or enjoys platforming titles, however I wasn't much into either genre until playing this game and came out loving the game!", "timestamp_created": 1686198171, "timestamp_updated": 1686198171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139712036": {"recommendationid": "139712036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178276446", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 9072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9029, "last_played": 1697667431}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is good, but i am bad\nbuy spelunky 2, this game is rad\ni love to die on dewlling 1\ngetting impaled on spikes is very fun\n(thanks for listening to my rap)", "timestamp_created": 1686182382, "timestamp_updated": 1686182382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139708495": {"recommendationid": "139708495", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023873554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 19887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19095, "last_played": 1693702789}, "language": "english", "review": "there are not enough words to describe just how fun this game is", "timestamp_created": 1686175483, "timestamp_updated": 1686175483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139707862": {"recommendationid": "139707862", "author": {"steamid": "76561199487471363", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1686174714}, "language": "english", "review": "fk, this game", "timestamp_created": 1686174322, "timestamp_updated": 1686174322, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139680761": {"recommendationid": "139680761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059827827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9738, "last_played": 1698728540}, "language": "english", "review": "digital manifestation of chaos theory", "timestamp_created": 1686133089, "timestamp_updated": 1686133089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139668612": {"recommendationid": "139668612", "author": {"steamid": "76561199104091833", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1115, "last_played": 1700188534}, "language": "english", "review": "this game has put me on suicide watch but in it's defense you can pet the rodent :)", "timestamp_created": 1686104744, "timestamp_updated": 1686104744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139666847": {"recommendationid": "139666847", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180575225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 272, "playtime_at_review": 4171, "last_played": 1700714160}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanna die", "timestamp_created": 1686101335, "timestamp_updated": 1686101335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139665250": {"recommendationid": "139665250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079163569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1692310239}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun, and probably one of the most difficult games I will ever play.

I would compare the learning process of Spelunky 2 to rolling dice. As your base of knowledge and muscle memory grows, you begin to roll more and more dice every time you play the game. First couple runs you die easily, to a single factor, because you had only one or two dice to bet on and rolled poorly. By the time you have hundreds of hours, you'll have 50 dice in the game, and know how to use what you get, what to place your bets on. Yet even with all of that being taken into account, sometimes you bet on the wrong die, and sometimes everything comes up snake eyes.\n\nA painful game to learn, for certain, but a rewarding one.

feels like a try-hard version of the first game, where too many mechanics/difficulty were inflated for the sake of it. \n\nHit rules are inconsistent (you get hit multiple times in a row and always take damage even if stunned, but enemies get invincibility frames after one hit). The first game was also like this but Spelunky 2 ups the ante to ridiculous levels by increasing enemy spawning to uncontrolable levels.\n\nEnemies like the mole or the armadillo can basically stunlock you to death regardless of your heath points. I have had armadillos kill me at 10HP because they stunlock me with roll attacks or launch me from one side of the level to the other onto spikes due to the poor physics.\n\nI feel the random generation of the levels themselves has also gotten worse. level paths are often blocked by enemy placements that make it impossible to progress without taking damage or outright block the way forward unless you can use bombs or ropes, which often means you do not start with enough resources.\n\nAll of these are problems that the first game already had but which were made worse in this sequel.

Expands upon the original Spelunky and refines it's mechanics.  [/h1]\n\n[b] Actual Review (No Spoilers): [/b] What can I say? This game is just about the best possible sequel to Spelunky we could've asked for. Spelunky 2 takes the formula from the the first game (Spelunky HD that is) and refines it down to the best possible version it can be. The movement is extremely fluid, The whip feels better than ever (especially backwhipping) and the game overall just feels so satisfying to play and learn. There's a real sense of reward as you get good enough to discover each subsequent area, and almost the entire roster of enemies and items all feel unique and fun to fight/use.\n\nI can't gush about this game enough, especially if you have friends to play it with, as it offers a different and hilarious experience. My first few hours in this game were with friends and I think that's the best possible thing you can do to get yourself into the game. Discovering all the game has to offer and laugh out loud at all the moments that you could have never predicted.\n\nIf there is one single thing to complain about with this game is unlike HD, deaths and other happenings in Spelunky 2 aren't always the fault of the player. In the first game, nearly if not 100% of all things that go wrong are the player's fault, no matter how bullshit they may seem (that's one of the reasons why it's a perfect game) But in Spelunky 2, there is a lot more that happens that feels completely out of the player's control. Altars for example can straight up just spawn in a way that they will instantly be destroyed upon loading into a level. There's various other things that you can just sum up as \"getting spelunky'd\" but despite all that, the vast majority of things in the game still have player-dependent outcomes. Which is why it feels so rewarding to play.\n\nI also should talk about the music. Spelunky HD had some BANGIN tracks and this game is no different. Definitely more atmospheric than HD but the thing is there is only one long track for each area that dips in and out of each level. In HD, there were multiple different songs that could play for each of the 4 levels in an area which gave some variety, but even without that, Spelunky 2 has some great music.\n\n\nLastly, going for 100% achievements is certainly a grind. But despite the insane difficulty of it, it was actually one of my favorites to date. I got all my friends into this game at the same time so there was a very organic learning curve that we all went through at the same time which gave me more of a drive than normal to complete this game. Definitely worth it if you're willing to put in the time, especially for some of the harder achievements where you're pretty much at the mercy of having good spawns and the right items in the shops.\n\nOverall this game is well worth full price and then some. Especially if you're going for completion, you'll learn the ins and outs of every area, enemy, item, and pretty much every interaction in the game. You'll master advanced tactics like bomb chucking and ledge whipping, and even get good at speedrunning just for good measure. Spelunky 2 is the full package and is a blast any way you look at it. 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1685239139, "timestamp_updated": 1685239139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Spelunky 2 is one of the most difficult video games of all time. It is, in my opinion, also one of the greatest of all time. There is so much to do in this game, and having to adapt every run to new challenges and obstacles makes the game extremely replayable. The existence of alternate paths, secrets, choices and everything else all comes together and truly creates a one of a kind experience. It's your choice to either attack an enemy or just jump over it and carry on. When you die, it's for good. And it usually happens rather quickly. The learning curve on this game is very steep, it definitely helps to have played the previous game. However, anyone has the capability to achieve great things with practice and patience.

No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!\n-Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a \u00bc teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.\n-Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it\u2019s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you\u2019d prefer).\n-Spinach (variation): To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.\n-Boil pasta: Cook in a large pot of salted water per the recipe below.\n-Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.\n-Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.\n-Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.\nSpread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9\u00d713 pan. Add a layer of noodles.\nTop the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce\nCover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.\nOnce you have prepared the meat sauce and the cheese mixture, you\u2019re ready to layer.

"language": "english", "review": "this is not a game, [b] it is a disease [/b] \n\nit's a dark, accursed, festering cesspool of broken hearts and forsaken dreams. a blightful place where a man's vitality and mental stability are drained to the point any memory of it is forever lost, and any hope for a better future is unceremoniously skewered in the same bloodied spikes countless naive explorers unwillingly sacrificed themselves along with their sanity. \n\nSpelunky's adorable artstyle hides a sinister deadly trap. behind the game's never ending promises of new secrets, treasures, and colorful NPC companions lies a snare that will not only cost the player its soul, but also the soul of any acquaintance who's unfortunate enough to hear their friend's desperate wailing and proceed to defy all warnings just to try their own luck in this ever hungry tormenting ground. \n\neverything in Spelunky 2 interacts amongst itself in a completely dynamic way. everything can be picked up, everything can be moved or destroyed, everything collides, everything reacts differently to specific stimuli, everything has a purpose, and that purpose is to make you suffer. sure it can also lead to countless other randomly generated chain-effect spectacles in this marvelous physics playground but make no mistake, the single main objective of every animated pixel in Spelunky is to ruin your life. \n\nSpelunky 2 has no fancy storyline or heroic duty to be fulfilled. you are a cute, round-nosed little girl in a yellow jacket looking for mom and dad in an ever changing sequence of dungeons that you are meant to freely explore until you reach the last boss or, realistically speaking, die horribly. and die you shall, not in the Dark Souls context of \"die until you learn enough and become sufficiently skilled to master the challenges at hand\", no. here you will die, again and again, forever. without ever becoming the master of anything other than your own screams of desperation.\n\npeople often ask themselves \"at what point exactly do you become good at Spelunky?\" and here's the secret, you don't. this is the genius of it all. the more you play, the more you learn. and the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know. along the dozens of hours sunken and the mountains of lifeless carcasses left behind, you will uncover all sorts of techniques. soon, you will be whipping dart trap arrows midair, handling awful item spawns with trickshot bomb throws, effortlessly robbing shopkeepers unscathed, and all of that will amount to absolutely nothing. because each personal improvement on your playstyle will be greeted by a new way for the game to murder you in the blink of an eye. \n\nyou will be boasting an uncanny amount of health points and riches, holding a vast arsenal of exquisite items, wielding mighty armament that can lay waste to any living thing on your path, and soaring with your jetpack as if you were a god in human clothes... only to be struck in the back by a mosquito, land on a thorned vibe, thrown into the stratosphere by a witch doctor's attack while you're still recovering from the fall, and finally end down on the dirt, where a tiki man will stunlock you against a wall with his boomerang for the next 30 seconds before a carnivorous plant comes to feed on your bruised corpse. this is it, this is your adventure's ultimate reward.\n\nyou cannot beat Spelunky, because the game was not meant to be beaten. i don't mean that it's impossible to get to the end credits. but by the time you manage to gather enough resources and know-how in order to make it to the last boss you won't be even remotely interested in doing such a thing because all you'll be able to think about is what's behind the secret door in the secret egypt level, which can only be unlocked with the secret accessory purchased in the secret black market whose entrance needs to be located with the aid of the secret artifact from stage one. \n\ndo you understand me now? sure, everything in Spelunky 2 is achievable. everything, except the thing you actually want to do. and what you're currently interested in doing will always change halfway through the journey of what you originally set to accomplish. the more you progress, the more you realize is yet to be discovered and coveted. this is the diabolical twist that keeps the cogs turning in this asymmetrical maze of perpetual disgrace.  \n\nthis ceaseless yearning and relentless pursuit of the unobtainable has had a devastating effect on my person. i became dismissive not only of my sleep schedule, my meals, and my social relations but also of the very games i consume. there was a point in time where i had access to two of the most anticipated titles of my life, legendary staples none other than \"God of War: Ragnarok\" and \"Elden Ring\", and yet, all i could dedicate my free time with a controller on hands was Spelunky. cutting-edge graphics and majestic visuals didn't matter, fascinating storytelling and next-generation combat mechanics didn't matter, rich lore and remarkable voice acting didn't matter. all that mattered... was Spelunky.\n\ni often wonder about Spelunky's lead developer and his creative genius. i anxiously pray to whatever god may hear me that i never happen to come across him. for i strive to be a man of peace, and meeting Derek Yu in the real world would mean an unavoidable crash course with cold barbaric violence. this is what Spelunky has reduced me to. a wandering, dust covered, frenzied beast that mindlessly charges toward the next contraption that will inevitably end my life.\n\nthis game tells you very little, even its codex only provides vague descriptions of symbolic nature leaving the rest for the player to figure out during his ordeal. however, one of the first things the game tells you is that time and death work differently in the labyrinth. essentially a sugar-coated way of saying that you will lose all notion of time as you continue to walk this house of horrors, and that you shall never find any resemblance of comfort nor relief not even in the sweet embrace of death. you'll devolve into a hollowed husk of raw frustration and denial, frantically attempting to vent all of your untamed hatred at the nearest ragdoll of the abomination this game dares to call an earth mole.  \n\nis Spelunky 2 a masterfully crafted roguelike and an exceptional gem of a game that excels in all departments?\nYes.\nis it one of the most thrilling and all-around entertaining products i have ever come across?\nAbsolutely.\nis it worthy of me recommending it to other people so they too may dive into this bottomless chasm of cyclic psychological abuse and self-indulgent masochism?\nNo.\n\ni beg of you, steer clear from this place. sweep all thoughts of this game from your mind and never look back on it. for the only happiness that's in reach of those who have already been swallowed by this nightmare where we continue to atone for every sin committed in mankind's history, is the soothing thought of having spared others from the same wretched fate.\n", "timestamp_created": 1682887110,

Great series and I have 80 hours on HD and many more on classic. Even though i consider myself a good and talented player the random generation and raw challenge of the game is what makes it still fun to play today. :)\n\nEdit: Im not sure how much more runs it will take but i have started doing more CO attempts, this is after a short break from the game and it feels like a brand new experience going for the co. I managed to complete a no-gold run and it was on of the most rewarding things when i got the achievement. This is something great about the game, you can still get a rewarding experience from playing level by level and still having a good takeaway opinion of the game.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, created my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he sat down with me and helped me figure out how to play. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I mean it's true game as we 80s kids LOVE! Definitely buy it if you love challenges!\n2. Lode Runner meets Indiana Jones meets Minecraft. Without mining and crafting. Put a grain of RNG in this and sip some Isaac then let cook at INSANELY HIGH temperqatures. \n3. GREAT [who cares about it] STORY, fits in the universe.\n4. The \"Beta\" online multiplayer is far beyond what AAA companies call \"beta\" nowadays. Unless you have toaster PC.\n5. Influential game. In my game ColorBlend FX the amount of Spelunky references is unmatched. Spelunky is THAT damn good, and I really can't stress enough how I love this game.\n6. Great developers and great designer! Derek, mush love. NWDD you too <3\n7. Excellent community and even though the game have no official modding support, the modding scene actually makes the game. The developers even allow you to play custom level packs online with your friends\n8... im getting too tired about writing this... \n\n[b]KEY CONS:[/b]\n1. It's HARD! I mean it's true game as we 80s kids LOVE! Only buy it if you love challenges!\n2. If you still consider 1 a con, and only like AAA/shooters, then go away newb!\n3. If you didnt felt insulted by 2, at least TRY the game. Steam Remote Play for example...\n4. If you still didnt tried the game somehow, try it.\n5. If the game really feels hard for you, then i forfeit, you defeated me, it's a horrible game for you but that's just you, not my issue :D\n6. Uhm... more cons??? Have to think... There's none! Even the game bugs make the game instead of breaking it.

Not only an in-game journey, exploring new levels, finding cool items, etc. but also a personal journey in which I had to overcome both mental and physical hurdles to get to where I\u2019m at today. Defeating Hundun has to be one of my favorite accomplishments in gaming and one that will mark the end of a journey that I barely thought possible.

denial helps us minimize the overwhelming pain of loss. As we process the reality of our loss, we are also trying to survive emotional pain. It can be hard to believe we have lost an important person in our lives, especially when we may have just spoken with them the previous week or even the previous day.\n\nDuring this stage in grieving, our reality has shifted completely. It can take our minds time to adjust to our new reality. We reflect on the experiences we've shared with the person we lost, and we might find ourselves wondering how to move forward in life without this person.\n\nThis is a lot of information to explore and a lot of painful imagery to process. Denial attempts to slow this process down and take us through it one step at a time, rather than risk the potential of feeling overwhelmed by our emotions.\n\nAnger\nThe second stage in grieving is anger. We are trying to adjust to a new reality and are likely experiencing extreme emotional discomfort. There is so much to process that anger may feel like it allows us an emotional outlet.\n\nKeep in mind that anger does not require us to be very vulnerable. However, it may feel more socially acceptable than admitting we are scared. Anger allows us to express emotion with less fear of judgment or rejection.\n\nAnger also tends to be the first thing we feel when starting to release emotions related to loss. This can leave us feeling isolated in our experience. It can also cause us to be perceived as unapproachable by others in moments when we could benefit from comfort, connection, and reassurance.\n\n\nBargaining\nWhen coping with loss, it isn't unusual to feel so desperate that you are willing to do anything to alleviate or minimize the pain. During this stage in grieving, you may try to bargain to change the situation, agreeing to do something in return for being relieved of the pain you feel.\n\nWhen bargaining starts to take place, we often direct our requests to a higher power, or something bigger than us that may be able to influence a different outcome. Bargaining during the grieving process can come in the form of a variety of promises, including:\n\n\"God, if you can heal this person, I will turn my life around.\"\n\"I promise to be better if you will let this person live.\"\n\"I'll never get angry again if you can stop him/her from dying or leaving me.\"\n\nBargaining comes from a feeling of helplessness and gives us a perceived sense of control over something that feels so out of control. During bargaining, we tend to focus on our personal faults or regrets. We might look back at our interactions with the person we are losing and note all the times we felt disconnected or may have caused them pain.\n\nIt is common to recall times when we may have said things we did not mean and wish we could go back and behave differently. We also sometimes make the drastic assumption that if things had played out differently, we would not be in such an emotionally painful place in our lives.\n\n\nDepression\nDuring our experience of processing grief, there comes a time when our imaginations calm down and we slowly start to look at the reality of our present situation. Bargaining no longer feels like an option and we are faced with what is happening.\n\nIn this stage of grieving, we start to feel the loss of our loved one more abundantly. Our panic begins to subside, the emotional fog begins to clear, and the loss feels more present and unavoidable.\n\nIn those moments, we tend to pull inward as the sadness grows. We might find ourselves retreating, being less sociable, and reaching out less to others about what we are going through. Although this is a very natural stage in the grieving process, dealing with depression after the loss of a loved one can be extremely isolating.\n\n\nAcceptance\nThe last of the 5 Stages of Grief is acceptance. When we come to a place of acceptance, it is not that we no longer feel the pain of loss.

One of my favorites, it's nearly perfect. On the other hand, Spelunky 2 is a great game, but it fails to capture the same feelings of mystery and adventure as Spelunky HD. I like it a lot, but there were points where I wanted to stop playing. \n\nWhat I loved: Figuring out the secrets! There's just enough clues for an experienced Spelunky HD player to piece together most of the secrets. This was the highlight of the game for me. I also like the graphics, the smooth animations and the tighter movement feel.\n\nComplaints: Like many others, I think that the first area is a chore to get through. Other than that, I hate how underwhelming the \"casual\" ending is - it offers no sense of accomplishment - instead lulling you towards the much, much harder endings. Dying is also not very fun in this game - maybe I just need to learn to laugh it off. This game cannot be played casually, though. You have to focus, and maintain that focus for a long time. To see all the build-up to a good run go down the drain just because you lost focus for a millisecond  is not fun, and sometimes it's not even your fault!\n\nAll that said, despite all the frustration and pain, all the boredom of getting through the dwellings, I kept coming back.

The game play itself is fun but it's just too frustrating to die to something falling from offscreen killing you, an alien explosion angering the shopkeep, or getting hit once into getting combed by other things that kill you. I did beat Tiammat using the frosty caves checkpoint after having to look up how to beat her but it just didn't feel satisfying like other difficult games do. Theres some mechanics I think are fun and have a good bit of depth like stealing from the store and killing the shopkeeper or trying to leave him alive to be forgiven but theres also just some that are impossible to figure out without looking them up like the moyai statue.

The game is, at it's core, some sadist's way to dealing with the fact that they were relentlessly bullied in school and is using this game to exact revenge on the anyone dumb enough to play it.  At least, that's what it feels like.  I recommend you play with a friend, that way being killed OVER AND OVER by the game's chickensh!t mechanics are not as frustrating.  I repeat, DO NOT PLAY ALONE.  You will want to break your controller after about 15 minutes of play.  Also,  I really hope you like the first biome as you'll be spending almost all of your time there.  That's why I hesitate to recommend it.  It's relentless, unforgiving and there is no difficulty curve.  It starts a 11, rips the knob off and runs away with it...and then goes up from there.  As a programmer, I can say that it's not RNG that screws you up but the design itself.  There is no way some of the Rube-Goldberg-like series of events (throw a rock, have it bounce off something off screen, spring an arrow trap which hits you, knock you down a pit and you get stun locked but a punching trap) is random.  It has to be carefully designed to screw you over and it is.  The player stun lasts too long, the enemy stun is too short, the whip has a laughably short range and stunned enemies take less damage where as player takes full damage while stunned.

I find this game highly intuitive and very fun. The gameplay is very interesting but it is easy for new players to understand. Although the cave systems may look hard to get around it is ultimately really easy. As you play the game the levels and worlds get harder to play and there are different mechanics. You may die a lot but you can always come back. The bosses are absolutely INSANE and there are a lot of secret achievements and a multitude of possibilities. As you can see i only have 40+ hours so I'm kind of new at this as well but I can say that I have had a great time. This is a game I will never ever give up no matter how hard it gets. There is also a really really cute animal that gives u little hearts when you bring her to the door (I personally like the cat but there's also a dog and hamster). \n\nSincerely Signed,\nGamer", "timestamp_created": 1672616733, "timestamp_updated": 1672616733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503267943859100342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129896318": {"recommendationid": "129896318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133962502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 386, "last_played": 1695786152}, "language": "english", "review": "spelunk or be spelunked", "timestamp_created": 1672616713, "timestamp_updated": 1672616713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129887517": {"recommendationid": "129887517", "author": {"steamid": "76561199220671252", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1692752280}, "language": "english", "review": "is great to play with friends", "timestamp_created": 1672608110, "timestamp_updated": 1672608110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129885088": {"recommendationid": "129885088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152147114", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 729, "last_played": 1689867276}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you ever wanted to spelunk but 2?

I got to the forest level/near the end of it so I never beat the game. I did die/instant restart A LOT in 3 hours which I don't mind. Dying a lot is fine but again... the game just doesn't seem to have anything that makes it fun.\n\nThe combat feels very one dimensional (I know its a platformer). There are way too many 1 shot kill traps as well. People recommended looking up YouTube videos to see how to \"play better\" but honestly that shouldn't be necessary. The game's tutorial mostly shows you how to move around but explains nothing about the games mechanics, goals, etc. From what I am reading I am guessing this game was mostly just made for people who already played the 1st one.\n\nThere is also no unlock/meta progression. You just start a new run and see what you get. I actually really like that concept but the execution of this game fell flat for me.\n\nI don't think this is a bad game necessarily but after playing it for 3 hours I am not sure why I would keep going.

I have a few hours in Spelunky HD but I never got into it as much as Spelunky 2. This game took the formula and gameplay loop from its predecessors and expanded and refined it in such a manner that one could call it \"perfect.\" One of Spelunky's greatest strengths as a roguelike is that everything is set the moment you step in the level and everything moves and interacts normally even without you being on the screen, with the exception of a few enemies that spawn other enemies. However, it's not like a caveman or bat can pop out of existence. \n\nThe consistency of the Spelunky formula is what gives birth to both high-level optimizations and the classic Spelunky shenanigans most people know and probably love. Traps will be set off because an enemy set it off before you came across them, your pet could be dead before reaching it because of something offscreen killing it. There is no entity that spawns in a level that is an exception to the game. It makes the game about as random as it gets because of all the potential unique interactions, but also probably the most skill-based roguelike I own. The game gives you good indicators of enemy patterns and the stage generation pulls from a consistent pool of shapes. You can learn everything you need to improve in Spelunky by paying attention. You can beat the game without using any items, and you can easily lose with gear that, in other games, would basically win you the game. Spelunky 2 balances some of the more absurd elements of Spelunky HD while also adding brand new dangers to keep you observant. It perfectly leverages risk and reward by accounting for how the world can interact with your character and the items you collect- the game keeps you on your toes at all times. You are never better than the game, one wrong step and your back accessory explodes or you get flung into a pit of spikes. \n\nDespite this, the Spelunky series, and particularly 2, is an absolutely perfect casual experience as well. The consistent chaos and pretty low average time for a run (assuming you don't intend to truly push yourself, which this game also accounted for) make booting up the game and playing for half an hour so much fun. You don't have to account for all the interacting variables, you can just breeze through a few levels, die/win, and have your fun with the game. You may be slapped into a virtual Rube Goldberg machine that flings you across the map and kills you, but that's just a part of the experience. Playing with friends is also a blast. The game makes everything* play by its rules, including all your friends together. Whipping, throwing, and killing your friends is absolutely on the menu and equally as, if not more, fun as trying to beat the game together. No matter who you are, Spelunky 2 can either offer a challenge or a casual, fun (but potentially infuriating) gaming experience that can kill a few hours easily. \n\nAlso, it has rollback.", "timestamp_created": 1669243580, "timestamp_updated": 1669243580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126473272": {"recommendationid": "126473272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450133624", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4575, "last_played": 1690249461}, "language": "english", "review": "SPELUNKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! heart", "timestamp_created": 1669241988, "timestamp_updated": 1669241988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126400863": {"recommendationid": "126400863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212779989", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 62165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "playtime_at_review": 57045, "last_played": 1699765607}, "language": "english", "review": "I've drafted so many extremely long reviews of this game, but I think I'm gonna stick to the main points:\n\nYou have to be prepared to \"fail.\" A LOT. And by \"fail\" I mean die and start all over with naught but a little more knowledge than you had before. Fortunately, thanks to the artstyle and physics-based interactions, deaths tend to be really funny, as long as you haven't died that way a hundred times already. But that, too, could make the 101st funny in its own right. If you can handle that, this game is for you.\n\nThe overarching gameplay loop revolves around exploring, dying, and learning. Every enemy and trap has very specific, predictable behavior, like how far away an arrow trap detects you, how quickly a lion trap activates its spears, or how a horned lizard behaves at 1 HP versus above 1 HP. As you play, you start to build up an understanding of how to approach every hazard both individually and in combination with each other. It's really satisfying to see yourself improve, and that's much of what I enjoy about the game. There's almost always more to learn.\n\nJust one single run involves a whole lot of choices: \"Should I face this enemy to reach that crate?\" \"Should I use a resource here?\" \"Which world would fit my run better?\" \"What do I spend my money on?\" \"Could I get away with robbery?\" The combination of risk assessment and equipment-gathering is something really fantastic, and it keeps bringing me back and saying \"one more run.\" One arguable flaw here is that you are basically forced to interact with most hazards if you want to learn from them, which is kind of the antithesis of the game's \"take your time! be careful!\" mentality, but thanks to the beauty that is unlockable shortcuts, you can practice with minimal consequences all you want. (Except if you want to go to the Temple. Or to any secret areas. For that you need mods.)\n\nExploration as a whole is also pretty fun, especially figuring out how all the secret paths work. There's some major ones that lead to different areas and endings, but there's also some NPC \"sidequests\" as well. I can't comment on what it's like to discover all the secrets yourself because I followed the community early on and they figured out so much of it so quickly, but I imagine it's pretty rewarding. It's certainly rewarding to actually get to those secret areas.\n\nTwo difficulty nitpicks here. For a beginner, the first world (the game's structured Mario Bros.-style) takes a LONG time to get a handle on. The game has a high skill floor I guess. Most people start to feel the Dwelling doldrums eventually, even in its current, toned-down state (compared to v1.0). On the opposite end, there's an endgame area related to a 100% optional secret ending that I (with 950 hours of experience (often distracted by podcasts in the background)) have never finished once. I still try, but it's just unreasonably unforgiving. (Derek Yu wasn't sure anyone would be able to beat it iirc. They have, though. Damageless. That ain't me though.) It also breaks the roguelike's promise of a short run you don't need a save & quit button for, which kinda sucks. But because it's totally optional, recognized as unbalanced, and very unlikely for the average player to even attempt, I've consciously kept it from skewing this review.\n\nAesthetically the game is really clean. Some will prefer Spelunky HD's artstyle, and most prefer its catchy gamey music to 2's dynamic and fitting background music, but I think 2's works very well. The visuals are very clear, aside from the odd red structure in Tide Pool that you forget is actually a physical barrier and not in the background. The sound design is fantastic too; if something weird happens offscreen, you can make a guess as to what it was based on the sound. I'm not sure I'd call the art \"pretty\" most times -- it's pleasing, but it seems to be more functional than aesthetic. But you can decide that based on the promo images and video.\n\nI haven't played co-op at length, but I have had more fun watching experienced players play with inexperienced ones in Spelunky and Spelunky 2 than I have had fun watching just about any other gaming content. It helps a ton if you're familiar with your co-op partner(s) and if you can talk in person or on a call, but online co-op can also be fun, though it mostly consists of highly experienced players and/or sabotaging trolls. Not much you can do about that.\n\nThere...I mean, there is a PvP Arena mode, but while it can be fun and chaotic, it's mostly a gimmick. You might very well enjoy it though.\n\nLast comment: mods. Modding is very easy and convenient with modlunky2, and there's lots of stuff done and in progress. There's Overlunky for practicing stuff, Fingerspit's remix mod for a huge rearrangement of the game's features, Jawnlunky (my personal favorite) for room variety and other minor tweaks, multiple kaizo maps, mods adding new items or abilities, in-progress metroidvania and \"99\" (a la Tetris 99) mods, and plenty of aesthetic retextures. These are the reason I'm still playing after all this time, to be honest, and why I highly recommend the PC version.\n\nGod. I said it wasn't going to be long. I told myself it wouldn't be long. This is what Spelunky 2 does to you, folks. You think you're gonna be there for 20 minutes and you look at the time and it's 3 hours later. (Buy it.

wonder to me\nnot to mention there's basically infinite replayability, and mod support (very scuffed tho)\nIf you're deciding to or to not get the game right now I'll give a quick explaination\n\nSpelunky 2 is a game for people who enjoy very detailed game progression, however skill and luck based, and not grind based. However, as a beginner I recommend using controller or figuring out some ungodly keyboard combination to play the game with. Spelunky 2 is by far the hardest video game I've ever played (and beaten!) and it still manages to give that spike of fucking dopamine every time I play. \n\nEven if you get bored as well, there's multiplayer, which can (sometimes) make the game easier.\nUnless if you have a friend who really like Nekka.\nYou know who you are.", "timestamp_created": 1668206680, "timestamp_updated": 1668206680,

It takes a while to get into though, and is extremely tough for anyone playing the game and trying to reach a new goal. It often takes hundreds of attempts to reach that goal, and many people will likely get frustrated and leave before accomplishing it. It can be mentally draining, but the sense of accomplishment and the funny things you can discover make it worth the grind.\n                                 - THE SECRETS -\n   There is a lot to discover in this game, and you can certainly spend hundreds of hours cracking the code of getting the secret endings, like reaching a second boss and two whole new worlds, the latter of which took ages even for the best of players to find the end of, and the theory was that it went on forever, so most people won't even come close to finishing it.\n                                 - IT FEELS UNFAIR -\n   A common joke in the Spelunky 1&2 community is named Spelunked, and is the event of a spectacular thing out of the player's control ruins their run. This happens a lot, and sometimes it's funny, but sometimes it feels awful and I know for a fact that people have rage quit this game because of it. Another thing I don't like is the lack of balance in some of the mechanics.\n                                 \n\n\n                                 If you read after spoiler warning, return here for my conclusion.\n   This game is only for the most resilent people and I would advise caution in playing if you don't feel you fall into that category.

A Witch Doctor is an enemy in the Jungle and Sunken City's Sun Challenge accompanied by a flying ghost of a skull that flies in circles around the Witch Doctor and within a few tiles, chases down the player, and when it hits you, inflicts the Cursed debuff and deals 1 damage.

You will find yourself discovering new items, secrets, strategies and interactions while playing.\n- An addicting and satisfying game play loop, the game is always changing and it will always keep you on your toes.\n- Beautiful graphics that are very easy to read and process. \n- A fun multiplayer / co-op experience. Spelunking the caves with friends is always interesting, and can have great high moments and hilarious interactions.\n- Difficult but rewarding achievements and secrets. There are still things i haven't discovered despite pouring countless hours into the game!\n\n[h1]The Cons[/h1]\n- Despite being the first level, the beginning area is brutal. I find myself losing most of my runs to the start of the game. It is filled with way more traps and hazards compared to the other areas of the game. Many of my friends have actually dropped the game because of the sheer difficulty of the starting area. This is pretty much the complete opposite of the first game, where the first area was simple, but still had a challenge.\n\n- Unless you are playing with friends, I cannot recommend playing online with strangers. It is beyond easy to grief players in this game so pretty much all random matches result in people leaving, or immediate conflict.\n\n- This game is very difficult to new / inexperienced players. There are a lot of variables to keep count of while playing, and from my experiences with others it can be a major turn off for people. Unless you are willing to put hours into this game, I cannot recommend it to the average player.\n\nOverall, Spelunky 2 is a timeless rouge-like with alot of content to offer. If you enjoyed the first game, or have played other rouge-likes I would highly recommenced giving it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1667812933, "timestamp_updated": 1667812933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125091625": {"recommendationid": "125091625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354423047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 827, "playtime_at_review": 19448, "last_played": 1700619362}, "language": "english", "review": "this game", "timestamp_created": 1667808417, "timestamp_updated": 1700004591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125088544": {"recommendationid": "125088544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048421816", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1718, "last_played": 1679859412}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is harder than elden ring. The movement is extremely slippery, mobs' hitboxes feel incredibly unforgiving, you very often get soft-locked if you run out of bombs or ropes, the shopkeeper shows no remorse and will start blastin at you if you even so as spit in his general direction. The mobs are deceptively strong, no matter how used to the controls you get every mob kill, even just bugs or bats is a struggle. There are very few I-frames after getting hit, so most mobs can stun-lock you to death regardless of your hp (Do NOT test the armadillo). This game will crush you in so many ways from getting trampled, poisoned, cursed, blasted, impaled, crushed, or incinerated which end the run instantly, despite Monty's best effort to give the player a sizable health pool, sending you back to the gloriously monotonous theme of the first stage. Wanting to get back to where you were, you might want to try to speed past the first few stages, however clearing stages has to be slow and meticulous because there are traps around every single corner. Runs are always dependent on the rng of the items of the shopkeeper. Even if you get cool items like the teleporter, you'll probably accidentally teleport into a wall and die instantly. Simply wanting to tame a turkey will likely lead to your death as it randomly runs around and jumps into a spike pit or an arrow trap. In Coop, accidentally killing your friends is so common that the best strategy is to split up. Even after someone dies they become a ghost and can kill you by freezing or tripping you.

There is a lot to like here, especially for die hard Spelunky fans who have squeezed as much enjoyment as they could out of the original game. Mossmouth saw what you were capable of, and built this game to challenge YOU at its very highest levels of play. At its most basic level of play, it is a bit more difficult than Spelunky in many ways, while offering new ways to survive. At its most complex level of play, it is a brutally difficult, complex, and nuanced challenge with many ways to get to the very, very end; one that few players will get to. It is a much bigger difference than the two endings of the original Spelunky; the multiple endings of this game are of vastly different difficulties.\n\nThis variety is what leads to this game's biggest strength: more ways to play Spelunky. Even if you haven't beaten Olmec in the first game, the amount of things you can do in this one is remarkably refreshing, and gives you more ways to enjoy the Spelunky experience. It can be easy to experience burnout when playing a one of a kind game such as Spelunky, and giving you more ways to enjoy the experience will allow you to improve much faster at the overall skill. Playing Spelunky 2 greatly improved my ability to play Spelunky 1 after going back to it, and, after playing Spelunky 1 for a while with a much fresher mindset, suffering less burnout from repeated plays, I went back to Spelunky 2 and discovered that I had gotten much better at it. It's a neverending cycle that probably would occur even if Spelunky 2 didn't have the variety it did, but is greatly helped by the fact that it DOES have that variety, and it improves this game's experience as a whole, even when playing it on its own.\n\nIt is with all this in mind that I highly recommend playing this game, but probably after playing and getting familiar with Spelunky first. You don't have to get good at it; you just have to get a feel for what its all about. That being said, it's perfectly possible to play this game first, enjoy it, and then play the first game. There are no rules; I can only verify that, in my own experience, playing and watching other people play the first game really allowed me to appreciate Spelunky 2. That's another thing; read up on, discuss, or watch others play these games; it really improves the experience.\n\nJust remember that the joy of the game should be how you tackle each run; not your ability to beat the game. If you concentrate only on whether you beat it or not, you will just end up dissapponting yourself.

It follows the life of the titular Cleveland Brown, originally from the show Family Guy, after his wife, Loretta, leaves him and kicks him out of his house. He then moved back to his hometown of Stoolbend, Virginia, and gets married to his high school girlfriend. The show itself got low scores by critics, which are wrong, but I want to highlight one aspect of this masterpiece, the theme song. Listen to these lyrics.\n\nMy name is Cleveland Brown And I am proud to be Back in my hometown With my new family\n\nThere's old friends And new friends And even a bear\n\nThere's good things and bad things It's true love we share\n\nAnd so I found a place Where everyone will know My happy mustached face This is The Cleveland Show\n\nAs you can see, this theme song perfectly describes the show it belongs to.\n\nThe first part tells us that it follows Cleveland Brown, who is part to be in his hometown with his new family. Focus on how he us proud to be in his hometown. Not ashamed or apathetic. This is showing of his optimistic nature.\n\nThe second part shows that there are recurring character, newly introduced characters, and a bear. This is important to the structure of the show because the character of Cleveland can't really hold up a show in his own, he mostly relies on the hijinks if other characters.\n\nThe third part show us that in the show, there will be both good things and bad things. It also shows how much Cleveland loves his new wife.\n\nThe fourth and final part of the song shows that Cleveland has finally found where he is meant to be, and his goals.

Yeah, the game has issues, but theyre adding it to a game that where it's first was a local coop only game, so give them time.

It's an amazing game.  If you are an experienced Spelunky 1 player, you will be decent at Spelunky 2 right out of the gate.  However, the movement mechanics in Spelunky 2 feel gummy compared to the first game.  In the previous game, the mechanics felt tight and reliable.  Here, they feel like you're trying to hold a bar of wet soap.  \n\nAlso, the first 4 levels are too hard.  Everything is so tight and compact, making it super easy to die.  And yea, maybe I should just \"get good.\"  However I would imagine this level of difficulty is pretty frustrating for a new player.  If I am having trouble (even after 10 hours), new players might be turned away.\n\nThose are the only reasons for this negative review.  If Spelunky 2 is your first Spelunky experience, it's worth the buy--on sale or full price.  The devs at Mossmouth did a great job, and props to Derek for coming up with such a great series.
