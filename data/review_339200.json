Well, the commitment did not last. The graphics and atmosphere is charming and Zelda-like, but the progression and gameplay is anything but.\n\nMy problems with the game after 2 hours and a handful of dungeons are:\n\na) The player character has less stamina than a Call of Duty protagonist, only being able to \"run\" 10 steps and only in a straight line, before having to wait 10+ seconds for the stamina to regenerate. What a curious design choice, as it slows down movement -- especially in situations where you do not know where to go and are searching around.\n\nb) The primary weapon, the sword, has an abysmal reach. What is it with some games forcing you to basically hug an enemy before you are able to make contact with a swing? Combat is not necessarily hard, since most enemies (in the beginning) are braindead, but it's tedious.\n\nc) Quest, dungeon and world progression is locked behind arbitrary gates (sometimes literally) whose solution is either mindnumbingly dumb (e.g. key in the only other dungeon room) or impossible to figure out without looking up a guide or the forums (e.g. \"jumping\" into the well on the starter island -- you cannot jump, at least I never found an item that allowed me to jump in the early game, so you have to go all over the place and into some caves to emerge at a higher point of the island than the well to be able to fall down into it; and the well is F'N half the player height).\n\nd) After not playing for a couple of weeks I forgot what to do next and there is no in-game quest marker or quest log or I am too dumb to find it. So I just figured out I would try a couple of islands, which only made the experience worse due to the following:\n\ne) The fucking travel system. The screenshots make it look like Zelda: The Wind Waker, but it damn sure isn't. Instead you are forced to wait for up to minutes to make your way slowly from one island to another, on rails and your only saviour from boredom being a shooting minigame that got tedious after 5 seconds. It's really, really annoying.\n\nThat's a lot of negatives, which somehow breaks my heart as I was looking forward to a Zelda-like adventure and do not necessarily mind that the story is completely uninteresting. But despite it's charming look, the game is shallow and mis-designed on too many levels for me to maintain attention.

Es evidente el motivo por el que se ha hecho este ajuste, ya sea para tener que cargar un menor n\u00famero de elementos en pantalla a la misma vez o porque al jugar en una pantalla tan peque\u00f1a, todos los elementos se ver\u00edan diminutos de otro modo, pero siento que le perjudica m\u00e1s que le beneficia, ya que el videojuego parece estar dise\u00f1ado para una distancia de c\u00e1mara mayor, ya que en determinados niveles hay elementos que no se muestran en su totalidad, haciendo m\u00e1s obtusa la lectura del mapa y la resoluci\u00f3n de puzles en general.\n\nY otro aspecto negativo que me gustar\u00eda destacar y que va muy relacionado con el punto anterior, se trata del dise\u00f1o de niveles. Cada zona, sobre todo las primeras islas se sienten como si los elementos hubieran sido colocados de manera un poco aleatoria para rellenar y dar la sensaci\u00f3n de no estar tan vac\u00edo, dando lugar a algunos elementos que no tiene sentido, por ejemplo una escalera que no va a ning\u00fan sitio o un pasillo que da la sensaci\u00f3n de esconder un cofre al final del recorrido y que de repente se corta, entre otros. Sumado a esto est\u00e1 el aspecto de la verticalidad de los niveles, hecha a base de bloques tipo v\u00f3xel, distribuidos de una forma que en la gran mayor\u00eda de ocasiones hacen dif\u00edcil la exploraci\u00f3n por el hecho de que, como he dicho antes, la lectura del mapa es obtusa (sumado a la corta distancia a la que se encuentra la c\u00e1mara). Adem\u00e1s, el apartado visual es agradable a la vista, pero la perspectiva elegida no termina de convencerme. Y en cuanto a la historia, comentar\u00e9 que sirve como hilo conductor para avanzar por las distintas fases pero nada m\u00e1s, no est\u00e1 mal pero se toma demasiado en serio a s\u00ed misma y si fuera un poco m\u00e1s desenfadada le habr\u00eda sentado genial.\n\nNormalmente en mis an\u00e1lisis suelo mencionar m\u00e1s los aspectos negativos antes que los positivos. \u00bfQuiere decir esto que Oceanhorn sea un mal juego? Para nada, de hecho lo recomiendo siempre y cuando te guste la saga Zelda y no comiences el juego con las expectativas demasiado altas. Se nota que tiene un origen humilde y comete algunos errores en cuanto a dise\u00f1o, pero se fija en los m\u00e1s grandes del g\u00e9nero (tiene claras referencias a Zelda, y m\u00e1s concretamente a Wind Waker) y en definitiva es un buen juego de aventuras, tiene muchas buenas ideas en su planteamiento y la sensaci\u00f3n de exploraci\u00f3n est\u00e1 bastante conseguida, te hace querer hablar con los ciudadanos o investigar en los libros de las aldeas para descubrir nuevas localizaciones, y siempre que entras a una nueva isla se renueva esa sensaci\u00f3n de exploraci\u00f3n y se siente muy fresco. \n\nAlgunas de las buenas ideas que comentaba anteriormente y que me han gustado son esa progresi\u00f3n de niveles a base de obtener experiencia ya sea derrotando enemigos, avanzando en la historia, explorando y descubriendo secretos, y que no hace que tu personaje sea m\u00e1s fuerte aumentando estad\u00edsticas y ya, sino que te recompensa aumentando la cantidad de un determinado objetos que puedes llevar en cada momento, o haciendo que tus habilidades consuman menos estamina y tus magias consuman menos man\u00e1, o mejorando la navegaci\u00f3n con el barco. Y aqu\u00ed viene mi \u00faltimo comentario negativo, que es la exploraci\u00f3n de los mares. \n\nSiento que el sistema de navegaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 algo desaprovechado, que puedas desplazarte de una isla a otra simplemente pulsando a donde quieres ir est\u00e1 bien sin m\u00e1s, pero ser\u00eda m\u00e1s emocionante tener un movimiento libre, descubrir algunas islas por el simple hecho de pasar cerca de ellas y acabar en ellas de casualidad, mayor variedad de enemigos (s\u00f3lamente hay un enemigo acu\u00e1tico que es la copia del octorok y ya), poder encontrarte eventos, mejorar el barco, etc. No digo que est\u00e9 mal tal y como lo han dise\u00f1ado, simplemente se siente desaprovechado y har\u00edan al t\u00edtulo a\u00fan m\u00e1s disfrutable incluyendo algunas de estas mec\u00e1nicas.", "timestamp_created": 1665476157, "timestamp_updated": 1665476157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122329551": {"recommendationid": "122329551", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078913076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1668882545}, "language": "english", "review": "this was one of the first games i ever played when i was younger, playing this on my ipad. over the years i have racked countless hours and beaten the game tens of times. when i got this back in 2013, i didnt really play games but this game made me start. it is a solid part of my <10 years old life and it forever will be. however, i noticed some of the music has changed which is a big sad because the music was half the game for me", "timestamp_created": 1663345137, "timestamp_updated": 1663416718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122067293": {"recommendationid": "122067293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388565060", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 828, "last_played": 1695334450}, "language": "english", "review": "an underrated gem!", "timestamp_created": 1662867215, "timestamp_updated": 1662867215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121375876": {"recommendationid": "121375876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006951888", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 297, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1604278666}, "language": "english", "review": "No", "timestamp_created": 1661699138, "timestamp_updated": 1661699138, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4360465407371521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120187044": {"recommendationid": "120187044", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970418041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1660179039}, "language": "english", "review": "It had sat in my backlog for years and I finally got around to playing it. 5hrs in at the moment and it is a very lackluster Zelda clone.

This doesn't mean it's a bad game though, just that it isn't very original.\n\nThe game mostly consists of you traveling between different islands by boat, exploring them and finding items that will help you to reach new areas. There are a few boss battles thrown in here and there, and while a couple of them were decent, most aren't all that interesting.\n\nThe level design is pretty good, with some well thought-out puzzle sections, although there are some places where you can trap yourself and possibly even soft-lock your entire save file. There's also a bunch of places where you can spot things like floating trees, or gaps in the terrain so you can see through to the sky or sea.\n\nOne thing I didn't like is the fact that there's no easy way of knowing whether or not you can blow up certain walls like you can with the cracks in Zelda games. Having to just bomb anything you suspect might be possible to destroy isn't good design, but thankfully bombs are easy to come by.\n\nDefeating enemies nets you XP, and while leveling up doesn't increase stats like HP or anything, it does refill your items and health, plus it grants you some effect like less stamina cost for blocking, or the ability to carry more of a certain item. You can also get XP by completing various challenges, which are like in-game achievements.\n\nIt's not the longest game out there, and it took me roughly [spoiler]14[/spoiler] hours to 100% and get all achievements. There is a decent amount of exploration and non-mandatory islands though.\n\nThe controls are a bit off, probably due to it being an iOS release originally. They're not terrible or anything, but there are some quirks like not being able to block in the direction you want using the shield, and since the dodge roll and jump action is the same button it's very easy to roll off a ledge instead of jumping over a gap.\n\nAs for the story, I found it to be mostly generic and not all that interesting. It's sort of just there for you to have a reason to do whatever you do in the game. The writing isn't terrible, just bland, and there is some voice acting as well. The music is serviceable, ranging from somewhat dull to pretty good.\n\nIt's certainly not the best game of its kind, but all things considered I'd say it's worth getting, at least during a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1659187198, "timestamp_updated": 1659187198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119549697": {"recommendationid": "119549697", "author": {"steamid": "76561199189198688", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 3094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3094, "last_played": 1658888427}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego.

Siempre lo empezaba con bastantes ganas porque sin duda me recordaba a Zelda, y su jugabilidad y su aspecto gr\u00e1fico me resultaban muy atrayentes. Sin embargo, siempre pasaba algo que me hac\u00eda abandonarlo, generalmente que me pon\u00eda con otro juego y al final lo dejaba apartado.\n\nPero esta vez no fue as\u00ed. Empec\u00e9 a jugarlo y cada vez me entreten\u00eda m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s, hasta que \u00e9l fue en esta ocasi\u00f3n el que hac\u00eda que dejara a otros t\u00edtulos pendientes de lado, y no lo he soltado hasta que no me lo he acabado completamente. Y realmente lo he disfrutado mucho.  Esto no hace sino reformar mi teor\u00eda de que no solo basta con que un juego sea bueno, sino que tambi\u00e9n te tiene que coger en el momento oportuno para disfrutarlo realmente. Sea el juego que sea. \n\nOceanhorn tiene una gran cantidad de virtudes, aunque no est\u00e1 exentos de algunos \u201cdefectos\u201d. Lo entrecomillo porque realmente no lo considero defectos como tal, sino que al parecerse tanto a determinados Zelda, uno espera encontrar la misma experiencia jugable, y obviamente esto no es as\u00ed. Sin duda, esto juega en su contra, pero no es tampoco algo por lo que haya que denostar al juego, ya que lo que hace lo hace bastante bien, aunque no llegue a los niveles de excelencia de la obra de Shigeru Miyamoto. Tampoco tuvieron los mismos medios, por cierto.\n\nSea como sea, Oceanhorn ofrece una aventura bastante entretenida donde nuestro personaje, espada en mano, y escudo, arco, bombas y magia tambi\u00e9n, visitar\u00e1 numerosas islas de una tierra que ha ca\u00eddo en desgracia y se enfrenta a un grave peligro.\n\nEl argumento como tal no es nada del otro mundo, y lo \u00fanico que hace es presentarse, aparecer en algunas ocasiones y listo. As\u00ed que no es un juego que brille por su argumentaci\u00f3n, pero s\u00ed lo hace por su exploraci\u00f3n y, sobre todo, por su resoluci\u00f3n de puzles. Realmente es una aventura bastante entretenida.\n\nGeneralmente, los puzles se encuentran diseminados por casi todas las islas, y ser\u00e1n del tipo de mover objetos, presionar palancas y cosas similares. No es que sean especialmente complejos, pero s\u00ed que exigir\u00e1n que te comas el tarro en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n para saber c\u00f3mo abrir la maldita puerta que te impide seguir progresando en la aventura. Esto se vuelve mucho m\u00e1s exigente si quieres encontrar todos los cofres y completar todas las islas al 100%. Si vas simplemente a pasarte la historia sin m\u00e1s, la exigencia ser\u00e1 mucho menor, aunque tambi\u00e9n menos gratificante.\n\nEl combate es tremendamente simple, aunque no por ello aburrido, y es muy parecido a lo que podemos ver en \u201cA Link to the Past\u201d, por ejemplo. Un bot\u00f3n para golpear con la espada, otro para cubrirte con el escudo, otro dedicado a las armas secundarias, como las bombas y el arco, y otro bot\u00f3n para ejecutar las magias.\n\nComo ya pasaba en el juego de Zelda antes mencionado, en Oceanhorn nuestro personaje no puede saltar cuando queramos, sino que lo realizar\u00e1 cuando haya una distancia id\u00f3nea para hacerlo y, adem\u00e1s, cuando hayamos encontrado las botas que nos lo permitan. Esto podr\u00eda parecer algo negativo, pero ni mucho menos, ya que este aspecto se enlaza directamente con la jugabilidad referida a los puzles. \n\nEl juego tiene una manera muy particular de presentar el mundo donde se desarrolla la aventura, ya que el entorno parece estar construido con cubos. De este modo, las monta\u00f1as estar\u00e1n representadas por bloques c\u00fabicos apilados unos encima de otros, creando diferentes alturas que nunca podremos escalar, pero si descender, y dependiendo de la altura de los cubos se podr\u00e1 realizar la acci\u00f3n o no. Esto es importante, porque muchos puzles se podr\u00e1n resolver al descubrir zonas que se interconectan entre ellas en base a la altura del entorno. En s\u00ed no es m\u00e1s que otro modo de presentar un puzle utilizando el entorno. Entorno que por otra parte es bastante bonito, bastante variado y diferente seg\u00fan la zona, as\u00ed como los retos que nos presenta, pudiendo llegar a sorprendernos en algunos momentos.\n\nLos enemigos tambi\u00e9n son variados, aunque no son tampoco demasiados, pero nunca se siente que se reciclen en exceso ni nada parecido. Adem\u00e1s, dentro de determinadas mazmorras nos encontraremos con jefes finales bastante bien dise\u00f1ados, aunque presentar\u00e1n muy poco reto a los jugadores m\u00e1s experimentados.\n\nEn s\u00ed se siente toda la experiencia como algo muy agradable de disfrutar, pero es indudable que se nota que viene de la mano de un equipo indie muy reducido. Esto no es algo malo, ni mucho menos, porque lo conseguido es algo bastante notable, aunque en algunos momentos se pueda sentir algo casual.\n\nTampoco hay que olvidar que este juego es un port de m\u00f3vil, pero no te equivoques con esto, el port est\u00e1 muy bien realizado y perfectamente adaptado para jugarse en PC, incluso a 4K, ya sea con teclado y rat\u00f3n o con mando, aunque yo lo disfrute bastante m\u00e1s con mando.\n\nEn definitiva, tenemos un juego con grandes dosis de aventura y mazmorreo de 10-12 horas de duraci\u00f3n, unas 16-17 si vas a por todo, lleno de puzles y acci\u00f3n muy entretenida, aunque no muy exigente, y todo ello representado con unos gr\u00e1ficos bastante bonitos y una m\u00fasica bastante notable. No es tan bueno como ning\u00fan Zelda, obviamente, pero s\u00ed es lo suficientemente bueno para ser disfrutado ya que ofrece una experiencia bastante notable.", "timestamp_created": 1642204910, "timestamp_updated": 1642204910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696946501731872559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107516599": {"recommendationid": "107516599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049192579", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 939, "last_played": 1676089346}, "language": "english", "review": "No words very posted except for two fish Botfish and Ghost Fish", "timestamp_created": 1641559836, "timestamp_updated": 1641559836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107450941": {"recommendationid": "107450941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995681559", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 3859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2005, "last_played": 1657709427}, "language": "english", "review": "Zelda for the poor.", "timestamp_created": 1641479783, "timestamp_updated": 1641479783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568370997905731201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107300547": {"recommendationid": "107300547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112563641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1483371304}, "language": "english", "review": "6/10", "timestamp_created": 1641303542, "timestamp_updated": 1641303542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106715221": {"recommendationid": "106715221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027444901", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 880, "last_played": 1640664747}, "language": "english", "review": "The boss fights especially at the end of this game, are more irritating than fun.", "timestamp_created": 1640664818, "timestamp_updated": 1640664818, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47590559720993042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106221045": {"recommendationid": "106221045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061442437", "num_games_owned": 987, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1640055258}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall a pretty solid game, nothing top tier, but fun and I didn't have any issues with it technically. \n\nYou have puzzles and combat, both are enjoyable overall, and the story has some solid lore to it.

My time spent with it was a pleasantly surprising journey that left a significant impact.\n\nGameplay - Simple Yet Engaging\n\nThe simplicity of Oceanhorn's gameplay is one of its standout features. It offers a gentle learning curve, making it easy for players to pick up and enjoy. This accessibility doesn't mean the game lacks depth, though. In fact, it features one of the most engaging leveling systems I've ever encountered in a game.\n\nLevelling System - A Standout Mechanic\n\nOceanhorn's leveling system is a true standout. It seamlessly blends character progression with the core gameplay, providing a sense of accomplishment as you grow stronger. This mechanic encourages exploration and tackling challenges, making each moment in the game feel rewarding.\n\nStorytelling - A Surprisingly Engaging Tale\n\nWhile not every action-adventure game excels in storytelling, Oceanhorn manages to impress. It weaves a narrative that, surprisingly, hits the emotional mark more than once. I found myself genuinely sentimental at key points in the story, a testament to the developers' ability to connect players with the game's world and characters.\n\nA Journey Worth the Investment\n\nAs I navigated through Oceanhorn, I couldn't help but think that it was a worthwhile investment. The game offers a rich and captivating experience that easily justifies its price. It's clear that the developers poured their hearts into crafting this adventure, and it shows in every detail.\n\nAnticipation for the Sequel\n\nMy experience with Oceanhorn has left me eagerly looking forward to trying the sequel on Steam. If the first game is any indication, the sequel promises to be an even grander adventure that fans of the action-adventure genre won't want to miss.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Oceanhorn is more than just an imitation of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. It stands as a remarkable indie game in its own right, offering accessible gameplay, a fantastic leveling system, a surprisingly engaging storyline, and a journey well worth the price of admission. For those seeking a nostalgic adventure reminiscent of classic titles, Oceanhorn is a true hidden treasure in the world of indie gaming.\n\n[b] **\"Oceanhorn: A Seafarer's Odyssey\"**\n\nIn the realm of pixels and endless blue,\nA legend unfolded, a tale anew,\nOceanhorn, the game, a heartfelt creation,\nA seafarer's odyssey, a true exploration.\n\nUpon the waves, we embarked on a quest,\nIn the world of Arcadia, we found rest,\nA hero's journey, in pixels and rhyme,\nA captivating adventure, a magical time.\n\nWith sword and shield, we ventured so bold,\nThrough islands of wonder, and secrets untold,\nThe puzzles, the riddles, in dungeons so deep,\nWith Oceanhorn's guidance, our treasures we'd keep.\n\nIn the Coral's heart and the Arcadia's Light,\nThe echoes of legends, a magnificent sight,\nThe graphics, the music, a symphony of the sea,\nOceanhorn, you're a masterpiece, forever to be.\n\nThe battles we fought, the monsters we slew,\nA seafaring voyage with skies clear and blue,\nOceanhorn, your magic, your stories, your lore,\nWill stay in our hearts forevermore.\n\nYet what truly amazed, and our spirits did bind,\nWas the depth of emotion, a tale intertwined,\nWith themes of courage, and love's sweet devotion,\nOceanhorn, you stirred a surprising emotion.\n\nIn the journey's progression, as the story did unfold,\nWe found ourselves touched, in a world made of gold,\nThe sentimental moments, they caught us by surprise,\nOceanhorn, you're a treasure beneath the vast skies.\n\nSo here's to the game, Oceanhorn, we salute,\nFor your heartfelt journey, your captivating pursuit,\nIn the realm of pixels, an adventure so grand,\nYou'll forever be cherished, in this gamer's land. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc99 [/b]\n\n[i] (Parody of the lyrics as a heartfelt review of the game Oceanhorn)\n\nOnce in a pixel world, we had a quest to fight for,\nWe had a game, we had a plan in store,\nSpells in the air, adventures aplenty,\nDidn't have to care, once in Oceanhorn's fantasy.\n\nRemember when we soared,\nWith dungeons never-ending,\nIn a world where heroes rise,\nRemember when we explored,\nWe had it all,\nWe had it all.\n\nSail away to this digital sea,\nMysteries and treasures for you and me,\nFade away, the game is calling our name,\nWe'll journey on, Oceanhorn's our aim.\n\nOnce in a pixel land, we lit up the darkness,\nQuests and legends, our hearts a fortress,\nThe tale we embarked on was better than we'd seen,\nEvery moment a delight, once in Oceanhorn's dream.\n\nRemember when we knew,\nThis adventure never-ending,\nIn a world where heroes shine,\nRemember when we grew,\nWe had it all,\nWe'd never fall.\n\nSail away to this digital sea,\nMysteries and treasures for you and me,\nFade away, the game is calling our name,\nWe'll journey on, Oceanhorn's our aim.\n\nNo need to pretend,\nIn this game we're defending,\nA realm where stories ascend,\nFearless to explore,\nTo quest, we'll soar,\nTo quest, we'll soar.\n\nSail away to Oceanhorn's embrace,\nA world of wonder, a magical place,\nFade away, with heartfelt praise,\nIn this game's charm, we'll spend our days.\n\nSail away to Oceanhorn's embrace,\nA world of wonder, a magical place,\nFade away, with heartfelt praise,\nIn this game's charm, we'll spend our days.\n\nSail away...

Back when it released in 2013 it was the closest thing we had to Zelda on the PC, and I bought and played it a bit when it first released. Yet, recently I found myself wondering why I dropped it so quickly all those years ago, and so I decided to give it another go.\n\nHaving completed the game, I can now tell you what it was that steered me away from it the first time. Oceanhorn might look like Zelda, and it incorporates many ideas that have become series tradition, but it ultimately fails to capture the feel of a Zelda title. The main issues I found was a lack of polish and faulty level-design, or in this case the dungeons.\n\nZelda, and as a result Oceanhorn are equal parts combat, exploration and puzzle-solving. I had no issue with the puzzles, most of them are simple and while a few of the later ones border on cryptic there are usually clues to help you in the enviroment. My problem lies with the two former matters. Lets start with the combat.\n\nOceanhorn, like Zelda eventually gives the player lots of tools like bombs and arrows that can be used both to deal with enemies and to interact with the environment, but primarily combat is done with a sword and shield. The sword has a swift three swing combo and can also be charged to do a spin attack. The issue is that the attacks feel floaty and inaccurate. There is no real flow to the combo, and most enemies (and a few bosses) can be staggered to death by simply spamming the sword attack. There is also a stamina meter, similar to the one found in Skyward Sword and Breath of the Wild, but unlike BoTW there are no edibles to restore stamina here, and using the spin attack drains your stamina. The Stamina bar is also used for blocking and sprinting. Sprinting doesn't just up your movement speed; instead it locks your direction similar to the Sprinting Boots from ALTTP but unlike those boots which let you charge forward with your sword at the ready piercing enemies, here you sprint unarmed and it can therefor not be used offensively. Walking is very slow, so you may resort to sprinting but doing so prevents you from blocking enemy attacks for a rather long time while waiting for the stamina bar to refill. You do eventually get a roll, but it too drains a ton of stamina and while less awkward than sprinting still limits your options in terms of blocking and spin-attacking. I think having all these depend on the same limited resource was a very bad idea for the game, and although there is a secondary resource in the magic meter it is only used for casting spells, which also make you stop dead in your tracks. If I had to describe the gameplay in one word it would be clunky.\n\nNext there's the exploration. While sailing from island to island is rather exciting, and there are quite a few treasures to find including pieces of heart, gold and Blood Orbs which must be collected to unlock the strongest spell in the game, the actual dungeons themselves often suffer from an over-reliance on destructible walls that are rarely hinted at or make sense in the grand scheme of the level design. I eventually found myself bombing almost every other wall I came across, and while there is no lack of bombs it does become very exhausting after a while. Bombs weren't just needed to find secrets either, oftentime you had to bomb multiple walls just to progress through the main dungeons, and unlike Zelda there weren't always a small crack to hint that the wall could be blown up. Nor can you attack the walls to hear a distinct sound effect from these walls. Finally, I found myself very disappointed with the Master Chests in this game. A staple of the Zelda series, Master Chests are known to hold new tools for you to use both in the dungeon their found in but also in your adventure as a whole. There are a few of these here, but quite often the Master Chest simply held money or some other resource instead of a new exciting item. Oh, and the last tool you find only has a single use in one specific scenario.\n\nI feel I might have come across a bit too harsh on this game. It is not that I dislike it, I really wanted to like it a lot, but it unfortunately disappointed me in a lot of ways. Even so, it does have some good ideas of its own and some aspects were surprisingly well done, so I want to give credit where credit is due.\n\nOne of the tools you obtain on your journey in Oceanhorn is a fishing rod. Fishing is not something Zelda is known for, and it did give a bit more life to the world I must admit. Most islands had their own unique fish to be caught, and while the mini-game itself wasn't anything too special, it did break up the monotony and offer a unique spin on things.\n\nOceanhorn also has stellar audio design, the music especially caught my eye, or ears. The soundtrack is both whimsical and bold, inspiring and mysterious. It's not as catchy as the OSTs from Zelda games past, but it does its job very well and can be enjoyed separate from the game. If someone told me it was the score of some Zelda spinoff, I might've been inclined to believe them. The voice acting also deserves a mention. Voice acting is a hard thing to get right, and until BoTW the Zelda games had strayed away from it for the most part. Most indie games either don't dare to attempt it, or end up sounding more amateurish because of it, but in Oceanhorn it is one of the main draws. Not all the dialogue is voiced, the vast majority isn't, in fact I believe only the cutscenes were voiced, but it is still a very bold thing to attempt for an indie game like this, and I must say I was surprised by how well the performances were delivered.\n\nOceanhorn is a love letter to the Zelda franchise, and there is a lot of heart in this game.

This is an old game, and it can feel old and clunky due to how it was originally built/developed as a mobile game. It's not perfect, and I want to say that up front.\n\nHOWEVER! If you are ok with dealing with some mobile-esque graphical settings and a pretty easy game overall, and also are looking for something that can help scratch that Legend of Zelda: Windwaker itch some of us may have, then this game is easily worth picking up. \n\n[b][h1]STORY[/h1][/b]\nThe story is... ok... but so are most Zelda stories (let's be serious here...). Although this game's story doesn't come close the the best of the genre, it's passable and has some mystery to delve into with some of the in-game lore. Honestly, I'm surprised a mobile game put this much effort into fleshing out it's rather sparse world.  The tale as old as time now gets repeated in a less than unique way, but it is still put together in a decently engaging undercurrent of family and desire to save the world. Groundbreaking? Hardly. Perfectly passable? You bet!\n\n[b][h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1][/b]\nPretty standard fare for what was originally a single button/touch interface. It maps surprisingly well to controller (played on Xbox 1 pc wired controller), and honestly even die hard M+KB users will find that although it may take some getting used to, the controls translate pretty dang well.  You'll be hacking and slashing your way through various environments and enemies, all with a steady upgrade in power with various items. Stop me if you've heard this before, \"a fire, earth, and ancient technology temple all with their own unique items to find\". LoZ to a T. But again, it works, has some interesting (all be it simple) ideas, and is fun enough to brush the samey-ness aside for the most part.  Have fun killing chu-chu look-alikes and bombing walls.\n\n[b][h1]OVERALL[/h1][/b]\nI 100% the game with little help (other than fishing... ugh) in about 13 hours. Totally worth the asking price if you ask me. I had fun, the game has some charming heart to it, and it definitely scratched an itch that Nintendo awakened within me all those year ago, if for only a week or so. Pick it up if you're interested in a fun/compact little Zelda-like game.

This feels like a very bad port of a mobile game. I expect stodgy controls and a flaky camera if you are attempting to play a game like this on a phone, I don't expect those same limitations in a PC version. I don't feel like I'm walking, I feel like I'm being dragged around by the collar of my shirt, and the camera is downright claustrophobic even in places that should be open with a wide view, it just isn't.\n\nIf you can stomach the stilted interface and jerky movement without getting nauseas the game itself is just really routine. Walk around a tiny island, collect some coins, solve a baby-tier puzzle, rinse and repeat. There's no real depth, what challenge exists comes off as just random and the minigames like fishing (which are typically relaxing in this type of game) are intentionally frustrating with gimmicks that punish you for even trying (ghost fish that inverts your controls, electric fish that zaps you, etc.)\n\nThe story didn't draw me in, the voice acting felt like reading from a book and did I mention how much I hate how the controls feel? Because that's worth repeating. Even forcing your way through this for the achievements feels more like work than fun.\n---\n\nBottom line: A bargain bin Zelda clone that was probably more at home on a last gen cell phone.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1623172751, "timestamp_updated": 1623172751, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545406341552734375", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93334095": {"recommendationid": "93334095", "author": {"steamid": "76561199144166659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 848, "last_played": 1623120387}, "language": "english", "review": " find /adventure /problem solving", "timestamp_created": 1623036950, "timestamp_updated": 1623036950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92868176": {"recommendationid": "92868176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361388429", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1190, "last_played": 1627767939}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and relaxing to play, stress-free and cute with all those little islands and caves to explore.", "timestamp_created": 1622380995, "timestamp_updated": 1622380995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92677151": {"recommendationid": "92677151", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970354718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1196, "last_played": 1622126687}, "language": "english", "review": "On the surface this game is a knockoff windwaker for pc. The controls are a bit iffy on keyboard and mouse, the gameplay is simplistic but it's still fairly enjoyable.\n\nThat is unless you're a completionist. Then this game is your fucking worst nightmare. All the regular stuff in the game is fine, the final boss is actually a joke and you can defeat it sub 2 minutes. But then there are the fishing achievements tied to a god awful fishing minigame. \n\nThis minigame is an abomination. There is rng on getting the fish you want, you can't see which fish you're catching until you've actually caught it. This is just a lot of trial and error. It's bad, but it gets worse. There is a ghost fish that inverts your controls while you're trying to catch it, and it's competely rng in the first place whether you'll actually hook it. In the ONLY area where you can get it, you can also catch other kinds of fish. It took me almost 30 minutes or constant retrying just to see the ghost fish the first time, at which point you're completely unprepared and it promptly escapes after 2 seconds. The second time when you're prepared for it it's just a tedious endurance round. You have to keep moving the rod along with the fish which is actually in the opposite direction because it inverts your controls for about 10 minutes. (look up youtube videos on the ghost fish) before it fully loses its strength. It's not fun, if you make a single mistake it'll escape and you can rng fish again hoping to get it before the endurance round begins again.\n\nThen there's the botfish. A fish that electrocutes you every 2 seconds while trying to catch it. You lose half a heart each time it does it and you can't control the rod for a second either. So if it's anywhere near the edge of the screen it'll escape. But you can't keep it in the middle to prevent that because then you'll long lose all your health before it ever tires out. So you just have to keep retrying until you get god-like rng and get the dumbest fish possible that for some reason just pulls either left or right the entire minigame so you can sap its strength before you lose all of your health. And this is on a max health character. Good luck doing this if you're not a completionist because if you don't have 8 or 9 hearts you will die long before the fish is even halfway tired. \n\nIt's fucking rng on top of rng and it destroys any positive feelings I might've had for this game. On top of that the developer is greedy and made the second game an exclusive. Don't give them any money, the fishing minigame makes this a no-go even on a sale where it'd cost less than \u20ac1.", "timestamp_created": 1622127532, "timestamp_updated": 1622127532, "voted_up":

It is short. As a mobile game it's fine. But on Steam it just doesn't feel like a full game. To illustrate this, in Ocarina of Time you collect the three spiritual stones (as you do in this), but then you go on to get the 6 sage medallions in full length dungeons. In this however, you collect the first 3, and then it's on to the final boss. \nIt feels like they attempted to increase the length by requiring a lot of backtracking and relying on collectables.\n\nPros\n- Soundtrack, a number of songs are quite good (however many of those seem dangerously close to the Zelda track that clearly inspired them)\n- Many of the islands were pretty unique and can be fun to explore.\n- I'm not sure how it plays on a touch device (control wise) but everything about it seems more appropriate as a mobile game.\n\nWhat it does best, is remind you just how good Zelda really is. \nIt honestly felt like a group of students trying to make a Zelda clone for their final project in a game development course.

The sword and shield are pretty useless\nThe sword is the only thing that can actually cut the Oceanhorn, but you never need to cut the Oceanhorn or really attack it. The shield is use to deflect lasers you can out run fairly easily. If you have a bow or bombs, you can just throw it at the weak point to beat the 1st phase of the boss.\n\n2. The artifacts are useless\nThey actually don't do anything.\n\n3. The final boss fight is really bad.\nThe way to beat the boss is to electrocute by hitting the pillars which could have been hit with a stick and then playing your father's flute that you pick up. \n\nIf you never got the sword and shield the first phase would be difficult but still pretty easy since you can out run all the damage. If you never got the artifacts then the 2 fish people would be frozen; 3 bird people could live on any other island; the 10 sky people would still live in the sky or just jump off because thats what the main character's mom did. \n\nSo I guess you help 15 people and fix some small environment issues with the world and get a pet called Oceanhorn.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1617239507, "timestamp_updated": 1617239507, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89328239": {"recommendationid": "89328239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022854959", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 375, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1122, "last_played": 1443733460}, "language": "english", "review": "Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a great 3D action-adventure RPG with a solid story.\n\nThe colourful art style, sound effects and music are good and create a nice atmosphere all together.\n\nI enjoyed the game mechanics like sailing from island to island and fishing quite a lot.

That's because it's impossible to not get the feeling that this is a game majorly inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, which is one of my favorite games on one of my favorite franchises. After spending ten hours to complete the game, I came out impressed, even if, as expected, originality isn't really something that's all that present here.\n\nTruth be told, Oceanhorn is less Wind Waker and more Phantom Hourglass, the direct sequel to the former game that was released on the Nintendo DS. Like the latter, it's played from an angled top-down perspective, and the navigation through the open seas isn't directly controlled, but pre-determined, with a few shooting targets here and there to keep you busy while it happens. Luckily, the controls don't really mirror Phantom Hourglass (or even Oceanhorn's own original mobile version), meaning the game has complete support for physical button inputs.\n\nThe story is simple, but it does have some nice moments. Your character wakes up to find a note from his father, explaining he's gone away to fight Oceanhorn, a mythical monster who terrorizes the seas. From there, it's up to you to go after him, exploring the ocean and a good number of island scattered through it.\n\nLike expected, the game play as a top-down Zelda-type game, meaning you'll come across quests, different races, and, of course, dungeons. Also like Zelda, each dungeon provides you with a new weapon, allowing you to reach previously unreachable areas. The overall game design is fair and the gameplay itself is very fun, but it has to be said that the puzzles are more simplistic and far less imaginative that the ones in Nintendo's franchise.\n\nThe one exception for this is the Island of Whispers, which is a late-game discovery that was by far my favorite part of Oceanhorn. The island was originally a post-launch downloadable content, and it shows, as the quality of game design goes dramatically up. Not only that, the island offers a parallel, self-contained story about a mysterious kid whose ambition led to the end of the local civilization. Figuring out what exactly happened, piece by piece, was an extremely engrossing experience, and the closest the game got to Zelda levels of excellence.\n\nAs far as production values go, I have to say the game far exceeded my expectations. The stylized graphics are crisp, colorful, and very pretty. Even more impressive is the soundtrack, which is nothing short of phenomenal, and is complemented in the audio department by excellent voice acting.\n\n[h1] TL;DR: [/h1]\nThere's no two ways about it: Oceanhorn is a Zelda clone, lacking originality to stand as its own thing. Luckily, it features a nice campaign and a surprisingly interesting story, even if the overall game design is a bit more basic that I would have hoped. Each of the game's explorable islands are self-contained isometric playgrounds that are a lot of fun to pick apart, and it all looks great (and sounds even better).

Unfortunately though, I am reviewing the ported variant of this game which leaves me with a few annoyances that were more understandable for the original release due to limitations. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics that are mostly \u201charmless but not spectacular\u201d. Sailing doesn\u2019t have a lot going for it due to its simplicity, but also doesn\u2019t do much wrong. Combat isn\u2019t my favourite and puzzles are okay at best, but they work. Vertical traversing is the bane of my existence, but the game is built around this limitation. But despite my annoyances, I can\u2019t understate how much fun I had with exploring the game and all the islands that popped up, including the dungeons and the many challenges that came with them for a levelling system. The mechanics may not stand out, but they did still work in providing me with a fun journey.\n\n[hr]\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/339200/Oceanhorn_Monster_of_Uncharted_Seas/", "timestamp_created": 1612029102, "timestamp_updated": 1689162909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525691688060760498", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85285154": {"recommendationid": "85285154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119408009", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 176, "last_played": 1688762628}, "language": "english", "review": "not played a huge amount (need to get back into it), but from what I have played it's a cute little game clearly inspired by the Zelda series (always a good thing in my book). if you like puzzle games like Zelda, you'll enjoy this", "timestamp_created": 1611516422, "timestamp_updated": 1611516422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85224743": {"recommendationid": "85224743", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998275901", "num_games_owned": 1153, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 595, "last_played": 1611535026}, "language": "english", "review": "A cute relaxing little game.

Well, it reminds me a bit of the Zelda series because the main character looks a bit like him, and the game play is quite primitive. Your overall goal is to recover some sort of emblems to restore something to somewhere. Story is the usual fantasy drivel, but the game is a fun slash and explore. It doesn't have a perk system or stat system, so when you level up the game just increases your hit points. You do collect coins which can be used at shops to buy such helpful things as health refills and bombs. Though it isn't open world, there are several different islands that open up once you get off the tutorial island, which should be renamed Tedious Island because of how boring it is. Though the islands don't have to be visited in any particular sequence, certain islands can not be opened up without getting something from some other island. I do wish the islands were easier to transverse. To get anywhere you have to weave your way through a series of ladders and bridges. A bit tedious and frustrating at times.\n\n\n\nconclusion\n\nsimple slash and explore. Zero customization and cliched story doesn't subtract from the simple primitive fun.

He went headlong to find a creature called the Oceanhorn. Your task is now to hurry after your dad and find out what the fabled monster is all about. The exciting story is picking up speed quickly and is told partly in pretty video sequences, partly in the form of your father's diary entries. \n\nSome dialogues were even set to music, but only in English with German subtitles, whereby the speakers sometimes sound a bit bored. In the course of the adventure you will make 14 different locations unsafe, each with their own dungeons, which are peppered with all kinds of monsters and nuts. \n\nFor example, you balance over wooden planks and operate lever mechanisms, bludgeon rows of rats, goblins and fantasy figures and puzzle your way through sometimes more, sometimes less challenging puzzles in order to finally crack the coveted treasure chest that awaits inside every dungeon - and not infrequently from one nasty boss monster is guarded.

The graphics are nice, music is good too and the flow just works. The balancing between combat and puzzles works fine too.\n\nBut this game has one big flaw for me i cannot ignore: It's a Zelda clone, which is more than obvious (and i can live with that ... in fact that's why i bought it), but it doesn't have the charme of the original at all. The characters, quests and the story are quite boring, the islands in the game look nice and most levels are well designed from the perspetive of pure game mechanics, but they don't feel alive, they don't have character and there is barely any interesting lore at all. And the enemy types, even the bosses are just random. Some trolls, mushroom creatures, beetles, birds. Not really bad, but there is nothing unique, nothing that stands out. From the technical perspective Oceanhorn is a nice little indie game, but imho it lacks soul. It's just a 3d clone of some older Zelda games that fails to capture the spirit of the original.\n\nOceanhorn - Monster of Uncharted Seas not a bad game, but it's not really a good one either. I still give it a thumb up because it kept me busy without frustating me too much and there is no option to to choose something between thumb up and thumb down (it's still not bad enough for a bad rating), but while many other games touch something inside my gamer heart ... this unfortunately didn't manage to do that.\n\nAnd a little update after i've finished the game after about 13 hours: I'll stay with my opinion. Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a nice Zelda clone that works good mechanically, has some nice dungeons and puzzles, looks good and has nice music ... but not a lot of spirit. It was fun, especially the first 4 or 5 hours, but it could have been a lot better with a more interesting story, characters and world design.

Like a mix between LttP and windwaker.\nBut it is a good clone. The story is good. The aesthetics are great. Music is wonderful. Combat is tight. The puzzles are (mostly) intuitive, and not too difficult. So head out, pick up your bombs and your bow, defeat the dungeon bosses weak to the item you just picked up, and just enjoy the game.\nI played it for roughly nine hours without being bored or having to consult a guide.

Never got to the point that I relied on checklists or walkthroughs to find anything.\n\nThere are some nitpicks, however. None of them make the game unenjoyable, but they are noticeable.\nFirst, and perhaps biggest, is that there aren't any collectable upgrades worth backtracking for. You gain powerups which unlock different areas with new collectibles and powerups, but the collectibles don't do anything until you get 100%, and the heart containers aren't as useful as you'd think. The big and useful upgrades are all tied to the plot, so instead of going the metroidvania route of revisiting every land when you get a new ability to pick up bling, there's no reason not to wait until you've gained all abilities and the game kindly reminds you it's time to stock up before beating the snot out of the final boss.\nAlso; whoever in development decided that \"precision jump to the next platform\" and \"throw caution to the wind and combat roll wildly around\" should be bound to the same button deserves to live the rest of their life in a world where hotsauce and toothpaste randomly swap flavors.\n\nOverall though, it's an enjoyable game.

And it is that monster that will soon make a young kid try to become a hero.\n\nNow it\u2019s that time to talk about what\u2019s to like about the game. To start the story is good and has some cool moments and interesting ideas, like with the villain Mesmeroth. The art/Graphics style is good with some good detail and some interesting places to see and explore. \n\nThe combat is good and simple with a sword and shield but all so bombs and arrows as well as some magic to use. \nThe bosses are very good and great looking; my two favs are Mesmeroth and Oceanhorn even those that boss is a pain to fight. The music is good, and the voice acting was okay too did not feel very wooden.\n\nAnd the two best things in the game was one: When you stop on a certain island the main character\u2019s dad would talk about the place.

Well there are only four bosses in the game and one optional Boss, there are sub bosses but the game could have used some more main bosses.\n\nThere is all so no exploring with your boat, you see when you go to an island your boat takes you there, you don\u2019t get to sail around and find places on your own.\n\nAnd while the combat is good and simple; there could have been more done with it, like with the weapons and magic like homing bombs and fire arrows.\n\nAnd the magic is not really needed in combat except to take out this one type of enemy and the battle with Oceanhorn.\n\nSo that said, Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a good game and a good port of a mobile game.

It's almost as if the developers failed to understand just what makes the Zelda games fun, what makes players want to dive into their worlds and explore.\n\n For starters Oceanhorn's combat is dull, animations are slow and clearly the animators lacked any sense of timing, combat is not impactful at all making it a very unsatisfying experience. Even if we decide to ignore this game's inspiration, the Zelda series and its nicely designed and satisfying combat, Oceanhorn on its own sports some exceptionally dull, slow, completely devoid of any kind of satisfaction or trhill battles. Everything feels like it lacks substance, and combat feels unfinished and like an afterthought to a walking simulator with some puzzle elements almost.\n\nSpeaking of puzzles, the majority of them are functional enough but not overly exciting or interesting, some are just plain unintuitive and tedious for the sake of prolonging the game rather than offering the player a  satisfying puzzle solving experience. Though truth be told, this can sometimes be the case with some of the Zelda games as well, (Twilight Princess in particular IMO. I find it fairly frustrating in Oceanhorn because the game has little else to offer in compensation.\n\nWe have rather unimpressive puzzles and dull combat so far, terribly hidden secrets that often require blind placement of bombs and sheer luck to discover unlike the Zelda games. To make things worse the main character moves at a snail's pace though running is an option it doesn't add much to the overall pacing of the games and environmental traversal. The environments themselves are your typical puzzle/adventure environments in terms of design and fairly generic when it comes to their looks, while the game looks decent at first glance the completely soulless character designs, unimaginative monsters and downright boring environments quickly overwhelm anyone who has played any decent fantasy games with more artistic creativity behind them.\nIt's a shame that so much muscal talent went into this product when everything else is just sub par and simply functional enough to offer some enjoyment but ultimately fall short of an even average fun gaming experience in the genre.\n\nThough I did enjoy my time with the game, it was mostly out of curiosity to see how the developers would handle the Zelda formula throughout, I love easy games but Oceanhorn's problem isn't the lack of challenge or difficulty, it's the lack of creativity and imagination on the developers' end.\nSure it has a fairly decent premise, nothing we haven't seen before but not all games of this genre need a strong story to support them, so by no means do I fault Oceanhorn for having a generic story, but I do fault it for failing to build an interesting world and interesting environments populated by all manner of characters and monsters that invite the player to explore.\n\nIf I had to rate the game I'd give it a 5.0/10", "timestamp_created": 1575230523, "timestamp_updated": 1575230643, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536450505256652832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58231381": {"recommendationid": "58231381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397931970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1621887468}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a very good game", "timestamp_created": 1574872772, "timestamp_updated": 1574872772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57870601": {"recommendationid": "57870601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009328000", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 1108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1598641356}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely Game!", "timestamp_created": 1574776889, "timestamp_updated": 1574776889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57613390": {"recommendationid": "57613390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027267313", "num_games_owned": 1832, "num_reviews": 4460, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1643041407}, "language": "english", "review": "Tags: 3PRPG - Third Person Roleplaying\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Small environments.

I was never a fan of Zelda series, but this game stole my heart. Really good game which you can easily play both with gamepad or keyboard+mouse. Story is interesting and nonlinear so you can take your time to explore the environment and visit in different islands to collect some extras. Extras are not just for achievements, but you also gather experience which will raise your level and upgrade your skills. Unfortunately you cannot choose your skills, but still they are most vital in order to survive when game proceeds.\n\nThere is a lot of different monsters and fighting happens in a real time. Fighting the easiest of monsters isn't that complicated, but when meeting some stronger opponents or bosses you must plan your approach more carefully. There is a few main bosses altogether in the game and everyone acts with some pattern you must solve and try to find their weak spot. You naturally gather some experience by killing enemies, but it usually also rewards you with money and health. With money you can visit shops and swiftly resupply your hitpoints or current tools which include items like arrows and bombs. Most of the things are not available in the beginning of the game. You can also collect these things by killing enemies, thus the shops do not need frequent visiting. They do sell a couple of special items which are quite necessary so money is not totally vain.\n\nThe hero have his hitpoints and mana which you can use to cast spells which are not only effective way to deal some heavy long range damage but also work as a key on some puzzles and can also reveal some new paths. For example the fire spell melts all the ice. Already in the beginning there is a lot of places where you can't get, but when you proceed in the game you will be provided with all the equipment and magic you need to get in the trickiest of places. Some things require also some puzzle solving and attentiveness.\n\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas isn't the most difficult of games and if you die you spawn from the beginning of the same area which aren't too huge and only penalty which you will have is a loss of an experience point or two and if you are lucky you may have time to collect them from the ground before they disappear. Only real challenge lie in bosses and some of them can take few trials and errors before you are victorious.\n\nThis game is like a warm breath of midsummer having sympathetic graphics and sweet soundtrack and a good amount of gameplay which can easily spread few hours longer if you want to collect and explore everything.", "timestamp_created": 1562846543, "timestamp_updated": 1562847081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530483424663543701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54026209": {"recommendationid": "54026209", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960397498", "num_games_owned": 2385, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 955, "last_played": 1562815363}, "language": "english", "review": "As everyone says it's a generic low budget looking zelda clone but it does do the puzzles well enough and I found it worth a play.

Personalmente batalle algunas vecez con las bombas y es que colocarlas es complicado, a vecez las lanza a vecez las deja frente de ti, pero aparte de eso es un sistema bastante comodo.\nLas mazmorras estan combinadas con las islas en su totalidad, y crean unos laberitos muy buenos, que para mi es lo mejor del juego.

I can see how it would be decent enough on a mobile, with the small selection of good action games available, but on the PC?\n\nStarting with the good points:\n- The general art style is nice, with a bright cartoony look that's straight out of Wind Waker (a little too straight out at points, but anyway) and high resolution textures. Gillfolk's Drop in particular looks quite pretty with the rain effects.\n- The music is also good - I wouldn't buy the soundtrack, but it was certainly very listenable and although some tracks were repeated here and there, overall the tracks matched well with the location/usage.\n- The game saves very frequently, which is a positive if you only have short gaming sessions.\n\nNeutral or subjective points:\n- The controls were overall fairly decent - I played both with controller and keyboard/mouse, and I didn't experience any problems. Items were sometimes finicky (particularly the Trencher Boots roll/jump detection and bomb throwing), but not to the point that I'd consider it a real negative.\n- I personally disliked the voice acting and thought it was at best average, at worst eyeroll-worthy, but I will admit I have very high standards in this regard and would rather have no VA than even average VA. So this may not be a negative point for others.\n- The isometric viewpoint is nice in theory and for perhaps the first half an hour of playing, but the joke of a camera makes it very annoying to see where you need to go and the game is inconsistent about attacking and moving between higher and lower levels.\n\nAnd negative points:\n- At best, the level design is bland. The game is short (roughly 8-10 hours for the main story, longer for 100%) so it's not as obvious as it would be in a longer game, but the island areas and dungeons both were unexciting and predictable.\n- The puzzles were insulting. \"Push a box onto a clearly marked button\" is not a puzzle, \"push a box around a corner onto a clearly marked button\" is not a puzzle, and \"blow up a crate and then push a box onto a clearly marked button\" is not a puzzle. And yet they never get any better than this, all the way up to the final dungeon. Honestly, I would have preferred no puzzles to what we got in the game - it was aggravating and annoying having to waste time on the same petty nonsense over and over again. \"Exciting gameplay\" this was not.\n- Connected with this, the entire game was laughably easy. I'm not asking for every game to be Dark Souls-hard - I'd be pretty annoyed if they were - but I feel like I'm not expecting too much to want some level of challenge. The bosses in particular were a pushover, up to and including the final boss. Hell, I died more times to the botfish than I did any of the bosses.\n- The game is extremely linear despite this supposedly being (and drawing so heavily from a series known for being) an exploration game. Even when the game unlocks multiple islands at a time, they can only be traversed in a set order, and the \"extra\" islands have literally nothing except a pair of collectables each. The worst of these is the world map, where you sail around on set routes and can do nothing except shoot the occasional crate and octorock-clone. \n\nI'm gonna put story & character into their own separate point, because this was a big one for me: whoever wrote \"captivating storytelling\" on the Steam store page should be ashamed of themself, because that is a massive flat-out lie. There is nothing captivating about Oceanhorn's story. There is nothing I would even call good about Oceanhorn's story. There are a few elements that could, potentially, be interesting - how do the living fortresses function? What is the connection between technology and magic hinted at on the Island of Whispers? - but they're drowned beneath a sea of yawn-inducing banality. None of Oceanhorn's characters have any real personality or depth to speak of and the unnamed hero is about as blank slate as it gets.\n\nThe story is almost laughably minimal. Here, I can sum it up (spoilers, I guess): The hero finds out that his dad is missing because he's gone to fight a monster called Oceanhorn. There's a dark magic user called Mesmeroth controlling it who has corrupted the three Emblems of the Gods, so the hero has to reclaim the emblems, use their power to reveal the ruins of an ancient kingdom, and fight both Mesmeroth and Oceanhorn. That's it. That's the entire story. \n\nOf course, it can't be content with being bland, it has to also be cliched. The hero's mother is dead. She had a special necklace that the hero wears to remember her. His father (and therefore him) are of a special, noble, ancient bloodline. The villain is evil just because. There's a girl that wants to go exploring but can't because [reason not found] and immediately has an emotional connection with the hero despite speaking with him once. Ancient kingdom that was brought low by their own hubris. Hero's mother sacrifices herself for some reason. Owl people that are known for being wise. Fish people that hate the humans for polluting the water. It just goes on and on and on.\n\nOceanhorn expects you to be emotionally invested in characters that it barely introduces and in a world that it barely explains. What little it does have is things everyone's seen a thousand times before.\n\nOverall, I would rate Oceanhorn a 4/10. It's definitely playable, it looks and sounds nice, and if you're absolutely desperate for a Zelda-like game, this might scratch that itch. But it's bland, overly easy, and the story is terrible. If you can pick it for a dollar or two, then maybe look at it, but otherwise don't bother.

I can imagine how inspiring it would be to a future game developer in terms of wanting to recreate more experinces like Nintendos work. \n\nSo if this company loves zelda why the fuck is this games level of frustration so fucking high, I abosoultly hate what they have created here. The game is a hollow husk version of WindWaker with zero personality or user accesablity that will drive you to either smash your controller or get bored and never finish the game. \n\nSome of the reasons why this game is a failure are its awfully limited poor user interface that explains nothing you want to know. Where the fuck am I going and what the fuck am I suposed to be doing or am allowed to do are frequent things you will question to ad nauseum. You travel to islands throught and though usually its fine to have a system that makes you backtrack and redo an area one more time with your extra abilites but because this game explain nothing youll be back tracking endlessly trying to figure out is it the right time to go back now. On top of that to change island you have to travel on the worlds shittest boat journey without the epic Zelda sea music. Also because of the respawn mechanics you often end of taking damage because the enemies come back to anoy you as your trying to figure out where you are going, frustrating. \n\nSo much of the games character mechanics make everywhere feel like a damn railway track you cant jump or run for more than 3 seconds and the landscape rules mean you often are very very limited as to where you can go. It creates a feeling of imprisonment in a game thats suposed to be an ommage to an exploration game, total fail. The Islands themselves are totally devoid of anything resembling charisma or enjoyable life that would make travel rewarding. I can't remember a single name of any of the brain dead NPCs or even the enmies which are very boring and could have been bought of an epic games asset store for all I know. \n\nA good Ommage builds on what was great about the game it looks up to Oceanhorn however is a brain dead effort that only copies elements of Zelda and makes them annoying or boring. Which blows my mind, why the hell this team put all this effort into a big project like this just to create something so forgetable. There are people recreating entire Nintendo games in HD on the unreal engine yeah heres this pile of shit disater.

This first Oceanhorn game sure is a rough beginning, but overall it's a remarkably solid effort for such a small game, and does a good job at creating an experience with the limited resources available to the team. I thought the world design was mostly pretty good, the character and monster art was reasonably charming, and the game has a nice balance between combat and puzzles, without either being too difficult most of the time.\n\nThat said, a few things rubbed me the wrong way. The first is that the movement controls are quite bad, but in a very specific way. You feel like your character is walking through molasses; turning, or going up or down ramps, seems to slow your character down in a way that feels terrible; but moving in a straight line, once you get going, feels fine. It's weird, and makes for some awkward moments in some of the timing-sensitive puzzles or boss fights where I wanted to yell at the screen for how sluggish the character was responding to the controls.\n\nThe final boss fight also seems to have severe bugs in it - there's a laser-reflection mechanic that's introduced earlier in the game and is used here as well, but it seems broken half the time. Sometimes your reflection ability doesn't actually reflect and you get lasered anyway; other times the laser itself reflects into the ground or gets caught on the boss' geometry instead of responding the way it does in past laser puzzles. Combine this with the sluggish movement and it becomes a very frustrating fight.\n\nThe story is also really basic and uninspired, feeling for the most part like a collection of recycled stories from the very simplest quest stories imaginable. I'm not really sure why this is - good writing is hard, sure, but ideas are cheap, and there don't even seem to be any really interesting ideas here. Some old wizard crossed a line, magical items must be collected, you're the heir of a special bloodline, etc. It was well-presented as far as simple little adventure games go, but I'm left hoping the sequel actually tries to have more interesting narrative ideas.\n\nBut still - it's a cute game with fairly fun gameplay for the most part, it's not too long, and given what such a relatively small team was able to squeeze out of a simple concept and simple parts, I'm still quite curious to see what they do with Oceanhorn 2.", "timestamp_created": 1534611030, "timestamp_updated": 1536095340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540780127048492432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44030730": {"recommendationid": "44030730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007617270", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 829, "last_played": 1506473480}, "language": "english", "review": "Clunky Zelda knock-off, but not in a good way.", "timestamp_created": 1533857945, "timestamp_updated": 1533857945, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43985024": {"recommendationid": "43985024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098325894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1533657416}, "language": "english", "review": "If you were hoping for a dumbed down version of The Wind Waker, but in a style of the DS/3DS zelda games, then you are in luck!\nAnd even if you weren't, check this game out.

It even has hints sometimes to tell you what you have to to, \neven though it's painfully obvious.\n\n[*]moving around feels so slow. You can dash, but only on flat surfaces, and only for a total of 1 second before you have to restore your stamina. This is a big problem because you're going to be moving around a LOT.\n\n[*]nothing unique. It borrows so heavily from Zelda I'm surprised it didn't get hit with copyright claims from Nintendo.

It has a unique charm that keeps me wanting more...and more. But unfortunately, it's 100 percent completed, both achievement-wise and in the game itself. This is one of those games you need to play for about four or five hours to know whether or not you enjoy it. If the terms 'Zelda-like' and 'top down' seem a bit mundane to you after seeing quite a bit of games like those, with a single one of those qualities or both, this is a game you can't afford to overlook, or at least acknowledge, because Oceanhorn seems to be just different enough to be considered a different approach to the genre.\n\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is indeed a Zelda-like game that has everything similar within, such as the dungeons, the way the game's story is laid out to you, an overworld nearly identical to The Wind Waker [except it isn't free-roam], items and equipment you can obtain [not too much variety, though], and mechanics themselves. And not to mention that the game's music is nice and catchy, the occasional voice acting is amazing, and the puzzles are pretty goshdang good. Starting with three hearts as your health, you can find [also not many] 'Heart Pieces', every four earning you another segment of health. You'll eventually get a magic bar as well, learning a few spells along your journey, some of which are even hidden/or optional.\n\nWithout saying too much, and correlating to the similarity to the Zelda franchise, the game's story revolves around the events of the past, before you set out on your journey, after your father who you overhear speaking of something called 'Oceanhorn'. Before you leave your starting island, you'll acquire your father's sword and shield in hope of going after him. And then you learn of the game's plot that pretty much consists of heading to faraway islands, meeting new species that come to aid you, clearing kinda-shorter dungeons and retrieving the three sacred emblems within them. You even find an upgraded sword and shield later on. And you'll learn of the game's lore throughout playing the game, obviously, and I think it's pretty elaborate for a game that's originally an iOS game for Apple phones. Not too many things on the side of the main quest, but there are fifty-five collectible 'bloodstones' you can whack to heck and will count toward getting a ridiculous spell that's really fun to blow everything up with.\n\nOceanhorn really is a fairly big game aside from what the Steam Store page suggests. Fifteen dollars is probably not an amazing asking price, but pick this game whenever it's on sale. Or conversely, get it on your Apple phone and have a mobile-but-less-graphically-enhanced version, if you care about how it'd look. And it already looks pretty amazing, and it's not even that demanding, either, which is great.\n\nIf you love Zelda games and want a great breath of that air, or looking for a decent action-adventure game that's actually extra-ordinary, again, pick up Oceanhorn when you can.

Oceanhorn is not inspired by Zelda \u2013 it\u2019s a blatant knock off, aping the gameplay from the 2D entries and cribbing the aesthetic from Wind Waker while being nowhere near as good as either.\n\nThat Oceanhorn doesn\u2019t measure up to one of the most critically acclaimed franchises by one of the world\u2019s most prolific developers should not come as a surprise, especially considering this was originally a mobile game. This however doesn\u2019t excuse everything in Oceanhorn from being a bit low rent, especially compared to other indie games at a similar price point. The overall presentation is very barebones \u2013 animations (where the devs even bothered) are stilted and stiff, texture and environment work is bland and constantly repeated and the writing and voice acting is absolutely terrible. Nothing here even approaches the quality of even the least fondly remembered Zelda game. Not even Phantom Hourglass.\n\nThat Oceanhorn is still a half decent game in spite of its flaws is more a testament to the quality of its inspirations than to any particular merits of its own. I can\u2019t deny that I had fun, and everything about the design is so obviously lifted from better games that it\u2019s hard to go wrong \u2013 dungeon/puzzle design is solid (though a bit too block puzzle heavy), combat and bosses are what you\u2019d expect and there\u2019s a decent amount of hidden collectables to reward those who go off the beaten path.\n\nHowever, even on steam there are several significantly better options if you\u2019re craving a Zeldalike \u2013 if you\u2019re after a top down game similar to A Link to the Past then Hob is so much better it\u2019s almost embarrassing.

It's not mindblowing by any means but you can tell the small team of devs tried to polish it up as best they could.  Other reviews compare it to some Zelda titles but it does stand out on its own, drawing inspiration from some of the puzzles seen in older isometric games.  While rendered in 3D, the game does have a fixed camera for the most part in a top-down isometric 45 degree angle.  \n\nThe environments are nice enough to look at and the characters all have just enough personality as to not be 100% generic.  There are a lot of tropes seen in other RPG / ARPG games but Oceanhorn puts its own style and spin on it all.  An interview with one of the devs states that supposedly all the levels are made by one guy on a proprietary engine via iPad which is pretty interesting.  I'd like to state that for the most part it's a puzzle game, and not so much a platformer game, although height differences between environmental objects does come into play.  The closest comparison I can think of would be the world of Link to the Past rendered in 3D, tilted to the isomentric 45 degree viewing angle, and then split up and spread across a bunch of cute little Wind Waker islands.  It's not a generic Zelda clone, like say, 3D Dot Game Heroes so some of the other reviews were a little misleading in that respect.\n\nSince the game was out on Android and iPad the combat isn't as refined as I'd like but you won't usually find yourself blaming bad controls for failing any challenges.  I would recommend playing with some type of controller as the keyboard layout isn't very intuitive and you can't rebind 75% of the keys for some reason.  This is my biggest gripe.  It's 2018 and we're still getting video games where you can't customize the controls.  An even bigger issue is due to the mobile restrictions certain buttons are used to do multiple things that don't quite relate to each other.  An example would be the button used for dashing around is the same button used to pick up items and throw them.  If your character isn't lined up quite correct with the item you're trying to pick up you'll find yourself running past it like a dummy.  Little annoyances like this should not exist, especially on a PC port.\n\nIf you compare this game to other mobile games it blows 90% of them all out of the water.  As a PC port it's not going to win GOTY but it's cute enough with enough secrets to discover that will drive you to 100% the game in a short amount of time without pulling your hair out.  It brings back feelings of the first Spyro or Ratchet & Clank titles before they got overloaded with too many sequels, powerups, and silly characters existing for no reason other than to bolster the Intellectual Property's Skylander figures.  The fun is in finding all those coins, eggs, gems, and bolts in a game like this and Oceanhorn's whole premise is constructed around that which is refreshing in an old school sort of way.", "timestamp_created": 1516674889, "timestamp_updated": 1516675032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39478473": {"recommendationid": "39478473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051757691", "num_games_owned": 1234, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1516440172}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks cool and new but the controls are awful and the movement is so weird.

If you're looking for a mini-Zelda, this largely hits the mark considering it's low pricetag (I believe I got it in a Humble Bundle as well.) The game compromises in enemy variety and dungeon puzzle variety (mostly pushing blocks and finding keys.)\n\nThe puzzles themselves were never challenging, but sometimes it was hard to tell what I was even trying to solve. This happens in the later bosses as well, figuring them out ended up being more of a frustrating process rather than exciting like it would be in LOZ. \n\nThe writing is respectable. The game succeeds in building out an interesting world, while lacking interesting characters. I was still impressed though, as I was expecting it to be completely devoid of plot. I was interested enough, and pleasantly surprised by the voice acting for an indie. If the characters were as developed as the backstory of the game's world, it would've been exceptional. \n\nCombat is decent considering it was an iOS port, but could've been much better with a bit of touching up. Blocking and dodging is tied to a stamina meter. I had fun rolling between enemies, avoiding attacks, blocking in time, but that fun was short lived by running out of stamina. The final boss especially became irritating because of this. Some of his attacks seemed nearly impossible to avoid without rolling, but I needed the stamina to deflect certain attacks with the shield. Ultimately the fight felt much more lame since I just healed through his damage so I could expend all my stamina with the shield instead. \n\nIn conclusion, considering that it's an indie game with a low pricetag, Oceanhorn does decently enough to be worth playing if you like the Isometric style of Zelda games. I'm personally a sucker for good worldbuilding, so I found myself driven forward by that, but also I'm less picky about the characters being lightly developed than most as it leaves plenty of room to fill the gaps myself. If you do get stuck anywhere though, just look up the solution. When you \"figure it out\", you won't feel satisfied most of the time. You'll just feel irritated that the puzzle itself wasn't hard, you just couldn't find the puzzle in the first place. \n\nExtra Notes: 94% completion in 13 hours, acquired all optional spells, but unsure if acquiring the rest of the collectables gets anything (reward is given without acuiring all of them.)

I don't think that's a huge issue considering the lenght of the game, but it becomes increasingly noticeable after some time.\n\nThe story and worldbuilding has some nice ground, and you can feel there's something beyond what you're seeing, it's just barely explored and feels like hollow or \"you're just seeing this very narrow side of the story\"; which makes sense in a journey's perspective, but feels like the world closes it's doors to you when it comes to an exploration game.\nI was very into the game's premise. An ocean monster? ancient technology? Ruined cities? Totally my jam! But it doesn't provide anything that you've never seen before or with a decent amount of substance to make them stay in your head after quiting the game.\n\nIn roleplaying games, they say \"the most interesting part about the story can't have already happened when you start\", here you feel you're here for the scraps, and not in a \"you reconstruct the story and make sense of it while defining the new direction the world will take\" (which would be just one of many interesting ways to take a story like this), but in a \"oh, let us tell you what happened and there's this one thing left to do, do it and everything will be fine\".\n\nTraveling from island to island, you just select your destination and wait. You can shoot at some ocasional enemies and crates that will appear but it's so little engaging you'll end up spamming the fire button in the general direction while doing something else. Most boring part of the game by far, I would've loved more items to use on board, things to do or freedom to move myself.\n\nThe boss battles were... the most disappointing part. You explore, fight, and make your way to the islands to find some unique enemies that poses a challenge and... every single encounter is summed up to \"find out what's the gimmick, repeat over and over.\"\nYou're probably thinking \"well, most games in the genre are similar\", but Oceanhorn pushes the boundaries. Maybe one is remotely memorable, the ambientation (either hype before or thrill during) the battle is nonexistant, the arenas are generic terrain you're already tired of... and when I say they're gimmicky I mean they're more trick execution that battles. Every single one of them. The final battle was extremely short as well which left you with a feeling it ended before it even started.\n\nPerformance-wise it runs fine, could be better optimized but no mayor problems.\nIt doesn't support gamepads/controllers with direct input, you'll need to use a third-party to map the controls.\n\nFine game, would give it a recommend if it supported controllers and had a little more content for the price point, for what it is, worth it if interested and on sale.\n\nPS.

This game was not the reason I got the bundle, thankfully.\n\nAnyone who's familiar with [i]The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker[/i] will see that Oceanhorn takes almost all of its ideas from it, down to the blue starting outfit, island travel, cannons, and more. I'd be able to look past this if the game offered much of anything inventive, funny, or novel. It disappoints me in every category, from gameplay to level design to story.\n\nAt first glance, this game has the makings of something good. Puzzle-oriented dungeons and so-so combat make the game seem inviting. As I played more of this game, I found so many shortcomings compared to other games in its genre. I'll cover these in order of importance.\n\n[h1]Controls and Gameplay[/h1]\n\nOceanhorn offers both keyboard+mouse controls and Xbox controller controls. I played the game using a DualShock3 and BetterDS3 to emulate an Xbox360 controller. Sometimes, the game glitches out and reverts to KB+M controls and won't re-detect the controller until you relaunch it. When the controls work, they're okay. No other game does this to me, so I'm sure it's Oceanhorn.\n\nMovement is very clunky. The main character can jog at a very slow pace, and dashing is limited to a single direction at a time. Stamina is depleted upon dashing, and you'll be lucky to cross a screen worth's of distance before running out. It takes roughly 10 seconds from depletion to fully charged stamina. There may be stamina upgrades later in the game, but I couldn't take it by the time I beat the Elder Gillman boss. More on that later.\n\nDespite being in 3-D, Oceanhorn is clearly built using self-contained 3D boxes, which is closer to 2-D design philosophy. They're not voxels (it's traditional polys), but the reuse of assets is apparent. That wouldn't be a problem to me if it felt good to move around in the levels. The standard running speed is too slow to dodge anything reliably, walking up and down stairs is like watching a snail travel, and a later item that allows for rolling expends your stamina too quickly to be of any use. Couple this with a clearly box-oriented world, and you have a game that looks 3-D, but would be better off in 2-D.\n\nWhen you hold your shield up using the right trigger, your character faces the nearest enemy and can strafe... except it's the same speed as swimming (which also eats stamina like crazy). Also of note is your shield can barely defend against anything. Rocks, maybe arrows. That's about it. Aerial enemies can hit you from above, past your shield, too.\n\nNext is interaction. Oceanhorn mimics Zelda once again by using a context-sensitive action button. When you pick something up, hold a direction and hit the action button again to throw it. Aiming in this game is a pain in the ass, due to being stuck in an isometric camera angle. Thankfully, the game will correct for you if you're aiming near anything important.\n\nSpells are something that sets Oceanhorn apart from the games it copies. It adds a second layer of interaction to the game world, which is very welcome. Unfortunately, you must stand in place and aim a cartoon hand at what you want to cast the spell on. Most of the time, this works fine, but if you're aiming at anything from a distance, there's a good chance that you'll cast on the wrong item, wasting your mana. Spells are also expensive, so you'll need to avoid busting things until puzzles are solved if you want to conserve mana.\n\nFrankly, it's apparent that Oceanhorn underwent zero competent play-testing. There are so many minor issues with this game that it becomes a big problem just to play it. There are numerous places where I shouldn't have been able to go, but the weird edge detection would send me into walls. Sometimes, I'd have to hit a button twice to register an action. This game should've been in testing for at least 3-6 months to iron out these issues. One time, I fell through a floor and into the Elder Gillman boss fight, but was unable to correct the camera or escape, forcing me to exit the game.\n\nThe same item that allows you to roll is also used to jump across gaps. That's a great idea, but actually *using* that ability, especially during its boss, is a crapshoot. You'll most likely end up rolling off the edge of things instead of jumping, even if you're stationary when using it.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nOceanhorn is not what I'd call a difficult game; nothing wrong with that, because it's fairly lighthearted and started out pretty solid. However, the difficulty in this game comes from knowing where to bomb things, or \"dodging\" boss attacks that have nigh-perfect accuracy. That is not a substitute for real difficulty! In fact, the Elder Gillman boss in general is a disaster. He hovers near you constantly, and rains boulder shards on you from a distance; one of which is guaranteed to hit unless you dash or roll in time. His freeze laser traps you for 5-10 seconds, and the mechanisms you activate are dependent on switches or using the dungeon item perfectly. On its own, this wouldn't be so bad; cheese bosses can often be cheesed back in return. Sadly, this boss is very efficient at staying in your face, and is difficult to hit with the statues that breath fire. The camera is focused on him the entire time, which makes it difficult to see where you're going. Pots and purple coral will obstruct your way, making this fight even worse.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nHonestly, the story isn't that bad. It's your standard adventure game fare. Instead of a princess, you're looking for your dad, who went to face Oceanhorn. Or something like that. The writing is a little cheesy in places, but overall there's not much to complain about. I couldn't get attached to any characters in the 12 or so hours I played.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nGraphics are easily the best part of this game, but even then they feel... odd. It has a sort of Unity/Unreal feel to it, with over-rendered textures on environments, but cartoony enemies and characters. Kind of an odd mix. My biggest pet peeve is the lack of meaningful camera control. You can \"lean\" the camera using the right stick, but it's never enough to see anything important, and you can't rotate the camera or switch to a top-down view.\n\nWhile we're talking about graphics, let's discuss objects you can destroy. It's not apparent which piles of dirt or rocks you can bomb and which you can't. This is a problem that game developers fixed [b]decades ago[/b]. There's no excuse to not have some sort of visual cue -- even if it's minute -- to prevent the player from wasting bombs or other resources like mana. In fact, Zelda: The Wind Waker *has* clues that suggest hidden items, while Oceanhorn does not. The game does a shoddy job of conveying what it intends you to do, and which areas are accessible. There are tons of places that [i]look[/i] like you can reach them, but are blocked.\n\nUltimately, Oceanhorn has the potential to be an enjoyable, light-hearted adventure game. Its light, unengaged story, frustrating controls and mechanics, and bullshit-grade bosses prevent me from enjoying anything great that this game might have to offer later on. I suggest skipping this game entirely. Word is the developers are working on a sequel; I would wait and see on that before bothering to spend money on an experience that will leave you wanting to play Zelda instead. Other games in the genre just plain do it better. I'm normally a big supporter of indies, but this game was clearly rushed and lacks the polish needed for the game to shine.\n\nIf I could tell the developers of Oceanhorn one thing, it's this: Give your games time to be refined and polished. A rushed game is bad forever. A delayed game can eventually be good. Do yourself a favor and test your games better. Insist on high quality programming; the graphics will come later.", "timestamp_created": 1510367768, "timestamp_updated": 1510367768, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464365512132644653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36383479": {"recommendationid": "36383479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052385538", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1510173850}, "language": "english", "review": "Awkward controls and painfully uncreative.

In any way, it was very poorly communicated where you can jump down and where you cant. For refrence: You can jump down 1 level. Mostly. More than that, and you cant jump. And sometimes you cant jump down 1 level either.\n\n3) Bombable places are not marked what so ever. This is bad and needs to stop. Period. I liked the game but this was very much the largest detrement to that.\n\n4) This is probaly mostly for modders of older games, but it felt a lot like a (very well made) mod from Warcraft 3, due to the way the levels and islands were designed within the limitations of the engine they used.", "timestamp_created": 1504781115, "timestamp_updated": 1504781115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34718676": {"recommendationid": "34718676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043943559", "num_games_owned": 1683, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 902, "last_played": 1504461094}, "language": "english", "review": "An enjoyable old-school spirited Zelda clone, with charming art direction and fun (yet familiar) gameplay.

It takes the classic action/adventure formula and sprinkles in just a little bit of RPG leveling (though, not in the traditional sense). Your main character gets all of the usual moves - attack; block; magic; dash; etc. but the game is paced well enough that you get a new ability, item, or spell periodically enough to keep it interesting. Leveling up doesn't increase stats but instead improves your spells, increases your carrying capacity or grants a new ability. This offers a little extra motivation to fight the monsters along the way and not just run past everything. The puzzles are not too difficult but they were rarely boring and they were easy enough to execute once you figured them out. Many other games make putting the solution together more difficult than actually solving the puzzle, so I am glad Oceanhorn didn't do the same. I also like how the \"drops\" are prioritzed a little bit. If you're low on health the enemies are more likely to drop a heart for you. Low on bombs? They'll probably drop some bombs. It's a nice touch and saves you from running to town to constantly buy supplies. The graphics and sound are all done well, especially for a game that started on mobile devices. I have no real complaints, only a couple of minor frustrations. Having limited movement on the camera is a bit bothersome for a 3D game but it's clearly a choice the developers made based on the style of game. There is also a little bit of backtracking to be done but if you're going for 100% you're going to do that anyway.

This is just..... Hard to review in a sense in how to describe this game.\n\nThis game is good but bad at the same time in some sense; but the good over shadows the bad only by so much... I guess I'll begin with the bad.\n\nBad:\nThe story is boring: In the sense it's your basic adventure story, something evil from an old age of technology and other sh*t comes out of no where and threatens to destroy the world and it's kinda mediocore from there. Sacred places with extra races who are grateful you recovered their technology or home or something precious to them that they give you a treasure so near and dear tot hem that you abuse it for puzzles and your own amusement such as dropping rocks out of the sky onto villagers for the hell of it.\n\nThe sound cues are just as bad, with the exception of the music, which is ok and some of the puzzle solving sounds, everything else feels out of place... When I got the Earth medallion for example, the laser like sound didn't sound like power was flowing from it and it's just awkward silence from there witht he voice from the medallion coming out of it. There are a dozen other sound clips in the game that just dislodge the whole experience. EVEN THE VOICE ACTING IS JUST..... WHY?!\n\nIf it was just the programmers voice acting to their game like the developers in Two World where the teams don't know HOW to voice act; Then I can give it the benefit of the doubt and let that slide for now.\n\nThe Good:\nWhile it isn't as BIG or impressive as the game it's cloning, Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Legend of Zelda, any top down zelda-like game; It does bring other ideas to the table the legend of zelda genre won't touch or hasn't touched on yet.\n\nExperience points: Ok, show of hands, who here finds grinding tiresome after doing it for a while in turn by turn RPG's and who here finds grinding LESS tiresome just by going around and killing lots of badies just because you we're bored and nothing good was on TV... Well, Ocean Horn uses the later part of that experience and it kinda works. What do you gain from the leveling? Well; imrpessive buffs such as the ability to carry more bombs or carry more arrows and so forth. In Zelda you either had to buy that kinda stuff or earn it after a tedious minigame; which is fine, unless that mini-game was a pain and you needed to perfect it. It's nothing new in some other top-down Zelda Clones, but at least this one has a decent idea of how to go about it.\n\nWorld: The world is kinda like a mix between Minecraft and Legend of zelda and weirdly enough, I'm ok with that. You have an area to explore, you can't fall from great heights which forces you to think about how you navigate your terreign and so on. When you travel from island to island, the ocean water kinda looks like real ocean water, nearly realistic that I have to give the developers points for details like this and the different biomes from island to island.\n\nMagic: Before I get stomped on, I want to ask a simple question, Aside from Din's Fire, Nayru's Love, Faore's wind and Large spin attack among OTHER spells in the Legend of Zelda, have any of them interacted int he world that you had to use to solve multiple puzzles? I've only seen it A FEW times in both N64 game's and in Link's Adventure for the NES and that's it. In this game, the spells or at least the magic I've found so far has multiple uses from puzzle solving to simple combat. Earlier I mentioned a spell that dropped rocks out of the sky; that spell can be used to fight enemies since you can throw rocks at them while also it can be used to hit switches you can't normally reach due to some difficulty.\n\nMisc: The monster designs are though out in terms of how you beat them and their complexitity grows with each new island you find and become more difficult to beat. The character models, while not well designed, are ok for the kind of game developed, Puzzles, when solved, don't take 10-20 SECONDS TO SHOW THE EFFECT OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOU SOLVED IT..... Looking at you ocarina of time..... There's places to explore for loot, treasure and it's fun to kill stuff.\n\nI already heard theres an Oceanhorn 2 ind evelopment and after seeing a screen shot of it; I have high hopes for this team toa ctually make a game that could probably rival Zelda.

There's nothing new in it. The story is boring, because it already repeats known patterns - a hero collecting elemental emblems or whatever to win against evil. The figthing mechanics and puzzles are so simple that I wondered if it's not a game directed for children. While fighting some bosses the camera was just infuriating. It  was bouncing all over the place making it harder to navigate the hero and aim at anything.  Guide in Tikarel was clearly pointless - he was basically only talking about level grinding and he didn't have any actual tips. It's sad that having all that guideposts on every island there was no mention on how to make a special move holding action button or how to counterpunch the enemy with a shield (most of the time it didn't work anyway, so it was better to just hold the shield all the time). And this fishing mini-game is pure nightmare - booooooring as hell. Why would I want to repeatedly go fishing, when there are like two moves involved in the whole process and a little bit of luck and patience?\n\nI think that for seasond players this game would be a waste of time - simplicity kills every challenge here and at some point there is no challenge, because you get bonuses with each level and opponents stay the same.

The music in this game is fantastic, and noticeably enjoyable to listen to. I would go as far to say that I would love to have an OST for this game.  Back to the game, the boss battles are fun and clever enough, using your progression as the tool to winning.  The game has a fair amount of meat on it, as of this review i'm nearing the end parts of the story; however, there is still a bunch of collectibles around the many islands to keep you busy and gaining Level Ups.  Yes, there are Level Ups too in this game, which reward you with new abilities, and stronger attributes, making grinding a factor as well if you want to beef up.  \n\nOverall, this is a fun game, and worth the price!

For example, you find jumping boots (for jumping over gaps) only after like 10 locations from when you first see a gap.\n- Sometimes you can't swim on land even though there is land\n- Enemies attack back faster than you can shield yourself after hitting them\n- Fishing is pretty boring and slow (botfish and ghostfish have too much RNG in getting them)\n- Some spells cost so much mana that you can only cast them twice, this can be bad in rooms with puzzles and enemies that require those spells\n- You barely find any coins and you want heart containers from shops, so you tend to not use shop refills.\n- Fetch quests and how the items they ask to bring break up after throwing them at an attacking enemy. You'd think a metal weather cuckoo wouldn't be destroyed after throwing it at a squishy enemy. Also it might be hard to even find a metal weather cuckoo without looking it up on a guide.\n- Can't drop down blocks\n- Too simplistic puzzles and not much difficulty increase in them\n- Unavoidable bomb attacks and bugged laser attacks of the final boss\n\nGood:\n\n+ Overall artstyle and design\n+ Some story elements\n+ Sound/Soundtrack\n+ Controls\n\nDespite a lot of annoyances, I would recommend playing the game.

While not groundbreaking in terms of originality, it succeeds at plunging you into a magical fantasy world and keeps you anchored there on account of its rich lore, thought-provoking puzzles, and sheer volume of environments that are ripe for exploration. Oceanhorn might be a love-letter to Zelda, but perhaps the question should not be whether it rises to Zelda's level, but rather, whether it is able to forge a path of its own that players will remember. In that regard, the answer is a resounding yes. If you are a fan of Zelda games and have been searching the oceans high and low for a similar experience, do yourself a favour and play this now. Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is as close to 3D platforming perfection as it gets.\n\nGood things:                                              \n\n+ Gorgeous art                                            \n+ Excellent, clear onboarding                     \n+ Breathtaking music\n+ Touching narrative\n+ Effortless, intuitive controls\n+ Highliy Immersive\n\nBad things:\n\n- Boss fight camera angles disorienting\n- Final boss too easy", "timestamp_created": 1487566679, "timestamp_updated": 1487567450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603070199489593506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30024416": {"recommendationid": "30024416", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991135353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1461188483}, "language": "english", "review": "im link!", "timestamp_created": 1487474157, "timestamp_updated": 1487474157, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.333874285221099854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30019859": {"recommendationid": "30019859", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994894216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1487089482}, "language": "english", "review": "Oceanhorn is an alright game.

From combat to flare, it doesn't just fall flat, but feels like a two dimensional biege mimic of an actual Zelda game's design.

Breaking things down for the game is hard, because each bland piece is connected to each other bland piece of the sub par jigsaw puzzle. \n\nCombat itself is probably one of the first things you'll notice, as it somehow lack that magic zing that makes it fun. Throughout my relatively short time with the game, none of it really felt either interesting or fun. The sword doesn't feel long enough to feel like I'm a swordmen, and the monsters both take too many hits and are annoying due to the short range. This probably is linked to how crowded the game is. There doesn't feel like any breathing room for flair, an entire town feels like a single street corner instead of an actual town. Dungeons feel like small hallways, and the fighting room just isn't there. Item use, what I have gone through, just isn't creative enough to break the mold and give me something new to work with. \n\nThe worst part isn't really the gameplay, though it is linked to the cramping issue. The game just doesn't have any flavor. The first few shots of the island don't feel any different from each other due to the way the game is set up with its blocks, and there isn't enough small tidbits to make islands feel different.

It's so much of a 2D Zelda clone that I've taken to calling it 'The Legend of Zoldo'. And I have to say it is a very problemed game, and a lot of those problems stem from it originally being designed for a touchscreen.\n\nFor example, in order to make moving the character manageable with a virtual stick the developer opted to make you walk really, really slowly. Which isn't helped with a difficult to control dash move that has you running out of stamina almost instantly (and it takes ages to replenish).\n\nAdd to that the cube-based level design which only lets you jump down from a height of one cube (whereas Zelda lets you drop down as long as there is ledge somewhere below, no matter how far below) and you have to painfully trek back and forth around the levels a lot.\n\nBut the design oversights get worse. For example, you can throw and smash pots (oddly you can't break them with your sword) to get hearts, arrows and whatnot, but unlike Zelda where the item you get is semi-randomised in your favour, in Oceanhorn it's entirely random which means you can get flooded with arrows when your stock is full and you desperately need health or magic. Many times I've had to trek back outside of a dungeon/area until I could top myself up.\n\nThere are also other immersion killers such as the poor implementation of the soundtrack.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't mean the soundtrack itself is poor (anything but), rather that the way it is used is overbearing. The game is constantly playing music that doesn't fit the mood of the scene, many times being just too cacophonous (works great in boss fights, not elsewhere) and, ultimately, tiring to listen to. The tracks don't even loop correctly as you'd expect of videogame music.\n\nFinally there's the several sections in the game where the solutions to puzzles are counter-intuitive because you can't move certain statues/boxes (for seemingly no reason) but can others. Or one part where you have to gather items from the island you are on, but are not given any indication that the last item you need is on a completely different island altogether.\n\nStill, it's not all bad. Some of the puzzle towards the end are pretty cool. And there's a really substantial optional island that is worth checking out. The story too, develops into something that is quite interesting (with the major characters voiced well).\n\nBut, all in all, I feel it's a game that just needs more polish, especially in the dungeons where you mostly do rudimentary puzzles. There's no sub-bosses or cool moments when you are locked in a room against an enemy mob. It's all just very... pedestrian.", "timestamp_created": 1483313616, "timestamp_updated": 1483313616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562102079391479492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28917019": {"recommendationid": "28917019", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993148381", "num_games_owned": 4292, "num_reviews": 187, "playtime_forever": 2128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2112, "last_played": 1483270713}, "language": "english", "review": "Unapologetically inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, Oceanhorn is a fun, if fairly lightweight, adventure/RPG.\n\nThe game sees the player exploring a series of islands (with both overworld locations and buildings/dungeons) from an overhead perspective, fighting monsters with a small selection of weapons (most commonly, just a sword and shield) and solving simple puzzles. The combat is fairly straightforward 'hack-and-slash' in style, but remains satisfying, while the puzzles are generally focused around block-pushing and switches - these are seamlessly integrated into the world, maintaining a good level of variety in most situations.\n\nGraphically the game is again farily simplistic in style, with its roots as a mobile port being clear, but that style has a certain charm to it and means that the game isn't very demanding on system requirements. The soundtrack works well to provide a fitting atmosphere, but I can't see it being anything that remains memorable long-term.\n\nComing in at around 10-15 hours to complete, the game doesn't outstay its welcome but still has enough content to feel substantial. A fairly extensive list of achievements provides an excuse to sink some more time into the game - many of these will come 'naturally' as you play, but there are a few with quite specific requirements that encourage experimentation. One thing that I'd recommend not getting too focused on is the fishing mechanic, as ultimately this brings little reward and is unfortunately based on randomness that does require 'grinding' to see out in full.\n\nAll in all, Oceanhorn gets my recommendation as a very approachable adventure - just don't come here expecting a great deal of depth to the game.", "timestamp_created": 1483305363, "timestamp_updated": 1483305418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549966871738433838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28905631": {"recommendationid": "28905631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128277337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 907, "last_played": 1542925039}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1483283697, "timestamp_updated": 1483283697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498753130435943604", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28845922": {"recommendationid": "28845922", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993204937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1513986765}, "language": "english", "review": "Although the game is relativity short in length it was rather enjoyable, but only get this if you are wanting a short quick adventure game.

If you re-skinned it could certainly pass for a handheld iteration of the franchise. It\u00b4s got heart pieces, dungeon with small keys and boss keys, dungeon items/spell as you progress, collecting powerful ancient artifacts necessary to defeat/reach the final boss. The question is, if it was  a Zelda, would it be a good one? Not really. Would it still be enjoyable? Hell yeah!\n\n[spoiler]Come on: starting off as a kid with no parents, sailing a boat through different islands (wind waker), a city in the sky (SS, TP), \"mirror shield\", an ancient powerful sword, Zoras and Ritos, bombs, arrows, scripted boss fights...[/spoiler]\n\nAs far as \"Zelda rip-offs\" go, this was the best I\u00b4ve ever played. It keeps the light and colorful tone that makes you fell comfortable while playing it. The controls and gameplay are not particularly good, but you must consider this was originally a mobile game, and as far as gameplay goes when fighting enemies it doesn\u00b4t go far from what you'd expect in the handheld iterations.\n\nIs does lack in story, though. Very simple plot, although there is a lore to the game.\n\nAlso, there isn\u00b4t really an open world, you sail from island to island without controlling a boat except for a \"minigame\" in which you shoot enemies and crates in the sea. I wish there was some sort of fast travel option, at least to know places, to skip this sailing bit.\n\nThe graphics are not particularly good, but the artwork and direction are very nice, there\u00b4s a pleasant atmosphere throughout the gameplay, and the soundtrack is just fantastic. Many developers don\u00b4t give the proper dedication to the soundtrack, and is this case it was one the things that made this game so enjoyable.\n\nIn the end, it was worth my buck, but it felt more like an experience than a full-fledged game. I was left craving for more. Not more of the same, but a more polished experience, a PC/console focused game, with better dungeons and better controls. Finally, they would do well with abandoning some part of the Zelda formula and risk trying out their own things, try to become a franchise of it\u00b4s own, and not just a mere tribute to another game.\n\nIt is not quite there yet, but Oceanhorn has what it takes to become the non-nintendo, multi platform Zelda we always craved for, and I have big expectations for the next installment of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1476499424, "timestamp_updated": 1476499424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26040462": {"recommendationid": "26040462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036879243", "num_games_owned": 1189, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 544, "last_played": 1476498502}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

I mean really Zelda-like. As in it doesn't add enough anything new but just takes pretty much everything from Zelda. Some might see this as a bad thing and some as good. The game could've been way better if it did something new mechanically.\n\nThere isn't enough enemy variety. Couple hours in you've seen almost every monster in the game.\n\nI just can't think enough what to say about this game. Bomb walls, hop from another rock to another. Collect bloodstones. Those btw you just need to whack like 30 hits. At first I just didn't think you could get them. Oh and the hopping from stone to stone.  You get this upgrade like halfway in the game and you've seen those out of reach stones from all the way in the first area.

Oceanhorn is the closest you'll come to a Zelda game on PC until Nintendo decide to release games on PC. It is very similar to Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass to the point of almost verging on copyright infringement. \n\nThe story has you as a young boy whos father goes to fight Oceanhorn, a giant ancient mechanical creature that has been terrorizing the world. You travel around different islands discovering weapons and other stuff that while help you face it.

Rather then lazily porting it to PC like a lot of other mobile games, they have put in that extra effort to make it enjoyable on PC and it shows.

OF COURSE YOU ARE. So buy this game and don't look back.\n\nPersonally, the Zelda series is incredibly important to me. Every time I load up a new Zelda game, it feels like coming home. OoT was my first, and I have played almost every single iteration of Zelda ever. I buy the newest Nintendo consoles JUST to play the newest Zelda games. Not even kidding.\n\nI have much longed for anything else to even come close to touching on what Zelda is. And while Oceanhorn does not, of course, replace our favorite silent protagonist, it holds enough similarity that I felt immediately and intimately familiar with its world.\n\nOceanhorn is semi-open world; you can explore most of the islands at your leisure, but many will require certain abilities or items to get to 100%. You will not be able to 100% some islands when you first visit them, and I actually appreciate this; that would make it far too linear.\n\nThe gameplay and, I would argue, the plot as well, are comfortably familiar. You play a young male protagonist known as the Kid, who is not silent; he awakes on an island, must acquire his father's sword and shield, and proceed on a quest to save his homeland.\n\nAdmittedly, the storyline itself is rather short, with no real sidequests except acquiring a couple of optional but helpful spells, getting more hearts via heart pieces/containers, catching a few fish, and acquiring 100%. I also felt that the voice acting, while good by itself, was a bit odd; the animations never matched up, and many of the characters' voices were really off for their appearance (most notably the Kid, whose voice was the deep timbre of a man two or three times the age he appeared to be).\n\nNevertheless, I found myself charmed as I traipsed through Arcadia, collecting Bloodstones and Heart Piees and dodge-rolling through enemies to strike at weak points or evade their giant swords from cleaving the Kid in two. Being originally a mobile game, it doesn't have a huge depth to combat, but it was super fun regardless. I thought most of the puzzles incredibly easy but (almost) never tedious, and there were even one or two puzzles that took me awhile to figure out - which is a HUGE bonus, as someone who loves to have their brain wracked by difficult puzzles (but not by stupidly and pointlessly illogical puzles, looking at you many point and clickers).\n\nI hope that Oceanhorn receives a sequel, one that expands even further upon the game, ups the ante, adds more depth and complexity. Features of future games that would, in my (not so humble) opinion, appeal to the masses: being built for PC or console or both to have greater depth to controls such as combat; deep and meaningful sidequests; more items, spells, collectables, optional items, monsters, etc; larger and more vast world, populated with interesting characters and fulfilling exploration; a larger variety of puzzles requiring items, spells, and lateral or abstract thinking. I'd also love to see more easily-missed secrets added in, especially ones that elude to the lore of the ancient Arcadians or even of other civilizations.\n\nWell now it looks like I'm waiting for the sequel to this as well as Zelda Breath of the Wild.

Despite looking like a 3D game, you can\u2019t jump in this game, so you\u2019re relying on ladders and stairs to climb between floors. Fighting is not the core of this game, so I wouldn\u2019t really call it a hack and slash. Oceanhorn is a port of a mobile game, which is why gameplay is so simplistic, but it\u2019s fun nonetheless.\n\nYou play an unnamed kid whose father has left to defeat the legendary monster Oceanhorn. Recovering your father\u2019s sword and shield, you decide to follow in his footsteps, exploring the wide seas, \u201cunlocking\u201d islands by hearing about them from NPCs you encounter or reading about them in notes found on other islands. Each island you explore has its own quests, treasures, and challenges, until you\u2019re ready to take on the beast Oceanhorn for yourself. \n\nI mentioned that the game is similar to Legend of Zelda, and frankly there are so many similarities that I\u2019m surprised the developers weren\u2019t sued for copyright infringement. There\u2019s a \u201cspecial sword\u201d that shoots projectiles if you\u2019re at full health, bombs to open secret passages, reflecting lasers with a mirror shield, fire and ice spells, a charged up whirling sword slash, breaking jars and cutting grass for item drops, collecting \u201cheart pieces\u201d to increase your max health, regular and master keys for dungeons, and so much more that you\u2019ll recognize if you\u2019re a veteran of Zelda games. \n\nPros:\n+If you like Zelda games, you should enjoy this one. The puzzles aren\u2019t too difficult, and the game itself is rather casual, as you\u2019d expect from a mobile port. Except that the game takes about 10 hours to complete.\n+The graphics are stylishly cartoony, closer to Team Fortress 2 than Diablo, and it runs pretty well on my 6 year old computer. \n\nCons:\n-While each individual island and puzzle is not too difficult, overall you will be asking \u201cwhere do I go next\u201d a lot. This is the biggest drawback of the game as far as I\u2019m concerned.  The game doesn\u2019t have a good \u201cmap\u201d function showing your quest objective, and some of the instructions from NPCs are quite vague. \n-The fishing minigame is annoying as hell, and doesn\u2019t really give you much, but if you want those Steam achievements, you have to endure it. Note that this is one of those Steam games where you can get 100% achievements if you follow a guide. There\u2019s no \u201chard mode\u201d that you need to beat, just those damn fish need to be caught.\n\nOverall, Oceanhorn is a decent game that you can finish over a weekend and then never think about again. I don\u2019t regret taking the time to play it, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll play it again afterwards since there\u2019s nothing really special about it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1471029657, "timestamp_updated": 1471029657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524164319038391113", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24815598": {"recommendationid": "24815598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070269642", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1640, "last_played": 1470329719}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple but nice game which will keep you entertained for some hours.", "timestamp_created": 1470859354, "timestamp_updated": 1470859354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24798313": {"recommendationid": "24798313", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978698121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1470768977}, "language": "english", "review": "Its cute and could be a competent Zelda-y game but hell is it confusing.\n\nHalf the time I have no idea where to go or what to do.

I had my eye on the game previously because of its clear inspiration from Legend of Zelda, and some of the game's odes to the classic series were enjoyable. As a mobile game ported to PC, the controls are kind of janky at times, especially spell targeting. The boat travel was extremely boring and tedious, and disabled any exploration on the open sea (which was my favorite part of Wind Waker). \n\nThe end boss might have been the most frustrating, janky mechanics I have ever seen. [spoiler] The first phase you are supposed to use your shield to deflect light beams onto its legs, but about 90% of the time it just bugged out and never registered. Either I wasn't able to block the beam for some reason, or it would hit the boss and wouldn't register it was hitting him. I finally figured out you can just use arrows+bombs instead, although much more difficult as you will always take damage from his beam trying to do so. This part alone took me a good part of an hour to finally beat. Then the second phase you have to somehow realize that a flute you picked up JUST BEFORE fighting the boss is necessary to just autowin after a short fight against the main antagonist. Talk about cruddy design.[/spoiler] One of my least favorite boss fights in recent memory. \n\nThe story was extremely mediocre and pretty much did nothing for me. I ended up just skipping cutscenes because I found myself not caring at all what was going on in the story. Overall, it was a dissapointing venture.

Before either of those, I'd like to say, as an indie developed game, and as a mobile developed game, there are definitely worse choices out there.\n\nHowever, as a port, the controls are extremely frustrating as something on PC. The controls are remappable, but use, and run are mapped to the same button. This doesn't even make sense with the controller, as the game still leaves 3 buttons, all on the shoulder open. Eventually, I did get a controller, and that made this game a lot less frustrating. In other words, if you're going to play this game, do it with a controller. It's a lot less frustrating.\n\nAs a game on Steam, this is just awful. Sound and graphics are nice, barely above average, but gameplay and story wise, it's awful. It's obvious, if not immediately, as the game goes on that it was heavily inspired by Legend of Zelda:\n\nYou have a voiceless character who's father figure goes out to fight the big bad, and then fights using, among a sword and shield, which become sword and shield of legend, also fights with bombs, and a bow and arrow. He has a spin attack, and he shoots energy out of his sword when at full health. However, the game seems to miss the point of LoZ. The point was you had a world, and that you were growing in skill, along with your arsenal. You didn't just have a combo and a spin attack, your skills grew and you learned all these maneuvers, and the game rewarded you near the end for knowing these cool attacks.\n\nIn this game, you beat the final boss by [spoiler] using a flute you JUST got.[/spoiler] No, I'm not joking. It doesn't matter how many cycles you go through in the final fight, you just do a little trick, that's really not hard, you just don't know you're supposed to do it, and the game doesn't even suggest that you should do it, but you do it because why not and it works, and you want to mash your face against the keyboard.\n\nThere were so many little things that I wanted to turn off the game for, but it made up for it with these little nuggets of fun: fighting is generally fun, and I honestly can't remember another time I had fun with this game. There are walls to blow up, like in LoZ, another similarity, but this time, you don't get any tips on when or where to do that, which seems to be a trend for this game. The sailing is totally worthless. The original point in LoZ: WW was for you to sail the seas, with only a map and compass to show where you have and haven't been. Here, they put you on a rail shooter, because god forbid they put something fun in this game. \n\nAlso, why, why, why did they put fishing in here. It's not fun. At all. And the worst perpetrator of this is the horrible robot fish that kills you if you don't hurry up and win.\n\nOh yeah, and the story is garbage. Doesn't make any sense, and the game doesn't try to make sense of it, except this huge info dump your dad(uncle?) drops on you after you beat the boss, in the stupidest way imaginable.\n\nHonestly, i wanted to like this game. Originally, I couldn't run it that well, so when I upgraded my PC, I played the game again, and tried to have fun. But with the shallow, lifeless characters, and the convoluted, unexplained plot, it feels like a campy 60's movie turned into a video game. What is the Oceanhorn? Why didn't my dad go pick up all these weapons that I'm using? [spoiler]*Why did the flute he brought with him become the key in beating the Oceanhorn???* ***WHY??***[/spoiler]\n\nIn short, don't buy this game for full price, it's not worth 15$, or even 7.50$, in my book.

The way they reference certain 'tropes' that can be expected of Zelda games, I think, was well done. For example, collect the three sacred things in the three differently themed areas, that assemble into one magical thing so you can fight the big bad. The story itself (while not extremely involved or creative) is somewhat original as opposed to lifted from the Zelda series. Many of the cinematic scenes had pretty good voice acting, which I didn't expect at all.\n\nHowever, most of the game was pretty subpar and in all honesty feels like a fancied up mobile game. The movement and controls were slow and clunky both with kb+m and controller. There is no button to view the map, so you have to work with the mini-map the entire game, including on dungeons with multiple floors. The sailing is completely on rails and unnecessary because there's no real threat and it only takes about 30 seconds. You can't have more than one item equipped at once so switching is a constant. Rather than have sidequests to add depth, there's an odd level up system for extra items + upgrades, which is tied to the achievement system. But most importantly, it's just not all that fun, with most enemies not presenting much challenge (apart from maybe mechanically because of control issues,) and not much actual meat on this platter.\n\nThe game also has autosave and no manual save option. This meant, when I loaded my save back up to try to get the stuff I was missing (I hit 82%), I soon discovered that I was automatically dumped into a room that existed between the final boss's two stages with no possible exit. So if you DO decide to get this game, and care to complete it, don't even go near the final area until you've gotten everything else done.\n\nOverall I had too many problems with this game to fairly recommend it to anyone.\n\nEdit: It's been 2 years since I wrote the original review, and the game is still $15 at full price. I considered changing this review to say it was maybe worth a try assuming it would be lower by now, but once again I find myself disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1469931880, "timestamp_updated": 1532284614, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482376337051391602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24622123": {"recommendationid": "24622123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011521745", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1010, "last_played": 1469911959}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was really awesome.

In the end though, if I have to choose between \"Good\" and \"Bad\", I just can't give it good - too bad because it came pretty close.\n\nThis game is in many parts a great love letter to zelda (sometimes bordering on rip-off but oh well, if it's well done I can certainly live with that!). It's got a cute colorful world, fairly good dungeons, good puzzles.\n\nUnfortunately for me the fun ends there. First of all this game only supports xbox gamepads, which means my very common logitech gamepad is unsupported (pretty much every other game I've ever played supported it just fine), leaving me to play with the awkward keyboad controls. The developer of the game appears to be aware of this but refuses to patch the game to support other gamepads. So the game definitely loses points there, it would probably be a lot smoother if I could play with a gamepad.\n\nThen there is this terrible boss battle where you need to avoid shots from turrets, except that the camera always places itself in such a fashion that you cannot see the shots coming, or at a weird angle that doesn't give you a good 3D perspective, so I'm always killed by shots coming into view at the last fraction of a second that there was no way I could avoid. After trying a dozen times to beat this boss, I'm giving up. \n\nAlso there is a single save file, so I can't go back to come later with better equipment.\nI have nothing against a challenge, but I'd much rather feel like I'm fighting the boss and not the camera or the controls.\n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1469836398, "timestamp_updated": 1469838247, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494444429874420166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24529572": {"recommendationid": "24529572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052501706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 717, "last_played": 1469499832}, "language": "english", "review": "It's small-scale, top-down, isometric Wind Waker with the stamina system from Skyward Sword.

Don't be fooled by this Zelda clone.\n\nAs many others have stated before, Oceanhorn is boring, excessively repetitive, and it just copies the worst of the worst of Zelda games. The puzzles are always the same, lazy puzzles with no innovation: pushing blocks and pressing switches. Some \"puzzles\" are illogical and make no sense: sometimes you are stuck and you are expected to put a bomb on some wall which is not cracked and seems like a normal wall (how the hell is one supposed to guess that without reading a walkthrough?). The battle sistem is repetive since the enemies are the typical ones (again, no innovation), and the hero moves quite slow. The graphics are cool (it is probably the only good thing of this game). IMHO, the story is boring. Of course, the NPCs of the game have zero charisma and no charm, as the game itself.\n\nTo summarize, Oceanhorn is a very boring game, with cool graphics but with bad puzzles, bad combat system, bad story, and no innovation.

I lean more towards recommending it on the basis that it is at least a very good casual game that would probably keep younger gamers busy -- around 8-12.  For harder core gamers, it is a little too oversimplified.\n\nThe game has a very slick visual style (a couple of the monster models withstanding, such as the bird-like enemy) and the graphics run famously at maximum settings on my overclocked 2012 PC (3.4 GHz Intel i3570k tuned to 4.0 GHz clock) with a 2015 graphics card (Radeon R9 X290 OC).  It is gorgeously presented and utterly beautiful.  The reflections from the surface of the water are sublime and the environments are truly immersive.\n\nThe gameplay, on the other hand, doesn't live up.  Combat involves almost no manoeuvre and is a slog between holding down the block key and hammering the attack button.  From time to time it can be strategic to let go of the block key and dash away, although this is more often rewarded with an enemy stabbing you in the back than with any actual benefit to your character that it is usually meaningless to try.  When you unlock magic spells, you gain a moderate cost \"magic missile\" spell that never misses its target; enemies have almost no personality other than the size of their hit meter and how long it takes to hurt them.  The most inventive enemy in the game is one with a mask which can only be knocked off with this spell or by throwing an object at them.  The others are, more or less, simply hit point meters that walk.  This is made even worse by the fact that their AI is almost nonsense: they will either lock onto you and blithely pursue you, or will suddenly and arbitrarily go back into unaggressive wandering behaviour.  (If they wanted to create a morality play where I feel remorse for haplessly slaughtering non-hostile creatures, they succeeded there, at least. =))\n\nTo coin a phrase, it has a \"none with a but\" style.  None of the monsters are well-designed, [i]but[/i] one of them is.  None of the puzzles are difficult, [i]but[/i] one is.  None of the combat conveys a sense of danger, [i]but[/i] the ogres do the first time.\n\nControls are a bit twitchy, since the mouse controls your point of aim and is often relative to your character instead of relative to the position it is on the screen.  (This part might be better with a gamepad.)  The game doesn't have the responsiveness of a purebred action-adventure game and is really more of a pure adventure game with interactive combat.  For instance, once you unlock the bow, trying to shoot a flying enemy that is south-southeast of you will result in many wasted arrows.  There is no first person aiming and thus no ability to carefully choose your target -- your arrows are auto-aimed to a rather ridiculous degree at times, especially as the threshold for where the auto-aim kicks in seems to be unreliable.  There is no locking-on of targets to specify which one you would truly prefer to attack.\n\nThe game appears to be remarkably short (I figure I'm at least a third of the way through after 4 hours of play), made longer only by grueling semi-interactive travel sequences.  Where the game with a very similar visual style would allow you to control your boat, this game is oriented more for auto-piloted navigation.  Your first travels between islands are pointless as there is no user interaction whatsoever, and could just as easily had been done away with entirely.  That they were included at all implies that the game was trying very hard to emulate another.  After your first travels, your character unlocks an ability that does unlock interactivity during the boat travel, but all it does is turn the boat travel into a tablet-like point-and-shoot minigame which has extremely little variety while your boat still travels on auto-pilot.\n\nUnfortunately the slick visual presentation is the only shellac over top of a samey plot and astoundingly shallow character interactions.  The characters completely fail to motivate the player: they are entities in a world in the same sense that a psychopath might view people walking down the street.  For instance, there is an implied romantic attraction between your character and another about 25% of the way through the game, with absolutely [i]zero[/i] exposition or setup as to why.  Even Miyamoto's games, with no more than a couple dozen lines per character, managed to express emotional attraction -- this does not.  I literally put my face in my palm for this one.  Literally.  I barely watched the cutscene through my fingers while shaking my head and laughing.  The only character I felt a genuine sympathy for was the \"last of the Owrus\", after visiting a grave nearby his house after reading the sign in front of the house -- the best example of \"show don't tell\" story writing, which (most of) the rest of the game sadly missed the ball on.  The game does express a hint of poignance in the bleak backstory now and then, but there is too little exposition for it to be more than fleeting.\n\nThe puzzles are very simplistic.  Never once did I have to pause for more than a second to figure anything out.  For instance, avoiding any spoilers, the supposedly cryptic messages that talk about gaining a particular item from a green chest are obvious exactly what that item is.  The only time I ever got \"stuck\" in the game is because I failed to notice that I could blow up a single barricade on the desert island at the very beginning, and even then I figured it out simply by double-checking the areas accessible to me and testing areas for vulnerabilities.  One of the puzzles later on in the game, en route to collecting the shield, is quite obvious in intent and solution and made frustrating only by the clunkiness of the movement and aim controls, including a need to quickly and precisely target two sword swings and a spell as well as several jumps.  Perhaps a gamepad would have served me better here too.\n\nWith all of those negatives, you would assume that I absolutely hated the game, but the game is well presented enough that, chore of gameplay aside, it is strangely compelling.  The music is utterly fantastic.  The game manages to capture \"fun\" without actually being particularly well done, and that is remarkable on its own.  It is a gorgeous romp through varied locations and all extremely atmospheric, even if all are extraordinarily short.  The voice acting is phenomenal and incredibly professionally done (not sure what VAs the other reviewers are listening to, but mine were great ;-)), although the characters are so one-or-two dimensional that it is difficult to develop any particular attachment.  There isn't enough of character interaction to make the world come truly alive, but it is certainly alive enough to watch as an external viewer: peering through the looking glass without ever deciding to step all the way into the rabbit hole.\n\nAn advanced gamer will probably turn their nose up at it, but it would definitely be something you could point a child at for mindless fun.", "timestamp_created": 1463266673, "timestamp_updated": 1463291577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22973575": {"recommendationid": "22973575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088033314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 956, "last_played": 1458950554}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]The Legend of Oceanhorn[/b][/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Full Review at [url=http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=148]GameDragons.Net[/url][/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Presentation[/b]\nThe premise behind Oceanhorn's story is something you have probably seen a hundred times before, as the story kicks off with the hero's father leaving to save the world, only to put you in control of the hero with a quest to find your father and help him defeat Oceanhorn moments after. From there onward you'll experience an entire Zelda-like adventure, looking for the location and a way to defeat Oceanhorn and rescue your father. There is always something new to discover, but Oceanhorn's biggest miss is when you realize that all your discovery excitement that builds up as you move forward quickly goes back to zero once you realize that there are few things to experience besides the main story. There are sixteen different islands to visit, mostly serving as an essential part to the storyline, but only a few of those have gameplay value to encourage a full exploration such as Tikarel which serves as the main town where you can buy items and take on new quests. \n\nUnfortunately, the rest of many are only a one-time visit deal, as you can finish everything there is to see and experience in less than 15 minutes and never return to that island again. There are some activities such as finishing and completing the different challenges that might add a bit of variety, but even those feel repetitive and pretty basic to any RPG. The story itself has nothing much to offer as you can probably guess how it's all going to end from the very beginning, but nevertheless, the journey all the way to the final island is an enjoyable ride if you're willing to look past the repetitiveness and basic concepts.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nNot only does Oceanhorn feel like a Zelda game, but it plays like one too; if you have played a Zelda game before the formula will seem very familiar to you: make your way to that dungeon, defeat the boss in order to obtain the item you need, return to town to gather more information about your next quest and repeat until you get to the end. Navigation is done via a Wind Waker-like boat mechanic that allows you to travel from one island to the next one using your boat, but there are very few things to do on sea, as the only thing to keep you preoccupied while you reach your next destination are the barrels and mines that randomly pop in front of you as you sail, but after a while, even those start to become more annoying than fun, as the whole concept becomes repetitive and unrewarding. \n\nOn land, the gameplay is pretty basic, as you only have a few spells at your disposal and your sword attacks, but once you realize that some spells are only useful once for the boss battle that they were designed for, the whole adventure will only become more and more repetitive. There are only a few enemies that you will encounter throughout your adventures, most of which can be defeated with basic sword attacks that require no strategy at all, while the boss battles vary in quality, as some of them feel intelligent and rewarding, while others are just a very long game of poke-poke-hit. Apart from the main quest itself, there are few things to keep you occupied in your adventures and while locating all of the bloodstones feels rewarding in the end, that reward will probably come in too late as you would've already finished the game by then.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nNoting the fact that Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas was originally an iOS game, it did make its transition to PC and consoles quite well, as the game does look beautiful on the big screen, but don't expect anything breathtaking, as even with an upscaled resolution the game still lacks the details a console or PC game would have. The design is basic, and there are only a few environments that vary from one island to another, but for most parts the world around you looks pretty similar no matter where you are. The animations could use a bit more work and the characters a bit more detail, but overall as a top-down RPG, Oceanhorn has enough to keep your hero on track.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nThere are some great tunes in here, and if you didn't know different you could say there were in the soundtrack of a Zelda game, but they do start repeating after a while and it does make it boring listening to the same thing all over again. The effects are enough to justify the means, but the voice acting is absent, not that the game would necessarily need it since the quests instructions are pretty clearly delivered via text dialogue, but it would've been nice to have that option, at least for the main cutscenes to make the whole missing father story more personal.\n\n[b]Extras[/b]\nYou can finish the whole game within 10 hours, add a few more if you're willing to revisit every island in order to gather all the bloodstones and complete all the challenges, but that's pretty much all of it, and since some skills are required to access a few areas, you can't complete everything in your visit visit, so you will have to deal with the repetitiveness of the main story first and then move on to the repetitiveness of the sidequests.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nIt's impossible to deny the fact that Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a Zelda clone since it feels, plays and looks like a game in the Zelda series, but it's a pretty decent one, so if you liked Zelda and want more of it, Oceanhorn might prove to be an entertaining adventure for you. The game does come with its flaws and lack of content, but in the end it will prove out to be an adventure worth playing.\n\n[u]Rating: 7.1[/u]", "timestamp_created": 1463222362, "timestamp_updated": 1594983955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22952271": {"recommendationid": "22952271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088775500", "num_games_owned": 2984, "num_reviews": 279, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1009, "last_played": 1462018017}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nQuite a fun game , I've never played any of the Legend Of Zelda games, but this has alot in common with them, I hear people complain about it being a rip off, but who cares, I had great fun with it, nice exploring , nice advancement and progression , it was a really good fun game, who cares if it's like Zelda, there are no Zelda titles on PC so don't complain about it being to Zelda, be happy that there is a Zelda-esk game on PC, oh yeah and enjoy the game, it was a really really great game :) 4/5!!!", "timestamp_created": 1463137611, "timestamp_updated": 1464358828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604427576065063477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22951683": {"recommendationid": "22951683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019801059", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1561570421}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me sorprendio mucho este juego, colorido y con una mecanica que recuerda al zelda, lastima que los combates no sean demasiado buenos, para el precio que tiene vale la pena.", "timestamp_created": 1463134589, "timestamp_updated": 1463134589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22904882": {"recommendationid": "22904882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003719394", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 788, "last_played": 1461397614}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little indie game, If you like The Legend of Zelda games, You will enjoy this, It has alot of the feeling from TLOZ.", "timestamp_created": 1462931706, "timestamp_updated": 1462931706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465994954109191895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22874252": {"recommendationid": "22874252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044122038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 164, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1462764244}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks like Zelda on the outside, but on the inside it's just another mediocre indie game.

To begin with the story, it's not anything special, so you'll just live with the fact that your father left you to destroy the expanding evil. As a good son, instead of being hateful, you become a powerful knight that will save the world and unite all races, surpassing your father.\n\nBut from what exactly you'll have to save the world? Well, from three types of steampunk machines and a possessed living fortress, and few native creatures like trolls or orcs, which also have pretty low variety. Overall, Oceanhorn is limited this way, as you'll meet just few distinct NPCs and beat them with one of two swords, bow, bomb or one of your five spells.\n\nThe steam page says it's also an RPG but I think that's overestimated. Even though there is a leveling system, there aren't many character levels and each level up brings you a passive bonus, e.g. increased amount of bombs or arrows you can hold. There isn't any inventory system and even though there is a currency system, you'll save money for later anyway, because only appealing items in shops are the (two) expensive ones. All cheap stuff in shops are arrows, bombs, mana or health refills but you won't need to buy these - anytime you are missing something, the game drops it for you from the next enemy, bush or vase.\n\nLow difficulty is something that really disappointed me. All puzzles are laughably easy and neither the combat is challenging, especially after you claim the second sword. Bosses might seem scary but they are easy too, it's like they want you to win with a single repeating pattern: Do something to stun them, tap your slash button until they stand up, and repeat two more times.\n\nThere are height differences on islands but the level design is pretty limited, you can't even jump down the cliff if it's higher than a block. After about 5 hours of playtime, you'll at least learn to roll and jump between blocks close to each other. Anyway, the game holds your hand in most moments so nothing bad can happen to you and if you fail anyway, you just respawn at nearest checkpoint and dead enemies are still dead until you leave the location. The game also have problems with occasional crashes, it crashed every hour in average but it's not a big problem since the game saves your progress often.\n\nIt's not complex, it's not hard, so what? Oceanhorn feels like a food for completionists. It has a good amount of achievements and it motivates you to explore all the areas, to find every treasure ([i]even though you know it'll contain useless junk like an old shoe[/i]). There are a lot of secret areas and there's also a well-made challenge system - Each discovered island shows you three new challenges that you can beat anywhere in the game. Those challenges varies from \"kill X enemies\" through \"drown your enemy\" to \"catch your first fish\".\n\nThere are two minigames in the game, fishing and sailing between islands. Fishing is completely optional but the sailing, that's something you'll have to do many times... and it's annoying. You set the place to sail to and there are boxes, mines and sea creatures in your way. To get through, you have a gun with unlimited ammo and attack speed - it just shoots everytime you tap the attack button. It's a boring playtime filler where you are just mindlessly shooting everything, that you can't skip.\n\nThe colourful graphic design is something that definitely stands up for Oceanhorn in the amount of negative facts around. At least if you don't mind that all characters look like kids. The soundtrack is fine, it contains average positive melodies that you won't mind listening repeatedly, but you forget them immediately after you finish the game. \n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nOceanhorn comes as a disappointment by many features - low variety of everything, poor story, low difficulty, very limited RPG mechanisms. But it has its positives, as it'll make many completionists entertained for being able to explore all the islands with many secrets and challenges. That's why I think it's worth recommending to people seeking relaxing and easy game, just don't expect much from it.

Unlike many similar indie designs, Oceanhorn doesn't feel like an homage or a tribute (much in the way that Ittle Dew or Binding of Isaac do) -- instead it feels like a somewhat randomly curated collection of Zelda artifacts, patched together in to... something, without really knowing what all those pieces were meant to do in the first place. While it is an enjoyable playthrough, the game shows its most promise in the rare moments where it isn't trying to shoehorn another Zelda trope in to it's structure.\n\nThe story hurts the most of the trouble; many of the characters are direct references to Zelda staples, but they lack any of the history or context of that series, so instead of feeling like they contribute, they just end of feeling hollow or forced; the villain, for example, reads as a Gannon cliche, not as an evil peer. And in an effort to create gravity, many ridiculous plotholes are developed -- we're told that the world is in terrible shape, but we never see it; the Gillmen have been waiting for help for centuries, but it's not clear why they haven't sought help; the Sky Islanders watch everything, but are completely in the dark about anything meaningful (not to mention that they have advanced technology, but couldn't figure out a safe way to get to the ground). Heck, the game even tells you that you're liked in town, and drops a romance in your lap, which is crazy because when it happens you're little more than a pot-smashing drifter in town.\n\nAnd with all the mirroring between Oceanhorn and the Zelda games, there is an unfavorable light cast on all its rough edges. The camera doesn't really work; there's mismatch between the overwrought dialog and its subtitles on several occasions; there's numerous small glitches and inconsistances that can ruin whatever it is that you're doing. And if Oceanhorn stood on its own, I'd probably be comfortable ignoring all of that; it's just how firmly planted in the shadow of another series the game chose to be that makes these issues pop to the fore.\n\nThat all said, it's a reasonable length for a good adventure; it's most tedious parts are either optional or far apart; and the game oozes with a respectible amount of polish. I think the dev team put some serious elbow grease in to brewing this game up, and they realized the concept admirably.

The puzzles are not nearly as well design as its counterpart that it's trying to rip-off and halfway through the game it starts feeling like a chore rather than fun. \n\n- Selecting an island to travel, has you sailing in a ship that looks eerily similar to that in Legend of Zelda Wind waker. However you don't actually control the ship, the game does that for you while you shoot from a canon, destroying the same enemies over and over again. It was fun in the beginning but like the rest of the game it starts to feel derivative after a while. \n\n- Story and characters feel very uninspired. \n\n- Boss Battles are boring and frustrating to play. \n\n\nConclusion.\n\nOceanhorn is HEAVILY inspired from the legend of zelda series, and while that may be a good idea the game fails in its execution.

Between all Zelda games, this game is more like Phantom Hourglass, with some difference. Although i don't want this review to be Zelda-Oceanhorn comparison, i guess i can mention some similarities and differences between the two. Both games has \"sailing\" minigame, where you can go to other islands and sail, which there might be some obstacles and enemies that you can shoot along the path, minus the upgradeable ship, pirates, and travelling merchant ship which sells you items and a heart container (however, there is an island who sell the heart container). Both also has tricky puzzle and creative boss battle (only some bosses in Oceanhorn can be considered like that, though).\n\n--\nWell, enough blabbering about Zelda, since i want to review this as its own game.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nOceanhorn serves you with its outstanding UI at the start. The font and style really matches so well, not to mention a beautiful soundtrack in the beginning. However, i must say that i was quite dissapointed soon after i start the game, because the 3D models isn't as good as the UI. The models look stiff and some facial expression (especially Neeti, a girl in an island) looks weird. The hero always looks angry. I know it's quite hard to make a facial expression, but if you decided to use one face from the start to finish, it better be a bright one. Also, some animations looks weird. One example is on the cutscene when the hero sleeps.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nAlthough i said before that Oceanhorn comes with a beautiful soundtrack in the beginning, i have to say, that i forgot most of the soundtracks in there, or maybe i didn't notice there is a soundtrack at all. The soundtracks are quickly forgotten. There is no difference playing it muted or not. Well, graveyard island might be an exception though, because it's quite creepy.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nIf you think that Oceanhorn comes with a beautiful and captivating story, you are mistaken. The ending only gives me a \"huh?\" feeling, since it didn't capture an ending moment perfectly (for those who have played this game, i just didn't like the fact that they are talking normally like nothing happened). The story is already set from the start, with some details in each of the cutscenes. In the middle of the story, they made a pair out of nowhere, and it's not romantic at all, even if they are put together in the night sky watching fireworks. But luckily, cutscenes are skippable and you can rewatch it anytime.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nWell, since i said that the models, soundtrack, and story are a no, maybe you are wondering as why would i recommend this game. Simply put, with all the defects, i am still satisfied with the gameplay. Let me elaborate.\n\n[b]There are tons of dungeons and puzzles in this game.[/b] Most puzzles are creative enough to make you think, and there are some collectables which require you to solve some puzzles first. I must admit that i can't solve some puzzle and have to consult a guide somewhere, but it's not to a point where it's frustating enough and you have to see a guide in order to solve all puzzles.\n\nTalking about puzzles, i must say that i was quite mad with the control at the start because you can't jump, only to find out that you can only jump after obtaining an item, which soon disappoints me because of the odd jump mechanism. You can only jump through one gap (you can't jump up and down one level). Also, you will roll if you can't jump, which makes you to really have to go through the corner in order to jump. I ended up stopping and jumping instead of running/walking and jumping because of that, which looks weird.\n\nYou can bomb some places to reveal a new path (and it doesn't looks bombable at all). However, it makes me stuck on some point. Although i have bomb the spot before, it didn't collapse, which makes me have to consult a guide to look for a new path, only to find myself to bomb the very same spot.\n\n[b]There are some collectibles in this game.[/b] There are two collectibles, namely heart pieces and bloodstone. You might be wondering at the start on how to collect bloodstones (and it's quite annoying to do once you find out how to), though. There is an item to track bloodstone and although you can't track heart pieces, this game has a completed guide which you can consult to. However, i am quite dissapointed that you have to retrack all the way just to recollect all the collectibles after you can jump because it takes time as the map is quite big and travelling between islands costs time.\n\n[b]Some challenging boss battles.[/b] Although i must say that the final boss is quite dissapointing (it's easier than all the bosses in the game), the others are quite enjoyable. Okay, maybe the first boss is easier because it's similar to a boss in Zelda game (i forgot which), but it's still weird to think that the final boss is super easy if you already know what to do. The other bosses are more creative imo, especially that shadow thingy, because it has two phases. I was expecting the final boss to have something like three phases, but it's only two dissapointing battles.\n\n[b]Minigame[/b]. There is a fishing minigame in this game. Luckily, it's quite easy. You can get the fish you are looking for in less than 5 tries. However, some fish are exclusive in an area and most fishes took quite long to catch. There are some \"specials\" in some fishes which can make it harder, but overall, it's just the same as catching other fishes.\n\nThere is also a minigame where you are traveling between islands. You just need to shoot everything and it's relatively easy though. However, in my opinion, it's taking quite a long time, especially on the \"cutscene\" when it docks, which can't be skipped.\n\n[b]Challenges[/b]. There are some challenges which is linked to steam achievement and you can unlock it in other island. Sadly, you can't see the achievement list in one go because it's only listed by 3 in every island. Some challenges can be done as you progress the main story and some needs you to grind a little or do a certain trick.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\nThis game is great for casual gamers and can be 100% quickly. The challenges aren't hard and doable.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nI would highly recommend you to buy this game when it's on sale, but if you are dying for Zelda games right now, why not just press that Add to Cart button and buy it?", "timestamp_created": 1461982417, "timestamp_updated": 1461983689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22709039": {"recommendationid": "22709039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265479902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1201, "last_played": 1523461078}, "language": "english", "review": "this is a great little zelda type game its loads of fun altho the puzzles and bosses are a bit to easy, i got 100 % complete in 15 hours on my first play throw im shore i can knock this down closer to 8 hour now i know ware things are. \n\nif this game was 3 time's the size it would be a must by for zelda fan's as every aspect you expect in a zelda game is in hear.\n\ni would give it 8/10 but only because of the game size i would expect games like this to take about 40 hour's to complete not 15 hours witch leaves the game feeling unfinnished\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1461954737, "timestamp_updated": 1461954737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22694220": {"recommendationid": "22694220", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994007641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1048, "last_played": 1435616766}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good, mindless Zelda-esque game.

Sadly, that sometimes includes both you and hazards. Of course, that is my only real gripe, as the other controls are well-mapped (to the point that it really FEELS like Zelda), the landscape - well. seascape - itself is beautiful (tho it REALLY should have emulated Wind Waker more, IMHO.  I liked sailing to my destination myself, rather than picking an island and just going there with what amounts to a minigame or five along the way), the music is nice to listen to, and the story is also good (even if I find some dialog lacking). It's a good game, don't get me wrong, but it really pales in comparison to the series that rather obviously gave the creators inspiration.

I would estimate that a 100% playthrough would only take about 10 hours.  Considering that is less time than an average LoZ game, I am a little disappointed.  Still, it is respectable given the price.  Still recommended, but know you're basically getting a truncated game in comparison to LoZ itself.", "timestamp_created": 1460981285, "timestamp_updated": 1490421542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22491500": {"recommendationid": "22491500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077161308", "num_games_owned": 1292, "num_reviews": 201, "playtime_forever": 954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 954, "last_played": 1460948612}, "language": "english", "review": "So close, yet so far, from being good, good. But, there is still fun to be had!\n\nHeavily inspired by Link/Zelda games Oceanhorn slowly, eventually, groggily delivers an adventure. It doesn't quite get close to Link but the inspiration is there. The early parts of the games feel like if you injected Link with horse tranquilizers and fed him 50 muscle relaxers and gave him toddler toys as a quest. The game just never decides its identity between ultra-casual young child adventure with no repercussions or something much more broad and deep with semi-complex puzzles and story nuances. And I think it struggles at that in a gameplay sense, at least in part, because of it being a mobile/tablet port. But thankfully by the second half it does evolve to a game with some average difficulty and challenges that most definitely a small child could not complete. Its just a very broken flow and stride to get there. A stride that was always a few steps too slow for my liking.\n\nThe world and story is complete though. And combat and puzzles do become quite fun. There's a fun adventure to be had. The pacing, or lack there of, pushed me into wandering and grinding. I'm not big on arbitrary video game \"achievements\" or \"trophies\" but going for them all in this game majorly contributed to my fun factor. What you get out is what you put in with Oceanhorn. You have to make a concerted effort with the game, but I think it was worth it. \n\nThere's more I could complain and nitpick about too. The fishing system is absolutely silly. The gun on the boat should've just been mounted to explain why you don't get to have it anywhere else. The boat travel in general could've had more variety. Blah blah blah. The point is, the game has issues. But never did I consider quitting or did any of them ruin my time.

However, it wasn't long before I started to enjoy the game in it's own right. It reminded me more of an old Playstation game by the name of Alundra more than Legend of Zelda. There is as much exploration and puzzles as there is adventure and fighting. Oceanhorn's story doesn't take too long to get into and honestly if I put down the game for a few days I would forget what I had to do despite the ability to review previous cutscenes. It's a really cool isometric game that deals with exploring various islands in a water ridden world.\n\nThe story was solid and never deviated far from the main goal of finding your father and defeating Oceanhorn. There were side quests a plenty along the way that brought you a little closer to your goal. Some featuring puzzles that required very little thinking, quick or otherwise. The general fighting was simple but gave you a few ways to approach how you would kill enemies. Boss battles took a slight learning curve before understanding their combat patterns. What I find surprising in this adventure RPG was the pace that it went. \n\nThis wasn't by any means a long game. The majority of my time was spent backtracking to find stuff or remember to do one of the quests when I ran into a road block. Clues were scattered around areas that alluded to other locations which I'd ultimately neglect to explore, which made things tedious. I noticed a few things that could have improved my experience.\n\nOne of the things I would have liked was a notebook that maybe jotted semi useful information that you found on your journey so that maybe I could remember where the honey was located without having to go back to the source to get information on particular items needed to progress. Another thing that I found a little mundane about it was the actual traveling between islands. You don't have the freedom of navigating yourself rather you select a route that your boat moves along. I did appreciate the obstacles in the water that I had to be vigilant and shoot with my cannon but after the 10th time it was repetitive to the point of boring because there was so much back and forth travel happening. It would have also been nice if your character was able to interact with people he met on the sea. With so many islands you really wonder why the sea was so barren. \n\nDespite the critical observations I did enjoy this game the time I did spend playing it. the visuals were beautiful the controls tight and the music was well done. The atmosphere and pace of the gameplay was all one note with the exception nearing the final boss.

His dad took off to face off with Oceanhorn, the last of the Living Fortresses, great monsters which were left behind by an ancient civilization. Your goal is to go from island to island in search of your dad.\n\nThe core gameplay is very familiar to Zelda fans \u2013 you have a sword and a shield. You wander around stabbing stuff. While the game has 3D graphics, it is fundamentally 2D \u2013 indeed, it is a major gameplay mechanic that you can fall down one \u201cfloor\u201d worth of blocks, and can only go up via stairs. This is pretty much how all the dungeons are arranged, and numerous puzzles center around your inability to jump.\n\nThis is not a sophisticated game \u2013 you walk around and slash stuff with your sword. There is no Z-targeting or anything of the sort, but the game does have a sort of auto-aim feature.\n\nOver the course of the game, you acquire items \u2013 bombs (for blowing stuff up), a bow and arrow (for shooting targets to trigger stuff, as well as certain enemies), a fishing rod (because what is Zelda without fishing?), boots (for jumping over one-square gaps)\u2026 really, exactly the most basic items you\u2019d expect in a Zelda game. You also get spells \u2013 a fire spell, a spell that drops stuff on switches, an ice spell to freeze stuff which seemed unnecessary, a cure spell that I only used on the final boss, and a black hole spell that is super overpowered but useless on bosses.\n\nThat said, the game is pretty easy, and the puzzles basic. There\u2019s nothing here that you haven\u2019t seen before many times.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really the problem with the game \u2013 it is nothing new. It is just a kind of mediocre Zelda-ish game that doesn\u2019t do anything new, just sort of treads the usual ground. The bosses are nothing impressive, the ordinary enemies are mostly boring and samey (and you find them a lot \u2013 there isn\u2019t a whole bunch of variety, having even less variety than Zelda games), the environments didn\u2019t feel that varied (you\u2019re on a bunch of islands, but few of them feel unique)\u2026 really, there\u2019s just very little here to excite you.\n\nIt isn\u2019t bad, and the voice acting is decent (even if the script is often not great), but there\u2019s just little here to get excited about. You\u2019ve probably played Zelda, and if you haven\u2019t, this isn\u2019t a great introduction to the genre \u2013 games like Darksiders felt like they were much more interesting new interpretations of the Zelda formula than this was. This was same old, same old, and fairly mediocre. There\u2019s nothing great about it, and while it isn\u2019t bad, there\u2019s little to recommend.\n", "timestamp_created": 1460420669, "timestamp_updated": 1460420669, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.404406160116195679", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22365242": {"recommendationid": "22365242", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960448925", "num_games_owned": 1583, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1460736963}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Voy a explorar un poco esta isla.

It's one of those things where there are weird little things that stand out like a sore thumb in an otherwise excellent piece. Oceanhorn is very Zelda-esk, which is what I went in looking for, what with the slowly unlocking new gear to open up new areas around the world. It also has an actual leveling system, which is nice, although it doesn't do a ton, it mainly just upgrades the number of bombs or arrows you can carry and whatnot. The challenge system is nice and provides an easy way to track achievements in a way that gives in game experience points. The story is kind of meh, but they don't shove it down your throat and generally just let you go explore. There are quite a few instances where they don't tell you about something and you're supposed to kind of just figure it out. That is to be expected from this kind of game, but there were several times where I had to utilize something in a way I wasn't even aware was possible and that was a bit frustrating since it wasn't clear. My main gripe with this game is the movement mechanics. I understand what they are going for, but it feels almost moronic to get stopped by 1ft high rocks CONSTANTLY and not being able to fall down more than one ledge space at a time. I feel like if they had given it more physical depth, it would have been a more immersive experience since it really pulls you out of the game when you have to navigate in ridiculous fashions that no normal human being would ever have to deal with. You also have to unlock the ability to jump via an item, which is stupid, and it only lets you jump horizonally across one space and not vertically at all. The movement structure also causes some confusion about progression since the rules get bent a bit here and there. Like you can normally only drop down 1 tier, but in certain spots to progress you have to drop down 2 or 3 and you weren't thinking you could even do that. The boss system is solid and very refreshing. It is something that genuinely awards paying attention and trial and error. The boss battles themeslves are actually extremely easy, but only if you know what you're doing. For instance, I would go into a boss battle and die over and over again until I learned something new and then I could go in and kill it without almost any problems at all. The fishing system in this game seems forced and pointless. You don't gain anything by doing it and it is complete random luck and there are far too many achievements revolving around fishing. My goal was to 100% this game and I got to the last few achievements and was just like NOPE. I see no enjoyment in running all round the world looking for fish and hoping they are the right kind. I was also a bit bummed that the sailing in this game is on rails and not open world. It doesn't feel bad or anything, but I didn't expect it to lock you on your path. Overall an enjoyable game though that satisfies the Zelda itch for a good price.

So I won't be making the kind of comparisons that would be expected here, because I can't.\n\nAnd maybe precisely because this kind of gameplay is still somewhat fresh to me did I enjoy the game so thoroughly. The gameplay is very solid, the mix of exploration, puzzles and action just right. The world feels somehow alive and vibrant despite its absurdities of scale. The fairytale visuals are appropriate here (and are of quite high quality). The music is top notch, especially the epic choral pieces. \n\nI was never stuck for very long. Difficulty is not adjustable, but it is kinda on the easy side. The same could be said of the collectibles, they're suprisingly manageable, not too hard. All that is great in my book. There was the whole Botfish episode, which threatened to produce a negative review [i]all by itself[/i] but it quickly resolved itself once I had 9 hearts so I will speak of it no more. There are some bugs that can cause you to get stuck in an impossible location and force to suicide/reload the game but they're rare.\n\nIf you're looking to go on a grand and fantastical adventure flavoured (in a good way!) with childish wonderment, this would be a pretty good choice.", "timestamp_created": 1459859711, "timestamp_updated": 1459859780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22243688": {"recommendationid": "22243688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090054708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1459812288}, "language": "english", "review": "Unless you're incredibly bored & brain dead just looking for a time waster do not buy this game. If you can get it on a massive sale, or for free, and have some time to kill... here's 63 trivial achievementsl. Also just a note going in, you never get to sail the boat yourself D: It's like a loading mini-game that's just spam the mouse to shoot things in your way.\n\nFirstly, enemies. There are barely any bosses and a severe lack of mini-bosses of any sort, leaving you to spam click your sword through low level enemies in every dungeon without any real threat to your annoyance. The Graveyard, Riptide, Old Fortress... none have a boss of any sort. Just the same ol' boring low level enemies. Not only that but pretty much every boss could just be taken down by a few bomb throws from across the arena. Very boring.\n\nSecondly, level design. The trailers don't lie: the levels are small and cramped. But alright, you can still do great things with that limitation. Sadly Oceanhorn doesn't. The puzzles can barely be called that, and yes this is coming from a puzzle lover who's crack is a challenge that could take hours to figure out, but holy applesauce this game... There is more than a couple instances where the 'puzzle' is literally a box right next to the switch. The 'increased' difficulty for puzzles in this game just seems to be: add more boxes and switches sitting next to each other.\n\nThis game feels like it was made for young children with its 'difficulty'. The only reason I have so much time on this is because it was an easy grab for achievements and it felt like it would be an embarrassment to not have them all with how trivial it is. The amount of time is because of how slow it is to move around, fishing, & the time it takes to skulk about an area murdering all of one type of enemy.\n\nThirdly, the story. While the main points are fine and dandy... there's a huge problem with everything else that gets one emerged in the game. There are no interesting or fun interactions with any NPC and despite them never doing anything, learning anything about you, knowing anything about what's happening, the game forces an advancement in their generic uninteresting NPC comments as if they are all omniscient. There are promises of a fun side note/reaction to something you've done, like the \u201cDon't break the pots\u201d sign or the \u201cYou will never reach Master Level\u201d sign sitting right next to the 'Master Adventurer' but just... nothing. It's all glossed over.\n\nAnother example is Neeto. No introduction convo, she doesn't acknowledge you're different than the regular townsfolk, yet when you meet her for the 2nd time suddenly she's waiting on the docks for you to arrive and help her cause you're the only one she can count on. Really..? It goes even further with the fireworks scene with her acting like she's the protagonists girl friend, asking to be taken to see the world, and then the kid gives her the super special thing he just got! Wat... Where did that all come from? Where did any of these relations come from? We never get to see, participate, or develop any of it. We only get the after notes, which leaves a player rather uninvested in everything.\n\nI didn't have a very high bar going into this game but I had hope it could be a shadow of a Zelda game as it likes to so proudly tell everyone. But this... this was a fanfic AU of a couple Zelda mashups (majorly Windwaker if one couldn't tell from the videos) where they had to make a few minor character design changes so they wouldn't get dinged by the trademark. Featuring the Zora, the Evolved Bird-Zora, the Hylians, Octoroks, Moblins, Buzzblobs, Keese, Peahat Larva, the Master Sword & Mirror Shield, the 3 Emblems (Green, Blue, Red), Islands as remnants of an ancient civilization...

I really enjoyed it a lot. It's not a perfect game, and near the end it was getting grindy, but overall I had a good experience. The game has some simple puzzles, and lots of backtracking old areas with new skills. If you enjoy old school Zelda type 2D RPGs you will probably enjoy this 3D rendition. It looks good, and the audio is very remniscent of those old games. This game is basically retro without leaning on the retro crutch. \n\nCon: If there is any con, the Oceanhorn battle itself is a straight up glitch fest and getting 100% (done), left you at the mercy of chance in the kind of dumb fishing mini game. I was 98% for quite a while and absolutely infuriated that no amount of skill would prevail I had to rely on luck alone. Oh and the story, it's barely worth mentioning. I think the game could've played better without one, and the terrible voice acting it brought with it. I suppose you needed some motivation to press on, but I didn't care for it. A child could've penned this. In fact if they reveal that one of the developers children wrote it, I wouldn't be surprised. \n\nOverall: worth a play if Zelda is your jam.

Or rather, they\u2019re in love with the monoliths of gaming history, the games that for many form a mesh of absolutes and ideals which other games continually seek to emulate. Sometimes this leads to the betterment of an idea, a concept first imitated and then refined so that it then becomes synonymous with this new game that did it better. Other times though the ways games so constantly seek to recreate their predecessors never extends beyond rudimentary or reductive replication, seeking success by playing to familiarity and nostalgia. This is where we are met with Oceanhorn: Monster of the Uncharted Seas, a would be Zelda clone that is the gaming equivalent to that off-brand action figure your grandmother mistakenly bought you for Christmas, on the surface indistinguishable from the original but whose inadequacy becomes immediately known once the disingenuous packaging is breached.\n\nOceanhorn mirrors not only Zelda\u2019s style of play, but its aesthetic and structure. Its art design is inarguably seeking to reflect that of Zelda\u2019s more cartoony iterations, specifically the nautically inclined Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass. Oceanhorn\u2019s world is bright and colorful, segmented into different islands you access by sailing on those supposedly uncharted seas, with a bouncy demeanor that is unable to distract from the overwhelming feeling of artificiality present in every aspect of Oceanhorn\u2019s design. This isn\u2019t wholly due to Oceanhorn\u2019s status as a poor man\u2019s Zelda, but the result of a world that feels entirely synthetic. The whimsical charm and history always so paramount to Zelda\u2019s world design is entirely absent, replaced with a cold and alienating feeling of obligation. Oceanhorn\u2019s world exists entirely for the sake of housing its plot, a plot which expands and shrinks in whichever way it finds convenient, pouring out backstory when it needs to feel grandiose and then receding into the background when it fails to back up its attempts at magnificence with anything more than words.\n\nWhere Zelda constructs its narrative to intersect and enhance its mechanics, Oceanhorn uses it as a crux. Things happen because the game needs you to move to the next dungeon. Plot is only ever employed for the sake of giving context to your actions, but the writing is so stale and inconsistent that it causes the game as a whole to feel even more so the product of recognizable but unofficial parts. Details are always given in terms meant to imply a storied history to this land, with caves and lost princesses being hidden away for thousands of years, and yet within minutes of arriving to these areas you are able to overcome whatever obstacle was standing in the way of the local inhabitants, often by such trivial means as to call into question whether anyone has actually cared even a little about the fate of their world until you arrived. There is an astounding level of pointlessness to Oceanhorn\u2019s plot given how much time it dedicates to selling you on it, to the point I feel it would be better off simply tearing it all out and letting the mechanics speak for themselves.\n\nIt seems fair to say Oceanhorn\u2019s main draw isn\u2019t its plot but its mechanical similarity to Zelda, so its true test is in how well it manages to reconstruct a formula that has changed little over the years and yet remains incredibly well regarded and popular. In this Oceanhorn is\u2026fine. It manages to mirror many of Zelda\u2019s most recognizable aspects, from item based navigation puzzles to dungeon layouts and boss designs, but it never loses that feeling of being a cheap imitation. One of Zelda\u2019s biggest strengths is in the multilayered design of its world and dungeons, where puzzles build upon themselves as your means of solving them becomes larger, each knew item bringing with it a host of immediate and secondary applications.\n\nOceanhorn in comparison is much less intricate in its design, presenting you with new items when it sees fit but never giving you much to do with them. There are puzzles here they are more like speedbumps than roadblocks, tending to hold you up for a moment but ultimately tedious to overcome and often of the same block-pushing variety. The lack of intelligent level and puzzle designs causes Oceanhorn to feel intensely segmented and linear, each dungeon serving to send you on the next but having little for you to actually do while you\u2019re there. Exploration is nearly entirely absent both within levels and in the overworld, the former due to the narrow design of each island, and the later as the boat you use to travel between islands is entirely on rails.\n\nEven as one of the few who enjoyed Wind Waker\u2019s sailing, traveling between islands in Oceanhorn is excruciatingly obnoxious. There is so little to do in these segments that their inclusion is as worthless as the plot attempting to justify it. The ocean itself is tepid and lifeless and the only thing populating it an abundance of trash you need to clear away with your cannon, a task no doubt meant to keep you occupied until you arrive at your destination but only serving to make sailing even more annoying as you are then required to pay attention the whole time you are cruising along lest you bump into a mine someone carelessly left floating around. The monotony of sailing caused me to lose any interest I might have had to return to previous island to pick up a collectible I missed or finish up some of the sidequest objectives I hadn\u2019t gotten around to, though these additions contribute so little to the game that the only real reason to pursue them is for the sake of completion.\n\nOceanhorn\u2019s only truly alluring aspect is its novelty as the closest PC and mobile players can get to a native Zelda game. With so little like it on these platforms it is tempting to accept and justify Oceanhorn\u2019s middling to bad attempts to replicate Nintendo\u2019s iconic franchise, solely because it\u2019s all we are likely to ever get. But for as hard as it might try, there is no mistaking Oceanhorn as anything but a knock-off, and not a good one at that. Its design is uninspired and meandering, a chore to navigate and a bore to solve. Even excluding comparisons to Zelda proper, Oceanhorn isn\u2019t fun to play, and if it wasn\u2019t for bearing such a striking resemblance to that series I doubt anyone would have paid it much attention in the first place.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2016/03/23/oceanhorn-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1458759152, "timestamp_updated": 1458759152, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573782563209533691", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22000253": {"recommendationid": "22000253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111598369", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 809, "last_played": 1457972001}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aunque desde fuera pueda echar para atr\u00e1s si te quedas solo con el mas que evidente parecido con Zelda, si le das una oportunidad no te arrepentir\u00e1s ya que es un juego con un buen dise\u00f1o de niveles, unos gr\u00e1ficos bastante bonitos y con una duraci\u00f3n adecuada para que en ning\u00fan momento pueda llegar a ser tedioso.\n\nResumiendo, si eres fan de los juegos de aventuras y no te molesta la excesiva inspiraci\u00f3n en la saga madre, ve a por el sin dudarlo.", "timestamp_created": 1458731359, "timestamp_updated": 1458731359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21971206": {"recommendationid": "21971206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048038280", "num_games_owned": 1133, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1352, "last_played": 1458592760}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Primero: NO recomiendo este juego a su precio completo.

What we get instead is a stroll through several islands, hunt for collectibles and a story that barely does anything.\n\nLet's start with the last on that list - while not overly complicated, and often obvious with its revelations/suggestions, the story of the game seems like an excuse thrown together without much thinking. The motivations and some connections are very sketchy, to the point where they don't get any explanation at all. Add to the fact that there is no real closure, the start and the end of the story feel almost random and... you have something that lives in the background, but that's about it. The big discrepancies in the performance of voice actors don't help - some of them sound like they just couldn't care for a single moment.\nUnless we count shoe-horned insinuations of romantic interest and the like, which were as unnecessary and clunkily handed as possible.\n\nCollectible hunt is actually fun, if you are after completing your games 100%, then this is a thing for you. There is plenty of exploring, bombing, jumping and otherwise figuring out how to get to that elusive last blood gem or chest. Coupled with the fact that the labyrinthine, complicated structure of the islands makes it interesting to poke your nose in every corner - it works well. \nWhich can't be exactly said about the puzzles, as they are divided into two categories, as far as I am concerned - relatively easy ones and those you will frown at because they are timed. Why would the latter be a problem? Because of how some of the control scheme works. The biggest offender here are Trencher Boots. For reasons I cannot fathom, aside from their primary function of jumping gaps (Zelda's ladder basically) they also have a roll function, which doubles the role of the dash the character has from the very beginning. Now, this roll can cause you to fall down from low-height platforms when you would rather jump from one to another, because both of these functions are tied to one button and which goes off is dependant on your position. And when you have a timed puzzle, you want to cut corners.\nThere are several more control gripes like that - throwing objects can be finicky, sword combat doesn't feel all too nice either. Bow has the same issues as throwing object which means... you will be okay, but sometimes it takes a wild guess whether you can hit something at all, and times when you will waste three arrows because you weren't just precise enough with turning your character around will happen.\n\nAll the issues and positives combined, Oceanhorn is... okay. You will probably enjoy yourself, spend 10-20 hours in it, then put back onto the virtual shelf. And forget about it, because what this game lacks the most, is anything that would make it leave a mark on your memories.\nI would gladly give this game a neutral review if I could, but as it stands, a thumbs down is in order.

For most enemies, you only have to hit and parry. There is only two exceptions. One were you need to parry and shoot from afar and one were you first need to use a spell for destroy some sort of shield. Even the bosses aren't challenging at all. In many games, phases are added to boss so you have to get a patern and use it against the boss to defeat it. Here, you don't have to pay attention to the patern, you only have to see if it's following you or not. And the \"phases\" are in fact the exact same patern that repeat faster.\n\n[u]Puzzles are dull[/u]\nHonestly ... I finished the game in ten hours, literally watching tv at the same time. And i didn't focused on the game.\nThe puzzles are so easy. Push this and you succeed. Walk on this and you suceed. Walk on this and walk quickly here and you suceed. That all. I know it's not easy making puzzles. I make some for passing time. But the only thing i ask is some intricacy. You finish a puzzle to pass a room and continue until you find an other room with a puzzle.

The ocean travel is boring (and you do a *lot* of it); it's like Wind Waker without the sense of freedom and exploration, while giving you more random stuff to shoot.

This game pays homage to the Legend of Zelda series, specifically to Majora's Mask, Windwaker, and A Link to the Past. To me this game felt like it was a love letter to the LoZ series, a game that brings the same feeling with it's gameplay and great music, not on par with LoZ's music but something that you can listen to hours on end without getting annoyed. Though my hours on this version of the game says 2.1 hours, as of writing this review, I have already beaten this game on iOS and it was really fun to play on both versions each with their own good parts and bad parts.\n\nThe story for Oceanhorn is fairly straight forward, a big sea monster known as \"Oceanhorn\" has come to your island and your dad goes to fight against it while you sleep. As you awake you're left alone with your mother's pendant, that acts kind of like a guide, and you're off on your journey to fight against Oceanorn on your little boat, just like in Windwaker.\n\nThough this game doesn't hold your hand and guide you through the game telling you which way to go, you're encouraged to explore around the different islands that you discover and sail to. You'll find interesting inhabitants, vast dungeons and enemies with their own unique design, though still looking very similar to their LoZ counterparts.\n\nWith just your sword and shield you'll fight off interesting bosses and solve some puzzles along the way. Now onto the controls, I highly recommend playing this with a controller, you can play with a keyboard just fine it's just gonna take a lil' while to get adjusted. The controls are a little loose but nothing too bad, especially noting that this was an iOS port, and the camera controls are a bit unnecessary since there is no use for it, especially since there is very little movement when you do move it.\n\nThe game itself has you fight off rather easy bosses, where you rarely take any damage, solve fairly simple puzzles and collect four elemental powers. Thought the gameplay doesn't have anything that really jumps out at you the islands make up for it with it's rich design making them immersive and best of all fun to explore. Sailing though is a bit of a let down, clicking on where you want to go without any controls, other than the gun that you fire later on in the game, but at least the amazing soundtrack helps pass the time while you sail from one island to another.\n\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a great and fun game to play, though it can be a bit too easy from time to time it's still something that I would recommend for someone to buy. As of writing this review Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is on available for $16.99CAD, about $13-$14 USD, and if you're planning on buying it I would say to wait until it's on sale for $10-$12CAD, $7-$9 USD.\n7.5/10 Great for a rainy day when you want to lounge around and play a relaxing game.", "timestamp_created": 1458446725, "timestamp_updated": 1479955850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502514302730560303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21936599": {"recommendationid": "21936599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246131368", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1489196902}, "language": "english", "review": "I will actually write a review later, but this is a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1458441878, "timestamp_updated": 1458701512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21930190": {"recommendationid": "21930190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002718103", "num_games_owned": 767, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1458442616}, "language": "english", "review": "Oceanhorn is a blatant Zelda Wind Waker ripoff - and I mean that in the most flattering and best possible way.

El personaje protagonista carece por completo de carisma, as\u00ed como algunos NPCs, nada novedoso. Carece de \u00e9nfasis y dramatismo, las escenas/cutscenes quedan sosas (como cuando matas a un jefe final y se corta la escena o consigues un nuevo objeto y no suena m\u00e1s que un escueto 'fanfare'), aunque quiz\u00e1s estoy mal acostumbrado.\n\nTiene una historia correcta y, aunque tiene ciertos huecos, puede dejarte con ganas de una secuela (precuela ser\u00eda m\u00e1s apropiado e interesante).\n\nEs entretenido, sobretodo eso. Si nos ponemos exquisitos se puede hacer un poco repetitivo, los puzles de las mazmorras son simples y obvios, pero son un buen punto de partida. En general el dise\u00f1o de niveles es muy bueno, con alguna colisi\u00f3n mal tra\u00edda, pero nada que no se vea en los mejores AAA. \n\nLos enemigos, los t\u00edpicos, aunque las batallas contra jefes finales, a pesar de repetitivas y un poco aleatorias (puedes tardar 5 minutos como 20, dependiendo de como le d\u00e9 por comportarse al bicho), tienen cierta originalidad.\n\nSu m\u00fasica no destaca, hace su funci\u00f3n de acompa\u00f1amiento y se adecua a cada situaci\u00f3n. Varias pistas repetidas la dejan en evidencia. Pero repito, cumple.\n\nPara mi lo mejor es su apartado gr\u00e1fico. Modelados acertados y texturas muy bonitas y llamativas, un buen uso de la iluminaci\u00f3n (aunque no siempre, eh). Las ilustraciones son geniales. Parece que olvidaron retocar algunas animaciones del personaje principal, a veces parece un robot.\n\nLo peor es el dise\u00f1o del juego. Concretando, no siempre te dejan claro qu\u00e9 tienes que hacer, d\u00f3nde o c\u00f3mo, por lo que, si no hechas mano de una gu\u00eda, te pasas medio juego de una isla a otra. No suelo usar gu\u00edas, pero llega un momento que se hace desesperante y cuando lo ves dices: \"\u00bf\u00a1En serio!? \u00bfC\u00f3mo pretenden que descubra eso?\". Una recomendaci\u00f3n: Cuando tengas dudas, pon bombas por doquier, aunque parezca que no (una grieta o algo, no es mucho pedir). Lo gracioso es que hay partes super l\u00f3gicas en las que s\u00ed pistas.\n\nHablando de bombras; Los items. No se arriesgan y van a los b\u00e1sicos. Tiene tambi\u00e9n hechizos, que bien podr\u00edan haber sido otros items (p.e. Hechizo de fuego = Cetro de fuego). Ah\u00ed s\u00ed, un toque de originalidad (aunque llegados a este punto ya no hac\u00eda falta). Y es aqu\u00ed cuando te das cuenta de que el juego sali\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n para dispositivos m\u00f3viles y esa dualidad nunca ayuda. La pesca es insufrible, pero en su defensa dir\u00e9 que me parece insufrible en todos los juegos (e intuyo que tambi\u00e9n en la vida real).\n\nLogros correctos, ninguno imposible. Adem\u00e1s, te dan experiencia.\n\n\n[i]Lo recomiendo, sencillo, si te gusta mucho mucho la saga Zelda. Sinceramente, es por lo \u00fanico que jugar\u00e1s.\n\nNo lo recomiendo, claro, si no te gustan los Action RPG. Es un juego con potencial, pero intrascendente. El enfoque es err\u00f3neo, casi imposible olvidar que no est\u00e1s m\u00e1s que en un (intencionado o no) homenaje a The Legend of Zelda.

However, it's a much shorter and smaller game. The gameplay and graphics are pretty decent, but the story, characters, and puzzles are relatively lackluster. Some of my favorite things about windwaker were the large, mostly open world to explore, the quirky characters and their accompanying side-quests, and the variety of items to use. However, those aspects were not really present in this game.\n\nThe sailing in this game is very boring to me. You're on a track to whichever island you choose as your destination and then there are a few obstacles you get to shoot in the 30 seconds or less it takes you to get to another island. No sunken treasures, outposts, or islands to discover(you just hear about them from other people and then go from point A to point B). The characters are not terribly memorable at all, although I did enjoy the designs of the rito and zora clones (owlbros and gillfolk). The only real items you get are bombs, arrows, and the ability to jump. There is also magic, but I think it could've been used more for the puzzles and bosses. [spoiler]You get this super cool black hole spell if you get a certain number of bloodstones and it's not effective against bosses and isn't nearly as cool as the name implies. [/spoiler] The story is about as cliche as it gets, but this time you're helping your dad instead of a princess. \n\nThat said, the quality is really nice for an indie game. The music is solid, but falls short of the glory of zelda soundtracks. The art is pretty and while the environments are blocky like in phantom hourglass, they're still made to look relatively natural. The combat works nicely and there are a fair number of enemies that you can't mindlessly hack and slash without first getting behind them or breaking their guard somehow. I also liked the fishing minigame. \n\nI'd recommend this for people who really like Zelda games, but expect a game about a third (or less) as long and half as good. \n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1458070607, "timestamp_updated": 1458070898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472125023603439331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21856707": {"recommendationid": "21856707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010056399", "num_games_owned": 722, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1457985423}, "language": "english", "review": "The short of it is that if you greatly enjoyed The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker(or games like it), and you have a ton of free time on your hands, than you should give this game a chance. Otherwise, if you didn't, don't have that much time, or have access to Wind Waker, than you are better off skipping this game (and just playing Wind Waker instead).\n\nThe long of it is that this game is a mediocre adventure game with some charming elements to it, but lacks polish. Which is very disappointing since it is easy to see how this game could have been much better, had they just done a little bit more.  The lack of polish in this game is shown in nearly every part of it, but the two that I think best display it are these. \n\nFirst, the game has a problem with visual cues, or to be more exact, it sometimes doesn't display any, or displays the wrong ones.  This happens at several places throughout the game, for example, sometimes there are floor tiles in a object moving puzzle section that will use the same texture as the border tiles, even though, you can slide things onto them. Not only is this confusing, but it is also very frustrating, since the solution ends up being very simple.  This visual inconsistence is bizarre, since at times it seems like it was done intentional. Like they wonder why no one else does this kind of thing (using the same texture for both a valid and invalid movement space) before, and they figure that they would.  Also, there a part in the game where the player run across a spiked gate. Not only does this looks goofy, but it doesn't make sense, since throughout the game spikes are used as a hazard.  Except in this one case, where it is the intended path.  These visual cue issues don't break the game, but they do happen enough to be a problem, which is disappointing, since they seem like they would be easy to fix.\n\nSecond, most of the game's puzzles, aren't challenging and feel meaningless, since they are just one step. For example, some time you'll run into a barred gateway, and to get past this gateway, all you have to do is use a switch. And most of the time the switch itself is within 20 feet of the gateway with nothing blocking you from using it. Other times you'll run into a pathway that splits into 2. Down one path is a locked door, and down the other is the key for that locked door. It is this simplistic design that makes most of the game's content feel shallow. There are no a-ha moments, no sense of achievement, and really nothing remarkable about running into a puzzle and then spending 5 seconds to get through it. In the end it feels like they have all the pieces that are used to make a puzzle, but missed the point of why gamers like to solve them. \n\nOverall Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a mediocre adventure game. It can be fun at times, but it usually isn't. The game has a decent foundation, but it execution of those ideas is lacking.

They copy mechanics and implement them in on of the worst ways I have ever seen.\n\nMy favorit example would be the bombs, that can be used in combat or to destroy walls. Zelda introduces bombs in a logical way and shows the player different ways of using them. Oceanhorn on the other hand gifs you said bombs and explains nothing. Of course if you know Zelda you will also know that you can destroy walls, they're clearly damaged and indicate that an explosion would destroy them. In Oceanhorn there is never a clear indication and it's more guessing than knowing. Rarly will you see a small part of an staircase or similiar to guide you the way.\n\nI could make these examples for every design choice in Oceanhorn from the painfully fishing to the horrible level structure.\n\nThe only good things about Oceanhorn are the some what decent soundtrack and the visuals.

This will be the best non-third-person Zelda game you've played for a long time, but don't let that comparison fool you as this game has so many good, well-followed-through ideas that you'll be left feeling Nintendo needs to catch up.\n\nIt's got everything you'd expect from the years of Zelda variations we've had: elemental relics, fish and bird people, arrows and bombs, heart pieces, and a silent protagonist. But it's also got a lot you woulds: XP and levelling up, fishing, built-in non-grinding acheivements that award XP, far more subtle secrets than Zelda's ever had, and persistent rooms that don't reset when you leave. This isn't some cheap indie cash-in. This was made with love, for the sole purpose of being a [i]good[/i] game.\n\n[b][Update][/b]\nThe further you get into the game, the more you see that this really is a shameless Zelda clone, which is very sad. It had so much potential to be special, but beyond simply a tribute game, they've stuck to the same old formula to the same detriment as Nintendo. The primary-coloured tunic, the carbon-copy Zora fish-people who are frozen and you save their princess, the legendary sword that looks identical to the Master Sword with a palette-swap, the three elemental gods whose elemental symbols you collect to gain their favour, refurring to Cuckoos by name (Zelda's name for chickens), and I mentioned it before but the silent protagonist is entirely unnessisary - characters converse with you like you're talking back, and this is a game where there is spoken, english dialogue, quite unlike Zelda. \n\nUsing an item to jump and casting ranged spells is a welcome change from the formula, but it's not the gameplay that's the problem - the fighting, puzzles and level design are all really fun. No, it's the strict adherance to creating an off-brand Zelda that really lets this game down. If you've never played a Zelda, then fantastic, but I imagine a lot of the people who bought this game were drawn to the aesthtic and familiar mechanics. This game could have been so much more and stood out on its own merits- the foundation is there -but its reverence to its inspiration is its downfall, highlighting all the stolen ideas and overshadowing the innovations.\n\nIf there's ever a sequel, and I would like there to be, I do hope they take a seperate path and turn this story platform into something unique.", "timestamp_created": 1457808990, "timestamp_updated": 1458151734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21794382": {"recommendationid": "21794382", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984723321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 606, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1480643008}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego aunque algo raro... la verdad que cuando lo vi pense \"anda mira una copia de zelda XD\" pero es entretenido la verdad aunque algo raro por los enemigos,mapas y la trama.\n\nGraficos: Tiene buenos graficos la verdad aunque no son para tirar cohetes tampoco es que sean malos.\n\nSonido: Estan en ingles las voces pero... pesimo doblaje en ingles ya que ponen al protagonista una voz de persona dulta de 40 a\u00f1os o asi cuando es un crio el protagonista.\n\nJugabilidad: Es entretenido aunque en ocasiones aburre porque te hace de pensarte bien las cosas, pasar 20000 veces por las mismas islas para sacar todos los secretos aunque sea uno solo que te quede... pero bueno no es ta mal ocupa muy poco en el disco duro y aunque tenga poco entorno de juego tienes bastante mas de lo que imaginarias que cabe en ese espacio :D \n\nMi nota es un 7 eso si puesto que le tengo de un bundle que me costo 0,90\u20ac os aconsejo que lo cojais de oferta porque 14,99\u20ac no los vale, no quiero decir con esto que sea una casta\u00f1a (siempre saltara el tonto turno ) es porque si en un bundle lo tienes a menos de 1\u20ac con varios juegos es que puedes conseguirlo a un precio barato no pagando 15 veces mas por el ademas de que es muy monotematico y a la par corto (en su tema) para pagar tanto", "timestamp_created": 1457803371, "timestamp_updated": 1457803371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528985500335693359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21778979": {"recommendationid": "21778979", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996692671", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 872, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 872, "last_played": 1457913546}, "language": "english", "review": "If you okay with a straight up Zelda clone, this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1457747709, "timestamp_updated": 1457747709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21776735": {"recommendationid": "21776735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127726945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1083, "last_played": 1559407892}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing action/adventure rpg!

Colorful, thoughtful, visually appealing.\n-A great game for particular gamers (Legend of Zelda fans, completionists, collectors)\n-Zelda for PC! VERY Wind-waker inspired, which is touching for the nostalgia.\n-A good wealth of game for the price. Many achievements and collectibles.\n-Sailing doesn't suck! A good idea to make it more of a mini-game than a chore.\n\nCons:\n-This is a Legend of Zelda clone that doesn't add or improve upon it's base material. The characters, the story, the puzzles, are all generally unappealling and forgettable. \n\nGames in notable concepts and mechanisms have been copied in the past with the aim of doing something different or better. Oceanhorn is not that game - it is unashamedly a Zelda clone. This point wouldn't be so bad if it Oceanhorn didn't go in the opposite direction at times and do things WORSE than Zelda - something to be examplified in further cons.\n\n-Puzzles are not challenging, and are often an exercise in tedium.\n\nMost puzzles are not difficult for the problem they present and how to solve them, but are often about a game element responding the way the player intends it to. This is further coupled with the next point...\n\n-Oceanhorn is arbitrarily made trying and longer with backtracking.\n\nThe game presents very early several problems that can only be solved after having particular items, which isn't anything new. However, one vital item to solving these problems isn't obtained until the 11th hour of the game, which presents the player with the (reluctantly optional) task of spending hours backtracking through every location for collectibles, treasure, etc. Without this, the game would probably have been about half it's actual length towards full completion, and with that in mind I can easily add that it outstayed it's welcome.\n\n-Bombs OP.\n\nTalking about a Zelda clone and getting down to brass tacks... When 90% of puzzles and encounters are solved with \"bomb everything\", it is a not a compliment to the other mechanisms present in the game. For puzzles, it feels like lazy game design, presenting the player repeatedly with, \"Which wall do I blow up?\"\nFor combat, this is largely a three-fold problem. \n1) All other combat abilities afforded to the player are slower and less effective than bombs. Spells are slower, sword-play is dull and risky, bow and arrows are slower and weaker. \n2) Bombs are plentiful! Often times, due to how the mechanisms work, you are rewarded a bomb for killing something with a bomb. You hold many and everyone and their mother has them too, so go nuts! Why not? \n3) It takes the guess-work out of encounters. Bombs work on everything from puzzles, to minions, to bosses, and after a while of slinging a sword and learning dodging patterns of enemies, it becomes increadibly simpler to chuck a bomb at whatever it is and win. There were two notable boss encounters where there were present some puzzle-like attribute in order to thwart the target, all of which was completely ignored because boss was vulnerable to bombs.\n\nConclusion:\nSadly doesn't live up to it's source material, despite so much effort going into the game to make it what it is.

I can understand why, but in my opinion, it evokes far fonder memories of an old beauty called Landstalker. The platforming style used in Oceanhorn mixed with it\u2019s gorgeous graphics and expansive world make it a pleasure to play. Find our more in our Oceanhorn Monster of Uncharted Seas Review!\n\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas\u2019 storyline is fairly basic. Boy\u2019s father sets out to slay a twisted beast, boy heads out to find father, boy learns he needs to collects emblems of Earth, Ocean and Sol to help defeat said beasty, boy makes friends along the way, finds beefed up equipment to help him with his journey etc.\n\nHowever, I feel that the true beauty of Oceanhorn isn\u2019t the story. The storyline plays second fiddle to the satisfying exploration and combat system. The most enjoyment when playing Oceanhorn is from the many different islands you\u2019ll visit and landscapes you\u2019ll explore.\n\nEnvironmentally speaking, each island is beautifully portrayed. One such island is covered in abysmal fog and rain, whereas another depicts an incredible rocky landscape. The islands are all unique and each hold their own secrets for you to uncover.\n\nSome players notice when playing Oceanhorn that the whole thing really is quite reminiscent of Zelda games. The enemies are similar; certain characters seem to have walked straight in from another franchise; and the sailing mini-events that take place whilst traversing the ocean waters will have you thinking you\u2019ve accidentally launched another game.\n\nHowever, I implore you to ignore the feelings that you\u2019ve played this before. Overlook the fact that some concepts seem borrowed, and think more along the lines that Oceanhorn is a culmination of different concepts brought together into one vast gaming experience.\n\nOceanhorn easily holds strong in today\u2019s gaming world and delivers a fulfilling experience from both it\u2019s gameplay and design.\n\n[h1]Controllation (yes it\u2019s a word)[/h1]\n\nWhen playing the Steam version of Oceanhorn, the main character is controlled via the \u2018WASD\u2019 keys, whilst aiming and attacking is controlled by your mouse and mouse buttons.\n\nVarious equipment can be acquired throughout your journey that, not only plays an integral part in combat, but also helps in gaining access to areas of the game that would otherwise remain inaccessible. Such items come in the form of bombs that can be used to blow away boxes or rubble; and a bow and arrow that can be fired at strategically placed targets which act as buttons to open doors or move pillars out of your way.\n\nThere\u2019s also a few spells to procure along the way, such as fire to melt ice, or a force spell which summons objects to the area you\u2019ve aimed your cursor. There\u2019s even a secret spell to unlock by obtaining a certain amount of items known as bloodstones. If you\u2019re lucky to chance across one, it can be acquired by hacking away at it with your sword until it gets added to your inventory.\n\nBox puzzles await your brain and act as a nice little break between taking on constantly respawning enemies. When completed, these box puzzles will reveal pathways to destinations unexplored or drop treasure chests that contain a nice little bonus of gold or XP.\n\nGold doesn\u2019t seem to play much of a role in Oceanhorn but it\u2019s still handy to accumulate. Merchants provide the service of stocking up your extra items, I.e. bombs, arrows etc. and they can also sell you extra hearts to increase your maximum health.\n\nLevelling up is great fun because each level you reach will unlock a little extra bonus for the game. Some of these bonuses are gaining a gun to shoot monsters or obstacles when sailing around the world, or decreasing the amount of stamina used when blocking attacks.\n\nAnother thing I quite like about levelling up is the title rewarded with each level. For example at level ten, you\u2019ll be given the title of \u201cVoyager\u201d and eventually you\u2019ll work your way up to \u201cLegend\u201d.\n\nBut one of the most fun additions to journeying through your quest is fishing! Yes!! Everyone loves fishing in a game!\n\nBasically at a certain point in the game you are awarded a fishing rod. Take this good ole fishing rod down to a body of water and commence your new adventure!\n\nYou\u2019ll catch different kinds of fish and you\u2019ll also be catching fish of differing lengths. The bigger the better.\n\nCatch all species of fish and I wonder what happens\u2026?\n\n[h1]Combatitation (really? you don\u2019t know this word?)[/h1]\n\nThe combat in Oceanhorn is simplistic in nature and does away with all the bells and whistles seen in some hack\u2019n\u2019slash games. Left click swings your sword; right click utilises whichever extra weapon/item you\u2019ve got equipped; the \u2018f\u2019 key casts whichever spell you\u2019ve equipped; left-shift brings up your shield to act as defence against attacks; and space-bar toggles sprint, picks up and throws an item or acts as the action key.\n\nIf you\u2019re expecting a massive challenge from Oceanhorn, you might be a little disappointed. Monsters found throughout Oceanhorn aren\u2019t that difficult. Some of them will do a lot of damage when they hit you, but you can always block those attacks with your shield. Most enemies will wait a few seconds before commencing their first attack which usually buys enough time to defeat them quickly.\n\nSome enemies are a bit more dastardly and will manage to get a few hits in before you kill them. This will result in a heart or two of your health being taken away. Health can always be replenished from hearts that drop from monsters, or are found when destroying an object like a vase or cutting down grass. If you do end up dying, you\u2019ll respawn at a previous checkpoint.\n\nThankfully, bosses happen to be quite engaging and fun! Each boss will tend to follow certain patterns or require you to perform a specific action before being allowed to damage them. However, bosses found earlier on in the game can be quite easy and you\u2019ll find yourself being able to handle them with little difficulty. When you get further on in the game, the bosses become more challenging and you\u2019ll be relying on your reflexes, as well as your gear, to dispatch them successfully.\n\n[h1]Aesthetic Charm[/h1]\n\nGraphically, Oceanhorn shines brightly. The environments and colours found throughout are gorgeously detailed and display beautifully on a sharp screen, be it computer or iPad.\n\nEnemy design is well thought out and you can see that a lot of love has gone into their creation. Boss design is brilliant and each one brings it\u2019s own flare to match the area you\u2019re traversing perfectly.\n\nThe music is nice to listen to but certain areas might have you reaching for the mute button. In particular the Hermit\u2019s Island. Sound effects aren\u2019t too bad but some sounds, such as when your character runs out of stamina and starts puffing, come across as a bit forced and sound like it could have been done better.\n\nVoice acting isn\u2019t that great. The actors sound wooden and devoid of emotion. That\u2019s why I preferred to play with subtitles on so I could still follow the story without having to listen to the dull voices.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\n\nIn summary, Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is a splendid release from both FDG Mobile Games GbR (iOS version) and Cornfox & Bros. (Steam version). The whole game is a joy to play and would be best enjoyed by younger gamers as an introduction to RPGs.\n\nThe game\u2019s main story takes around ten to fifteen hours to complete, but if you want to fully explore everything and get one-hundred percent complete, you\u2019ll probably find yourself investing quite a few more hours.\n\nBeautifully designed and superbly created, you\u2019ll find yourself wanting to jump back into the world of Oceanhorn quite often.

Even though it's an iOS port, I didn't know that when I purchased the game and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's compared to Windwaker, but I never played that one, so I can't comment on that.\n\nPros: Works well for mouse, keyboard, or game pad. Decent graphics; nothing flashy, but about on par with a good GameCube game. Plenty of side content and extras to hunt for. Good challenge; not too difficult, not too easy. It's a bit on the easy side, but not disappointingly so. Some of the puzzles and encounters make you think. I encountered no glitches and was able to unlock all the achievements without issue. The different areas and dungeons are fairly diverse. Leveling up unlock new perks in all aspects of the game which is fun; only one level up seems to break the difficulty balance.\n\nCons: The sailing has no value in the game; it's little more than a mini game while you're loading the next island.

Set in a world following a huge magical war, you set off in search of your father, who in turn is hunting a massive sea monster known as Oceanhorn. Follow in his footsteps as you gather some strange relics in order to finally have the power to confront the beast and perhaps find your father.\n\nThe story is fairly lighthearted and quirky, with a very Zelda-like feel. Characters are all sketched out very quickly and loosely, and you're expected to really like people quickly. I didn't always find this to always be the case, but warmed to what the story was aiming for pretty quickly. I'm about 2/3rds of the way through the game at time of speaking (as far as I can tell), and am looking forward to diving even further in to what this game has to offer.\n\nPros:\n- Lighthearted, fun story, with a rich backstory and lore\n- Controls are really solid for PC, especially with it being a mobile port (don't let that scare you off, the game looks and plays like a PC native game, and the price is more than fair)\n- There's plenty of content to explore, lots of fun secrets, and cute puzzles\n- Great unlocks as you progress, opening more of the game to you and rewarding players who note down places of interest earlier in the game.\n- Interesting monsters to fight, with tactics to learn as you move forward.\n- Some really fun boss fights!\n- Graphics are charming\n\nCons:\n- Your character's attacks are sometimes a bit unresponsive about specific directions\n- The storytelling can be a bit weak sometimes\n- Puzzles are occasionally quite unclear, and solutions are sometimes just finding a hidden button under some breakables\n- Sailing is often pretty dull, which is a shame\n\nOverall, this game is a solid 7.5/10 so far, and is well worth picking up and playing.

No s\u00e9 si es un gui\u00f1o a la saga o una copia descarada que imita un modelo que funcion\u00f3 bastante bien.\n\nEl escenario es variado a nivel visual, y se reparte en mazmorras y habitaciones peque\u00f1as, espacios m\u00e1s grandes y abiertos, y un mapa por el cual desplazarnos de un lugar a otro en un viaje autom\u00e1tico en el que no podremos dirigir el barco pero s\u00ed disparar a los monstruos u obst\u00e1culos que nos salgan al paso.\nEn tierra hay bastantes desniveles y plataformas escalonadas.

In general I tend to find those two things normally equate to that of total crap. Surprisingly however, Oceanhorn stands out as a shining example of how a solid port should be done.\n\nNo hiding the fact it's a total Wind Waker clone. Pretty much everything in this game draws direct connection from much of the Zelda series. Trying to fill those shoes can be a pretty huge task, which it at least does a pretty good job of emulating. It manages to capture the nice open colorful world in the same fashion as Zelda. The characters, monsters and bosses are fairly creative. Most of what you encounter tries to mimic the art style of Zelda quite closely. Not quite as charming of course, although to be fair it'd be hard to live up to some of the most beloved games of all time completely. \n\nSometimes you can sense a bit of the restraints from this game originally being intended for the ipad. The combat is good, but I feel like it's not quite as fluid or polished as it could have been. Had it not been originally designed around the ipad. For the most part at least it comes off rather well on the PC using a controller. It also allows for the use of mouse an keyboard controls. \n\nUnlike Zelda, Oceanhorn features a leveling system. Gaining a level can result in earning coins an item refills, increasing the number of bombs you can carry, but it also serves to unlock other things such as a cannon item for your sail boat early on. The boat is your main source of transportation for island hopping around the world. Travelling by boat is done on a rail system unlike the free roaming in Wind Waker. I guess to try to make the travel portions a bit less dull, they decided to add in things like explosive mines and enemies along with crates and things you can shoot for experience and coins as you travel along. This portion can become a bit tedious at times. \n\nThe music is nice and the game looks good enough for what it's intended to be. Saving is done either automatically when entering a new area or when activating checkpoints. Not having the option to save manually however can be a little annoying. The game itself is pretty forgiving however. If you find yourself being killed, you're automatically transported back to the location of your last checkpoint save, while retaining any items and exp you collected beforehand. For the most part the difficulty is rather mild.\n\nIn the end for what faults it does have I would still recommend this to any fan of the Zelda series. All in all it's bit like a smaller Wind Waker lite. It does do a pretty good job in filling a nice niche, in which it's hard to find many similiar games on the PC. If you're looking for something to fill that Zelda-esque desire you probably won't regret buying Oceanhorn. Overall I'd rate this game at maybe a close 7 out of 10.

From fish dudes to eagle people. From several types of humans to even machines. Also the occasional demon. There're also ghosts in the postgame dungeon. Like all video games, it starts out peacefully but everything turns to hell and some random kid with a destiny has to save the world. To do that, you hunt an ancient relic from the technologically advanced past named Oceanhorn but there's a twist...which I'll save for those who play the game.\n\nThe main character is the aptly named Main Character (or Hero). At the start of the game, his father writes a note saying how his (the father's) destiny is linked to Oceanhorn, which also means the Hero's destiny is too because that's how video games work). He then goes to attack a giant robotic crab. The Hero then wakes up on a different island inhabited by one guy named Hermit who sends you on your way to avenge your father and save the world. All the while a Black Boat stalks you from just off screen except when plot demands otherwise. \n\nThe game then continues like all action games: you visit scenic locals; a desert, a dense forest, some ruins, a quaint little town, a floating rock, etc. and you upgrade your gear, learn to use magic, and learn just how special you are because your parents are doubly special. Once in a while, you fish or throw plants at the head of their gardener/Hero's love interest because you (as the player) are a sociopath. \n\nThe controls are exceptional for a game that was originally an iOS game \u2013 at least with an X-box controller. The only issue that can, and totally will, happen is how easy it is to fall off a ledge and have to redo entire sections of dungeons again. It's not game breaking but it can be annoying having to back track several screens because you were pushed off a small walkway or you just got to close to pick something up or to avoid another thing. It's great that being able to jump down ledges is a thing \u2013 it allows for a bit of a different type of exploration \u2013 but it's frustrating to no end when you've done it too many times. Other than that, combat is fairly fluid. Arrows and magic go where you send them and there are never too many enemies on screen to make one have to panic. The puzzle aspects don't interfere with combat when they're intermingled (meaning boss battles). \n\nSadly, the plot isn't all there. I'm not saying there are any plotholes but some of it just feels rushed and just didn't feel deep to me. A random girl suddenly being your love interest is the most obvious one. It's not a main plot in the story so it might just be something that bothered me slightly and you might be totally fine with it. The game is all narrative which, is fine, but it's easy to miss things or important information can be easily forgotten. For example, if you don't talk to the correct people or find certain bottles then certain side quests aren't going to be available to you. Nothing story related is missable but you might not get to full health, arrow/bomb capacity, or challenge completion (if you're into that though, you're probably using a guide). The game keeps going after you beat the main boss so even then, you can go back and find what you want to. Nothing is permanently missable. Some of this might just be mobile limitations that unfortunately show in this PC port. I don't do a lot of mobile gaming so I'm not sure what is and what isn't great. \n\nMusic is a very subjective subject but I can say that I found it to be perfect. It fits the mood and helps provide immersion. Nobuo Uematsu wrote a track for the OST so that's all you really need to know. I like to add official sources where one can preview it so here's a link. \n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHFXufiOhqkAstu8CibFvEw/videos]Youtube[/url]\n\nThis is Cornfox & Bros first RPG (and second game after a top-down Carmageddon/Twisted Metal style remake \u2013 [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/108700/]Death Rally[/url]) and these Finnish developers already have my attention. I'm looking forward to anything they might release in the future.

A Disappointing Sea of Content and a Boring Combat System.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Genre: Isometric Adventure RPG.\n[*]Developed and Published by: Cornfox & Bros. \n[*]Platform: iOS, Windows and Mac OSX\n[*]Business Model: Base Game.\n[*][i]Copy Purchased by Myself[/i] \n[/list]\n[i][url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-2u2]Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url][/i]\n\n[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]\nOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is an isometric RPG clearly inspired by the Legend of Zelda series, at least the isometric/Game Boy versions. Everything from the lock-on sword play, the story about a hero gaining three valued artifacts of power to overthrow a growing evil and much of the visual design shows that inspiration in spades. Due to that inspiration, the comparisons to the Zelda series are easy to make. I hate to say this but more often than not, Oceanhorn doesn\u2019t compare well. Whether by limitation of the iOS platform or the inexperience of the developers, a lot of ideas and mechanics were pale imitations of what\u2019s been done before.\n\n[b]Story Thoughts[/b]\nThe story is ok at best. It\u2019s a traditional story of a young boy who goes out to find the three magical Emblems of the Elements and put a stop to an evil entity. At first, we\u2019re introduced to Father, who goes out to fend off a living fortress known as Oceanhorn and what happens to him is ultimately unknown. After gathering Father\u2019s sword & shield as well as preparing yourself for sailing, Hero goes out to gather these circles. He has Father\u2019s journal with him which will narrate a little bit every time you visit an important island. Hero goes to a forest island, a desert island and an island in the sky to collect all three magical sources of power. Along the way, Hero meets two different races that have fallen into ruin due to the evil machinations of Mesmeroth and some of minions. So, through some dungeon crawling, Hero will eventually right those wrongs done and those races will eventually rise from defeat\u2026.in maybe another game. Once the pieces of the puzzle are assembled, with help from Hermit along the way, Hero will go to Father and fight Mesmeroth once and for all. During this quest, a few side characters will come in and out of the story but otherwise, Hero is on his own for this journey. Having only the guidance of Father\u2019s journal and the power of the elements to \u201cguide\u201d him. The emblems are only in the game to push the story along, nothing else.\n\n[b]Combat Thoughts[/b]\nThe combat has the worst problems. Using a sword and shield most of the time, you\u2019ll have a lot of slap fights with bullet-spongy (sword-spongy?) enemies in the game. They will often require a ton of hits to bring down and there are a lot of enemies per level which also happen to respawn rather quickly. It definitely feels like grinding through a level, if the experience system didn\u2019t make that particularly obvious. Bloodstones in particular, while not enemies, seem to require 20 or so sword attacks to collect. Why? I don\u2019t know but I thought that was a waste of time. As far as blocking projectiles/attacks with the shield, this seemed to be hit and miss on which attacks would and wouldn\u2019t be blocked, leading to a constant source of frustration while fighting. As a whole, the system works and you can get through the game. But it\u2019s not going to be a whole lot of fun. Oh and there are spells which are used for some puzzles and can be used for the fights. However, I found they often used far too much mana so I usually only used them for puzzles. This is thanks to the lack of an adaptable inventory system. There\u2019s no bottles you can hang onto to replenish health or mana, everything has to be found in the levels. It makes boss fights a lot less interesting as well. \n\n[b]PC Settings & Port Report[/b]\nIt\u2019s got a pretty OK selection of options. You have four different graphic presets including low to ultra. There\u2019s a bunch of different options that turns various objects including clouds and soft shadows on/off. V-sync and anti-aliasing is included. Fullscreen and borderless windowed are here as well with a reasonable choice of resolutions. FPS can be set to 30 or 60 FPS locked/unlocked. In the pause screen, you can adjust speech, effects and music with individual sliders. You might want to consider lowering the music slider which I\u2019ll explain later on. Keyboard and mouse work ok with Oceanhorn but it feels off. Not that controller is a lot better either. Some of the action keys can be rebound but the implementation limits where they can go. Mouse keys can only be rebound to other mouse keys and the same goes for keyboard ones. Why did we decide this was a good idea? No clue. It\u2019s a big no-no.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nUltimately, the frustrating part about Oceanhorn is how much this game treads the same ground so many others have in this genre. Sure, it\u2019s one of the better iOS to PC ports I\u2019ve seen in a long time. There\u2019s nary a mention about touching the screen or buying microtransactions in the App Store and I respect that. Unfortunately, the game still suffers problems inherent to the mobile platform. It\u2019s a mechanically boring game that\u2019s a chore to get through rather than an experience to be enjoyed. The gameplay is filled with repetitive and somewhat unresponsive gameplay that completely lacks meaningful feedback to hook the player in. The optimization is questionable too. The story, honestly, the story feels like it was missing a chunk of itself. There are two dimensional characters abound and its hard to stir myself into getting interested while I\u2019m playing. \n\nOceanhorn was just a drag to get through, especially towards the end. The entire time, I was constantly reminded of what this game could have been instead of what it was doing. I was constantly disappointed every time a new mechanic was introduced or an area shown. Most of the time, what they had implemented was done on the most basic of levels, giving me nothing to sink my teeth into. Other reviewers constantly talk about how much this is like Legend of Zelda except on an iPad. This, at best, is a passing imitation to that series. I myself cannot recommend Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas. \n\n[h1][url=http://wp.me/p4fZDz-2u2]Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1447539382, "timestamp_updated": 1450758142, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536376595497131348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18899528": {"recommendationid": "18899528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025693063", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1446767790}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, looks good and gives provides a decent amount of fun. Still, I am not so happy with it as other reviewers. This is a Zelda clone, ok, maybe the story is original, and the voices are pretty good too, but there are so many things just exactly like you would find in a Zelda game, chests, heart containers, mirror shield, coins, even a tryforce reference. I'm fine with subtle references, but this is too much, it's not that hard to come up with something different and original. Then there's also the dungeon and puzzles design, which are kind of dull, but it gets better later in the game.\n\nAnother annoying thing is the controls, which relies too much on the physics engine, the player moves around kind of slow and it feels weird when going up stairs, because the weight and gravity makes the character move slower and even it seems like it gets stuck. You get used after a while, but still feels weird.\n\nI understand that this game was made by very few people, but that doesn't justify anything, this game needs more polish.\n\nDespite all that, I liked it and I would recommend it, as I said, the game is fun and the story is not bad.", "timestamp_created": 1446769025, "timestamp_updated": 1446769025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18883715": {"recommendationid": "18883715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021761794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1089, "last_played": 1438065951}, "language": "english", "review": "Oceanhorn immediately caught my attention as an IOS game. I eagerly awaited the Android release because of the rave reviews and many comparisons to Zelda. When it came to Steam, I said \"good enough\" and made the purchase. Mistake.\n\nOn its face, Oceanhorn has a cute art style and interesting Zelda-like premise. Evil monster, father killed, dungeons, items, puzzles, bosses, you get the drift. But from the moment you set foot on your home island the first time, the game clobbers you with a very un-Zelda feel. \n\nTo say this game's controls feel clunky, does not really convey the true badness of how this game plays. Moving your character around is a chore, and dodging enemy attacks is almost impossible. Fortunately, that is not really an issue, because 90% of the enemies are dumber than a bag of hammers and so slow to act that there are no attacks to dodge. The few enemies who are actually a threat to you are easily dealt with using items that are far too powerful to make any part of this game a challenge.\n\nThe boss fights are really the true disappointment. In almost every boss fight, the game switches perspective to lock the camera so that it always faces the boss. This was kind of interesting, but when most of the bosses have no attacks except to charge at you in a way that almost feels like they're bored, it really lets down. I never took a single point of damage from a boss until about 3/4 of the way through a game when a boss pleasantly offered a real challenge. This boss, the lone exception, features battle mechanics that require weakening him and avoiding his counterattacks. Part of the challenge comes from the camera always changing perspective while he's shooting at you, but hey, I'll take it.\n\nThere are more annoying gameplay elements, like the completely-extraneous boat travels scenes between islands that took 3-6 minutes of firing an infinite-ammo gun at every single thing that isn't water. The challenge is so low for this part that I don't understand the point. It is not fun and adds nothing to the game or story.\n\nThe plot for this game is plagiarized from Generic Adventure Game. Literally nothing surprising happens. Ever. \n\nComparing this game to Zelda is like comparing a Ferrari California to a Chevy Cobalt. Yes they are both sports cars, but that hardly puts them in the same category.

Here's the pros and cons from my experiences of the game:\n\nPROS\n- great story, it follows through very well despite the side quests\n- Graphics are A+ from what I can manage on my computer. However...\n- a lot of chances to explore and the way you sail around really does remind me of LoZ: Windwaker. Although...\n- FISHING! I love fishing, and I'm a fan of collecting.\n- Dungeons reward you for exploring everywhere.\n- Boss battles are challenging, yet still easy for casual play.\n\nCONS\n- [b]Graphics:[/b] Despite the game being visually appealing, I was forced to lower the resolution because the game would go haywire if I went to better graphics. The screen would flicker and the game screen would black out like some creepy haunted video. \n- [b]Movement:[/b] The character moves too slow sometimes, making me wish there was more of a dashing chance without it eating up stamina so quickly. It wasn't fun walking around a boss and hoping they wouldn't hit you and kill you so quickly.\n-[b] Camera Angles: [/b]The biggest reason I can't give a better score on this game. In my fight with Mesmeroth's Spirit, when you're trying to wack the little flaming orbs to find him, the camera angle would TWIST YOUR VISUALITY AROUND SO MUCH that you would STRUGGLE just trying to simply hit all the orbs. I couldn't hit them in time because THE CAMERA WOULDN'T LET ME. I died many times because of this. :(\n- The second time I was fighting the fish boss, he got stuck on one of the pillars and couldn't move. It ensured my victory...but...\n- [b]Exploration[/b] - I love exploring. The map is great and going everywhere is fun, but I wish instead of going on a set course, you could sail on your own. It'd have a more Windwaker feel, but it'd also feel nostalgic.\n\nEither way, great game!", "timestamp_created": 1443531322, "timestamp_updated": 1443531322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18231425": {"recommendationid": "18231425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137532891", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1215, "last_played": 1552684171}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 and I just dont toss that around much.", "timestamp_created": 1443413535, "timestamp_updated": 1443413535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18221136": {"recommendationid": "18221136", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988684267", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 783, "last_played": 1443363310}, "language": "english", "review": "Eventhough it is very charming and it's fun to explore the bonsai-like islands, the boss fights are abysmal and the game is overall way too easy.", "timestamp_created": 1443363373, "timestamp_updated": 1443363373, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18212746": {"recommendationid": "18212746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044602606", "num_games_owned": 7358, "num_reviews": 471, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1443882867}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a very nice and fun  homage to Majora's Mask/Wind Waker from what I could tell.

Zelda veterans will find the gameplay natural, as if an extension of an actual Zelda game.  The puzzles work very similar if not the same, items are familiar, core objectives are mostly the same.  Veterans will also find this game a bit easier, and therefore feels a little too short; even with the extra level from the \"Game of the Year Edition\".  Zelda noobs (are there any?) will be eased into the genre without being overwhelmed by the puzzles which are significantly more difficult in parts of the Zelda series.  Then go tackle all the Zelda you can get your hands on...please.  This is a great game to play in addition to any of them.   Even though I said Veterans will find it short and a bit easy, it's still worth the price.  It's a good deal at full price and a steal at any sale price.\n\nPros: \nWell, you can wait for Nintendo to release a new Zelda for your N64 or Gamecube, or give this a shot.\nA nostalgic but fresh game.\nExcellent graphics that are a blast in 3D with 3D TVPlay!\nPerfect controlls with my PS3 Controller\nAny age can enjoy\n\nCons:\nNo fairies, or bottles to put them in...sad.\nAnother acceptable answer could have been merfairies.\nEach game save is a completely different game, you can't save a single game to multiple save slots.  Minor issue, but I like to sometimes save a duplicate for back up or whatever.\n\nPS. I've never heard of a merfairy before.  That just came to me out of the blue as I was typing.

The story is simple - find your father. The execution is effective, making this one of my favorite games. Let's take a look at why.\n\nPROS\n- The story is basic, but never boring or cliched. Subtle, yet deep. Characters are well-done and engaging. I really look forward to the development between the hero and heroine in the sequel, as well as seeing his father and others grow.\n- Overall, at least as far as story advancement is concerned, the difficulty level is pretty good. It may be a bit high when it comes to finding all bloodstones and such, but, overall, it's solid.\n- Gameplay is enjoyable, with multiple weapons and basic puzzles to solve.\n- Boss fights are pretty well done, though the last boss might should be a little harder. The boss before him was actually harder.\n- The game's morality is solid. No bad content of any kind (profanity, sexual content, etc.), solid view of right and wrong, no female warriors, etc.\n- The graphics are excellent, though the frame rates do seem a bit low.\n- Trading cards!\n- Lots of content. I got all of the achievements, and almost 100% completion, with about 20 hours of gameplay...Walkthroughs helped. ;-) But a better gamer than me may not need them. It will provide a lot of game time nonetheless.\n- Music is excellent.\n- Being able to progress in pretty much any order you like is nice.\n- Island designs are good.\n\nCONS\n- No jumping, excepts across ledges, and only then with \"trencher boots.\"\n- No long-term swimming in deep water (even though he can swim indefinitely in shallow water). These two things are actually, I think, the worst design flaws of the game. They're only there because the gameplay model needs it.\n- No story after defeating the final boss. You were supposed to do something with the heroine, which I really wanted to do, but I guess that's for the sequel. :-) It would be nice if people would talk about how you defeated the monster and all that jazz.\n- Fishing might should be a tad bit easier, though, if you change up spots a lot, which is good fishing advice, anyway, it's fine.\n- Being able to control the boat would be nice.\n- There's no sequel yet! D-: So, yeah, I loved this game.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOceanhorn is well worth the money, with a good story, solid gameplay, nice graphics, and an enjoyable soundtrack. The world is immersive, never feeling dull, but like a real adventure. I highly recommend it - buy it today!\n\nThanks for reading my review; I hope you found it helpful.

With only your father's notebook and your mother's mysterious necklace as clues, you set off in his search and thus begins the adventure.\n\nOceanhorn is a very nice casual action/adventure RPG, complete with puzzles, which is quite reminiscent in many ways to Legend of Zelda. The gameplay revolves around you finding clues from NPCs, battling monsters, solving puzzles and collecting keys and treasures from the different islands around the vast world while you search for your father and discover more to the story and lore of the place. The story and lore might not be too in-depth, but it's deep enough to keep you going through the game.\n\nAs I understand it this game was first made for iOS and then ported to PC, and although the port and game play are smooth enough that you might not have realized it, you can tell it was meant to be mobile by the way certain things work - such as in moving the world map, sliding the menu and other specific touch screen features.\n\nAlthough the developers lean to the simplistic side, the game's graphics are beautiful: bright, colorful, and they feel quite alive. There is something definitely cute about all the characters you encounter and the sights are gorgeous. The way all islands are a bit different, each with their own little biome, some even with weather, adds interest to the gameplay and makes visiting each one a slightly unique experience. This spontaneous element helps keep it from being tedious.\n\nThe music was also wonderful, fitting to the world and the islands. The voice acting was a bit hit and miss, but for the most it was pretty good. I just wish the main character would have spoken, too.\n\nThe camera I found a bit annoying at first, as it's not free roam; you can only move it a little bit left and right, but I got used to it quickly and it did not hinder my enjoyment in the end. The camera follows you during boss battles too, which was both extremely helpful (as it did not get in my way), and extremely dizzying when my main strategy was \u201cback up in circles and wait for an opening\u201d.\n\nHaving tried both ways I can definitely say that the game plays a lot better with a controller, still, I used my keyboard through most of my play through without any major issues. The key distribution is decent enough and, if I\u2019m not mistaken, you were able to rebind certain keys.\n\nStarting up the game for the first time I could see the menu was simplistic, which was good and fitting for the game; but I was not overly pleased with the windowed mode option. The only option available was \"Windowed (borderless)\", which was... still defaulting to full screen as I could not even change the resolution for it (but I could change the resolution for full screen). However, I read the developers were working on this. I'll be happy to see the option to use regular windowed mode to play it, hopefully in different resolutions.\n\nThe world, as I already mentioned, is quite large. You get several islands to explore, but the islands must be unlocked first by talking to NPCs. If you're not paying much attention to what they say, it'll be easy for you to get a bit lost on which of two (or more) options you're supposed to go to first in order to follow the main story line; still, at most you'll need to do some backtracking. The game has a few tutorial bits (conveyed to you through little signs and pop ups), yet some things were still learn-as-you-go, such as how to deal with the world map.\n\n\nTo travel from island to island you sail a ship. I quite liked the idea of this initially - there'll be monsters to shoot at and boxes to sink. Once more I was reminded of Zelda with this. The first couple of trips are quite nice, however, it soon becomes a bit bothersome to go from island to island, even once your ship gets upgraded to sail faster. I think it might have been much more entertaining if we'd been able to steer the ship ourselves (auto-pathing and steering both as options would have been fantastic!). This would have made it more interactive than just sitting there and shooting at things. It's not much of a challenge to get to your destination though, just like the majority of puzzles are not much of a challenge either. They're good, but they're simple: perfect for a casual gamer such as me. Yet if you're into hard, challenging puzzles, you might find oceanhorn a bit disappointing.\n\nInteracting with items was fun: everything that could be hit or bumped into would wobble, which I found was super cute. You could even bump into people (as opposed to getting stuck by running into them), a little detail that I quite love in games. The way interaction with picking objects worked though was a bit annoying, since the attack button would suddenly serve the function of picking and tossing an object if you were near it; thus, if you were in the middle of slashing your sword away at an enemy and walked by a rock, you would end up getting the rock instead and thus getting hit by the enemy. That you could not walk off large cliffs to your early death was also quite nice and a little feature I was thankful for more than once. Be careful if you choose to go swimming in the ocean, though, as your character will quickly run out of stamina and drown.\n\nThe fighting system was quite easy to get a handle of, and I found myself thankful for the little auto-target while defending, at least most the times. Sometimes it would lock me into the wrong target though and leave me open to a second attacker I was more interested in defending myself from. I liked the way the character leveled up, but it was a bit odd that his leveling did not modify the way his hits affected monsters. Stuff that took 3 hits to kill would still take three hits on level 1 or level 5. It wasn't too troublesome as the enemies are easy to defeat, but I thought it was a bit odd. Even though you can explore the islands, the game is rather linear, needing some interactions to happen first before you can unlock others.\n\nThe mini-bosses require a bit of strategy, but are also not overly challenging once you get the handle on them. Once again this makes it good for casual gamers and the younger crowd, but those seeking challenges might not have as much fun with it. In whole, the game offers you just about 10 hours of gameplay to finish it without any side-questing or aimless exploring, and some 4-6 hours more if you\u2019re a completionist.\n\nOceanhorn plays quite nicely in older PCs and I kind of like the way things spawn on your screen as you come closer to them, slowly popping into the map with their little bouncy animation. It adds to the overall cartoony cuteness of the game. It also helps that it has an extremely small size (at ~380mb) so it's quick to install and start playing it.\n\nI heard some talk about crashes and bugs, but to be honest I did not experience any such. At most I experienced a bit of lag when video sections began or ended, but that was about it and it and it did not occur all the time. The game was truly fun and a delight to play.

The main story happens at a reasonable pace and doesn't involve too much backtracking. Going for the 100% completionist, though, stretches out the gameplay to the point where it starts to become tedious and less enjoyable.\n\nThe general combat is fairly decent though it's not very responsive, dynamic, or varied. Hack n' Slash is holy writ for the most part. One [b]major[/b] gripe I have with general play is that enemy loot doesn't spawn until a second or two later when the enemy bodies have despawned; this means you have to force yourself to wait around after killing something, backtrack, or ignore the loot. On the plus side the experience \"drop\" is an automatic pickup even if in the grand scheme of things not worth much (you get most of your XP from [i]doing[/i] stuff, not [i]killing[/i] stuff.\n\nI greatly appreciated that there wasn't One Way to defeat bosses, largely because that way would result in longer and more tedious fights. Many of the boss fights had a particular gimmick to disarm them based on the arena but this effect could be replicated by bombs, arrows, and/or magic. On the other hand there isn't much depth to any of the fights except the very last one as all the others are just 'disarm, bash-bash-bash-bash-bash, disarm, bash-bash-bash-bash-bash, disarm, bash-bash-bash-bash-bash, done'. Despite that I'm still not sure how I beat the final boss (deus ex machina, literally).\n\nIts style shares vague similarities to Wind Waker but it lacks a certain depth that Zelda games tend to have. There's only basic gadgets, half of the spells are unnecessary, and the fishing mini-game is largely there just to pad the XP growth potential (you can't sell the fish, they can't be used in any way, and none of the NPCs care what happens, but you get tons of extra XP the first time you catch a fish type).\n\nMy personal recommendation is to get it on sale, play through the main story, maybe track down some heart pieces for the final boss, and leave it at that.", "timestamp_created": 1435308319, "timestamp_updated": 1435308319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16713363": {"recommendationid": "16713363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144267313", "num_games_owned": 1093, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1346, "last_played": 1434678490}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best Zelda-like games available.", "timestamp_created": 1435296760, "timestamp_updated": 1435296760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16666167": {"recommendationid": "16666167", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984322112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 954, "last_played": 1435114311}, "language": "english", "review": "Like a cheap verson of Zelda, nothing very hard.

The game obviously emulates Zelda, but it also reminds me of other classics like Landstalker (Genesis) and Alundra (PS1).  If you\u2019re into these types of games, you\u2019ll definitely enjoy what Oceanhorn has to offer.  \n\n- Certainly, the upgrades and variety of gadgets could have been more robust and there could have been more towns to explore, but as a five hour experience (if you're just focused on the main story), Oceanhorn didn\u2019t need these extra elements to be enjoyable.    \n\n- Unlike other reviewers, I really liked the sailing segments. It\u2019s essentially an on-rails shooting gallery that gives the player an opportunity to refill their inventory and health before reaching a new island. \n\nThe Bad:\n- For the most part, Oceanhorn ran smoothly; however, there were a few times during my play through that the frame rate plummeted. This occurred mostly when entering the towns, but thankfully it only lasted for ten to twenty seconds before returning back to normal speed.  \n\n- This game desperately needed an active mission hint system to give the player suggestions on where to go or how to accomplish certain goals. For me, this would have been helpful after major segments of the game as it took a bit of trial and error to figure out where to go next. \n\n- Boss fights ranged from tedious to overly convoluted.\n\n- If you\u2019re an achievement hunter this game is not hard to fully complete. But, some of the fishing challenges (The Botfish) were ridiculously frustrating.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI recommend this game, but only if it\u2019s on sale.

Well, you get Oceanhorn Monster of Uncharted Seas. What seems like a Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker clone with an isometric camera, Oceanhorn has a style all its own. From sailing the high seas, spelunking dungeons for new items, and defeating bosses in a \u201cspot and exploit the weakness\u201d motif; sure this does sound a lot like Wind Waker, but hey, if you\u2019re going to be influenced from a game series, why not one of the most renouned and beloved? Bonus points for borrowing so heavily from one of the strongest games in said franchise.\n\nNo one who plays Oceanhorn will be able to deny the various Legend of Zelda inspirations throughout, but just because it has all of these various ideas and tropes in place, is that a bad thing? Yes and no. Yes because a lot of Zelda fans are rather tired of the same Zelda formula the recent games have instituted: go to dungeon, get a new item, use that item on the dungeon\u2019s boss, repeat 6-8 times, learn midway through of a legend about a green tunic\u2019d warrior that will save the land, exposition a bit more, Triforce wielders confront, roll credits. We realize that\u2019s a snarky critique, but it\u2019s also valid. Oceanhorn at least avoids a lot of these tired ideas and throws us back to a more retro Zelda premise. Those who have played the very first Legend of Zelda on NES will recall the game was rather obtuse and almost too open. Players load the game up and are thrust into a world, onto a screen that has three directions: north, west, and east, with a single cave wherein player will find a weapon (sound familiar, yet?). Oceanhorn feels more like a 1989 Zelda than anything else in terms of world design and instructions.\n\nA few players may be turned off by the lack of hand-holding and direction in the opening hours, but for us here, it was a refreshing take. We\u2019ve become spoiled by overly-simplistic tutorials and being lead through opening segments with lengthy cutscenes and explanations about the world around us. Oceanhorn does seem to abandon the uniqueness it begins with after a few hours and lean on the Zelda formula, but it\u2019s done progressively, making it a forgivable sin. There\u2019s still the \u201ccollect x number of relics and defeat the ultimate evil\u201d blueprint in place, but the dungeon exploration and puzzle solving is there to prevent boredom from overwhelming the player.\n\nThe gameplay takes place on dense lands ranging from single-tiered isles to several levels of housing and dungeons. Don\u2019t be fooled by an island\u2019s size while sailing up to it, there\u2019s typically more below the surface than shown. The scale is lesser than Wind Waker, but this is no short game; expect to spend 10-15 hours with Oceanhorn, with an extra few for those that aim to collect any and everything the islands hold within. Puzzles will range from block-moving to hitting ranged targets with arrows. It\u2019s never anything too strenuous, but a few were noodle scratchers that provided \u201ceureka\u201d moments when solved. Boss battles aren\u2019t too genre-defying, but are more complex than one would think an iOS-to-PC game would be. Most bosses require a specific strategy to affect them, and finding out that strategy while strafing and dodging can provide a sense of tension few Zelda games can even subject us to. Tight rooms and multi-powered bosses can keep players on their toes during a fight.\n\nVisually and audibly Oceanhorn is a like-it-or-leave-it presentation. Just like with nearly every other aspect, the main character borrows heavily from Link, even seemingly borrowing his Skyward Sword garb minus the hat, to head out on this adventure. Characters look great, full of colors, design, and polish, but few enemy types and marginally different skin swaps of some of them leave a lot to be desired. Lush environments and dark, diluted dungeons accentuate each other very well, but only vary by the end rather than consistently throughout. Nearly every over world island is practically the same look with a different layout; at least every themed dungeon has a personality and appeal. Voicework and composition are impressive given the small staff at handling the game, with many cutscenes providing adequate storytelling and delivery. Music is acceptable, if not a tad bit safe in the end. As fun and upbeat few of the songs are, there\u2019s little that keeps us coming back to listen to more after the fact. It\u2019s passable, and the influences are there, but the music just doesn\u2019t have that lasting appeal that comes with other games, and especially Zelda games.\n\nWhat was probably a great iOS game, where aside from DS titles, there were not many Zelda-esque games on the market; Oceanhorn was a relief and refreshing. Hitting Steam and diving into the deep end where Zelda clones are a dime a dozen, this little trek has heart, but fails to sail far enough from the rest of the pack to standout for too long. If you have a Zelda itch to scratch while waiting for more, Oceanhorn can fill that need, but don\u2019t expect new ideas, only tweaked presentations on acquainted themes.

Throwing is still ok because you can direct your throws with the wasd keys.\n\nMusic is nice, fits the atmosphere of the game, but i noticed a bit of repetition where the same theme was used for different similar environments. To be expected i suppose.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the longer i play, the more it begins to lag. Fortunately the game saves between rooms, and if i feel a lag coming on, i just close the game and reopen it, that seems to reset the memory. Saved games pick up where you left off, either at a doorway or save point.\n\nFirst boss wasn't challenging, and actually glitched, running into a corner instead of moving around the room or attacking. This creature was reused as a general monster later, so i don't think it was supposed to be as big a deal as what i anticipate will come later.\n\nBoat travels are nice. You don't control the boat direction like in Wind Waker, but instead point out your destination on the map and it auto routes you to it, and after going up a few levels you get a gun for the boat and can then shoot crates and barrels, floating mines, and \"octorocks\" that are in the way. Fun little minigame that breaks the pace of the dungeon crawling and exploration.\n\nI love the fact that, once you get bombs, you can really start going crazy with the combat and exploration. Only 5 bombs at first, but as you level up you can carry more. If there are visual clues about bombable walls, i haven't noticed any. I bombed a wall to see if it opened a path to a chest i couldn't reach, and it did, but noticed no discoloring, blocks, or cracks to indicate i could do so. This is oldschool wall bombing at it's finest.\n\nGot it on sale for 8.99, and would strongly recommend this game at that price. Even for the normal price at around 15 dollars it is still a nice game.\n\nIf devs could fix the issues causing lag and my disappearing pointer, i'd give this at least a 9/10, as it is, i'll say 7.5/10\n\nIf you're a fan of the 2D Zelda series, Alundra, Landstalker, Light Crusader, or even Neutopia, give this game a try, you won't be disappointed!", "timestamp_created": 1432623073, "timestamp_updated": 1432623073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15874389": {"recommendationid": "15874389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008926167", "num_games_owned": 1506, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1428092082}, "language": "english", "review": "\u201cOceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas\u201d is an interesting game in concept. It accurately compares itself to the \u201cLegend of Zelda\u201d titles and is definitely reminiscent of the core gameplay in that series. The interesting part however comes from the game being on mobile devices and PC, whereas Nintendo has so far only released Zelda games on their own consoles. \u201cOceanhorn\u201d attempts to tap into a niche, and does it fairly well, despite lacking the polish that Nintendo fans have come to expect.\n\nThe game is a mostly isometric dungeon crawler game akin to Zelda games. Using a sword and shield, along with various items unlocked through the game, the goal is to progress through various dungeons and reach the boss of each area. At times this is much easier said than done, as the level layouts can be a bit confusing at times. The levels themselves however look fantastic, and generally speaking the game\u2019s graphical quality is up to the standard of the Zelda games, just with a bit less bloom which is very welcome.\n\nIn fairness to the game, as of yet I haven\u2019t run into any major issues that have stopped me from progressing or caused me to wonder what exactly the developer was thinking, however my problems with the game arise from a series of small things that are missing. The easiest way to describe it is unfortunately just to reiterate the first paragraph; the game lacks polish in many areas.\n\nThe graphics of the game, as previously mentioned are pretty great, the game genuinely looks gorgeous, especially the water used to sail between islands. However some texture glitches and clipping can stand out while trying to solve a puzzle, and the isometric viewpoint can be a bit of a problem at times even with an adjustable camera. The game\u2019s combat is generally solid, however hitbox issues can make fighting a bit unsatisfying, and the music sits comfortably in between being great and defining the landscape as Zelda games use their soundtrack, and being fairly mediocre. I never found reason to complain, but unlike some other games in recent memory, it never left me wanting a soundtrack to slap on my phone.\n\nHowever, a lot of the issues I\u2019ve raised with this game are present in others like it, and are usually forgivable, however for something that compares itself to a Zelda game, it\u2019s hard to not judge it in the same vein as those titles. That said, this review has been a bit harsh so far -- while the game definitely lacks the polish of Zelda titles, it brings some of its own traits to the table which add to the game.\n\nAn experience system and a sprint function without having to wait to unlock the Pegasus Boots is likely the biggest improvement, as being able to zip around places you\u2019ve already been through means hopping right back into a dungeon is always just a couple seconds away. The challenges offer experience as a reward and can add some interesting depth to the game, assuming it\u2019s not a simple one like breaking several pots, something Zelda fans were going to do anyway.\n\nOverall, the game does a decent job at mimicking the Zelda series, but as stated before multiple times, the lack of polish can stand out and may put some people off from the title. That\u2019s unfortunate, because the game is generally enjoyable. It makes some legitimate improvements to the formula of Zelda titles, it\u2019s just hard to not look at some aspects of the game and wish the developers had a bit more experience behind them so they could smooth out the rough bits. That said, it\u2019s an enjoyable experience that at the least attempts to shake things up a bit.\n\n3/5", "timestamp_created": 1431881936, "timestamp_updated": 1431881936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50035560131072998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15859635": {"recommendationid": "15859635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066046242", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 940, "last_played": 1427238072}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a mobile port and it definitely shows. The game is pretty enough, voice acting is decent, but the gameplay itself is dull. The controls feel clunky, especially in combat where your hits do not always register if you attack the enemy too fast. Magic takes too long to be useful most of the time, and even when it is needed it feels underwhelming. An item you get lets you jump across small gaps and dodge roll, both of which are keyed to the same button. The game will let you fall from areas up to a certain height, which means you can be doing a timed puzzle and then inadvertantly (and commonly) dodge roll instead of jumping to the next platform and have to do the entire thing over. \n\nDamage is inconsistent, with bombs doing massive damage to some enemies but barely a scratch to others... and yet those other enemies will take a big chunk of damage from a random pot thrown at them. Speaking of pots, you have to either throw, shoot them, or throw a bomb at them to break them... your sword is evidently the sword of not smashing pots.\n\nBosses are few and far between, and most are unimpressive. I died a few times to them, not because they were hard, but because of completely unavoidable attacks, the boss freezing (status, not game freezing) the mechanic to damage it and the only way to unfreeze it aside from letting it time out is your magic with the very long windup, or just poorly designed.\n\nTravel between islands is set on pre-set paths, you tell the game to go and it drops you into a little shooting gallery where you spam the attack button to kill anything that gets in the way until you reach the island. On mobile I'm sure it was neat, tap to kill the things, but on pc its just feels like a boring, spam your mouse button and go add-on. \n\nOverall, the game is probably very good on mobile platforms, but not a very good pc game, and comparing it to zelda is like comparing a perfectly cooked steak to a $1 Banquet microwave dinner.", "timestamp_created": 1431805876, "timestamp_updated": 1431805876, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785404622554779053", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15833116": {"recommendationid": "15833116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056930319", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1486864720}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bueno, lo intente con este juego, la idea de tener un \"zelda\" en PC se me hac\u00eda interesante, y tengo que admitir que de lejos parec\u00eda prometedor, pero lo \u00fanico que encontr\u00e9 es una imitaci\u00f3n muy pobre de las mec\u00e1nicas del referido, con una narrativa tirada de los pelos que no sabe ni para donde va y una seguidilla de errores de dise\u00f1o que termino por hartarme hasta el punto de odiarlo.

It offers multiple languages for subtitle like French by example.\n\n- CONS -\nThe game is too easy. Unfortunately I would recommend this game for a real big fan of the Zelda style games or to kids arround 8 to 13 of age. Sure I died a couple of time in this game but... That's just not enough for the majority. Once finished I don't think you will want to play this game again. Some of the puzzles are too similar to some others.\n\nI would give this game a 7/10.

More specifically, there are just too many inconsistencies with the gameplay and visuals. Some players may ignore these issues considering it\u2019s an indie game but it's apparent that several of them are due to sheer laziness and that's something I can't forgive.\n\nI'll give you an example. The first issue I spotted, even from the trailer, is that the animations are simply stiff. The main character's idle animation is a big offender here. This is because almost all of the animations use a linear transition which creates a really rigid and unnatural feel. This can be solved with easement scaling and a little bit of hand-crafting. Basically the animators were lazy. A minor issue, but the game is FULL of  these minor issues and it's incredibly abrasive after a while.\n\nAt one point I fell down a \"hole\" that I thought was suppose to be the entrance of a cave. My character stopped shortly after falling only few feet, landing on solid ground.  His head bobbed in his rigid little idle animation for a brief moment. I thought that maybe I was mistaken about it being a cave entrance but then the game transitioned into another scene where my character was falling from a cave ceiling. I then realized that the developers simply made the entrance hole too shallow and this broke the illusion of actually falling through it. When I later got back out of the cave the grass that had grown over the entrance when it was undiscovered was there again, floating in mid-air. See what I mean by lazy?\n\nAnother huge problem is the absolutely shameless use of invisible walls. Many games use invisible walls but it's pretty hard to forgive in this case. You can only walk off ledges in very specific places and it's not nearly as obvious as it should be. In fact it's almost arbitrary. It just feels weird trying to constantly mime your way off a short ledge.\n\nThe allusion to the Zelda series can't just be called inspiration. It's actually a little offensive how much they rely on established Zelda mechanics. For example there are pieces of heart and they work pretty much like you would expect them to. You find them in random chests and you need exactly four of them to create a heart container. I mean, they are literally called \"Pieces of Heart\". Not convinced? There are crustacean-like enemies that shoot projectiles at you but dig into the ground when you come near them. You defeat them by shielding their projectiles which bounce back at them. I'm not even kidding.\n\nThe intent of copying Zelda mechanics are so desperate and obvious that the game should be called \"Shoehorn\". Exploration is based around the open-ocean feeling of Wind Waker, for instance. That itself isn't a bad thing but they copied the mechanic in the most superficial way possible. Instead of having any sort of interaction with the actual sailing of your ship, you simply click your destination and then watch as your tiny little vessel coasts its way along the featureless ocean at a snail's pace. This may have been somewhat scenic if it weren't for the main character looking around like a dork with his robot movements I feel like any time a game makes me want to get up and make a sandwich instead of actually playing is a huge red flag. I'm sure some players find this relaxing but for the less patient of us, an option to skip this would have been nice. \n\nI think the real thing that bothers me is that I really had high expectations from the game but it feels more like a Zelda cash-in than a love letter.

But why is this a bad thing? As a diehard Zelda fan, I welcome the gaming industry to create their own attempts at Zelda-like games, whether from AAA developers or indies. And Oceanhorn does a fine job of being a fun game, even though almost all of its major elements are pretty much lifted from the Zelda series. But let's be fair here, bows, bombs, swords, shields, and sailing are far from monopolized by Zelda.\n\nGetting into Oceanhorn itself, there's a lot to like about this game. The art style has its own charm, the isometric viewpoint is neat and a nice callback to games like Mario RPG and Landstalker, and the music... sublime. It all comes together in a wonderful presentation package that should delight anyone who can see past the game's obvious inspiration. The controls, for the most part, are pretty fluid, especially considering this is a port of an iOS game, and it felt just right on a controller, although the main character does move just the smallest bit slower than I'd like him to. The sailing atmosphere is gorgeous, and it's fun visiting new islands and charting them out, learning what secrets and people dwell there. The puzzles, while not entirely brainteasers, were the right amount of clever and made the game feel fluid. Dungeons are clever and designed expertly, with creative boss fights I quite enjoyed. In some ways it's a bit on the easy end, but no easier than your typical Zelda game.\n\nThe cons with this game are minor. There's the often-cited lack of a map screen, which would have been very handy. I find it odd that you can't dash or roll up steps, which would be nice for speeding up action. And the sailing is even more restrictive than that of Phantom Hourglass; in that game you could at least plot a course, but here, you can only select a destination.

And it really doesn't hide that fact at all. One of the very first things you encounter are pots you can pick up and throw in order to destroy them. There are bushes you can cut down with your sword in order to collect money, bombs and arrows and you have to explore dungeons in order to collect three pieces of a mystical item that helps you defeat the final boss. You also get a new, stronger sword and a new shield over the course of the game. The only thing it doesn't directly lift form Zelda games is the fact that there isn't a princess in this. Otherwise it's an extremely faithful homage to Link's adventures, especially Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass, since it incorporates a lot of sailing as well. \n\nI think the most interesting aspect about the game is the fact that it actually came out on mobile devices first. Because while playing it on PC, I honestly wouldn't have guessed its origins. The interface is perfectly adapted for PC and it's playable with both controller and mouse and keyboard. And for a mobile game it's definitely quite a lengthy game to play. It took me on PC around 10 hours to get through and I haven't even collected all the hidden secrets in there and even for a proper PC game the length is adequate enough. The only thing it's lacking is good bossfights. There are only really six bossfights and two of those don't involve any strategies beyond holding up your shield and countering when the enemy is exposing himself. Three of the boss fights are the ones where you collect the faux-Triforce shards and then the last one at the very end. Even though you need to employ different tactics to beat them, they're not all that challenging to figure out. \n\nAnd since there's only three shards to collect, there are only really three big dungeons to explore. The other dungeons are very small and don't contain many puzzles. And speaking of the puzzles, they're mostly very easy block pushing or switch pressing puzzles. Only one of the puzzles was rather hard for me to guess, the rest is fairly straightforward. \n\nOther than that I can say that I'm very pleased with the art style. They really managed to capture the typical whimsical Zelda aesthetic. Though what elevates the experience is definitely the soundtrack. It does take a lot of inspiration from other video game composers, but it's still very enjoyable and very fitting to all your surroundings. \n\nIf there's one problem I had, at least with the beta build I got for review purposes, it's the amount of crashes I suffered. The game constantly crashed on me for no apparent reason, and it had tremendous difficulty maintaining 60 FPS on my rig which is saying a lot. Though I did notice that the crashes subsided on the day prior to release, so maybe they've fixed it. Though really, the crashes were only annoying in the sense that I had to restart the game. Because the auto-save function is pretty damn awesome in this game, I barely lost any progress while playing it, so there's that at least.\n\nIn the end, it's an obvious Zelda-clone because that's exactly what it wants to be. And for an effort from a small indie studio form Finland it's definitely not a bad one.

I mostly see it compared to [i]The Wind Waker[/i] because it takes place on a series of islands, but it's really more similar to [i]Phantom Hourglass[/i] and [i]A Link to the Past[/i]. You don't have free reign of your boat like in [i]Wind Waker[/i], but instead select an island from your map and a path is automatically charted. During the trip, you must shoot down attacking octopi and mines, but everything is on-rails. Most of the map is locked away at the game's start, but additional islands appear when you learn about them from NPC's or other sources.\n\nThe main game takes place on an isometric grid. One thing to keep in mind which is very important for puzzle-solving and finding hidden secrets is that you can only drop down from above by a distance of one \"block\". If this isn't possible, then you will simply walk to a cliff's edge and stop. Combat is simple and a bit loose, but it works okay. You have access to items such as bombs and arrows which help out in combat. In particular, I found bombs to be very potent against stronger enemies.\n\nBlock puzzles are featured fairly often, though they never become too complex. Most of the other puzzles are more of the navigational variety, and you'll really only find a challenge if you look for optional collectables. [i]Oceanhorn[/i] features \"Challenges\" similar to what you see in many mobile games. Each island you visit brings with it three new challenges, some that are general goals (i.e. \"Defeat 50 skeletons\") and some that are specific to that island. Completing these challenges rewards you with a large amount of experience points. You can also gain experience by defeating enemies, but it can be a bit of a grind. When you level up your abilities become more efficient (require less stamina), you can hold more consumable items, or other various bonuses. \n\nThere are also optional items to collect called Bloodstones, which eventually unlock a powerful spell. I noticed these items early on, but I thought I had to get some sort of shovel or something to dig them out. It turns out, you just have to whack them with your sword like twenty times to collect them. I don't think the game ever mentioned this, so I was kind of annoyed when I realized this after I passed by so many during the first few dungeons.\n\nThe graphics are nice and clean, although in motion the animations could have been better. I played this game entirely on a 37\" TV at about 10 feet away, and sometimes the text was a bit too small. (Though it didn't help that I played it until 1:00 A.M. the last few nights.) This originally started as a mobile title, so at times you can see its origins peeking through. Overall, though, I'd say this port was pretty good. The music is nice, although it does sound pretty similar to Wind Waker at times. I had heard that the mobile version [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=zJwSAru1ZyA#t=130]featured several songs by Nobuo Uematsu[/url] of [i]Final Fantasy[/i] fame, but I'm not sure if his songs were replaced for the PC version as I did not see his name in the credits at all.\n\nThe controls worked great with my Xbox 360 controller. I did have the game lock up on me a few times, but it was usually right when I launched the game so I did not lose any progress. I did have to exit to the title screen once because I got my character stuck somewhere they weren't supposed to go to. Fortunately, the game auto-saves frequently so it was no big deal.\n\nLike Link from the Zelda series, the main character of [i]Oceanhorn[/i] is mute. In most Zelda games, however, some sort of proxy character is present to give some sort of voice to Link. The nameless main character of [i]Oceanhorn[/i] lacks this, and coupled with an always emotionless face, you really don't get a feeling of any personality for him at all. The other characters in the game fared a bit better, though none of them were too memorable. In addition to other humans, the world of Arcadia features bird-like Owrus and fish-like Gillfolk. While a bit clich\u00e9d, the emerging backstory was interesting enough to keep me playing, and had a slight twist that I didn't expect.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with [i]Oceanhorn[/i]. It's not perfect, but it's a decent substitution for a Zelda game on PC. It's much shorter than recent Zelda titles and isn't padded with a lot of filler. It may be a Zelda clone, but it's certainly a competent one so I'm not going to complain.", "timestamp_created": 1427128796, "timestamp_updated": 1427128796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495596885681152344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15020886": {"recommendationid": "15020886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141507279", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1029, "last_played": 1432891471}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego.

There are obvious nods to The Wind Waker in the world setting and locales right down to an ocean landscape dotted with islands, but that did not stop Cornfox & Bros from developing their game the way they wanted.

The main character sets off with an interaction level akin to the Zelda titles; jars are picked up and smashed on the ground, grass blades are slashed, boulders are blown apart by bombs. However there is an enjoyable yet simple physical meat to the main character in Oceanhorn. Even something as basic as wading in water brings about a speed penalty. A sign that the developers pay attention to the minutia of videogames.\n\nThe graphics are gloriously bright and colourful. The story won't set your imagination alight with wonder but it does the job. And the music is outstanding - sooner or later you'll be humming and whistling to the overworld theme.\n\nIt's a pity that this game may fly under the radar despite the reception it could and should achieve.

Don't worry about the latter, you only get passive bonuses like being able to carry more bombs or sailing a little faster when you level up.\n\nThe only annoying thing: You can't skip sailing from island to island. It's not the sailing that is annoying, it's the flotsam, mines and even Oktoroks (I don't know their name in this game, so I'll use the Zelda one) which you have to shoot EVERY TIME you're traveling via boat. If you don't, you either arrive at your goal with low health or you die on the way to it.\nWind Waker made it so that you can lean back while your boat rushes across the ocean. If an enemy shows up it either gives up chasing you after a couple of seconds (Gyorg) or it keeps missing you with its shots (Oktorok). You can always choose to fight them for some extra rupees, arrows or bombs, but you don't have to.\nOceanhorn makes sailing a pain in the behind, because it always spawns stuff into your way and because your boat always sails TOWARDS it, which you can't prevent, since the game does not allow you to control your boat. A third of the game is literally \"just sitting there and shooting at stuff\".\nEnough about that.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nAlthough it's a port of a smartphone game, the graphics are pretty nice. The faces may lack emotions, the talking animation looks a little jerky and the terrain consists of blocks (which you can NOT mine, dear hardcore Minecraft fans), but all that gives the game some sort of \"unique artstyle\".\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe (quite repetitive) soundtrack reminds of Final Fantasy, which is probably the dev's fault, since they \"hired\" Nobuo Uematsu and Kenji Ito.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nYou're a Zelda fan?

It's an incredibly well done Zelda clone(circa Link to the Past) with a healthy dose of the elevation-based problem solving from the classic Genesis adventure Landstalker. The game takes all it can from Zelda right down to the pieces of heart collectibles and block pushing puzzles to the simplistic but effective hack and slash combat. Heck, even the world map is itself a total Windwaker copycat(however nowhere near as tedious or annoying). \n\nIt adds it's own features here and there such as a leveling system, quests and a tad more open exploration than certain Zelda titles, and a more involved story but it's part and parcel a huge homage to the trend setting franchise. In no way is that a knock to the game's character because it's all done nearly as well as an indie dev could do so.\n\nThe music is another feature that struck me as well. It's another high quality aspect of an already high quality product, even if it sounds slightly Zelda-ish at times (when you first leave your house, you'll instantly get the feeling you've been here before).\n\nIf you're someone who loves Zelda or hack and slash adventures in general, you can't go wrong with picking this game up.

Intro\n2. Technical\n3. Gameplay\n4. Pro's, Cons, conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]1. Intro:[/h1]\nHello review readers! The fact that you're reading this review means you're either potentially interested in this game or have played it & want to get another guy's opinion on the game you have been playing. I am currently still playing the game and have not finished it, about 5-6 hours in.\n\n[h1]2. Techncial[/h1]\nThe game has full controller support (using xbox 360 controller for pc) and I would recommend playing it in this way. It is possible to play with mouse and keyboard, after testing both I decided to stick with he controller.\n\nIt's possible to change some graphical settings (shadows, screensize, etc.) up to a given point, I would have liked to have seen a little more options for this to make the game prettier/uglier depending on your hardware, but the basics are there.\n\nWhat annoys me a little bit is that it seems to be poorly optimised for PC at this point. Meaning: even though you might have a high end gaming system, sometimes you will get the occasional FPS drop or screen tear here & there. Nothing major & gamebreaking though, but it did cause me to tone down the graphics a bit for more consistent FPS.\nNevertheless: the game has vibrant colours & is fun to look at, despite it not being \"graphically advanced\". The cartoony atmosphere grows on you, and I would not want to see this game with realisticly drawn characters & backgrounds, it feels fine the way it is.\n\nI have not had any crashes yet & the game runs flawlessly, people on the community forums have reported otherwise and I did see dev responding to these topics regularly. If you are unsure if you can run this game, better ask people on the forums with similar specs what their experiences are.\n\n[h1]3. Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay in my eyes, at first, was a bit \"easy\". Meaning: if you're looking for a \"hard\" game you will find little joy playing Oceanhorn. I'm not sure what age group i'd recommend this game for but i'd say something in the lines of 6+. If you (or your kid) can play games like Spyro the dragon or Skylanders/Disney Infinity, they can play this. It's not very hard, but to fully play the game they will need to understand the English language, be it to follow the story or just to read clues / where they should go next. The game starts off easy & keeps on making the puzzles more difficult, having you look around & go \"hmm, what now\" at regular intervals, keeping it interesting.\n\nYou get some freedom as in where to travel at any given point, yet, until you get some basic things handed to you by following the storyline (*minor spoilers, mouse over to show* [spoiler]bombs, a bow, a jump ability, stuff like that[/spoiler]), there is little to do other than follow the main route. It's a fake sense of freedom, but a sense of freedom nevertheless. After gaining a certain item or ability, you will often backtrack on the map or take sidepaths to reach areas you could not reach before.\n\nThe music is catchy at some points, making me hum it in the background while inside a dungeon / traveling around the world. They chose to not give the main character a voice in this game, as is common in a lot of these games, which I still kind of miss - I get that this is done to make the hero more relatable to you, giving you the option to give him your voice, but having a totally mute main hero has been done countless times and I find it more enjoyable when this isn't the case. That being said: the voice actors from the other people around the world sound kind of bland and I'm under the impression some bad/good guys were all voiced by the same person. They could have spiced this up a bit.\n\nThe story feels a bit clich\u00e9 to me, as an adult, but what more do you need than save princesses and find your family to go on an adventure right?\n\n[i](I hate to say this, but the similarities with Zelda are at some a little too obvious, take this as a good or a bad thing, that's up to you)[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Pro's, cons, conclusion[/h1]\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]PRO[/th]\n[th]CON[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Non-gamer friendly[/td]\n[td]Sometimes too easy for frequent gamers[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Full controller support[/td]\n[td]The way the game handles your hardware could be optimised[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Music is very nice[/td]\n[td]Character voices are kind of bland[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\nConclusion: Don't regret being curious enough to buy this game, have been having a lot of fun with it, albeit making the game/puzzles a little bit harder would not hurt. Very good step in game for friends/family who are not that experienced with gaming. Consider it a stepping stone into adventure/puzzle games to later hook them on something more complicated like Zelda, Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, ...\n\nIf you must have a score, I rate this game 67/100, it would have gotten 70/100 if the voice actors could loosen up a little :-)", "timestamp_created": 1426859697, "timestamp_updated": 1426860618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749628841876983643", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14967757": {"recommendationid": "14967757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086289495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1472107671}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful graphic 9/10 \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1426820888, "timestamp_updated": 1426820888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443089038133621216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14965703": {"recommendationid": "14965703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082345505", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 1036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1036, "last_played": 1426913275}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall it's a great game, many places to explore, secrets waiting to discover and monsters to fight.\nAction RPG fans would definitely enjoy playing [b]Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas[/b].\n\nSomehow, the difficulty of the game, puzzle solving and boss fight could be more challenging.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFawZy2LXiU", "timestamp_created": 1426805059, "timestamp_updated": 1426805059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513255894184112549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14965402": {"recommendationid": "14965402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031151772", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131, "last_played": 1426359463}, "language": "english", "review": "Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas caused a splash when it dropped on iOS back in 2013. It was plain to see that the game was an almost cut and paste rip, at least visually, from The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker, but it's unfair to call Oceanhorn a clone. To me, 'Clone' is a pejorative term reserved for the scores of cheap knock-offs occupying iOS, Android and Greenlight. Oceanhorn is better than that. It's a love letter to the Zelda series that brings similar, high quality design practices and gameplay values to gamers on iOS and PC. It doesn't quite sail into the same realm as Nintendo's flagship series but it's the closest another developer has ever come.\n\nThere's not much worth knowing about Oceanhorn's story, it's much the same as any Zelda game - so, as deep as a puddle and just about as interesting .The fabled sea monster called \"Oceanhorn\" has come back to your island, leaving your father to go fight it while you sleep. You find yourself alone with nothing but your mothers magical pendant to guide you, and off you pop on a Windwaker-style adventure in your dinky little boat- which, thankfully, doesn't talk this time.\n\nYou'll sail to new islands, each inhabited by people with interesting stories to tell, explore vast dungeons, and encounter creatures that are most definitely not ripped off from the Zora or Rito people.\n\nEquipped with your sword and shield, you'll take on dangerous foes and some surprisingly well designed boss monsters. Combat isn't as tight as the Zelda games but it's an admirable impersonation, especially for a game that has made its way over from iOS. Controls can be a bit finicky and loose at times but they are otherwise fine, feeling just as good with the mouse and keyboard as they do with a gamepad.\n\nThe developers try their hardest to conjure up the same sense of adventure that can be found in A Link to The Past and Windwaker, and for the majority of the game they succeed. It's unlikely you will forget that you are playing a game very heavily based on a well-known franchise, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand, opting to leave you wander off in your own direction with nothing but the words of other people to guide you. You are free to travel around and explore, neglecting the main story, if you so choose.\n\n\nDiving in to the meat of the game has you kill easy monsters in deep dungeons, solve simple puzzles, and collect elemental powers (where have we seen that before?). It's fairly standard stuff that even the Zelda franchise has dined out on for far too long. There's nothing particularly outstanding about any of Oceanhorn's action but its richly crafted, sun-kissed worlds are immersive and fun to explore. Ironically, for a game based around traversing large bodies of water, sailing isn't that fun. In fact, it's a bit dull - a complaint that was frequently directed at Windwaker, also. Any frustrations inspired by the mediocre sailing will at least be washed away by Oceanhorn's gorgeous soundtrack.\n\nAudiovisual presentation is an area where Oceanhorn zips past its, rather sparse, competition. A beautiful world-class composer crafted soundtrack and pretty landscapes are destined to keep a smile on your face and a tune in your head.\n\nIn truth, Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas can be a bit shallow, but it's hard to dislike a game so lovingly crafted - and with such respect for the source material from which it was created. Temper your expectations and you'll find an engrossing adventure that pays homage to one of gaming's greatest, never managing to step out of its shadow.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclosure: Review key provided by publisher.

The puzzles never get too difficult that you feel completely stuck as the signs offer pretty good hints what to do. The combat is pretty good although aiming can be a bit frustrating.

If you're a Zelda fan who's thirsty for adventure, look no further. For a port of a mobile game, Oceanhorn manages to look pretty. The visuals have been polished and everything looks shiny and new, but there are some framerate problems. The art style is pretty much ripped from The Wind Waker, so fans should feel right at home. Speaking of The Wind Waker, you get a boat! This is how you travel from island to island. Unfortunately, your boat doesn't talk and you can't steer it yourself. Traveling between islands is an on-rails affair, but there are enemies to keep you on your toes and driftwood to be smashed for the loot it contains. There's also a leveling system that basically replaces bigger quivers and bomb bags from the Zelda franchise. You gain experience from slaying baddies and attaining in-game achievements, which can force you to backtrack but do add to the longetivity of your adventure. Puzzles are a bit on the easy side and some items are a bit too familiar, but why fix gameplay that isn't broken? If you're a Zelda fan, Oceanhorn is a must-have for your Steam library.\n\n+ Gameplay is immediately familiar\n+ Environments are lovely, varied, and don't overstay their welcome\n+ Great soundtrack\n\n- Framerate issues\n- Controls could be tighter\n- Not being able to sail the ocean yourself is a bit of a bummer", "timestamp_created": 1426764179, "timestamp_updated": 1426764303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458723664283752441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14956252": {"recommendationid": "14956252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052243475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1422, "last_played": 1433047223}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome.

This game has it's own personality.\n\nIn short, if you like zelda then GET IT, if you've never played zelda then go buy a nintendo.\n\nThe following is based on 15 hours of game play and I'm maybe 50% through the game.  \n---\n\nI will start with the differences from zelda:\n1) locked camera: think Diablo.   2.5D-ish, very little ability to look around.\n2) blocky world, think minecraft.  Very well designed but can get repetitive and a bit easy to forget.\n3) No lock on targeting, you have to turn and face enimies to fight.\n\nSimilarities:\n1) multiple islands, almost all with dungeons below ground\n2) multiple spells, items, weapons, etc. earned as you go.\n3) varied enimies and boss and mini boss battles\n4) pretty epic story and characters. I didn't expect this part to be as good as it is.\n\nPROS:\ngreat graphics , animations, sound and music. story text is well written.\ndifferent areas and dungeons are very well layed out, quite intricate and detailed.\nthe story and characters make sense and everything progresses with a good pace.\ncombat works well.\nvery clean inventory screen.\n\nCONS:\nnone, I really didn't expect this game to be as good as it is or come as close to a zelda experience as it does.\n\nMINOR GRIPES:\nno full screen map, mini map is hard to read.  I mean, roaches showing up as blue dots? why?\nno free look / locked cam\nenimies are too easy, puzzles have been to simillar and easy, too much block pushing\nyou can get lost, take this to who? \nsailing is on-rails mini-game, pick your destination island and shoot stuff on the way\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nFishing was done really well, actually almost everything the designers put in the game is done really well.  Very high standards of quality.  This game is fun.  I recomend it if you like zelda.\n\n(I'll edit further if things change)", "timestamp_created": 1426744165, "timestamp_updated": 1426924206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498816847801208496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14955205": {"recommendationid": "14955205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058273548", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1433356220}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a zelda clone but this game is so good that I'm happy that it's a zelda clone.", "timestamp_created": 1426735011, "timestamp_updated": 1426735011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47399449348449707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14954988": {"recommendationid": "14954988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080373710", "num_games_owned": 4172, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 1452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1696471542}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game to play .\nIt's an Action/RPG game that reminds me of Zelda in almost everything .\nThe puzzles aren't very difficult neither are the enemies .\nIt has a good sound track and the graphics are really nice to watch ( very anime style ) , the control of the character could be a little bit better , ( but no one will die because of that ) .\nThe game still has some bugs like getting stuck on some hole or walking through some objects but if you restart the checkpoint its close by.

Your character gains experiences through defeating monsters and completing specific goals. Then, through the adventurers guild, you are given access to different weapons and features in the game.

Although the tight-level design and interesting mechanics of Zelda isn't really here (Let's be honest, you shouldn't expect it to be), the game manage to  the Zelda games justice, to a degree, without ripping it off too much. It's like Oceanhorn sat next to Zelda on a test and manage to pull off a B- without the teacher's suspicion.\n\nCons:\n_Where is my windowed mode? Man, TB is gonna freak the fuck out: Ya, for some reason you can't have windowed mode. You can have borderless though, so that's good. But for people who connects their PC to a TV, you'll have to play this game on  a huge resolution.\n_The leveling system: This is where the whole \"this game used to be on iPad\" thing showed its head. You \"level up\" by completing challenges, but you don't get anything from it, other than just some ingame coins. That is some IOS stuff right there. But no big deal. UPDATE: There's actually more than the leveling system than that, so scratch this off of the list of cons.\n_Voice acting is meh.\n\nOverall, you would like this game if:\n_You think IOS ports to PC can be done and are looking for some proof.\n_You think IOS ports to PC CAN'T be done and are looking to prove yourself wrong.\n_You like The Legend of Zelda games.\n\nIs this game worth $15: Yes. It's pretty good. Not in the GOTY sense, but it's very, very decent, borderline excellent for its price.\n\nSeriously, though, I can't believe this game is an IOS port...\n\nShameless plugs time!

Was it worth the wait? [b]YES[/b]. Graphically speaking it's just as amazing as the first time you may have played it. Adding 4k+ res, realtime AO, soft shadows, AA, higher draw distance and 60FPS support among other things. While the game played well with keyboard+mouse or controller, everything was completely rebindable.\n\nStaying true to the Zelda formula while keeping a charm of its own, you travel the between islands on your ship gradually piecing together the story. Each island has it's own distinct themes and challenges while some just serve as hub points for restocking and gathering new information about undiscovered locations. Progress will result in level ups which unlocked a range of upgrades including a peashooter for firing off your ship. Later stages traveling becomes quite dangerous so these extra defenses are critical.\n\nDungeons generally consist of simple puzzles and key finding while backtracking to unlock areas you were unable to access earlier. Select islands contain boss fights and victory often rewarded unique abilities which also helped with opening secret areas. While you do spend much of your time traveling to locations already seen it's not a problem at all, as you will also find many new npcs and sidequests along the way.\n\nOceanhorn is a little on the easy side but the beauty of the entire package completely out weighs the lack of challenge. The game does ramp up in the later stages and you'll need to learn different attack patterns of enemies to guarantee success. Already mentioned the graphics are very distinct, the closest game to the mark would be Lili: Child of Geos (another decent phone port). With a captivating story, relaxing soundtrack and a whole bunch content to discover. For the asking price it's well worth the investment.

The short answer would be \"Yes and No\"\nLet's get into it.\n\nThis is not the original launch of the game, first being released on iPad where it got good reviews. So first things first, how well was it ported to PC ?\nPlease keep in mind that my time with the game was through a pre-release version, that being said :\n\n-Frames locked at 60 max (Vsync on or off).\n-Vsync off will result in screen tearing.\n-Operates fine with mouse and Keyboard as-well with a controller.\n-Most of the keys are rebindable but not all. You can rebind the movement and action keys which are most important, but you can not rebind generic commands such as \"Pause\" , \"Menu\", Numeric for items (1,2,3,4) and you can not assign keyboard commands for mouse actions (attack, use item and turn camera). Overall i found this to be acceptable but not ideal.\n-No bugs, glitches, crashes or any issues from my time with the game\n-Decent graphics options for quality / resolution etc.\n\nThe developer claims that this was a huge overhaul and from my time with the game i found this to be true. So overall it's ok technically speaking. My only issue is with the frame lock and tearing, hopefully the dev will have this sorted soon. OR RIOT!!! :D\n\nNow that we are done with that on to the game!\n\nThe overall feel of Oceanhorn resembles the Zelda series, featuring a mute hero, a handful of magical artifacts that you will collect across very different environments in order to save the world!...what else ?... oh and find out what happened to your father!\n\nThe journey will take you from verdant landscapes to sun-scorched deserts to treacherous dungeons, all of these environments are beautifully crafted and never outstay their welcome.\nThe \"I am on a adventure!\" feeling is present throughout the game. A big part of that feeling is caused by the epic soundtrack which blends perfectly with your surroundings, never breaking the feeling and always adapting itself to the situation at hand. \n\nThe gameplay is rather stiff for a Action RPG and while it may be fine for ipad it's definitely sub-par for a PC title. This is a issue because from my point of view the actual combat-gameplay is the bread and butter for a game of this type. You start with a STICK for a weapon (yes a actual stick!) but you soon find your fathers sword and shield! You can block with said shield using shift and you can move around while holding block, but when you attack with your sword you are rooted in place, making for a bit of a frustrating experience when a enemy moves 5 pixels out of range you need to stop attacking, move and start attacking again.\n\nWhile you traverse Oceanhors worlds you will level up and unlock new items and abilities which will allow you to solve previously impassable puzzles. So if you are a completionist there is plenty of backtracking for you in Oceanhorn.\nSpeaking of puzzles...these are for the most part no-brainers, with the occasional brain teaser, i did not mind this to much as i never enjoyed being stuck on a puzzle but if you want something more complex you will have a hard time finding it here.\n\nWhat about the difficulty ? \nWell there is no hand-holding and the game rarely points you in the right direction.\nFor example, if you chose not to talk to all of the towns folk or read all the messages scattered across the land you will not get access to all the locations you can explore. A location will only unlock for you if someone tells you about it or you read about it somewhere.\nThe actual combat is not that challenging and you will have no problems dispatching creatures or learning a bosses patterns so you can counter it.\n\nLet's wrap this up...\nIf you are looking for a leisurely-paced enchanting adventure and you are not to fussy about combat then look no further. \nSure... it is not perfect and it may not be the embodiment of modern day ARPGs but it more then makes up for it in feel and style.\nOverall a good game at a very attractive price which i am happy to recommend!\nFor a clearer view on the actual game you can watch my first impressions video :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvJyt0Q7TWY&index=1&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK", "timestamp_created": 1426592445, "timestamp_updated": 1426594071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 256, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844010651111602783", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 938, "total_negative": 266, "total_reviews": 1204}, "cursors": {"AoJ4pKbik8wCfIj7OA==": "Thu Nov 23 23:04:30 2023", "AoJwgez0jfwCcNiW/QI=": "Thu Nov 23 23:18:51 2023"}}
