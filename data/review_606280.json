While the game delivers a thrilling action-RPG experience, it falls short of its full potential due to a few notable shortcomings.\n\nGraphics: A Visual Feast with Technical Hiccups\n\nDarksiders 3 boasts a captivating art style, with environments that range from desolate wastelands to towering demonic fortresses. Character designs are equally impressive, particularly Fury, who exudes both strength and grace. However, the game's technical performance can be inconsistent, with occasional frame rate drops and texture pop-in.\n\nSoundtrack: An Epic Score with Occasional Repetition\n\nThe soundtrack of Darksiders 3 is a powerful blend of orchestral and electronic music, perfectly capturing the game's epic scope and dark undertones. The main theme is particularly memorable, its soaring melodies and ominous harmonies setting the stage for Fury's journey. However, some tracks can become repetitive during extended gameplay sessions.\n\nStory Richness: A Tale of Redemption with Unfulfilled Potential\n\nDarksiders 3 delves deeper into the lore of the Darksiders universe, exploring themes of redemption, vengeance, and the struggle to maintain balance in a world teetering on the brink of chaos. Fury's journey is compelling, as she grapples with her own inner demons while fighting against the forces of evil. However, the game's narrative could have benefited from a more fleshed-out exploration of its themes and characters.\n\nGameplay: A Satisfying Challenge with Room for Refinement\n\nDarksiders 3 offers an engaging blend of combat and exploration. Fury's whip-based combat is fluid and dynamic, allowing for a variety of combos and attacks. The game also introduces new weapons and abilities, adding further depth to the combat system. Exploration is equally rewarding, as the environments are filled with hidden secrets and puzzles to uncover. However, the game's combat can become repetitive at times, and some platforming sections can be frustrating due to imprecise controls.\n\nOverall Impression: A Solid Action-RPG with Room for Growth\n\nDarksiders 3 delivers a thrilling and satisfying action-RPG experience, but it falls short of its full potential due to technical issues, occasional narrative shortcomings, and a combat system that could benefit from further refinement. Despite these flaws, the game's strengths in graphics, atmosphere, and gameplay make it a worthwhile experience for fans of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1700776397, "timestamp_updated": 1700776397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151390343": {"recommendationid": "151390343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120511098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 265, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 890, "playtime_at_review": 876, "last_played": 1700765771}, "language": "english", "review": "What an utter disappointment.\n\nCompared to the previous entries, this third installment only gives the player much better graphics and a new interesting way of combining elements of combat.

Very few new additions work, and even when they work, they work poorly. \n\nCombat has been extremely sped up, for no apparent reason. Doing one-on-one combat feels nice, but as soon as you are fighting two or more enemies at once, you characters becomes a pinball to be bounced around with. Fury, as the main protagonist does not gain any unique benefits to her character like War and Death from previous game had. \n\nThe campaign is much shorter than previous titles, with campaign lasting only around 13-14h (keep in mind that I did not rush the game in any way, and did explore a lot of optional areas and paths).\n\nBosses are again more gimmicky like the first game, while only a few require actual skill to battle, which was another disappointment. Enemies are almost (if not the) same as in previous game, with almost no new additions. \n\nMap looked like an interesting addition, or better yet a more open approach to gameplay, however, after a while you realize that most paths are needed to be traversed in order to do all main content, which makes side quests not that interesting and very easy to do. \n\nFury herself seemed like the worst written protagonist so far, She had so many random quotes that don`t match the room or situation in where she is, and a lot of times your character was locked into walking animation, just so she can talk about herself with the Watcher that was stalking her, seemingly only prolonging the game. \n\nOverall, 3/10.", "timestamp_created": 1700764931, "timestamp_updated": 1700764931, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150759846": {"recommendationid": "150759846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960454691", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1699151367}, "language": "english", "review": "Still a little rough around the edges, but much better than when it launched.

When I finally decided that the price is right I decided to give this one a go (I was not really getting a good first impression when I saw first gameplays).\n\nThis game is not a Darksiders, it's not a Dark Souls. It tries to be both and fails miserably at it. Fury is not a good character, she stays so low in the bar that even if you'd make Death an idiot he would still be better. That goes for all of the characters in this franshise. Levels are designed poorly. Fury's movement is a shitshow. Dodges does not give you anything aside from an opportunity to counter and that's just not punishing enough. You cant cancel animations and dodge so what you do is you attack, take damage, then dodge and then enemy attacks you immidietely and you cant dodge because you just dodged. Not to mention many enemies have animations of blobs who you just cant read in small corridors and thanks to an awful camera. The dark souls thing of levelling fails and is just not fun in a game where you should be slaughtering hordes of demons. Not to mention that Fury is just weak. There is no precision nor speed to her attacks. You may think that whip makes for a good crowd control and it does not. The camera is awful, obstructing view, the focus system which was in previous games is implemented poorly and does you more bad than good. Level design is what reminds you of a first game, but levels are just so hard to read.\n\nAs for technicalities the game crashes which causes you to lose a lot of progress simply because you cant save. The language also can switch for whatever reason.\n\nThis game is ahuge dissapointment and honestly a step back in the franchise. Luckily Darksiders Genesis was so much better with level designs, music, characters (Strife is awesome), gameplay and anything honestly. I just cant play this game anymore, it's frustrating and not fun.

It was rather short which is a shame but also allowed the game to pace well.\n\nStory started a bit rough with main character being not very likeable.

The user rating is really unfair in my opinion, this is a pretty nice and polished game, although not without flaws.\n\nIt's not really a souls-like either, there are only some superficial elements, like the \"bonfires\" you respawn at, the \"estus\" like healing, animation commitment (can be turned off via the \"classic\" mode, which I recommend). The game has a 2 weapon combat system, you fight with the whip + one of the 4 elemental weapons (dual chains/fire, spear/lightning, hammer/gravity and dual swords/ice), and there's also a chakram/glaive as your sole ranged option. The combat is much faster paced than Souls and there's a lot of combo potential, e.g. you can do Scorpion's \"get over here\" thing (from Mortal Kombat) to catch an enemy with your whip and then juggle them. You can also jump, stomp, do charged attacks, and there's even a Devil Trigger like super transformation.\n\nYou can't block and the dodge is just a short dodge step, no rolling. The only defensive option is the dodge counter a la Bayonetta/Oneechanbara. You dodge at the last second, the game slows down and you press one of the attack buttons to counter, which deals a lot of damage and has very satisfying animations. This also usually breaks the enemy's combo, thus making a lot of 1v1 fights quite easy. Just bait the first hit, then counter and go ham.\n\nHowever, the combat system shows its flaws when it comes to group fights. The game loves spamming large groups of fast enemies and even with the whip's wide, sweeping hitboxes it's still easy to get overwhelmed and chain stunlocked, as you can't really dodge counter when surrounded by multiple enemies, so you kind of just pull back and mash. The camera is not the best either, it's too low when locked on, with Fury partially obscuring the opponent.\n\nThe enemies hit hard and it's possible to get 2 shot, especially early on when you're low level and don't have any upgrades, however the game offers a plethora of difficulty options to accommodate all skill levels (but none of them will let you just button mash through the game, you still have to counter). I recommend playing on balanced (aka normal) + classic mode (you can dodge cancel your attacks).\n\nThere are a lot of boss fights, but none of them are too hard, except for maybe [spoiler]Lust[/spoiler] who's a double boss fight very similar to Ornstein & Smough in Dark Souls, as well as the last boss in the Void Keepers DLC who's a little overtuned.\n\nThe game is set in a large interconnected world with no loading screens and numerous shortcuts and secrets to find, and you can tackle the areas and bosses in a non-linear fashion. There are also metroidvania elements, you unlock 4 elemental powers and each comes with multiple new movement abilities (e.g. high jump, wall jump, gliding, walking on water etc). There's a fair amount of platforming and even some puzzles (although nothing too crazy). The game has no map and you're thrown in with no guidance or handholding, which I found really refreshing and fun. The exploration is excellent, you pick a direction, drop down a hole, and can end up somewhere really cool.\n\nWhile the game is not AAA, the graphics are quite pretty, and the animations are very smooth. The cutscenes are very cinematic and the voice acting is solid. The game runs on Unreal Engine 4 and I haven't encountered any bugs or issues (aside from the missing texture for a shipping container, which you can fix using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/darksiders3/mods/25]this mod[/url], apparently the texture got lost in one of the updates).\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of challenging action games and metroidvania like exploration with no guidance, Darksiders III is lots of fun and an easy recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1699660914, "timestamp_updated": 1699691474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

At least the bosses. They're modeled after the seven deadly sins, but they were done in such an original way that I remember all of them very clearly even years later. I had never seen the sins designed like that (excpect maybe Wrath) so it's really something I want to point out.\n\nGameplay-wise, I found it less forgiving that the first Darksiders. Saves are few and far between, and enemies hit hard. Combat was much less focused on puzzles and unique mechanics than the first game, replacing it with learning boss patterns. (I have seen this game described as a Souls-lite, but if a casual gamer like I was at the time can beat it without help, it's not THAT hard.)\n\nThe puzzle parts were more about using Fury's different forms to traverse the environment. So while there are puzzles in the game, they are less present than in the first game and it's a shame.\n\nCombat however was as satisfying as in the first game. Fury feels powerful and savage and it was a pleasure to kill everything that stood in her way.\n\nThe plot was a bit confusing and there are things I did not understand, but all in all I was satisfied with how the story ended and how Fury's character evolved.\n\nI definitely recommend this game !

It's not the best game in the franchise, but definitely playable.\n\nThere are bugs here and there, such as falling through the floor, the game freezing as though it has crashed during loading sections, and very sudden performance issues that happen rarely, but are easily fixed by just restarting the game.\n\nSome boss fights are great, others not so much. Most of the bosses don't have the greatest of character designs, and their personalities are fairly one-dimensional, but the same goes for Fury, no matter how hard the script tries to convince you of her character growth.\n\nYou are massively rewarded, for the most part, for dodging enemy blows and projectiles via the arcane counter mechanic. Even on Apocalyptic (I am assuming the same applies for Reckoning), you are able to steamroll through the entire game by dodging attacks into arcane counters, or \"parries\", for massive damage, as long as you've been investing your stat points into Arcane. HOWEVER, dodging can be inconsistent, as the window for a perfect dodge during attack animations, at least according to my own observations, can vary massively from one mob to another -- bosses, on the other hand, are fairly straightforward, as they all attack at consistent enough speeds, and some also have explicit cues that tell you there is going to be an opening for a perfect dodge into arcane counter.\n\nIMHO, I don't think the Souls-inspired gameplay was the best direction for Darksiders III, as the other Darksiders games are very casual-friendly and not too difficult to beat, whereas this one has one too many moments where you just want to uninstall the game. In spite of that, this new-to-the-series difficulty curve can be enjoyed, as long as you have the time to invest.\n\nStory-wise, I believe that this game can be skipped entirely, because it doesn't expand on the Darksiders story all that much. The only important plot threads are, 1. Fury coming to the same conclusions as War; and 2. the not-so-explicit confirmation that the overarching antagonist from Genesis is the same being who is, to a large extent, responsible for the majority of the events in the Darksiders universe. With that said, it is still somewhat enjoyable to play through the story for the first time, if you're a fan of the series. \n\nNot bad, not great, buy on sale only.", "timestamp_created": 1698917673, "timestamp_updated": 1698917673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149201847": {"recommendationid": "149201847", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987911254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 1847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1847, "last_played": 1698534274}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La saga de  Darksiders  se caracteriza por que en cada entrega sus mec\u00e1nicas principales cambian bastante , pero mantiene su esencia y en  esta tercera parte no es la excepci\u00f3n  , si bien en la primera vimos un HACK AND SLASH puro,  en la  segunda vinos  la implementaci\u00f3n de elementos de Rol , y esta tercera vemos elementos de un Souls, que le quedaron  de maravilla ,  eso si el juego se siente  con menos presupuesto para su desarrollo,  que sus anteriores entregas (algo l\u00f3gico por toda la  restructuraci\u00f3n que ha presentado THQ ) , elementos como el \u00e1rbol de habilidades, el mapa ,   el mundo se mi abierto que vimos en anteriores entregas ,  no existe en este entrega , pero supieron   hacer un Darksiders y un buen juego ,  con lo recursos que le dieron , que para m\u00ed   no est\u00e1 a la altura de la primera entrega ni la segunda , pero que gracias a sus nuevas mec\u00e1nicas , desafiantes Jefes  acompa\u00f1ado de un buen apartado t\u00e9cnico , hace que este juego sea muy recomendable.\nAhora  qu\u00e9 sigue? , pues aprovechando que gracias a Darksiders Genesis, unos de sus  protagonista fue lucha ,   me encantar\u00eda una 4 parte donde el jugador tuviera la oportunidad de jugar con los  4 jinetes, respetando sus habilidades y el estilo de lucha de cada uno, en una aventura \u00e9pica!!!

Darksiders 3 is a return to form after what I considered to be a weaker entry in the second game.  I enjoyed the game... but there are some pretty glaring flaws that prevent this from being a great game. Let me elaborate...\n\nI'll start with the minor stuff first.  The power ups/potions (outside of healing) are essentially useless/pointless.  I barely used them across two play throughs.  But by far the biggest issue here is that the interface is too clunky to make using them in combat viable.  You don't have time to scroll to find the one you want.  The game would have been better served by having fewer potions and combining the effects and then binding each of them to a direction on the d-pad or giving the play the option to choose which potion was bound to each direction.  Anyway, the point being that it's clunky and it doesn't really work but it can also be ignored (at least on easier difficulties).\n\nThere's some unnecessary inventory management required.  This is a minor thing and it didn't bother me that much but why have a section where the only purpose is to go in there and \"release\" the souls for use?  Well, it actually does make some sense.  If you die, you lose the souls you have collected but you can return to the spot you died and recover them.  So in that context, having a collection of stored souls that can't be lost *does* make sense.  But it seems a like a system that didn't need to exist.  Just make it so you don't lose souls and add those caches to your total souls. \n\nThe weapons were fine and I found myself using most of the base weapons in different scenarios.  However, the DLC weapons didn't seem unique enough to warrant bothering with.\n\nSimilarly, there's too many different types of armour in the game, and each buffs a specific type of damage attached to a weapon.  This is kinda clunky because if I want to ensure that I'm not gimping my damage output I need to pick a type of armour and then not switch weapons mid fight... unless I want to pause the game, and equip the armour that buffs that weapons.  You can see the problem.  \n\nStill it didn't stop me switching between weapons in combat but it would have been better if there was just one armour that upgraded to add the buffs for each weapon damage.\n\nThere are no maps of any kind in this game and the fast travel system is confusing (possibly because of this).  I've read that this was a deliberate design decision because the developers wanted players to feel lost.  They achieved their goal... and I hated it.  Especially on the second play through where by that time I'd had a decent idea of the places I wanted to visit, but I had trouble extrapolating which fast travel point was the best or quickest to get me there.  It's even more confusing when there are many shortcuts and connections to different zones/areas.  \n\nThey obviously noted this because they have tried to incorporate little quality of life tweaks to make it easier.  For example there are markers to the last place you travelled to/from but it's not enough.  They also give you a compass which points you in the direction of the bosses but I didn't use this at all.\n\nThis is even more annoying when you factor in that the game wants you to revisit previous areas to find secrets and spots made accessible by new abilities.  All in all, they could have saved themselves (and us) a lot of headaches by just implementing maps.\n\nThe dodge mechanic.  I played through on Balanced Difficulty with Classic mode turned on and for the first third of the game I pretty much ignored the mechanic completely.  There's nothing bad about that.  I just prefer it when Darksiders game play embraces it's Hash and Slash roots and I enjoy that.  \n\nHowever, through out the middle of the game, the bosses become more difficult and I found that I had to start trying to mitigate the damage coming in by dodging.  That's when the frustrations begin.  The problem is - it just doesn't feel good.  If I did a perfectly timed dodge to allow a counter attack, it felt more like luck or a fluke.  I did eventually get better at it but I think it took way too long.  It also seemed off that often the toughest enemies in the game weren't the bosses.\n\nIn late game, you start seeing a lot more \"mobs\" that block.  Combat becomes tedious at this point and after awhile I started running past them because it wasn't worth the time or effort to kill them.\n\nAnd this brings me to the single biggest problem in the game.  One that had me raging so much on so many occasions that I began to understand why controllers end up embedded in tv's/monitors... the response time or lack of response when attempting to trigger a heal or a special ability.  This drove me absolutely insane.  I'd be mid fight and notice I'm getting low on health.  Press up on the d-pad and continue fighting.  Next thing I know I'm dead. What?! This happened a few times before I noticed that the game was not responding to what I was doing.  In my second play through almost all my deaths were because I died before I noticed that a health power up hadn't worked.  I had similar issues with Wrath and Havoc mode.  \n\nI don't think there's any excuse for this problem and if you've going to make a souls-like game when the play is trying to do something, that thing should happen the first time you do it, every time you do it.\n\nAnyway, as I said at the start, if you take away all these problems the game could have been great instead of just good.  I think this is a game where less would have actually been more.  As shown above, over and over, they built convoluted and/or unnecessary systems where a simple one actually would have served the game better.\n\nI loved the story, the tone, the aesthetic and just generally that I was once again playing as a horseman (which is super cool) so this concept has legs.  I wasn't sure about Fury as a character to begin with but by the end she had grown on me.  It says something about the game that I played through it a second time (something I never do these days) despite all the flaws I've mentioned (and some I haven't).  \n\nThe music is understated but well done.  The voice acting was fine.  At times, I found myself getting confused about who was speaking (Fury or the Watcher), but not a big thing.  \n\nI absolutely loved the ending.... and I'm hoping that THQ continues the story with a stand-alone game involving Strife or a final game to bring the series to a conclusion with all horseman being playable.

Jumped straight into 3 as soon as I upgraded my PC this year, and I'm having a blast 100% it! The Horseman - Fury is yet another cool as hell protagonist, the comic art style and animation are a feast to the eyes just like any previous Darksiders game.\n\nThe game world is well-crafted and it was fun to traverse & explore with Fury's different unique form (Gotta map the run button to an easy click though, I used one of my mouse's side button). Combats are engaging & mostly fun, that is once you get the hang of it I guess, I personally am not too bothered by the mixture of Souls-like elements, it is an acceptable change to the series for me as I feel not all Horsemen have to rely on the same fighting style, Fury being more focused in dodging, utilizing mid & wide-range attack with her whip and no block feels right since she's less \"bulky\" than the other Horsemen. Story is great too and is a continuation to the series (though it kinda cliff-hanged at the end...).\n\nThe one and only thing I frankly dislike is the brutal 'difficulty' at the EARLIER stage of the game, it sadly, does make me feel as though it is more or less 'artificial'... Playing through the entire game makes me realize the pacing curve and balance are really not too well done. Let me try to elaborate - firstly, the creeps at the earlier stage are strangely, VERY aggressive and quick, coupled with their immensely painful damage, Fury can die in just a few quick hits (and they also tend to gank you, plus you can hardly outrun to escape from them..) so it's pretty frustrating while you are still learning the combat, it leave you no room to breathe (and Heal), unlike many other games where they would normally start slow and introduce you weaker enemies at the beginning. And then as the game progress.. More enemies variant that actually attack SLOWER appears, those that are actually less painful to dealt with as you have more reaction window to time your dodge and heal... Odd isn't it..? Also, due to many enemies & bosses that could outright kill Fury in a few hits, DEFENSE are probably the most important stats in the game.. But it was almost non-existence at the earlier stage. The tide only turns once you proceeded pass the game where you can obtain and upgrade the Enhancement that boost your Physical & Arcane defense, then only the game become MUCH MORE tolerable, much much less frustrating stupid death moments due to minor mistakes. The difference gap is so huge it makes me feel like it wasn't really balanced properly, and that is also probably why many players rage quitted the game and calling it \"not\" Darksiders; I blame it on the bad difficulty curve really.\n\nOh and I was also baffled by how on earth they don't allow free \"Heals\" refill at save point, kinda stupid since dying can refill all heals for free..? lol Why would we even pay to buy the \"refill\" (unless you are a masochist that would play on Nightmare mode)? This again, contributed to the lack of breathing room while you are starting out and still learning the game...\n\nUgh anyway, rant over and overall I would say it is still a great game at it's core, definitely worth a playthrough if you like combat-heavy action RPG (with a bit of puzzle and platforming).

And that's why a lot of people give this game a bad rep. But after finishing it, I disagree on the notion that this is a bad game, since \"It's not a darksiders game!\" argument holds little weight when this franchise never really had a concrete identity in terms of gameplay style and mechanics, that were 100% its own. \n\nNow then, the biggest change arguably comes to combat. If you're familiar with Dark Souls, Darksiders 3 follows a similar combat style, with perfect dodges being rewarded with even better counters that do more damage and so on and so forth. If you come into this game from the first 2, without any Souls-like experience, you might find it frustrating at first. Fortunately, the devs listened and added a \"classic\" combat style for those who preferred the more hack-and-slash nuance from D1 and D2, so it's your choice which combat you go with. Still, the option being there is nice. \n\nDarksiders 3 also seems to combine bits and pieces from D1 and D2 when it comes to gear progression. You have some form of skill points to invest, though there's no actual talent tree like Death had. The gear itself is gathered by playing the story like in D1, but upgrading it requires materials that are scattered throughout the world. So they don't get stronger just by using them like in D1. I find this balance to be sufficient to be enjoyable without becoming a chore. You can go through the game on any difficulty with upgrading at a normal pace, i'd say. So i never really felt like I suddenly hit a wall. I will say though that the game encourages you to replay it several times, as it gets even harder but with different enemies and loot in the world, so they're really in it for the long run, if you want to max out Fury. The bosses are way more fun mechanically than in D2, simply due to the fact that in D3 the cycle of dodge-and-counter is baked into the core combat system now, which makes it seem less tedious, especially since bosses don't rely on adds anymore. And the combos between the main and secondary weapons flow really well. Overall, even though many hated it for being different, the combat of Darksiders 3 is quite nuanced and deep in my eyes, so it's good enough to be enjoyable. I do miss executions however, and i'll get to that.\n\nTraversal has taken a bit of a hit, due to the nature of a souls-like game. They're not exactly known for parkour sections. That's not to say there's none. Fury is quite agile, able to swing with her whip for example, but I do think she has less options than her brothers, who run across the wall and hang on pillars. The game also never really challenges traversal that much, i think, until the Keepers of Void DLC, but that's fine. Because what Darksiders 3 has over 1 and 2 is the sense of vertical exploration. This map is probably the one who allows to travel you the highest in terms of height for exploration purposes. That comes at the cost of a smaller and closed off overall area compared to something like 2, but i think it worked for the better, considering the circumstances of this game, since we might have never gotten it at all. That being said, many areas can be entered only after progressing further in the story to get a tool/power, so it's encouraged to return. Keep in mind you don't get a map anymore, so better unlock all the Serpent Hole fast travels.\n\nPuzzles are unfortunately, very easy compared to the previous entries. Some probably prefer it that way, but I still felt somewhat empty that nothing in the game really came close to something like the dungeons of the Forgelands, let alone the Ivory Citadel in D2. Alas, not all aspects can be comparable. Not even the dlc puzzles are that challenging to be honest.\n\nSpeaking of DLCs, they're fine. As good as the ones for D2 (that were later included in the remaster). I especially like the Crucible for convenience, since there's a lot of cool items you can get from it that helps in regular game. The keepers of void is more about dungeon crawling, but [spoiler] if you want the abyssal armor, you need to get this [/spoiler].\n\nLastly, Fury herself. In the beginning, I really thought I'd hate her character, especially how she's so full of herself at first. However, the story manages to make her a likable protagonist for this franchise. It's not a ground breaking story by any means, but it's enjoyable and fits the franchise theme. At the time of release for this game, I'd say Fury was a better character than War, since she got way more personality (Still pales compared to Death), but after Genesis, they rank about the same. The dialogue with Strife really elevated War's character.\n\nOne gripe i have with this game. Granted, it's something more cinematic related than gameplay. It's that Fury doesn't really seem as visceral as War or Death, which seemed odd considering her personality when she starts the game. Remember how each boss defeated in D1 and D2 had War and Death execute them in a flashy cinematic with signature moves and such? You don't really get that here, and it's a shame. I would have loved to see Fury pull something like that off. The closest thing we get are the perfect counters on fodder enemies, but even then, they're not the same as the executions in the previous games.\n\nAlso, if you play this game on a 16:10 aspect ratio or a big resolution in general, you might encounter a bit of a problem where the game screen is very zoomed out. Just fiddle with the settings a bit, and after a few restarts it should be fine. I have encountered a few crashes at certain points, but nothing too bad to make me consider quitting (Like the Kingdom of the Dead in D2). \n\nOverall, If you love this franchise, I recommend this game wholeheartedly, with both its ups and downs. And throw out the notion of \"Darksiders games aren't like X or Y\" and just enjoy it. Because Darksiders was never a strict formula, it was always a constantly evolving franchise. So not being the same isn't in any way a valid critic to this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1690792861, "timestamp_updated": 1690792861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143053787": {"recommendationid": "143053787", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963375232", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 816, "last_played": 1690680049}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the embodiment of mediocrity. The gameplay, which is heavily dependent on combat, falls short in its experience. The lack of action canceling to dodge on command with a game that has a perfect dodge mechanic is a frustrating experience.

This can be fine in some games, but this is an action RPG hack-and-slash, and it has no place here.

When I first researched about a map, this game USE to have a mini map but was later removed in patch because the devs \"felt they wanted to encourage exploring.\"  I LOVE exploring, but I also don't want to be lost wasting precious game time, hours, and the like back tracking only to \"feel\" that I'm in the right spot. Having no map was the deal breaker for me.\n\nThis isn't like the previous Dark Siders, if you're looking for that here, you won't find it.

At this point the pattern is clear - the developers are more interested in mimicking other games than really finding a voice of their own. They got lucky with 1, overconfident with 2, and 3 proves they're just being lazy.\n\nThis time around the gameplay is cribbing Dark Souls - and that's according to the developer. The combat returns to hack and slash mechanics but the souls influence means damage is volatile. The game wants you to make use of evades and counters which do more damage, but enemies also have large HP pools so every fight turns into a slow slog. \n\nIf you try to combo enemies block so you're stuck in the position of playing this anger fuelled character who can't be pro-active in combat and you get punished for trying. This also means Fury comes off as strangely weak and fragile, and don't get me started on the contradictions in her development. Speaking of the story, it ends up being even more filler that throws empty twists and needless turns in that make no sense.\n\nAs for gameplay there are a few weapons but none of them are better than the whip so expect to use that the entire time. Most of the movement has been stripped out besides swinging with the whip (what a cop out). The power ups are now just 4 elements each of which let you solve one or two types of puzzle and each puzzle is the same every time. Every environment is the same usual brown, green, and grey boring setting from the past game, as all the colour is now in Fury's hair.\n\nI gave up on this one around the time you get to the scar. It's such a boring and slow paced game that I truly lost any interest in the conclusion. The only message at the core of this game is mixed messaging and trying to create something without having to actually put anything unique in themselves.

You could say that this was to distance itself from that cartoony style which kinda was more at home in the game battle chasers, but I think that style added to the comic book feel the other games kinda danced around with. The environments look good its just they feel very flat with that art style departure. As I said, the game is fine, but it falls short to me in a way that just makes me want to play Darksiders 1 or 2.", "timestamp_created": 1689588355, "timestamp_updated": 1689588355, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142177290": {"recommendationid": "142177290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198854251747", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1997, "last_played": 1689852018}, "language": "spanish", "review": "me gusta mucho", "timestamp_created": 1689483520, "timestamp_updated": 1689483520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142176414": {"recommendationid": "142176414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425654531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1389, "last_played": 1689481201}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gran juego, ojala salga la ultima parte", "timestamp_created": 1689482138, "timestamp_updated": 1689482138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142167485": {"recommendationid": "142167485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868920198", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1071, "last_played": 1692587727}, "language": "spanish", "review": "TREMENDO JUEGO.", "timestamp_created": 1689469061, "timestamp_updated": 1689469061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142162049": {"recommendationid": "142162049", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986366676", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1699582436}, "language": "english", "review": "darksiders?

Esto viene porque en el Darksiders 1 me pareci\u00f3 bastante profundo el esquema de control para los combates, teniendo una buena cantidad de combos desbloqueables mediante puntos, cosa que ya se perdi\u00f3 en el Darksiders 2 pero si que ten\u00eda esa interacci\u00f3n de combos entre la guada\u00f1a y el arma secundaria equipada, sin embargo en este Darksiders 3 no tiene eso. Sin embargo, conforme fui avanzando en la aventura vi que esa simpleza a la hora de ejecutar combos se deb\u00eda a que el foco en el combate hay que ponerlo en otro sitio: La esquiva perfecta e incluso el contraataque tras la esquiva (una especie de parry). \n\nEste juego castiga bastante los errores, sin haber jugado a\u00fan en profundidad a la saga souls me atrever\u00eda a decir que bebe bastante de ella, salvando las distancias ya que no hay barra de energ\u00eda y podemos hacer tanto esquivas como ataques infinitos, sin embargo de lo que si ha tomado inspiraci\u00f3n de dicha saga es en la observaci\u00f3n del timing en los ataques de los enemigos, aprender a esquivarlos correctamente y despu\u00e9s atacar. En las dificultades bajas los enemigos ya pegan bastante duro e incluso los enemigos m\u00e1s d\u00e9biles pueden suponer un problema si te pillan con la guardia baja.\n\nEsta dureza en el combate es lo que me ha atrapado finalmente, de hecho comenc\u00e9 a hacerme una build a fuerza ya que los ataques principales es lo que m\u00e1s se utiliza durante la aventura, y por lo tanto ser\u00eda la opci\u00f3n m\u00e1s equilibrada si queremos progresar en el juego. Pero me encant\u00f3 ese riesgo-recompensa del parry, y por primera vez en la saga me he decantado por el estilo Arcano, donde se potencian los ataques cargados, ataques de esquiva y ataques especiales. Quise jugar buscando no s\u00f3lo esquivar para evitar el da\u00f1o, sino esquivar en el momento exacto previo a recibir el impacto para poder aprovecharme de este mayor da\u00f1o que me brinda esta especie de \"contraataque\". Equipando las mejoras de da\u00f1o arcano a las dagas de fuego (mi elemento favorito al jugar con Furia), mejorando su nivel en la forja de Ulthane Martillonegro y todo ello junto los talentos fuertemente hacia arcano, he llegado a hacer m\u00e1s de 1000 puntos de da\u00f1o tras una esquiva, m\u00e1s luego la quemadura que va desgastando lentamente la vida del enemigo.\n\nSin embargo como dec\u00eda antes, no es un juego f\u00e1cil. Mientras que otros Darksiders he podido jugarlos en dificultad apocal\u00edptica (si no me equivoco es el pen\u00faltimo modo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil), aqu\u00ed sin embargo he tenido que jugar en Exigente e incluso a veces bajarlo a Equilibrado (esto s\u00f3lo me pas\u00f3 en un tramo hacia el final del juego donde por un error muy tonto, mor\u00ed hasta 2 veces, siendo una zona sin apenas puntos de guardado respecto al resto de la aventura, y con una gran cantidad de enemigos bastante duros por el camino y en grupos grandes). El tema de la dificultad no es una constante a la hora de jugar a los t\u00edtulos, en la gran mayor\u00eda de los que me causan frustraci\u00f3n o s\u00f3lo quiero avanzar para poder terminarlos (si, ese es un problema que s\u00e9 que tengo, el querer terminar todos los juegos que empiezo), los acabo jugando a m\u00ednima dificultad, para que no me supongan un mayor quebradero de cabeza. En cambio en juegos r\u00e1pidos tipo hack and slash, acci\u00f3n o plataformas, me gusta ese puntito de exigencia que le dan ese picante al juego, y me hace disfrutarlo m\u00e1s.\n\nEl problema es que en este Darksiders 3 (al igual que el resto de la saga), la dificultad simplemente es subir la barra de vida de los enemigos y hacer que sus ataques hagan m\u00e1s da\u00f1o, dandote un menor n\u00famero de oportunidades de error, y cuando es de esta manera tampoco me hace disfrutarlo bien. Por eso, entre Exigente y Equilibrado me sent\u00ed bastante a gusto, teniendo las oportunidades de error en un valor bajo pero sin ser excesivamente bajo para evitar la frustraci\u00f3n y la repetici\u00f3n excesiva.\n\nTengo que decir que me ha gustado bastante m\u00e1s que Darksiders 2, y se pone pr\u00e1cticamente a la par que el primer Darksiders, siendo bastante diferentes el uno del otro pero siendo muy buenos cada uno en lo suyo.\n\nEntrando a analizar un poco m\u00e1s el resto de apartados del juego, se nota un gran salto gr\u00e1fico y el trabajo que se ha realizado a nivel t\u00e9cnico, jug\u00e1ndolo ahora casi 6 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su lanzamiento, en una Steam Deck proyectada hacia una pantalla de 70\" (eso s\u00ed, con interpolaci\u00f3n), hay que decir que se ve\u00eda muy espectacular en todo momento, aunque con alguna rascadita de FPS.\n\nLa historia me ha parecido muy muy buena, la del primer Darksiders me gustaba mucho la premisa que ten\u00eda, pero la de este Darksiders 3 creo que me gusta incluso m\u00e1s, adem\u00e1s que al final del juego tiene un buen cierre, dando a Furia un nuevo prop\u00f3sito como protectora de los pocos supervivientes de la raza humana. Sin embargo el personaje de Furia, aunque consigue transmitir la energ\u00eda y rabia propios de un personaje de este tipo, tengo que decir que a veces me chirriaron los di\u00e1logos que tienen ella y la vigilante (se ve\u00eda a leguas que era la mala, aunque no supuse que fuera uno de los pecados capitales) o incluso ella sola hablando del resto de los jinetes, con comentarios no se si tirando a infantiles, o intentando hacer bromas y chascarrillos que ni hacen gracia ni le pegan al personaje.\n\nDe la m\u00fasica, no me ha parecido tan memorable en general como en las otras entregas, pero si tengo que hacer especial menci\u00f3n a la m\u00fasica que suena al iniciar la conversaci\u00f3n con Ulthane, mientras realizas las mejoras a las armas. Esa zona de Refugio, es un remanso de paz rodeado de un mundo apocal\u00edptico y repleto de enemigos, y esta m\u00fasica lo transmite muy pero que muy bien, a veces me he quedado en el men\u00fa de la forja simplemente para poder escuchar la composici\u00f3n de forma extendida.\n\nEs una pena que parezca que la saga Darksiders est\u00e9 muriendo. Me gustar\u00eda jugar a Darksiders G\u00e9nesis, que es el que me queda por jugar de la saga principal, pero cambia el tipo de juego a un Hack and Slash de vista isom\u00e9trica en lugar de en tercera persona (no por desmerecer estos juegos, sino porque cambia completamente respecto a lo que ven\u00eda siendo la saga), adem\u00e1s que es una precuela del primer Darksiders y a m\u00ed lo que me gustar\u00eda es poder controlar a Lucha en un Darksiders 4, con un esquema de control cl\u00e1sico y una historia potente, que de un buen cierre a la saga.

As someone who has played the previous games, this one is on par in quality with them. \n\nStory follows the 3rd horseman, Fury, this time. Fury starts off as an unlikable douchebag at the beginning. She needlessly angry, self centered, without self control, rude etc. However, she's constantly berated for her personality by tons of people. As the game progresses, she goes through a journey and becomes a significantly better person. I can easily say that I loved her character arc and she became my favorite horseman by the end. If her personality annoys the hell out of you in the beginning, just now that it is intentional. Story is signiicantly better than 2's \"do fetch quests until the credits\" style with Fury actively pursuing the Seven Deadly Sins and learning more about the apocalypse on the way.\n\nGameplay is slower than its predecessors. People call it \"soulslike\" but I disaggree with the sentiment. There is no stamina, you don't get healed/potions from save points(you get potion uses from enemies, just like how they dropped health in previous Darksiders games) and using save points don't spawn enemies like soulslike games. Only common points I can say is dropping your experience when you die. However, if you die several more times afterwards, your exp points don't disappear and you can still claim it no  matter how many times you die. You can even have several dropped exps in different points of the map. Game also has stuff like arcane counters (counters caused by dodging at the right time, similar to Bayonetta's witch time), tons of platforming and verticality (where you get powers to open up new paths like a metroidvania) and a literal devil trigger/transformation. As someone who's kind of experienced in soulslikes, this doesn't feel like a soulslike to me, but I like the differences it has compared to a soulslike.\n\nSadly, you can occasionally feel the lowness of the budget in several places. There are 2 types of cutscenes, and the one using in game engine has extremely stiff models. You might also encounter some bugs (died twice due to my character getting stuck randomly while t-posing). There are also some stuttering, mostly when you're chanhging regions. I've had my game stutter like 10 times during the playthrough (and those stutters last for several seconds).\n\nOverall this was a really pleasant experience for me after seeing some negativity about this entry. If you are a Darksiders fan, this is a game you don't want to miss out. If you are a newcomer looking for an action game, starting with this entry is an acceptable choice.

Today we\u2019ll be looking at \u201cDarksiders 3\u201d an action / adventure game that continues the Four Horsemen\u2019s story of the concluded Apocalypse.  I absolutely loved the first two games and finally got around to playing Fury\u2019s part in the story.  This game is a bit old however, so does it hold up?  Let\u2019s Discuss!\n\nHell Hath No Fury:  Although the game is a few years old it does hold up very well, the stylized graphics could be considered \u2018timeless\u2019 though there are hints of outdated visuals occasionally.  The audio effects and music are great as well but the real reason anyone plays this is the gameplay loop.  There is a bit of a hybrid of action / adventure in the vein of Zelda but also the challenging and timing oriented combat similar to the Souls series.  In many ways you could say this game plays more like a casual souls game, less crushing difficulty and more story focus.  The leveling system is basic, as the overall combat system but the easy to learn attack chain and dodge while learning different enemies patterns are still there; albeit not as heavy as a typical Souls game.\n\nIt\u2019s Edge lady to You:  For me this game is a great balance of challenging but not brutal combat and immersive story that I have enjoyed since the original, I just wish there was more.  Not only did I find myself just killing enemies for hours (the crucible is great for this) but I also found myself constantly exploring just to see more of the world.  To make matters even better, this game has a water level\u2026but it actually isn\u2019t a nightmare to play through!\n\nBut, Mistress:  The game has some frustrating elements, specifically a tornado area and the occasional ledge that doesn\u2019t seem to grab and one could easily argue that the game could use a bit more story.  The one big issue I have is the saving system, it is very inconsistent; I loss about two hours of play one time because it always seemed that the game saved whenever you went to the vender but one time it didn\u2019t and I had to play through about half a level of content.  This isn\u2019t a huge issue as long as you are sure to check for the saving icon before you think about ending your session.  The game did freeze up a few times for me to but this probably had more to do with the fact that I tend to tab out occasionally to do other things though.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game with light RPG, platforming and puzzle mechanics and remains true to the \u2018Zelda like\u2019 gameplay of the first two.  If you like the more open world action adventure style but with a bit more difficulty inspired by the Souls games then I\u2019d highly recommend this, Enjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1688087232, "timestamp_updated": 1688087253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526213169097900391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140872654": {"recommendationid": "140872654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028004269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_at_review": 2088, "last_played": 1699903173}, "language": "english", "review": "It hits that sweet spot between the action mechanics being engaging, and the Equipment side of it, being deep but not to deep.", "timestamp_created": 1687990021, "timestamp_updated": 1687990021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140844485": {"recommendationid": "140844485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822617902", "num_games_owned": 827, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 8836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8836, "last_played": 1686191525}, "language": "english", "review": "Really liked this game, one of my favorites. I think almost all the negative reviews are due to missed expectations - the gameplay has nothing to do with the previous Darksiders games, and instead resembles Dark Souls.\n\nHowever, it's missing some very frustrating aspects of souls-likes:\n- You don't lose souls (souls are dropped when you die, but you can pick them up after as many deaths as you like. kinda weird to lose them in the first place). An exception is the final boss battle - wish I knew this before going into it.\n- You can pause or quit the game any time.\n- There are checkpoints right next to most of the bosses. A couple are pretty far, but those bosses are not the hardest ones. So you don't spend most of the game running from a checkpoint between boss tries.\n\nI played the whole thing on the hardest difficulty (Reckoning) and it was a blast. Some very satisfying moments when you learn all the boss' attack patterns and after many tries finally beat him (almost) flawlessly. I didn't get bored at all until after NG+ (btw, there is NG+9 if you absolutely love the game). Other notes:\n\n- The world is beautiful and interconnected.\n- Story is okay, not worse than previous Darksiders games; there is even some character development.\n- Music is good.\n- Hard to forget the main villains because you already know them (the Seven Deadly Sins)\n- Feeling of character progression. Every upgrade matters, things like +20% health might go unnoticeable in some other games, but here it's a game changer (again, might be specific to Reckoning difficulty)\n- The DLCs are a mixed bag - I liked Keepers of the Void (especially the final boss), but not the Crucible (used my potions to complete it as quick as possible and never touch again).\n- My only real grudge is a bug with not saving progress. I lost 2+ hours of progress because of that. As far as I know though, it only happens in a specific place ([spoiler] if you die during the Angelic Champion fight [/spoiler]), so you just need to reload the game when you do that.\n\nAll in all, should definitely try if you like souls-like, but want a more forgiving game.

I think 1 was great but for me 2 did everything better, the world, the combat, the puzzles, it all just worked in a wonderful manner. That being said, unfortunately I did not enjoy 3. By the end I got really bored and frustrated at the same time, I had to look up some puzzle solutions (shame on me) and I just wanted the story to end.[list][/list]\n[list][/list]\nTL;DR: It was a massive downgrade from Darksiders 2 for me, the main character's arc was great and I liked some aspects of the world, but I think the combat was way too repetitive and boring, the puzzles had very simplistic mechanics with unintuitive solutions for me and I felt the story's conclusion was very disappointing.[list][/list]\n[list][/list]\nI'll start with what I enjoyed:[list][/list]\n- Fury: The main character was great, I really enjoyed her arc. She started from a really annoying character and has gone through a satisfying journey, concluding in a completely different world view. It was understandable, you could see what actions affected her, how she changed throughout the events and eventually her final actions made complete sense. I was really surprised how much I liked her by the end as I couldn\u2019t imagine that at the start.[list][/list]\n- World Design/Graphics: I think the world was ok, nothing spectacular (the locations in 2 were so much more interesting) but for me the graphics did all the heavy lifting. Although the places themselves weren't that interesting, but at least they looked very pretty. Also, the effects were a definite upgrade from 2. I love the art style of 2 but I think it looked a little bit better here.[list][/list]\n- Bosses: The boss mechanics, fighting methods and designs were all very interesting. It wasn't that much fun for me fighting them, but that's on the combat (more on that later), but the overall look and what they offer skill wise were pretty good. I was looking forward to see what each sin looks like, how they attack and how they interact with Fury.[list][/list]\n[list][/list]\nUnfortunately, unto the negatives now:[list][/list]\n- Combat: I don't understand why they had to go this way. Why swap the combat system from Darksiders 2, which I think was an absolutely wonderful system and replace it with a single attack pattern, no real combos between weapons, clunky power system and most importantly a half hack-and-slash, half Dark Souls combat in general. To be fair, after a few hours I understood why they swapped the combo based combat to a single list of attacks; there is no need for combos. The entire combat can be resolved by dodge + counter. The attack windows for the player are really small and barely any attack is going to stagger the enemies, so if you are lucky, maybe you can get 2 attacks in before the enemy charges their attacks so you have to dodge that. For me this system was incredibly boring. Nothing changed in the 16 hours. The powers barely matter, the weapons don't really change the flow of the combat because you have to dodge constantly. But the worst thing is the checkpoint system. I understand that they wanted to make dying have a bigger consequence but for me this resulted in closing down the game when occasionally I had to replay a huge section after death. It is not the system I don\u2019t like, it is the fact that it is in a Darksiders game. I could go on all day long why the combat didn't work for me but I think the main issue was definitely this counter system. The fact you just had to use the same attack pattern over and over and over again and eventually kill all bosses by dodging and countering 100 times.[list][/list]\n- Puzzles: This was another huge disappointment for me. I loved the complexity of the puzzles in 2 and I absolutely hated them in this game. On one end, the puzzles were either 1 or 2 steps long. As a (not very) simplified example, you either need to flip a switch, or flip a switch and then interact with an object. Apart from the fact I found this limitation really boring, my main issue is that (especially as I was getting closer to the end), sometimes even these 1 step solutions felt completely inconsistent. At some point I had to light up a puddle of oil. The problem is, I thought that was water. The texture did not look like oil, the surroundings did not suggest oil in any way and even if I had to light up oil puddles before in the game, I cannot remember because these puzzle mechanics come up so rarely that I just forgot this could be a thing. Plus, the actual reaction in the world that the solution caused made absolutely zero sense for me so I was just sitting there after looking up the solution, thinking \"How the hell was I supposed to guess this?\". I think the puzzles with the powers were poorly introduced and therefore I just randomly tried something after everything else failed to see if that would do something. Not because it made sense for me but because I was messing about randomly.[list][/list]\n- Story: The only thing that kept me going was the story. Not for the story, I wouldn't have finished the game, something that I hate not to do. I wanted to see the end, wanted to conclude the journey of Fury. Apart from how Fury evolved (as described at the beginning), I was really disappointed in the story. I try to be very brief here; the twist at the end was very underwhelming for me, it just happened. A character appeared that we didn't know anything about, then it all just ended very quickly.[list][/list]\n[list][/list]\nI was really looking forward to play this game, I loved 2 so I was hoping for something similar with a new character and story. What I got eventually was a game that only reminds me of the previous games every now and then, but mostly just frustrated me endlessly.[list][/list]\nIf you don\u2019t mind the aspects of a game I complained about above or if you've seen reviews that take these points from a perspective that aligns a lot more with what\u2019s important to you, than that's amazing and I honestly wish you a wonderful time with the game.

abilities, allowing players to unleash their fury upon enemies. The fast-paced action and responsive controls create an exciting gameplay experience.\n\nThe game features an interesting and atmospheric world design, with distinct areas to explore. The post-apocalyptic setting and artistic design elements contribute to the immersive experience, bringing the world of Darksiders to life.\n\nChallenging boss battles add another layer of excitement to the game. These encounters require careful strategy and timing to overcome, offering a sense of accomplishment upon victory.\n\nDarksiders 3 benefits from solid voice acting and sound design. The voice performances bring the characters to life, and the accompanying sound effects add impact to combat and environmental interactions.\n\nPuzzles and environmental exploration provide additional depth to the gameplay, offering rewards for those who take the time to solve riddles and uncover hidden secrets.\n\nHowever, one notable drawback is that the main character in Darksiders 3 may not be as interesting or captivating as the protagonists in prior games. The character lacks the same level of depth and development, which may result in a less engaging narrative experience for some players.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to address a significant issue with Darksiders 3. Many players have reported frequent crashes in the Unreal Engine, particularly after reaching a certain part of the game. Unfortunately, as of now, there are no known solutions or fixes available for this issue. This random crashing can disrupt gameplay and progress, leading to frustration for players.\n\nIn conclusion, Darksiders 3 offers an engaging combat system, interesting world design, and challenging boss battles. The voice acting and sound design enhance the overall experience, and the inclusion of puzzles adds depth to the gameplay. However, the main character may not captivate players as much as the protagonists in previous Darksiders games, and the game is marred by frequent crashes in the Unreal Engine, which can greatly impact the enjoyment and progress of players. These factors should be considered before deciding to embark on this adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1685903181, "timestamp_updated": 1686093948, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522690176963806152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139548878": {"recommendationid": "139548878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093050774", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1694478611}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego es muy bueno y recuerda la mec\u00e1nica del Darksiders 1.

Secondly, the game mechanics, like swapping between styles, were quite a good idea and brought new original puzzles to the saga, making it a whole new puzzle experience. Thirdly, the boss design and the side character, which weren't too much, were more charismatic with a more interesting design in this entry. Additionally, the game now has a great soundtrack, making it more exciting when it hits.\n[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]\nOn the negative side, the main problem is that they tried to make a souls-like game where the small enemies deal tonnes of damage, which is ridiculous compared to the damage dealt by other bosses. Secondly, the game had constant crashes at the beginning, but after verifying files, it was fixed. Thirdly, the different styles were not well approached in the combat, making it mostly to use only one combat style, and the havoc mode was the worst of the Darksiders games; it didn't deal practically any damage, making it just to heal you when you're low. Thirdly, the DLCs starting with Keepers of the Void had four bosses with the same design, which was quite disappointing with some identical riddles being not really interesting, and the other side, the Crucible, which was a concept that was present on Darksiders 2 and was completely free and practically the same with the same final boss, was quite a scam. Additionally, the main character, Fury, was less interesting than the previous one because she didn't know what she wanted and didn't have any strong ambitions.\n[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]\nTo sum up, it's a good game that improved the graphics with the addition of a good soundtrack and continues to innovate on the puzzles. It tries to be a souls-like game but doesn't do it very well. The game is a 7.25/10.", "timestamp_created": 1685875483, "timestamp_updated": 1685875828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139485419": {"recommendationid": "139485419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081614969", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2781, "last_played": 1685540106}, "language": "english", "review": "Darksiders is such an interesting franchise, every game is vastly different from each other and this time what we got was a Darksiders that is hack and slash that meets souls-like.\n\n- Story sadly doesn't progress further from the first game but instead we get another view on it through the eyes of Fury. Surely someday we will get a Darksiders game that moves forward with the story... But anyways story in Darksiders 3 is fine, nothing crazy. The charred council sends Fury to take down the seven sins. Things don't go that smoothly as one would expect but I won't talk about it to avoid spoiling. Overall I enjoyed the story but don't expect too much from it.\n\n- Moving on to the level design, its truly impressive in this game. I just love it so much. The world is connected and there are multiple paths that you can take and once you have gained some new abilities you can open up new paths on previous areas. Only con is I sometimes found myself wishing I had a map of sorts to remember all these different places I had to revisit. The game does give you a compass but it is only used for hunting down the seven sins and frankly it is quite useless.\n\n- Combat I found to be fun most of the time, I played the game on Apocalyptic difficulty which is the second hardest difficulty and I found it to be quite decent. There were certain enemies that I felt like had way too much hp but they didn't show up too often so I didn't mind it too much. The game has two options for combat: Default and Classic, I ended up using Classic since it makes the game more fast paced and makes the game more of a hack and slash. My biggest complaint with the combat was that there wasn't really a good way to counter enemy blocks, sure some of the attacks will break their block but before you get the third ability in the game, you don't have a consistent way of breaking blocks.\n\n- Bosses in the game are mostly fine, there are bosses that I liked a lot and there is a boss that I absolutely hated. I didn't really find them too hard. I don't really want to talk too much about them to avoid spoilers but fuck Gluttony.\n\n- The puzzles were surprisingly good, they aren't that hard but sometimes they made me think a bit. I didn't find myself getting bored of them which can easily happen for me since I'm not that big on puzzles.\n\n- Platforming in the game is fun, once you get all the abilities you have so many ways of platforming which made the platforming pretty versatile.\n\n- Graphics are gorgeous, I really love the art style in the game and playing the game on ultrawide (humble flex) I just couldn't stop admiring the views, that is until I reached Bonelands (its the \"swampy miserable\" looking place of this game). Thankfully the game does give you a beautiful area afterward.\n\n- Soundtrack is fine, not as great as Darksiders 2 has but I still found myself enjoying it.\n\n- The performance of the game sadly isn't too great; at least, it wasn't for me. It was actually a reason why I stopped playing the game on my first playthrough, I just had a lot of stuttering that I couldn't find a fix for. I think it was caused by my cpu bottleneck, since after upgrading my cpu the game was a lot more playable. There are still some stutters but nothing that would make me stop playing the game.\n\n- I'm not sure if I would really recommend the DLC for Darksiders 3, especially the Crucible dlc, it honestly is just a waste of time. The amount of grinding required to unlock everything is just a bit too much and the rewards aren't really worth the grind. You get some enhancements for the weapons but I only found one of the four worth using and then there are some armors to unlock but they aren't worth it if you already have the abyssal armor which you can get in the other dlc. Keepers of the Void is bit better and does give you better rewards that are actually worth it. It is a very puzzle heavy which at the start is pretty fun but they do end up getting a bit old. The new level also isn't that interesting to look at and the enemies are just reskins from the base game. It has five bosses. Four of those bosses are pretty much the same boss just with newer moves. Overall you get some weapons and abyssal armor which is nice but if you already played the game this dlc is quite pointless, only worth it if you really want that armor or you are doing the dlc while completing the game.\n\nI am surprised by how much I ended up enjoying this game; it might even be my favourite in the series, I will have to replay Darksiders 1 and get to finishing Genesis to find that out for sure but overall it is a great game and I had a lot of fun 100% it.

For example, being able to dash is infinite with noticeable recovery time vs in other games needing a stamina bar for it. Or needing to refill respite from enemy drop instead of refilling at Vulgrim. The only complaint is enemy behavior is not balanced between Classic and Default where in Classic you are allowed more animation cancelling to offset the more aggressive enemy behavior where in default you don't really have any recourse.\n\nFury is a tolerable character and completes her arc at the end of the game, I had my doubts because she is probably the most unlikable character in the first half where all she does is scream and attack sh*t, it had me groaning just hoping for character development.

This is a damn hack and slash game franchise and the few attacks that can bypass blocks are either single enemy's attacks or doing with that hammer/axe that takes a century to pull an attack.\n\nCounters damage is just ridiculously low, your only tool of defense against ranged enemies is a counter lance attack that more often than not gets block by terrain, your crossblade has the same acuracy that if you throw a fork while drunk and the only damage that you do that is substantial is at the very late game after doing so many upgrades that you better be fucking Thanos at that point with how much damage you \"should\" do.\n\nI remember playing Prince of Persia the Two Thrones, having an identical weapon than Fury and you actually felt deadly with that thing, but the dark prince barely had a pair of effective moves. Fury has a whole arsenal of combos and manages to feel weaker than an NPC. Seriously. For fuck sake, STOP THE FUCKING SOULSLIKE TREND. You keep ruining franchise upon franchise with it. This cursed game cannot even be properly enjoyed in damn Story Mode how do you expect people to like this shit?\n\nI really hope they make Darksiders Genesis 2 focusing on Fury and Death just to give Fury at least a decent game where it doesnt feel atrocious to play as her cause this game feels like a sacrilege to the character's legacy.", "timestamp_created": 1684197853, "timestamp_updated": 1684197853, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591949105262756348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138354426": {"recommendationid": "138354426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171330333", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1690911252}, "language": "english", "review": "After countless hours playing in my ps4, and maxing everything,  I also bought it at steam.\n10/10 got one shotted again", "timestamp_created": 1684183284, "timestamp_updated": 1684183284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138340868": {"recommendationid": "138340868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345780763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1942, "last_played": 1684179058}, "language": "spanish", "review": "esta re nashe\n", "timestamp_created": 1684163526, "timestamp_updated": 1684163526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138318486": {"recommendationid": "138318486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002769916", "num_games_owned": 822, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1575, "last_played": 1684114312}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, this just pisses me off, so apparently the portal at the end of the game disappeared and i'm reading online that this has never been fixed.

It's more like Dark Souls. The world is just a series of interconnected corridors instead of a big open world like Darksiders 2. RPG elements have less impact than in previous games. It's less about buttom smash/combos and more about timing and patience. Nothing wrong with that. The gameplay is engaging, you're not bothered with pointless sub-quests to artificially increase the length of the game, but there are some collectibles, a LOT (277), but thank God you don't need to get them all for achievements, and progress on them is continued in New Game+. On higher difficulties the game is absurdly hard, but for more casual players you can lower the difficulty.\nThe only gameplay nitpick I have is poor radar. I got stuck several times, but this was partly due to the game not explaining (or poorly explaining) some mechanics that are necessary for some puzzles (like that bloody rock puzzle under the tornado >.>).\n\nSo where does the game fail? Technical problems. It continues the tradition of unstable PC ports. Darksider 2 had lots of problems (lots of crashes, some script were not started, you could soft-lock the game, the last boss could be bugged so you couldn't beat it because it kept crashing). \nDarksider 3 comes with: crashes (some people have them rarely, others often), some cutscenes you have to watch on youtube as you are forced to skip them (they crash the game, especially the ones at the end), game on lower settings is constantly flashing white screen (it looks like it is constantly inserting between frames completely white screen), game also have a problem with overall performance.\n\n\nOverall, from gameplay perspective I had a lot of fun, if not for those technical problems I could easily recommend this game to others. But in the state as this game was left ... play only if you have lot's of patience for technical issues.\n\nNOTE:\nDLC are not worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1682930248, "timestamp_updated": 1682930248, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137571717": {"recommendationid": "137571717", "author": {"steamid": "76561199221546662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "playtime_at_review": 1803, "last_played": 1700440783}, "language": "english", "review": "i finished this game many times and totally recommend it. it's great", "timestamp_created": 1682882038, "timestamp_updated": 1682882038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137554013": {"recommendationid": "137554013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418623933", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2801, "last_played": 1682862383}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, possibly my favorite of the three.

And if you're not a fan, I still do, but play it on normal or below. The achievement for beating it on Apocalyptic is really not worth the trouble, since the game is very unbalanced in higher difficulties.\n\nIt is a hard recommendation, but ultimately I do recommend Darksiders III. Following in the steps of the two previous games, DArksiders III approaches combat in a different system (yet again), which makes sense, since every game has a diffenrent protagonist, I just don't know if it is intentional or not. The game came out in 2018, in the height of souls games and probably started develpment in 2015 or 2016, which, if you guys remember, was when Bloodborne and Dark Souls III came out, so there's more than an influence from Fromsoftware games in Darksiders III. The combat is methodical, but you regularly find yourself being attacked by all directions. The game tries to mitigate this with a danger pointer around fury, but sometimes you're locked in an attack animation and you won't be able to dodge that incoming attack from the back. Or the front, for that matter. In the DLC Keepers of the Void, the last boss has some pretty fast attacks that will 1hko you if you're playing in the Apocalyptic difficulty and sometimes you'll me stuck in an attack or dodge animation when an attack that can only be avoided through a jump comes crashing om you. And, boy, will you find A LOT of enemies with 1 hit ko attacks. You can change the combat system to the classic hack n' slash tho.\n\nThe level design is very reminiscent of the souls games and you will usually find some simple puzzles to solve, unlike in Darksiders II where they were obtuse and happened way too often for its own good. \n\nThe story itself is... kinda the same from Darksiders I (?) but with some different plot points and an interesting intrigue being revealed by the end of the game. The good thing is that every character in all the games evolve and Fury is the one that grows the most during her journey. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1682132236, "timestamp_updated": 1682132236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516252398490905762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137069356": {"recommendationid": "137069356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110948674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 967, "last_played": 1682448897}, "language": "english", "review": "It's solid", "timestamp_created": 1682103956, "timestamp_updated": 1682103956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136956322": {"recommendationid": "136956322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019463167", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1684964294}, "language": "english", "review": "So far having a good time", "timestamp_created": 1681910806, "timestamp_updated": 1681910806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136920121": {"recommendationid": "136920121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198443310722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2729, "last_played": 1617022587}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Volvemos a los \"inicios\" de la franquicia.\nEsta vez, nos encarnamos en mujer,  FURIA.\nEl personaje me gusta bastante y la trama promete bastante, ya que se adapta bien a su cronolog\u00eda en su historia.\nGr\u00e1ficamente, aqu\u00ed ya va a mejor, los combates son mejores, la disposici\u00f3n de armamento se limita solamente a tu l\u00e1tigo, por lo que los azotes est\u00e1n garantizados.\nCada t\u00edtulo contaba con su propia identidad, y en este no nos quedamos fuera, porque aunque haya vuelto a su inicio, aqu\u00ed tenemos combates m\u00e1s inspirados a \"DarkSouls\" incluyendo el sistema de si mueres, pierdes lo que ten\u00edas, aunque eso ya es opcional seg\u00fan el modo que elijas.

It also helps that the puzzles in this one have been drastically reduced and I no longer get the feeling to recive items, just to do puzzles with them. Because of that, the whole gameplay in the world itself feels more immersive and complete for me. The level design in general is genius in all aspects, it's beautiful, it has many secret paths and connections to other paths you couldn't access before as you progress with your abilities (just like Darksiders1), each way you took before can open up to completely another direction. The combat as well as the abilities and weapons feel fun and refreshing. Even though I can't withhold the fact that you have to get used to the new \"souls-like\" mechanics before the combat is really enjoyable. The bosses are easily the best so far from the franchise (and in the worst case, at least as good as in the second part).\n\nNegative for me was the fact that the story again does not take place after part 1 and that the plot just runs parallel to the first and second part. Therefore, the third part has the same problem as the first: The ending is so exciting that you immediately want to know what happens next, but all you get is a black screen and see the credits rolling.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] War and Death were cool, but my favorite horseman now is without a doubt Fury. A great game, very enjoyable and worth your time, without the false expectation of people (which is kind of understandable) the game would have much higher scores from critics.\n\n\n[b]\u27a4\u2800L\u2800A\u2800P\u2800T\u2800O\u2800P\u2800\u2800S\u2800P\u2800E\u2800C\u2800S\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac[/b]\nCPU-: AMD Ryzen\u2122 9 5900HX Mobile Processor (8 CPU cores)\nGPU-: NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce RTX\u2122 3080 GPU 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM\nMB-: AMD Promontory/Bixby FCH\nRAM-: 64 GB (2x32 GB) DDR4 RAM (3.200 MHz)\nSSD-: Samsung\u00ae PM9A1 MZVL22T0HBLB, 2048\u00a0GB", "timestamp_created": 1681300735, "timestamp_updated": 1681300735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605765283107757568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136524697": {"recommendationid": "136524697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030545547", "num_games_owned": 723, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 697, "last_played": 1681209350}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels more like a souls game then Darksiders. its okay but not true to what i know and love about the originals\n\n\nsad to say i cant recommend it", "timestamp_created": 1681221463, "timestamp_updated": 1681221463, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441489338874816895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136499534": {"recommendationid": "136499534", "author": {"steamid": "76561199046722256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5517, "last_played": 1682271740}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bien", "timestamp_created": 1681171995, "timestamp_updated": 1681171995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136476430": {"recommendationid": "136476430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137577596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 715, "last_played": 1681135224}, "language": "english", "review": "Mommy Fury whiplash", "timestamp_created": 1681141240, "timestamp_updated": 1681141240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489283859729766846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136433729": {"recommendationid": "136433729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060206044", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 221, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1681117538}, "language": "english", "review": "Advertised as full controller support.

It happens. You probably did your best making a souls clone ( or you don't give a damn about darksiders lore ), but you can't switch genres in the middle of a series. The 'classic' combat patch even makes you more stupid, you guys fixed the things that didn't need any fixing. The thing about the game - if you listen closely to the cutscenes - that you are playing one of the horsemen of the apocalypse. Demigods. I expect them to not die after one slap from a zombie because you think \"dark souls was cool\". It's not cool, not even semi-cool, you made a broken and annoying combat system. If you're struggling to understand the connection between the story of a game and the gameplay of a game, I can point you to the variable you'll need to change to solve the dissonance here. When you're looking at the scripts of the combat, look for something like \"if (GotHit) {CanMove = false;}\", write another variable there, hook it up with a switch in the settings menu and let us decide if we want to play a Darksiders game or a lame dark souls clone. \n That should be it. Disclaimer : I don't mind taking damage, I do mind losing my progress because the lamest enemy hit me once, then every other enemy had chance to beat me to death. It's not that Fury-y. It just sucks and you failed at basic game design. Or you guys are just a bunch of souls fanboys and wanted to ride the franchise's success to release your sh*tty game.\n If you're still struggling with game design or coding, dm me, I'm here to help.\n\nooc : stupid combat aside, the game is still good, - enjoyable backtracking, super cool economics, awesome characters, story and atmosphere - Fury is one of my favorite horsemen so far.

Every game in the series is a different take. Darksiders 3 takes some inspiration from games like Dark Souls. Enemies hit hard. Dodging is critical. Timing is everything.

The game is still hard. One bad move against a boss or mini-boss and you can easily die. One bad move against a swarm of enemies and you can easily die. Difficult is uneven as well. Some boss encounters are very hard. Others you will get on your first try. There seems to be little rhythm or reason to this. Overall the game is far from perfect, but it grew on me. Graphically it looks very nice and offers some variety of locale. Story wise it does not add much to the mythos.

The only sort-of queer character was Lust, who is of ambiguous gender, and only in so far as Lucifer being betrayed in catholic frescos as having both boobs and a penis is, i.e. also bad rep.\nThe characters overall were uninspired, including the bosses, and the their motivations were vague at best, and utterly incomprehensible at worst. The twist reveals about any of them were also superficial and not built-up at all.\n(spoilers end)\n\nThe gameplay was mediocre and unrefined, with a lot of conflicting design goals. Implementing quasi Dark-souls-esque combat, with enemies hitting hard and combat focused on learning their patterns, while also having multiple segments where you are flooded with enemies or just standard traversal past enemies being impossible because they outpace your running speed will leave a lot of players feeling stranded. The fact that attacks aren't telegraphed but still wanting players to focus on dodging because face-tanking isn't viable shows a misunderstanding of the inspirations of the series, be it Dark Souls or Legend of Zelda.\n\nOverall, I played this for the story elements revealed, as I finished the first two roughly a decade ago. I will say that it was not worth it, as the story doesn't expand on what the horsemen were doing during the other games, or who the actual villain of the whole story is. It feels like the \"typical\" pre-sequel story, where it cannot deviate from the story of what comes before and after, while also not carving out an interesting story on its own.\n\nSome ratings in numbers:\nAccessibility: 0/10.

Usually that's how sequels improve on their prequels.\n\nBut with Darksiders 3 I feel like the developers just scrapped everything that made Darksiders 1 and 2, a Darksiders game and decided to add elements from scratch without keeping either successes or failures.\n\nDarksiders 1 took inspiration God of War and Devil May Cry with tons of puzzles that were quite annoying but had great execution moves and combat.\nDarksiders 2 took inspiration from Prince of Persia while adding RPG elements such as armour, plenty of weapons and a skill tree that defines the way you play. Perfected the puzzles and made them fun, lowered the gruesome factor and the executions that DS1 had but worked on world building and characters.\nDarksiders 3 drops the Prince of Persia elements, drops the major puzzles, drops the dungeons and the god of war combat like elements and decides to draw inspiration from Dark Souls and while such a genre is very difficult to draw from, (Darksiders 3 didn't do a great job at that) Fury is probably the most interesting horseman/horsewoman that we've gotten.\n\nNow leaving my confusion aside Darksiders 3 is a decent, quite fun game, where you take control of Fury.\nOut of all darksiders games, she's pretty much the only one who has a character arc that I've really enjoyed.\nShe starts off as a self-righteous, selfish, power hungry character that's indifferent to her brothers but you'll soon come to realise that she just wants to be acknowledged and she's wiser than she initially lets on.\nWhile not all of the jokes land, there's much more character development here and chit chat between Fury and her Watcher which War severely lacked in the 1st game.\nFury doesn't feel floaty/light or going on ice skates when you're playing like War and Death did. \nYou can feel how heavy she is and I believe that's how a horseman of the apocalypse should feel like.\nI really hope that these aspects aren't going to be dropped in future Darksiders game. Fury's a character done right, probably the best out of all horsemen which is refreshing to see.\n\nThe world in 3 is pretty good looking and feels very metrovenia like. You'll unlock new skills and abilities that allows you to travel in places you couldn't access before.\nFury's mission is to hunt down the Seven Deadly Sins and unfortunately that's more interesting than it sounds. The Sins are pretty boring and very defined by what they represent in a cartoon villain like fashion with only 2-3 sins standing out more such as Lust, Pride and Envy that had more dialogue and scenes.\nThere's no real build up to fighting the sins besides little snips of dialogue here and there, and they're just wandering the world with no clear purpose. They're like lost children wanting to do stuff and the Council sends you to pick them up and kick them back home.\n\nThe combat is serviceable and credit goes to the accessibility of the game. You can pick between Classic and Default combat from Story difficulty to Reckoning. This will impact how good the game feels but overall it's challenging. There's also enough enemy variety to keep you on your toes. Fury's abilities feel good to use so you'll find yourself using most of them through the journey.\n\nThe boss fights aren't Dark Souls level but out of all Darksiders game they're the ones that are most fleshed out which makes them more challenging. Depending on what difficulty you're playing, observing their patterns and moves, it'll make you play more methodical than before.\n\nThere are some downsides and bugs that hold the game back.\n1. The impact of combat that Darksiders 1 and 2 had is pretty much gone. Even though you're still fighting demons and angels in many stages, Fury's whip feels like it's hitting metal, not living fleshy things.\n2. There are 0 execution moves in this game.\n3. The puzzles are there but toned down significantly with only 2-3 that are at least remotely interesting.\n4. No more RPG elements. There are some armours in the game but the only difference between them is a few stats and colour patterns. If you want the coolest armour set, the Abyssal armour, you have to play through the DLC to get it and it's the only one that really changes the appearance of Fury and not just the colour.\n5. No map - On your first play through you'll lose the sense of direction. I understand that the game wants you to remember the places you visit and make them memorable but this isn't Dark Souls or Bloodborne. \nThe areas aren't masterfully crafted. Some of them are wide open spaces (forests, deserts, cities) and besides their colour pallet they're not much different. \nDarksiders 1 and 2 had a map and that would help you figure out where you're going, what you've explored or what you should keep on exploring. Here, you only get a compass that will direct you towards the next boss and that's it. \nFor example, some areas have certain points where you can fly. However, you haven't unlocked the ability to fly yet so you're progressing through the main path. Then, you unlock the ability to fly and you'll have to remember where the heck you've seen the flying spots you couldn't use before.\nHad it been on a map, it would've been easier to just check rather than wandering around aimlessly. Not a huge issue but an annoyance for sure.\n\nAll in all, great game.\n\nIf I were to score all Darksiders:\nDarksiders 2 : 8.8/10 - Great puzzles, great world, decent RPG system, beautiful graphics, atmospheric.\nDarksiders 3 : 7/10 - Interesting character, good boss fights, challenging game with the right difficulty setting\nDarksiders 1 : 5.5/10 - Fun combat, amazing executions, classic game\n\nExcited for Darksiders 4.\nConsidering how many times these games have changed, I hope Strife won't drive a car through the Grand Prix to stop the Charred Council.", "timestamp_created": 1677238756, "timestamp_updated": 1682968543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749081611633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133420448": {"recommendationid": "133420448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051418546", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1677368746}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanta la saga Darksiders, he jugado y terminado los dos primeros.

After all, after the first part, the war for survival began. Before leaving, he warns FURY - \"This is all a conspiracy, you should not trust anyone.\"\nThis is our beauty and pride. The main mechanics this time are borrowed from Dark Souls. Everything else is as always - the merchant raises our level when we feed him the accumulated souls - for them we buy ourselves upgrades for weapons, life shards for healing. The point where the merchant is located also serves as a checkpoint. You can\u2019t take many souls from opponents - therefore, you have to look for hiding places in the form of yellow crystals with accumulations of souls or, as you progress through the story, get improvements and abilities - they won\u2019t let us get to many places right away (as in the recent Lara Croft).\n3 characteristics are available - increase in health, strength and magic damage. You don\u2019t have to pump everything evenly - you need to make a certain bias. Boss fights require tactics (like in Dark Souls) - we have to defeat the seven deadly sins. At the merchant, in addition to improvements, you can move through rat holes (portals), which is very convenient.

Exploration is fun as there are quite a few secret areas with nice rewards. Boss fights on the highest difficulty are challenging at your first encounter with them but may vary from difficulty to difficulty (I started the game on Reckoning so it adds more to the fun and challenge).\n\nI also recommend getting both the DLCs because they add quite a lot to the game. I won't go too much into detail about that in order not to spoil the fun of the exploration.\n\nThere are a few small bugs but nothing to worry about too much.

The franchise would have been better off without it.\n\nIt's clear to me that they hoped to capitalize on the Soulsborne hype by copying many of the core mechanics from those titles. As a product of this, Darksiders 3 is a poor man's Dark Souls.\n\nThe concept of hunting down the 7 Sins is decent, but otherwise the story is rather uninspired and bland. There is a serious lack of new and original characters.\nOriginal Darksiders 1 characters were: Samael, Abaddon, Lilith, Azrael, Ulthane, Uriel, Vulgrim, and The 5 Chosen.\nDarksiders 3 has, what, Abraxis (Who appears once and has lit-er-ally no character development), Lord of Hollows, Usiel (who appears twice) and the 7 Sins? There's also 5 forgettable (and optional) Chosen, but I don't remember doing most of them. Otherwise there are many recurring characters, which is fine. But it shouldn't be a replacement for original characters.\n\nAnother thing which isn't a huge deal but kind of rubbed me the wrong way was the lack of over-the-top comical graphic violence that the series is otherwise known for. I remember watching War tear off Tiamat's wings, then doing a backflip mid-air while holding her severed wings, and then finally tearing out her still-beating heart in a fountain of blood while Tiamat screams in agony.\n\nIn Darksiders 3, by comparison, the most graphical thing I remember, is Fury catching an axe mid-air and throwing it back, hitting the target.

If you want a number rating I think 8/10 is representative\n\nLong version: I started playing darksiders 1 as a teenager on my pc back in early 2010s. The darksiders mainline games have always had mixup of gameplay styles from various inspirations to be sort of unique for each Character.\n\nWar (Darksiders 1) - tloz, dmc and gow like gameplay\nDeath (Darksiders 2)- pop, tloz, diablo ish arpg\nFury (THIS GAME - Darksiders 3) - metroidvania, souls\n\nI think people were unnecessarily harsh on this games design on initial release. The genre blending has always been a thing and Genesis is a top down arpg twin stick for strife. My main gripes are just that the camera should've been changed. Since this is a souls like now which expects you to pay attention to enemy telegraph. Pulling the Camera back for lock on is actually.... Quite dumb. Look at what any of the souls likes do - the lock on puts the camera slightly higher than normal so u can see a FULL view of the enemy.\n\nOther than this, the only real complaint I have is poor writing which let's be real this is darksiders. They never had all that good writing to start with.\n\nWhat you DO have here is a very competent souls like. I mentioned people were too harsh on the design because this perfect dodge is actually more common as a perfect parry in sekiro, fallen order etc and no one really complained about those games. Darksiders fans just weren't used the kind of difficulty from souls likes. Understandable as souls is the last type of gameplay you'd expect from \"HORSEMAN OF THE APOCALYPSE\". Regardless the power fantasy is here.

The first Darksiders game was GOW + Zelda, Darksiders 2 was GOW + Zelda + Diablo, and finally Darksiders 3 is Dark Souls + Bayonetta + Metroid. You might see how there's quite the departure here, but not only that but it's like this game was made by people who'd watched a let's play of Dark Souls and had maybe overheard the general idea of what a metroidvania is. It's so incredibly laughable. \n\nYour estus flask (Nephilim's respite) is super inconsistent. Sometimes I can't use it while attacking, sometimes I can. Sometimes I can't use it while dodging, sometimes I can. Sometimes I'm mashing the heal button and it works or it doesn't (never had any issues with healing in Darksiders 2). And in a game that claims \"Hack-N-Slash\" you'd think the healing would operate like 2 where you could heal at any time in or out of comboing.\nOne of the biggest combat flaws, and this ties in to me saying that this feels like a Dark Souls wannabe that was made by people who had only watched a let's play, is that there's no poise system. Fury is basically a character who has 0 poise and every enemy has 100 poise. If an enemy begins blocking you cannot break their guard with attacks and if you try to use a heavy attack, which people claim will break guard, you will be hit because your heavy attack takes too long, so it's better to just use the one combo that lets you stun lock and constantly throw an enemy in the air and pull them back down, but the intended method is to stop attacking and wait patiently as they attack and then you get your \"MUH EPIC SLOW MOTION DODGE ATTACK TIME\". It's mind numbingly bad. On the note of the \"Muh epic bayo dodge\" it's really annoying when you do a perfect dodge and get hit by the end of attack animation anyways. Very epic.\n\nEnemies have way too much health, they don't drop hardly enough souls, items rise in price if you buy them (really cool to punish the player with \"Muh hard game\" amirite?), AND OH MY LORD the fact that there's no bonfire system to refill your Estus is insane! It's almost like this is a Dark Souls clone made by people who haven't played Dark Souls! Color me surprised! Wanna know how you get to refill your healing? There's literally a button in the options menu to kys and respawn refreshing your Estus. Just awful.\nCan't charge your projectile attack while dodging.\nLots of enemies cannot be singled out to face 1v1 like Dark Souls.\nEnemies literally can chase you down faster than you can run away making entire sections of the game a slog when it throws 4 enemies with 100 Poise, a bajillion health points, and unbreakable guards who all kill you in 2 hits.\nCan get hurt by enemies during tentacle scenes.\nHave tiny flying enemies ->Have no ranged attacks like the guns in Darksiders 1 or 2 ->have to keep jump attacking to effing hit them = Genius Design. Technically this is resolved with 2/5ths in to the game you are given a long range weapon.\nalso, forced slow walking sections cuz \"Muh story\".\n\nOkay okay, so maybe the combat is terrible and the game has lots of generally bad gameplay choices, but that's just a large portion of the game, but what about the metroid part?\nNot terrible, but underwhelming. I think the thing that disappointed me the most was no form swapping mid air to have complex platforming. It would've been really cool if you use the fire ability (High Jump) and then swap to Electricity (Float) and then swap to Force (?) (Purple ball form) and slap on to something, but no. It's all very simple and plain with basic platforming and basic puzzles. I hope you also like grabbing ledges because Fury's jump is not high enough on it's own to let you not have to watch that \"grabbing the ledge and climbing up\" animation a billion times.\n\nI'd like to also take a second to say the bosses range from really fun and fair to just annoying and bad whether its due to mediocre attacks/awkward attack timing, bad hit-boxes (I'm looking at you gluttony), or general sponginess. \nI think the most fun fight aesthetically and mechanically has to be Greed. I never felt like any of his attacks were unfair or that he was at fault. His boss fight literally had me only blaming myself for anything that happened.\nI think the worst boss fight is a tie between Gluttony who has undodgeable attacks due to the tentacle being so huge OR Lust his/her strange/awkward timings and the jab attack that has 0 build up, and the fact that it replicates the worst boss fight from Dark Souls 1.\n\nI'd like to take a second to mention I encountered a myriad of visual bugs and oddities. In the warehouse zone boxes would not load probably and I'd see the Unreal Engine props. Constant pop in. etc etc. You can definitely tell these are the same guys who \"Updated\" Darksiders 1 and 2 for last gen and pc cuz it's poorly slapped together. \n\nBoss tiers :\n\nGreat Tier\nGreed\nWrath 1\n\nOkay Tier\nWrath 2\nPride\nSloth\n\nBad Tier\nLust\nEnvy 1 & 2\n\nAnd the thing that ABSOLUTELY DISAPPOINTED ME THE MOST was when starting a new game+ I thought to myself \"Oh man, it'd be really cool if when I do NG+ I start the game with all of my abilities and I get to tackle the sins semi out of order/in an order I'd find more fun\" but nope. Not happening. You are forced to play slowly and unlock everything again despite the game actually picking up once you receive all 4 forms.\n\nDarksiders 3 is a solid 4/10 maybe a soft 5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1672111491, "timestamp_updated": 1672127985, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657705605030059814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129356652": {"recommendationid": "129356652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384435603", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1502, "last_played": 1672134622}, "language": "english", "review": "really fun game to play \nif you find some monsters too difficult to kill , make sure your weapons are upgraded to max level possible with the enhancements + some YT videos might be helpful \nhavent finished the game yet but I will edit this when I do so\nedit : I just finished the game , 100% recommended ;)", "timestamp_created": 1672078861, "timestamp_updated": 1672088957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129352808": {"recommendationid": "129352808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075201942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1669800343}, "language": "english", "review": "Another hack 'n' slash game that got violently converted into a souls-like game.\nThe progression system felt useless because no matter how much you level up your character, you could still get killed by 2-3 hits from the lowest of the low monsters.

The game is not absolute garbage, but at best it's only worth 1 playthrough on normal.\nSkip both DLCs, both are garbage. The Crucible doesn't feel like it was tested due to the amount of bs that can instantly end your run, and the Void is mostly platforming that overstays it's welcome, followed by \"5\" bosses that are just reiterations of the last one but with more moves.\n\nThe game itself has problems in multiple places. Feels like it was missing a good year in the planning stage, someone to tell them that the combat doesn't work as it is, and better writers to not make the protagonist completely unlikable.\n\nThe stage design is closer to the 1st game, but nowhere as interesting. So much of the game feels like underground tunnel/hallways that it's easy to forget where was that one puzzle in the back of your mind. The puzzles are just ok, but they don't try to do anything interesting like 1 and 2 did. It's overall pretty generic.\n\nThe combat just feels bad overall.\nThe damage received is stupidly high and you die in 2-3 hits. This means that in a group fight you get staggered once by the enemy in front, and then the one next to them gets a free attack. Or a projectile hits you from out of the screen and whatever you where attacking gets a free hit. Or an enemy spawns behind you. Or you get cornered and you only options are to die, get lucky, or have enough Havoc to iframe your way out of there. \nYou're mashing X most of the time vs trash enemies, or just baiting counter attacks on bosses to play it safe because you can't cancel out of every attack and you can't block either.\nDespite the fact that you unlock 4 more melee weapons, all of them feel the same except for the charge and counter attacks, where only 2 of them are particularly useful. In fact, the game doesn't tell you that one of them is the only way to get behind endgame enemies that never lower their guard, otherwise forcing you to wait for them to attack so you can counter attack about 7-10 times per encounter until they finally die.\nThe biggest offender is that one of your counter attacks (that will most likely happen at random) can force you to jump. You have no defensive options in the air. This means that fighting more than one enemy, or an enemy that has super armor, will most likely end with you getting hit out of the air because there's just nothing you can do. And like I said above, you will be countering a lot in boss fights.\n\nThere was no need to force you to switch to a different form every time to solve a puzzle. All of those new mechanics can fit perfectly fine with a better controller design. And speaking of controller design, they somehow manged to fuck up the dark souls item selection by forcing you to scroll through all your items instead of letting you equip them, and forcing you to tap down to \"equip\" the healing instead of just letting you use it right away... in a game where you die in 2-3 hits.\n\nThe Crucible DLC is a 100 stage gauntlet in a boring circle arena.\nWhy it's bad:\nEnemies constantly spawn behind you mid stage and out of camera... in a game where you die in 2-3 hits.\nEnemies can spawn in platforms above you that you have to climb... in a game where you have no air defensive options usually forcing you to eat a hit as you climb, unless you wait and wait and wait until they decide to shoot the ground AND THEN you can climb.\nBoth of these are pretty easy problems to spot had they tested it. They clearly didn't or at least they didn't outside of the easiest difficulty where you can stomp everything with endgame gear for your dirty chievo.\n\nThe Keepers of the Void DLC is a long series of puzzles using the mechanics you unlock through the game.\nIt's not bad, but there's nothing special and overstays it's welcome so not really worth the time.\nAt the end of each section you fight a boring boss. Each section has the exact same boss but with more moves. Bosses 3 and 4 where the closest thing to fun due to how much more active those fights where compared to the main game BUT the damage was so stupidly high that they demand a lot of pattern learning and counter spam. Then the 5th boss is the most different, but the damage is so high and it has so much HP that it's just not fun to try over and over.

"language": "english", "review": "I delayed playing this one because of the initial backlash and negative reviews. Having replayed the first two recently I wanted to see where the story continued and I was very pleasantly surpised by this game.\n\nIt's a very good Darksiders game and I never got bored (except maybe for that one boss), much better than what it presents itself to be in the description or the screenshots.\n\nGraphics, level desing, lore, music and sound are all well crafted and in line if not improved from the previous games.\n\nAt first the game feels stripped down if you compare it to Darksiders 2. But in reality it's just different and while it lacks depth in character progression and loot I think ends up being a more focused experience this way.\n\nThe combat and gameplay loop is inspired frome recent \"Souls LIGHT\" titles, in fact this game reminds me of Jedi Fallen order in its atmosphere and gameplay.\n\nHere are the main aspects that change from previous titles, none of them detracted me from finishing the game :\n\n- Only 3 main attributes to level up. Meh, but Okay. You can also level up weapons choose different armors and enhancements but it's more about personalising your gameplay experience.\n- Only 4 acrane abilities that are tied to only 4 secondary weapons (and I actually liked it this way).\n- Loot mainly consists of currency and crafting components. On one hand it gives you the freedom to upgrade the weapons and the attachments you prefer. On the other hand it's sad to never be able to find unique weapons or armor. I think this helps keeping you focused on mastering the 4 secondary weapons but otherwise I can see why this is percieved as a huge step back.\n- There is no map. It's OK, in part because when you revisit old locations you will have outleveled the enemies there so exploration is actually fun and not a chore.\n- The \"souls lite\" elements : one health item that replenishes as you die or randomly after certain enemies die. When you die your souls are left where you died and all enemies respawn. I think it fits the depressing post-apolcalyptic atmosphere, and I liked the slower pace in general (like Jedi Fallen order).\n- Combat requires more precision, perfect dodges meaning learning enemies patterns. Again, good change of pace and I felt it was fluid and had a lot of fun with it. It is not hower as hard as a true souls title, far from it.\n\nAll in all, very fun game.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.", "timestamp_created": 1671038110, "timestamp_updated": 1671038110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496212124824523926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128509333": {"recommendationid": "128509333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164797763", "num_games_owned": 444, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1234, "last_played": 1670968219}, "language": "english", "review": "Plusy:\n- ko\u0144czy si\u0119\nMinusy:\n- ca\u0142a reszta", "timestamp_created": 1670968602, "timestamp_updated": 1670968602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47992175817489624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128448942": {"recommendationid": "128448942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040657724", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2113, "last_played": 1670879003}, "language": "english", "review": "As a person who played all 3 games and have all achievements on each game,\nI must say , in my opinion this is the best game of the franchise. \nSure, it's absolutely different from it's earlier ,,brothers\".

In terms of soundtrack its a well-done one but not something that memorable, graphics may look dated compared to some other games but the art design makes up for it, its not a high budget game in anyway and because of that it tries to use its resource more precisely which is something the series needed after darksiders 2 and being more of a modern game, they had time to refine the gameplay a little bit more which is what made it the most enjoyable one to me, plus I love metroidvanias too, for me this one is a fun entry that the series needed, its not expensive and it gave me a journey with fury, the third horseman, that I will truly remember, I am so glad that this series didn't die with THQ and while I also enjoyed darksiders genesis, I hope to have a proper game focused on strife and then we can finally get the darksiders game withh all horsemen reunited, which is something every fans dream of.", "timestamp_created": 1669770803, "timestamp_updated": 1669771040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127593466": {"recommendationid": "127593466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063104451", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 459, "last_played": 1687204781}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked it when Fury said, \"I am the Darksider 3\" and Darksided all over everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1669761090, "timestamp_updated": 1669761090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511594116687774658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127452343": {"recommendationid": "127452343", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985474992", "num_games_owned": 1267, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 2124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2124, "last_played": 1612744918}, "language": "english", "review": "The best of the Darksiders games.", "timestamp_created": 1669668032, "timestamp_updated": 1669668032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127414950": {"recommendationid": "127414950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046229190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3943, "last_played": 1669633022}, "language": "english", "review": "Weakest of the three main games, but still good.

Players take control of Fury, the sister of War and Death, two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, from a third-person perspective. Fury, a mage described as the most unpredictable and enigmatic of the Four Horsemen, relies on whips, swords, flails, daggers and magic in combat. Fury can take on several different elemental forms to enhance her combat abilities, giving her new weapons, attacks, and locomotion abilities.\n\nCombat is described as methodical and straightforward, not focusing on large clusters of enemies and removing the hit counter like in the previous games. Enemies are stronger than in previous installs, but spawn in smaller numbers in encounters to make combat feel more personal. Some enemies return from previous games while other enemies are new. Gated Combat isn't a feature in an attempt to make everything contextualized and connected within the environment like it was in the Dark Souls series.\n\nDarksiders III focuses on its leveling system, where Fury's damage, health, and arcane damage can be upgraded. The threats to the world of the game grow stronger as the player progresses through the story. Similar to War but unlike Death, Fury collects souls from enemies and objects in the environment as a form of currency or as a consumable resource. The player can attach \"Enhancements\" to Fury's weapons to gain various perks and damage increases.\n\nThe game takes place in a continuous environment where exploration plays a big part in collecting more Lurchers and materials to improve Fury herself and her arsenal. As she explores, Fury must solve simple puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles, some using her whip. Such puzzles include using bombs to blast blocked paths or Fury's Forms to interact with the environment.\n\n[h1] Per [/h1]\n\n+ Zelda meets Dark Souls\n+ large, connected world\n+ nice comic style\n+ successful background music\n+ Small but fun arsenal of weapons\n+ varied skills\n+ challenging opponents and optional bosses\n+ Achievements and trading cards\n\n[h1] cons [/h1]\n\n- weak textures\n- Puzzles are too simple\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nDarksiders III offers fresh new approaches and fun gameplay that is well translated into a story full of twists and turns.\n\n\n[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]\n\nDarksiders III f\u00e4llt ins Adventure und Action-Rollenspiel, welches von entwickelt wurde. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884135197\n\n[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]\n\nDarksiders III ist eine Abkehr von den vorherigen Spielen, indem es Struktur- und Gameplay-Elemente von Metroidvanias und Soulslikes entlehnt, das Spiel wird als eine Mischung aus Elementen fr\u00fcherer Spiele und einer neuen Richtung angesehen. Die Spieler \u00fcbernehmen die Kontrolle \u00fcber Fury, die Schwester von War and Death, zwei der vier Reiter der Apokalypse, aus der Third-Person-Perspektive. Fury, ein Magier, der als der unberechenbarste und r\u00e4tselhafteste der Vier Reiter beschrieben wird, verl\u00e4sst sich im Kampf auf Peitschen, Schwerter, Dreschflegel, Dolche und Magie. Fury kann mehrere verschiedene elementare Formen annehmen, um ihre Kampff\u00e4higkeiten zu verbessern, indem sie ihr neue Waffen, Angriffe und Fortbewegungsf\u00e4higkeiten verleiht.\n\nDer Kampf wird als methodischer und geradliniger beschrieben, der sich nicht wie in den vorherigen Spielen auf gro\u00dfe Ansammlungen von Feinden konzentriert und den Trefferz\u00e4hler entfernt. Feinde sind st\u00e4rker als in fr\u00fcheren Installationen, erscheinen jedoch bei Begegnungen in geringerer Anzahl, damit sich die K\u00e4mpfe pers\u00f6nlicher anf\u00fchlen. Einige Feinde kehren aus fr\u00fcheren Spielen zur\u00fcck, w\u00e4hrend andere Feinde neu sind. Gated Combat ist kein Feature, in dem Versuch, alles innerhalb der Umgebung kontextualisiert und miteinander verbunden zu machen, wie in der Dark Souls-Serie.\n\nDarksiders III konzentriert sich auf sein Levelsystem, in dem Furys Schaden, Gesundheit und arkaner Schaden verbessert werden k\u00f6nnen. Die Bedrohungen der Welt des Spiels werden st\u00e4rker, je weiter der Spieler durch die Geschichte voranschreitet. \u00c4hnlich wie Krieg, aber anders als Tod, sammelt Fury Seelen von Feinden und Objekten in der Umgebung, als eine Form von W\u00e4hrung oder als verbrauchbare Ressource. Der Spieler kann \u201eVerst\u00e4rkungen\u201c an Furys Waffen anbringen, um verschiedene Vorteile und Schadenserh\u00f6hungen zu erhalten.\n\nDas Spiel findet in einer kontinuierlichen Umgebung statt, in der die Erkundung eine gro\u00dfe Rolle beim Sammeln von mehr Lurchern und Materialien spielt, um Fury selbst und ihr Arsenal zu verbessern. Beim Erkunden muss Fury einfache R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen und Plattformhindernisse \u00fcberwinden, von denen einige ihre Peitsche verwenden. Solche R\u00e4tsel umfassen die Verwendung von Bomben, um blockierte Wege zu sprengen, oder Fury's Forms, um mit der Umgebung zu interagieren.\n\n[h1] Pro [/h1]\n\n+ Zelda trifft Dark Souls\n+ gro\u00dfe, zusammenh\u00e4ngende Welt\n+ sch\u00f6ner Comic-Stil\n+ gelungene Musikuntermalung\n+ kleines, aber spa\u00dfiges Waffenarsenal\n+ abwechslungsreiche F\u00e4higkeiten\n+ fordernde Gegner und optionale Bosse\n+ Errungenschaften und Sammelkarten\n\n[h1] Kontra [/h1]\n\n- schwache Texturen\n- R\u00e4tsel sind zu einfach gehalten\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n\nDarksiders III bietet frische neue Ans\u00e4tze und ein spa\u00dfiges Gameplay, welches gut umgesetzt wurde in eine Geschichte voller Wendungen.", "timestamp_created": 1669209014, "timestamp_updated": 1669209065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699533939361572266", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126108941": {"recommendationid": "126108941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012026189", "num_games_owned": 830, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1669730298}, "language": "english", "review": "God of War, Dark Souls and Devil May Cry all at once lol.

Which in my option is just what the franchise needed, you can still Hack and Slash but with no combo meter, there's no pressure to keep your attacks moving. This has left a lot of Darksiders fans annoyed but it's a risk Gunfire took. If you haven't played the previous two Darksiders, this won't make much difference to you, but I felt the strain playing this for the first couple of hours. Once you get the hang of the new controls/combat, it feels like a breath of fresh air, has been put into the franchise.\n\nThey've improved drastically with how the story is portrayed, it's almost identical to the previous games but explained so much better, perhaps it's the cinematic scenes and the raw emotion you feel of Fury that brings this story to life, or it's how the Seven Deadly Sins try to explain themselves before and after going into battle with them. I'd say it's both of those concepts that made this game a little more advanced than Darksiders 1&2.\n\nThere is a slight hiccup that needs to be talked about, the frame rate when going into a different area drops drastically for a couple of seconds before returning back to normal, this would be more of an issue if this happened in combat but luckily it's only when you enter a more scenic area.\n\nWithout upsetting you huge Darksider fans, I'd recommend getting this on a slight discount, 15% sounds pretty reasonable, if you're new to the franchise and you're playing this before the others, you'll enjoy Darksiders III immensely.\nTotal Score = 84/100.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe game departs from the gameplay of the previous entries and incorporates elements from Metroidvanias and Soulslikes. Taking place before the first Darksiders game, the player controls Fury, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, in her quest to capture the seven deadly sins which have taken corporeal form and escaped imprisonment. In their quest, players can use a variety of melee and magical weapons and gain experience points and currency to upgrade Fury's powers and weapons.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nDarksiders franchise, Dark Souls franchise, God of War, Elden Ring.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1\u25a1 8 / 10\nIs Fury really a HORSEmen?

Darksiders 3 sees a new dev team take on the mantle and the change in style really shows, also the lack of budget. Whilst gunfire games did make the amazing remnants from the ashes they almost seemed a perfect fit for the sequel but this game is just super bland and boring with only somewhat enjoyable combat and exploration holding up the rest of this disappointing game. \n\nBefore we begin I did play this game on classic mode so combat was more like how it was in darksiders 1/2, that being said the game originally had comabt which was more akin to dark souls and the game is heavily inspired by the souls genre in general which means this game is quite the departure from the series (even genesis still feels like a darksiders game despite the camera perspective change.) and because of the change the game is easily the most polarised in the series. \n\nFor this review I'll list pros first as I don't have many. \n\nPro \n\nCombat feels pretty ok, it's weighty and has some decent impact and changing weapons mid combo feels nice, also the selection of weapons is pretty decent as well. \n\nThe abilities that change fury's apperance was pretty decent and a fun way to add to her arsenal, sorta reminded me of Primal. \n\nThe graphics sometimes looked OK. \n\nCons \n\nStory sucks so bad, just really lame fetch quest for fury and some lame message about her discovering herself and her not being a complete jerk, voice acting is weak and the writing is so woefully bad, like the other games aren't Shakespeare but they are decently written enough. \n\nPc performance should not be this bad, at points the game would run at like 15fps and would wildy swing from that to 60fps causing stuttering and slowdown, I have a 3070 so shouldn't really be seeing issues like this especially for a game as basic as this, what a shame this port is so weak when I played remnants perfectly on a rx 580 \n\nFury is a lame character, I found her rage to be annoying and a bit like a diet war, her journey and change in character felt undeserved \n\nCombat when not playing classic just doesn't feel as good, I respect the courage to try something a bit different but ultimately I think it hurt the game \n\nNo horse \n\nLame boss designs and a super cringe final boss who had a terrible design, looked like a death cosplay \n\nMusic was mostly forgettable \n\nIn conclusion this game was obviously made with passion by a small team of devs working with a shoestring budget but these games need to have an epic feel to them, I just hope if we ever get another game in the series they drastically increase the budget and ditch the wannabe souls vibe", "timestamp_created": 1662331959, "timestamp_updated": 1662331959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121739320": {"recommendationid": "121739320", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015501663", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1717, "last_played": 1662352188}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic exploration and puzzles, engaging story, and gorgeous to look at.\nInitially I wasn't a fan of the combat, at least in comparison to the prior games, but it's grown on me.

Darksiders 1 (released almost twenty years before this game) was just a more well-thought out game with tighter controls and a better story. It was released in an era where it was\u2014if not innovative\u2014at least a solid entry of its type. This one feels outdated at release and its story feels pretty derivative and contrived. The controls feel floaty and disconnected. \n\nSecond, it's trying to be something that it's not. The first Darksiders was a lot like Zelda Ocarina of Time in gameplay. The second Darksiders was a lot more like Zelda Twilight Princess with a randomized loot system layered on top. This third Darksiders, like a lot of games these days, is trying to be Dark Souls and it just feels off. It doesn't even pull off Dark Souls very well.\n\nThird, there's a lot of regressive design. This is a game that, when you die, doesn't respawn you near where you died, but instead makes you run all the way back through a mostly deserted level to get back to you were. If you died on a boss, I hope you enjoy a 5-minute run back to the boss arena.\n\nFourth, some of the Metroidvania progress blockers feel heavily contrived. The main character is supposed to be a supreme badass heavenly warrior, and yet some of the early \"you can't go here yet\" walls are literal cobwebs wafting in the breeze. You can see right through them and they look like real-world cobwebs. There's no explanation as to why you can't just tear through them like you do with much of the other scenery.\n\nFifth and finally, boob-armor and battle stilettos are the *only* armor options. I'm fine with cheesecake in games, but not having a \"realistic\" armor option for people who *don't* enjoy cheesecake is a massive oversight. And all of those armors appear to largely just be recolors on the base armor that you start the game with. Why bother adding in different armor sets at all if they all basially look the same? \n\nOverall, I recommend taking a pass on this entry.", "timestamp_created": 1660859580, "timestamp_updated": 1660859580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425468623638153076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120756087": {"recommendationid": "120756087", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089435692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4936, "last_played": 1660694184}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful edition to a wonderful franchise. Darksiders 3 brings back the good ol' action-adventuring in style, and shines doing so. \n\nThe story follows Fury, one of the Four Horsemen. The story is very neat and interesting, like all the other installments, and has some really good plot twists and hype moments. \nGameplay is action combat. It does not offer many moves or much of aerial combat, but it compensates with a wide variety of weapons. Also the combat animations and visuals are juicy af.\n\nThe voice acting and music is phenomenal as well. Most of the gripes I have are with the optimization and performance, the stuttering and the FPS cap at 62. So if I were to rate it I would give it a 7.5/10 with most of the points deducted being for poor optimization.

No, not because of the story but because of the combat system. First, let me be clear. I don't like Soulslike games and I hate it when developers put Soulslike combat into their games just because it's trending and popular among players. Well, in this case, Gunfire Games made it even worse in Darksiders 3. \nYou can dodge enemy attacks and you can counter that with Arcane attacks which have a significant amount of damage than normal attacks. The problem is with timing the dodge in order to execute the Arcane attack. It took me quite a while to get used to it, plus studying the attack patterns of certain enemies and bosses. \nWhat I hate even more is whenever you die, you will be spawned at exactly where you last interacted with the merchant. \nAdding more salt to the wound, THIS GAME CRASHES A LOT! And there is a missing texture for some freaking shipping containers in some levels too! It seems that Gunfire Games abandoned the mission on fixing their game to move onto other projects which is pathetic for an excuse. \nThis game is so bad, I had to use cheats which is harmless in a single player game. I am criticizing this game not because I simply hate it, but because I want the developers and publishers to pull their heads out of their own bungholes and start making games that follows the original concepts and start fixing their own mess.\nEdit: after putting 50+ hours in and unlocking the final achievement, this game burned me out so bad. The Crucible DLC is great for anyone that's familiar with Devil May Cry's Bloody Palace. What I liked more is Keepers of The Void DLC, which rewards you with 4 more weapons that fits your Hollow modes.\nFinal verdict: this game is the weakest among Darksiders 1 and 2", "timestamp_created": 1660467982, "timestamp_updated": 1661965839, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484282881021499634", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120548856": {"recommendationid": "120548856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039992669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 154, "last_played": 1660383593}, "language": "english", "review": "With only 2.6 hours on record, I'm giving up on this one.\n\nEasily the worst of the three main entries. For no reason other than complete lack of original ideas, the developers decided to borrow en masse instead and gave the third entry an immediately apparent identity crisis. You have the whip from Prince of Persia 3, only with bare minimum of that game's combos and environment interactions. You have the Dark Souls' \"clumps\" of souls planted on corpses hanging off cliffs as well as leaving a retrievable soul sack in places where you died. You have the Dead Space 2-like first-person vent crawling. And you have the coma-inducing, blow-your-brains-out dull combat of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. And those are just a few off the top of my head in the first 2.6 hours of play!\n\nI guess the devs decided that Fury's two unique qualities were an obnoxious attitude and squishiness. So now both regular monsters and bosses kill you in three hits. True early on, true in the late game. What's the point of having a health [i]bar[/i] if that's how it works now? The gear system from Darksiders 1 is back in all its uninspered-ness. The confusing multi-colored \"lurchers\" (the collectible skull comets that serve as currency and other resources) are back. The super-counter system is dogshit because you're not even a glass cannon! The counter-attacks after perfect dodges offer as much, or less, DPS than your regular button mashing.\n\nAlso, there are actual living humans now.\n\nI don't think I had a single moment of fun after I took control of the character.

The verticality in levels is always a nice addition but not when all platforming sections feel like you're actively trying to break the game in order to beat them. It's like if gameplay programists and level designers didn't talk something through with each other. Combat is terrible - most oponents are damage sponges with little to no real mechanics behind them, it's just constant of evade and counter, perfectly evading is best way to beat most oponents as you can't really break stance or stagger them with most weapons. Map layout is a little bit convoluted and you might get lost at times but in a bad way as in you don't know where to go next to progress so if you decide to play this i recommend exploring the map methodically so you don't go backtracking too much (which this game forces you to do a lot like in all releases from this series).\nI actually dropped this game cause of how frustrating the damage sponge thing is, i started at hardest difficulty level thinking i'm going into a proper action game experience but then dropped to lowest just to save me time and boredom since there's no mechanical difference between difficulty levels just to find out everything STILL TAKES EONS TO KILL (even most basic skellys).\nIf you have money to spend, put it elsewhere.

There were some good puzzles, and combat is decent with good music. Unfortunately they made a lot of changes to the Darksiders formula that just left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThe story is meh and nothing new is added to the franchise. There is no mini map or overworld map. Checkpoints are mainly where Vulgrim locations are, which in most cases are few and far between. They amped up the difficulty unnecessarily, most of the bosses were cheap AF and some regular enemies can kill you in two hits. I was playing below normal difficulty and just got off playing Darksiders 1 and 2 and was having my ass handed to me in this game. With multiple playthroughs I completed, I must have died at least 500 times. They also changed the weapon system from the second game which is unfortunate, because weapon drops were so satisfying. The third games weapon system is similar to the first but stripped down. And lastly, the excessive collectible b.s from the second game is back. I'm personally sick of collectibles from any game, it pisses me off and raises my blood pressure.\n\nSo if this game is on sale, give it a try. Go in with low expectations.

What it really says is anyone's guess, I suppose.\n\nDarksiders III is of course the sequel to the previous two titles of the same name. Mind you, what the title has to do with the actual plot of the games is a matter of question, as I can't find a cohesive connection between them to save my life. So, to recap the basic plots of them, here ya go: An overly dressed Wish version of Kratos comes to Earth early for the Apocalypse only to find out that Armageddon wasn't scheduled for some time. He gets into a hot bed of trouble, then promptly breaks the Seventh Seal. Then a being that happens to be named Death (not to be confused with the actual personification of death, because that would be confusing) attempts to clear knock-off Kratos' name only to add further to the body count and cause more trouble all around. Are you with me so far? Great. So, it turns out that there are two other Horsemen, just not who you would expect. It turns out that in this mess of a universe, Famine, Pestilence, and Conquest are retired or on vacation or something. Instead we get Mildly Frustrated And Extremely Impatient (Fury) and her brother, Irritated Contrarian (Strife). Darksiders III deals with Mildly Frustrated and her journey to find and capture/kill the Seven Deadly Sins: Jealous Spinster, Angry Beefcake, Antisemitic Jewish Caricature, Obese American, Red-Flag Mommy-Domme, Tentacle-Porn Monstrosity, and Arrogant Angel. Without getting into the nitty-gritty, that explains as much as you need to know about the story.\n\nNow, much like it's predecessors, Darksiders III suffers from the same identity crisis that they did. The first game played like God of War with a boatload Zelda puzzle mechanics and a stolen Portal Gun; the second was an action looter with some Zelda puzzle mechanics, a Doom gunfight sequence, and a stolen Portal Gun; and this game feels like a rip-off of Dark Souls with prettier set-dressing, significantly less Zelda puzzle mechanics, and no return of the aforementioned Portal Gun. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, having a narrative connection but no solid game structure in common puts this series in an awkward place that doesn't really allow for accessibility to most players willing to experience the titles without experience whiplash. All in all, Darksiders III in comparison to its counterparts feels rather stripped down, which actually makes the entire experience all the more tolerable and surprisingly fun.\n\nThat isn't to say that this game is without fault, because it is a bit of a mess in places. The currency system is effectively broken and incredibly easy to manipulate and outside of increasing character level, it's useless. Drops of helpful items are plentiful and easily obtained, provided you're willing to slaughter whatever monstrosity happens to be around. The combat returns to being a torrid affair between two buttons, which makes the overall experience stale after a while. Fortunately the game is rather short, able to be completed in about 14 hours, and that is without skipping content. Mind you, I'm not about to purchase the DLC. If there's one thing I've learned from this series, it's that the added material is often not worth the trouble. Completely unrelated to the above complaints, I feel it is absolutely absurd that the characters of the first two games can easily destroy cars while Mildly Frustrated can't manage to do so unless she's in a fancy glowing rampage. Whether that is misogyny on the developer's part is a matter of supreme mystery.\n\nAfter weighing how I wanted to present my feelings of this title, I can't in good conscience say I would actually recommend it. While, yes I did enjoy it, and it does a fair job of functioning as a standalone game if you squint really hard, it still carries the baggage of its predecessors which are cumbersome to say the least. I suppose it would fair well as a bargain purchase, just don't try to backtrack to the first two unless you're as much a glutton for misery as I am.", "timestamp_created": 1659899855, "timestamp_updated": 1659899913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511939704418182373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120234354": {"recommendationid": "120234354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080316404", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1431, "last_played": 1659896541}, "language": "english", "review": "Besides the checkpoints being shit , the game is fantastic.

I first played it a year or two ago, but only got a few hours in before it sort of just faded into my unfinished games pile, but I'm glad I decided to come back to finish it.\n\nI won't risk spoiling story stuff for anyone considering playing it, but I will say I was pleasantly surprised by the story. I wasn't expecting much from the outset, considering Darksiders stories and lore only really exist on one of two levels: completely absent or so mind bogglingly convoluted it physically hurts your brain to try to comprehend. This game though, it keeps the story as a subtle presence for a while before ramping it up more in the later stages, and while some of the connecting elements did lose me toward the end, I actually came away really enjoying Fury's character arc, and how she reacts to the things that happen to her. For once a Darksiders protagonist has character growth, something I'm fairly certain War and Death were missing in previous entries. While the story isn't earth-shattering (since this is a prequel game, kind of easy to see some twists coming when you already know them from previous titles), it's a big plus for continued interest in the story imo, Fury definitely takes her place as my favourite of the horsemen seen so far.\n\nI'll also give them props for doing so many of the side characters so well, especially the seven deadly sins you're hunting. Each is very well acted, and in the short time you have with each before their boss fights, they get personified excellently. Lust was my favourite; quite refreshing to have a game depicting the embodiment of lust as something other than a scantily clad, permanently horny woman, props for that! The other supporting characters are great too, the Lord of the Hollows, Ulthane, the Watcher, they all play their parts wonderfully, and the voice acting is superb, most especially Fury's.\n\nI know some people were turned off by the switch in combat / gameplay from DS1/2 to a more meaty, slower, dodge-focused style, and I'll say I can definitely sympathise with those opinions. On the whole, the gameplay is probably the weakest part of Darksiders 3. It's fine, but it's plagued with issues, principle amongst them is the overtly high difficulty of the game that turned a lot of people off, but just to sound off on the others real quick: flying enemies are a chore, groups will easily flank/stunlock you from off-screen, dodging doesn't work against groups even if you time one attack right, the others will still hit you mid-dodge, inputs frequently get dropped mid-combat due to staggers + lack of animation cancelling, dodging is the only method of avoiding damage which funnels the entire design of the combat through a single mechanic and stunts any potential the game could have had for interesting evolutions to the gameplay over-time.\n\nI got used to the combat after a while, but I'm not blind to it's inherent flaws, the game IS too hard for most people on the normal setting, it turns too many people away and has led to most of the negative reviews that I can see. I know Dark Souls d**k riders like to act as if beating a hard game is some right of passage to judging others who can't manage it, but I'll remind the rest of you; it's okay to acknowledge that a game is too hard. It's okay to criticise a games difficulty. It's completely valid to not like game because it's too tricky to get into, and no amount of morons on the internet trying to denigrate you with 'git gud' will excuse the fact that some games are only difficult because of poor design. This is definitely one of those. I beat it because I stuck with it long enough to get into the groove of the combat, a lot of people don't have the time or simply don't want to bother with that. Toning the difficulty down for the normal or easy settings would only have helped this game imo.\n\nSpeaking of combat, let me briefly touch on the DLCs for this game. There's two; The Crucible and Keepers of the Void. Hard pass on the crucible; it's complete tosh. It's just 100 waves of combat against different enemies; it's tedious, boring, unfair at times because of stunlock instakills, and not worth anything it rewards you with. I only beat it because I'm an achievement wh*re. Keepers of the Void is decent though, and the reward armour you get is top tier imo. It's something you need to play alongside the main game though; don't pick it up for playing after because it will not offer much. But the bosses are neat, the new areas are fun enough if a little samey, it's a decent addition to the game for what it is.\n\nI'll confess I wasn't super into the semi-open world thing at the start, but it's honestly a nice edition. Multiple times I took a break from the story path to travel back through old areas, using new hollows to open up paths and find loot. It felt good, even if in the end it wasn't all that grandiose. Most all the loot in this game falls into one of three categories; shards, lurchers, or upgrade materials. Shards are consumables to use at-will during gameplay, lurchers are basically the exp currency that you can use to level up or buy other items, and upgrade materials are used for the bulk of the games progression. The latter is the best to find, since upgrading your weapons and enhancements can confer some pretty nice and noticeable boosts to Fury's power. All in all, the upgrade and levelling up systems are quite shallow; there's not a great deal of depth to them besides just make the numbers bigger, but they allow just enough dopamine release to make finding these things feel fun and rewarding, at least for me.\n\nOne last thing of note, the game has a very nice new game plus system called Armageddon mode. Essentially it's just NG+ but the game will get progressively harder each time you clear the story, with nine total levels of difficulty. But what's neat about it is that NG+ actually introduces new items and enemy spawns, and opens up new progression like being able to upgrade armours. It's a really neat set of additions imo, and I'm already committed to doing another run of the game thanks to it.\n\nI think this is definitely my favourite of the core Darksiders series so far. I've not tried Genesis yet, but this one certainly left a better impression on me than DS1/2 did. If you're into third person hacky/slashy combat affairs, it might be right up your alley, so long as you can adjust to the difficulty and get used to having to dodge enemy attacks 30 times a minute.

You only want to play this if you are desperate for more Darksiders, otherwise just play the two previous installments.\n\nMore specifically:\n\nThe protagonist, Fury, is unlikeable and mostly boring. The game makes some character development noises, but if it comes at all, it comes too late. To be fair to her, War had similar issues. In that they are both very one-note and not interesting to listen to. But they had fixed that with the sequel. Death was charming and could swap neatly between humour and being more serious. Fury, meanwhile, goes right back to basically being no character at all.\n\nHere is how practically every exchange in the game goes:\n\nEnemy: \"Dismissive insults.\"\nFury: \"Dismissive death threats.\"\nEnemy: \"More Dismissive insults.\"\nFury: *Does a big angry*\n\nAnd thats about it. Copy paste this about a dozen times and you already know the story. There are the occasional good lines here and there, but it is nowhere near the quality of DS 2.\n\nThe Gameplay has the same boils that a lot of the rest of the series does. Namely, it's one good hair is to be found in combat, yet it is too averse to actually give you enough of it. Combat arenas are often interspaced with meaningless, boring platforming. The chain grab in particular is a dramatic little madam, and has a solid 50% chance not to work half the time. The puzzles have the usual issue in a game with ability unlocks, in that you will frequently be staring at something for a while, unsure whether you are just missing an ability or are actually capable of solving it in your current state.\n\nIn cases where you do have the needed ability, most of the puzzles are still unengaging. usually its just rubbing yourself against surfaces until you find the thing you can interact with, be that a wall, switch or some of the chain hangers. Optional side areas will to rarely lead to any interesting combat, and too frequently to a dead end with a bit of loot or a human to save.\n\nThe actual combat is, as stated, the best part. But it too has issues. Playing the game in the \"default\" mode, which I strongly recommend against, no longer lets you cancel out of attacks with dodges. This in turn generally makes a careful approach more successful. Sadly, this makes many fights really boring. The combat works best when you are in the enemies face, weaving moves and dodges. But the telegraphs are so quick, and the punishment for dying often harsh, that its just not worth it.\n\nThe game also jumped on the \"Let's steal some DNA from Dark Souls\" bandwagon. You now have corpse runs, and lose a needless amount of time when dying to get back where you were. The game also doesn't mark teleport locations in terms of how close they are to objectives. So if you lose track of the 6 teleport locations in an area, that all look the same, you'll be backtracking a lot.\n\nThere are other niggles. The attribute point rewarding items also increase your level, and thus the amount you pay for leveling up. Making you averse to using them. The upgrade character has a completely pointless hammering animation, that forces you to wait 5 seconds before you get to talk to him. In cases where you are going between him and the shop demon, you constantly have to wait for either of them to finish their dumb animation before you are allowed to interact.\n\nAll in all, the game is actually just kinda bad in most ways.

Darksiders 1 is best know for its use of dynamic hack and slash combat that felt heavy and satisfying while the story was in the background being rather minor. So combat in the foreground story in the back. However, Darksiders 2 was more of an RPG experience, the hack and slash style was dialed down a bit to focus on new puzzle mechanics and the story which is the strongest narrative wise it has ever been. So now we have Darksiders 3, it doesn't have better combat than 1 and doesn't have a better story than 2. What we have here is a middle ground where the story and combat aren't ground breaking. It does not excel in the combat or have an enthralling story that keeps you entirely engaged. It has proven to be a very middle of the road experience with the only real thing it has over its predecessors being the graphics. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad game, it's just not a great game.\n\nHowever when you play a game the actions and reasoning of the main character is what drives the player's interest in the game. Wrath went on his journey to try and to prove his innocence dimply and sweet, Death was trying to prove Wrath's innocence while simultaneously going on a personal journey involving his past which we see is full of regret as well as self doubt/hatred leading to his eventual emotional growth allowing him to come to terms with what he did and himself. Meanwhile fury simply wants to fight things and somehow this very one dimensional all encompassing character trail that is front and center for 75% of the game at the last minute takes a very inorganic turn that shows the level of writing at work. Especially when she appears to be entirely uninteresting in the very story where she is meant to be the focal point. It's just odd how badly they wrote her character.\n\nAs far as the game as a whole it is a solid 7.5/10 as far as MC's in quality of story that is a generous 5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1659327742, "timestamp_updated": 1659327742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608666598796844482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119742478": {"recommendationid": "119742478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126363854", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1224, "last_played": 1660677136}, "language": "english", "review": "not as difficult as dark souls even at hardest difficulty but still more fun", "timestamp_created": 1659158158, "timestamp_updated": 1659158158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119728697": {"recommendationid": "119728697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146546438", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1162, "last_played": 1606494110}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego, el mejor de la saga Darksiders aunque tiene bastantes bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1659136670, "timestamp_updated": 1659136670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119727516": {"recommendationid": "119727516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266700586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1662073953}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Pese a que no es Darksiders II y la jinete no tiene el carisma de Muerte... bueno! tampoco Guerra lo ten\u00eda no? es un juegazo.

Though it is a bit difficult to recommend this game. I know when it first came out a lot of Darksider fans weren't as happy with it.\n\nI think there are still some that aren't as happy cause they went with a more difficult (some may call it \"dark souls\" feel) gameplay and I can see that when I started playing this game. But I wanted to support THQ Nordic so we could continue getting more Darksider games especially a fourth one and/or maybe one where you have all 4 of the horsemen fighting together? idk.\n\nI stuck it out and although it was clear this game was a lot harder then the previous 2 games it still was a concurrent/tandem story to the first 2 games. But there were quite a few changes which made it less appealing. Like getting rid of some of the loot, making some parts of it more simplified.\n\nAlso the fact it made you feel weaker with the fact you had to dodge SO much. Also it seemed like they went out of their way to make the game harder. Like making it so you do less damage. But can get more damage even from usually weak enemies. \n\nThis also didn't help they made the main character a girl thing in a way. \n\nI was fine/had no problem with that, and actually kinda happy they made one of the four horsemen (well I guess should say horse.. people? lol) a girl/woman/thing? But now the game that suppose to have a strong female character seems weak? :S She definitely looks bad a$$ but her attacks barely do anything. :( Kinda not fair when the previous 2 games the boy/man/things could easily tear through demons etc. But who knows. \n\nAlso apparently this was the start of locking away stuff behind a paywall/DLC which is also not cool. \n\nI did end up playing through and beating the game though I know at least a few times playing through a level a number of times pissed off cause I kept getting cheated out of a win. \n\nI think even to this day if you play through the games starting with 1, then 2, and then start this one (3) you will find yourself struggling for a little while to get used to this big change to the gameplay. Though I know after the first time later on it was a bit easier to get back into it. This game just wasn't as much fun as the first two that I can remember.\n\nAnd while waiting for a darksiders 4 (and still waiting for even word of it, as of writing this review) I know they did come out with another darksiders game after this one but it was also a departure from the FPS/RPG games. It is a darksiders top down fighting game which is more like the very old school SNES type games just with better graphics. As soon as I saw that game it really didn't interest me all that much. \nIt reminds me of the Gauntlet Legends game that released on steam a number of years ago that I was all excited about to re-live my N64 gauntlet Legends days only to be let down with how bland/simple the game was compared to that old N64 game. \n\nNo idea if Darksiders Genesis did well or not but having just War and Strife (the one horseman you haven't gotten to play as yet in these games who apparently has lots of guns) in a top down fighting game kinda is a let down to me. I was expecting Darksiders 4 playing as strife and with FPS elements since he is the horseman known for having lots of guns. And since they seem to be wanting to try something new with each of the horsemen that's what I was expecting. Maybe we will get something like that eventually but so far all we have gotten after this game was Genesis which didn't appeal to me but you should check it out if you want to continue down this path or hold off your itch for more Darksiders games.", "timestamp_created": 1656565632, "timestamp_updated": 1656565632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117898190": {"recommendationid": "117898190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083120784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1927, "last_played": 1656537257}, "language": "english", "review": "top notch gameplay, has a very darksouls feel with the leveling, gorgeous level design, 10/10 game for me", "timestamp_created": 1656553632, "timestamp_updated": 1656553632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117834097": {"recommendationid": "117834097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868587185", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2610, "last_played": 1658978428}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1656471520, "timestamp_updated": 1656471520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117774034": {"recommendationid": "117774034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070975020", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1147, "last_played": 1656418641}, "language": "english", "review": "Always loved the Darksiders franchise.

In essence, the game personifies the 'bare minimum' positive review I can give.\n\nWith that said, you can really tell the devs struggled with this one -which is super bizarre considering we're on the 3rd game in the series (excluding Genesis) and the developers still haven't really decided on any solid frame of the series outside that it needs to be Zelda-dungeon crawler with exploration elements. The combat system has been historically 'hack &  slash', but this one released with the slower 'Souls' combat formula. This seems super out of place in some parts, where no enemies have next to no windup on attacks (a staple in the souls like); but still deal tremendous damage. Contrastly, bosses themselves have massive 'h&s' sized health bars, which you'll need to whittle down while dodging - which feels much more akin to DevilMayCry than the Souls games. You can tell the devs were flip-flopping late in development because they released the classic form of the combat system out in relatively short order. \n\nCombat aside, Voice acting is middle of the road. Really nothing special to write home about. Everyone does a fine job. Music is subpart-average. The plot is profoundly underwhelming for an entry in the DS series, which usually has some really good plot points and characters. Fury is easily the most dull out of all 4 horseman (and we really haven't seen much of Strife as of now outside of Genesis). \n\nConclusion: A decent romp.\n If you enjoy DS series; you'd might as well try this one.

Perhaps I've missed the \"Souls-like\" Tag and had similar expectations as prior games, still, please don't jump in to this game for the reasons above, unless you don't mind the differences and as well as being Darksiders fan.\n\nThe story was alright, great character development with decent background music. Level designs are cool, graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Good amount of [strike]jumpscares[/strike] ambushes by certain enemies, so have to be more observant and react on time. Combat is pretty nice, although it feels very different when compared to prior games and it can be really difficult to adapt to, especially in the beginning. It can also get pretty dull quick until you reach some point, and it will just get better. Game isn't very forgiving, players will be punished badly even for small mistakes. To play this game will require good patience to attack and dodge. There is no blocking system in this game, other than some enemies that does. Combat Mode splits in two types: [b]Default[/b] and [b]Classic[/b]. The only difference is the \"Classic\" feels more of [i]Hack-n-Slash[/i] in terms of able to cancel attack animation and dodge immediately after, while \"Default\" is stricter. I played at [b]Balanced[/b] difficulty [i](Normal)[/i] and often struggles at some points.. or rather, many. Maybe I'm that bad at video games, furious, but after re-trying numerous times over and over again, learning from mistakes and to see the outcomes.. is really satisfying, knowing that I've completed the game when I *almost feel want to like, just drop it during the first day of playing. Will consider coming back to complete this game on NG+ Apocalyptic, after when I've decided to re-play all the Darksiders games some time again. \n\nMy only rants are that there isn't any Map for navigation and no manual saves. Sure it's understandably supposed to be a difficult/challenging game and there are checkpoints, but honestly, it can be real frustrating at times. Encountered a few minor bugs, one time game crashed out of nowhere but fortunately, it's not too bad. Sometimes there's also little \"white\" spots which appears randomly due to temporary missing textures as it loads, so it isn't your PC's fault. Overall I find the game still very much enjoyable after investing about 10-ish hours, it was a great experience. Again, I'd only recommend this game if you don't have high expectations and is up for some good challenges. If otherwise, skip this. Consider looking up for one or two Walkthrough clips with commentary, then decide if you'd wanna give it a try on [b]Darksiders III[/b]. \n.\n.\n.\n[i]Can't wait for [b]Darksiders IV[/b] [i](not Darksiders Genesis),[/i] if... it's being developed.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1650737482, "timestamp_updated": 1651201642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114329003": {"recommendationid": "114329003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123193011", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 26747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21292, "last_played": 1677619283}, "language": "english", "review": "Darksiders 3 (D3) is a platforming hack-n-slash game, in which you play as one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse (or \"The Four\", as they are called in-game). It takes place [spoiler] after the prologue of D1 but before the start of D2 [/spoiler] and follows the story and development of Fury (I guess she is a stand-in for \"Plague\", who was the actual third biblical horseman, but for a combat setting this just does work better), who is tasked with catching and apprehending the seven deadly sins.\nI say \"development of Fury\", because this is probably the first instalment in the series, where a character is significantly different from how they were at the start [spoiler] (War HAS uncovered some things, but he is pretty much the same persona he was at the start - big, burly, yet smart guy with anger issues and a propensity for excessive violence and Death has faced his demons throughout D2, but pretty much has the same resolve and same loyalties as he did when he started off) [/spoiler], which is honestly a breath of fresh air. Partly because character development is a strong selling point for me, and partly because at the start Fury is .... not exactly a mature person... :-) So if you like character development and/or didn't like a personality trait of the protagonist you saw somewhere - she will change. ;-)\nOne of the two main things you do in any hack-n-slash game is combat and I am pleased to say D3 combat is spot-on! It is dynamic, fluid, based around attacks, counter-attacks and dodges (there is no parrying or stamina, Fury is no wimp after all... :-D) and learning enemy movesets. The latter is quite important, as dodging involves either a \"dodge\" or a \"perfect dodge\". The former merely avoids damage, the latter lets you perform a counter-attack, either with Furys whip (her main weapon), or one of her Hollows. You start off blank, with only your base abilities (which contain the Chaos Form, more on that later), but as the story progresses you gain the ability to imbue Fury with Fire, Lightning, Void (basically the power of a supermassive black hole) or Stasis (basically Frost). Each comes with their own perks and lets Fury perform different feats. \nOne thing that seemed strange to me in D2 was, that Death picked up equipment and you geared him up. In the lore The Four are presented as having been outfitted by the policing force of the Universe (called \"The Charred Council\") and given incredible powers and equipment and Death just strides off and picks up the first common item a skeleton drops, because it is better than what he has... In D3 this is no longer the case - enemies do drop things, but they are either consumables which can temporarily improve her stats, components which she can use to upgrade her gear, or soul shards (called \"Lurchers\" for some reason) which give her varying amounts of souls (a currency she can buy level-ups and other things with). There is no inventory or weight limit and, for the most part, drops for materials and gear are hard-set, while consumables, soul clusters and lower tier materials have a chance to drop from pretty much any enemy, meaning that there is no grinding for materials and when you want to upgrade your weapon beyond a certain point and do not have the materials for it, you will need to boot up New Game+ (NG+ is a game mode in which you start off with most of the items you had at the end of your previous playthrough, but otherwise \"restart\" the game with enemies more buffed than they were before. you can however change the difficulty level each time.) Whenever Fury dies, all enemies and destructible environmental objects respawn, meaning that if you want to farm souls to level Fury up, you can (but do not have to, you will get enough to have a good time of it). \nThe gear is very dynamic, each hollow has its own weapon, with two varieties to choose from and each variety LOOKS different, but actually has the exact same moveset and combos, which is not necessarily bad, but it is kind of strange that Fury uses hand claws to smash the ground as if she were using flails... Other than that - each item has one slot, in which you can put one of the several Enhancements. These are basically \"gems\" and each one has a different effect. These effects are separated into active (only activates when you use the weapon it is slotted into) and passive (active regardless of whether you are using said weapon or not, it just needs to be slotted in a weapon listed in your inventory, even if that weapon is not activated by having unlocked the hollow it is linked to). So once you have unlocked all weapons, you can have up to 10 passive enhancements active (2 weapons per hollow, the whip and a throwing weapon you get later on). You can also get a number of armors, which either provide very specific bonuses (damage improvement of a certain hollow form, getting more souls when breaking open soul lurchers or mitigating damage. Varying quality levels of armors provide varying amounts/levels of bonuses, with the epic one being the most protective and the most buffing (you get it when finishing the \"Keepers Of The Void\" DLC, which also has pretty epic fights btw). Other than that gear is pretty unobtrusive and after a bit of customisation lets you focus on the games main selling points - combat, puzzles, story and exploration.\nUnlike D2, this game takes place on Earth and sees Fury exploring the \"immediate\" ramifications of the Apocalypse. I put that in quotes because there are trees EVERYWHERE, so obviously at least 20 years must have passed, but I digress. I feel like the map is smaller this time then it was in D2, however it is less empty than it was in that game, with secrets and side paths all over the place - you can pretty much get anywhere from anywhere, with side-paths opening up as you get more hollows. Puzzles also very much rely on them, as some places will remain unreachable if you do not have the right hollow unlocked and equipped. Also - in comparison to D2, this time you have to walk everywhere, due to certain events which take place early on in the game, but I will not spoil it here. The exploration is, all-in-all, very satisfying, rewarding and easy to get used to.\nStory-wise the game also ties up a few plot-holes [spoiler] (such as why a demon of greed like Vulgrim even helps War in D1 without asking for a fee, why a seeming loner like Ulthane doesn't seem to mind him either, why Strifes guns are no longer in his possession, .....) [/spoiler]. Talking about the games story without spoiling it is pretty much impossible, so I will just say that in true Darksiders fashion, there are a number of surprises and plot-twists, which I honestly did not see coming and are VERY much alluded to from the start of the game, [spoiler] such as that the Talisman of Sin only lights up when the first boss steps up before you, not when they are watching you from afar [/spoiler]. \nMy final verdict is, that is you are looking for an action-RPG game with LOTS of combat, a very good story, high amounts of character development and a rather rich story, which will leave a fair bit to your interpretation, Darksiders 3 is a game I genuinely believe you have a high chance of enjoying.

It obviously takes inspiration from the souls genre and I think it doesn't fit the series well.\nNow let's get to the real problems: technical difficulties and textures.\nAt times you are required to use your whip as a rope to get across cliffs. Well, it doesn't always work. At times the game wouldn't get the input and would make Fury attack instead of using her whip to get across the cliff.\nAnother thing that's bothering me way more than it should is missing textures. There are some spots in the game where textures are missing and they are replaced with the grey and white checkers. I checked online to understand if it was a problem with my copy, but it turns out that it's a very common problem and the devs decided to abandon the game anyway.

This game is all about perfect dodging and it is very unforgiving when it comes to taking damage; you can't even rest at the ''bonfires'' (Vulgrim spots) and you need to pay souls if you want to recharge the healing without having to die. Most enemies are very fast in their movement and can keep up with you without any trouble, but here's the absolute worst part : every single enemy is designed to throw you off with their attacks! They will clearly prepare to swing and even make a little sound sometimes, but that doesn't matter because they stop for like half a second mid swing just to mess with you. Some attacks seem impossible to avoid at all. For example : I stopped playing at Gluttony, a boss which swings around the whole arena 2-3 times in a row and you cannot dodge even by timing perfectly; you must run in a corner and wait.\n\nLong story short : the game feels like a very unfair fan-made Dark Souls rip off; everything about it feels wrong.

Founded in 2005 by some young blood (I'm talking about VG development experience, since the most experienced person there was probably [b]Marvin A. Donald[/b], who worked on 1999 RPG game called [b]Revenant[/b]), it quickly became a part of [b]THQ[/b] family. Which... turned out to be a terrible decision. Just because it led to their death after only two games developed. And it's [i]very[/i] unfair, because, let's just admit it \u2013 [b]Darksiders[/b] series was pretty good. Despite the fact that there was nothing original in it and the entire thing was just a bunch of stolen ideas mixed together? It was still good. Very good. Having a [b]Zelda[/b] game with [b]God of War[/b] melee combat, [b]Devil May Cry[/b]-like guns and [b]BLIZZARD[/b]-like visuals? It worked. [b]Darksiders[/b] games were very satisfying and it was easy to forgive them for copy / pasted approach.\n\nLike I said, it felt very unfair when the guys died together with [b]THQ[/b], who slowly sank due to a long series of failures, which included [b]Red Faction: Armageddon[/b] and [b]uDraw[/b] gimmick nobody ever asked for. [b]Darksiders[/b] franchise, though? It survived. Unfortunately, it didn't go to [b]PlatinumGames[/b], that was interested in it (just imagine [b]Darksiders[/b] game from people behind [b]MadWorld[/b], [b]Bayonetta[/b] and [b]Nier: Automata[/b]). Instead, it was purchased by [b]Nordic Games[/b], together with two other [b]THQ[/b] franchises \u2013 [b]Red Faction[/b] and [b]MX vs. ATV[/b]. Naturally, they didn't pay for nothing, so... yeah. Here comes [b]Darksiders III[/b]. From a new developer - [b]Gunfire Games[/b]. There's a trick, though.\n\nSee, after [b]THQ[/b] died, [b]Vigil Games[/b]' CEO [b]David Adams[/b] was approached by [b]Cevat Yerli[/b], CEO of [b]CRYTEK[/b], creators of [b]Crysis[/b] franchise. [b]Mr. Yerli[/b] loved what [b]Mr. Adams[/b] and his crew did in [b]Darksiders[/b] and wanted to work with them. That's how [b]CRYTEK USA[/b] was born. Pretty soon, the guys announced their first game - [b]Hunt: Horrors of the Gilded Age[/b]. Which was supposed to be co-op oriented spiritual successor of [b]Darksiders[/b]. Even though [b]Crytek[/b] did bid on [b]Darksiders[/b] during the [b]THQ[/b] bankruptcy auction, they just didn't have enough money to win. So, spiritual successor was the only way for ex-[b]Vigil[/b] team to continue doing their thing.\n\nTalking about money, by the way. Unfortunately for us all, [b]CRYTEK[/b] didn't do well financially. And pretty soon it turned out that they can't even pay their new employees on time. As the result, [b]CRYTEK USA[/b] was shut down long before [b]Hunt: Horrors of the Gilded Age[/b] became a thing. The project was soon re-launched by [b]CRYTEK[/b] and became [b]Hunt: Showdown[/b], while [b]David Adams[/b] founded yet another company - [b]Gunfire Games[/b]. And that's, ladies and gentlemen, who worked on [b]Darksiders III[/b]. In other words, in a way, the old [b]Darksiders[/b] team is back to work on their old series again. Sure, [b]Mr. Adams[/b]'s team underwent a lot of changes and wasn't really the same at that point, but still, quite a lot of people who worked on the originals (like [b]Nicolas Fikac[/b], [b]Kenneth Bassham[/b] and [b]Colin Bonstead[/b]) were still there. So... it's a happy ending, right? [b]Vigil[/b]'s back and they brought [b]Darksiders[/b] back to us?\n\nWell, the funniest (saddest?) thing is \u2013 no. No, they didn't. Because when you'll see [b]Darksiders III[/b] for the first time, you'll be like \u201cSay wha...\u201d. Because despite everything I've said above, [b]Darksiders III[/b] feels like something made by people who had absolutely no idea about what the original [b]Darksiders[/b] series was all about. That's exactly why I thought that such a long history lesson is important. [b]Darksiders III[/b] feels exactly like one of those games, in which some new publisher purchases popular franchise and then hires some new guys to make a new game. Which feels nothing like the originals. Just because those new guys don't know a thing about the old titles, while publisher has their own vision. Remember how it was when [b]Fallout[/b] series became a property of [b]ZeniMax Media[/b]? That's pretty much what we're talking about here.\n\nThat's right. [b]Darksiders III[/b] is an entirely different game. With the entirely different kind of gameplay. And the only thing that connects it to the originals is the story. Which... was never the strongest point of [b]Darksiders[/b] games. I mean, seriously. [b]Darksiders[/b] games just threw some basic mythology references at us and called it a day. And as the result, I totally didn't care about the fact that the old characters (like good ol' [b]War[/b], for example) appeared here. I didn't care about all that blah-blah-blah stuff before and I didn't care about it here. Even though the writing does feel weird this time, since [b]Gunfire[/b] added some cheap humor for whatever reason (you know how there's that certain guy in your class who desperately tries to be funny without much luck? And it looks pathetic? That's what we talking about here), all I cared about is gameplay.\n\nAll I wanted is more of that satisfying [b]Zelda[/b]-like experience. Especially since even [b]Nintendo[/b] can't provide us with the old-school [b]Zelda[/b] experience anymore (you may like [b]Breath of the Wild[/b], you may dislike it, but let's just admit it \u2013 it's totally different from what we used to have before it). Guess what [b]Gunfire[/b] gave us instead? Well, they gave us [b]Dark Souls[/b]. That's right, people. What we have here is yet another [b]Souls[/b]-like game. Even though every second major game nowadays is [b]Souls[/b]-like, some smartass decided that we need yet another one. But OK. Broken expectations aside, maybe this game is actually good? Maybe, despite the fact that it's \u201cyet another one of those\u201d game, it does some really nice job? Providing us with some especially juicy, polished and satisfying experience? Maybe it's so good that it's actually worth to care? Well, the answer here is very short \u2013 no.\n\nWhat we've got here is yet another \u201cpoor man's [b]Dark Souls[/b]\u201d. I can't say it's completely unplayable, of course. Quite the opposite \u2013 if you're a die-hard fan of such games and is currently out of new titles to play, [b]Darksiders III[/b] will totally do. The problem is \u2013 there's nothing unique about it. Which, technically, was true about two previous games too, but while two previous [b]Darksiders[/b] games were surprisingly smooth and there was clearly not enough [b]Zelda[/b] clones on market, [b]Darksiders III[/b] feels pretty cheap and clunky, while, like I said, there are way, [i]way[/i] too many of such games around.\n\nIt's just that \u2013 core mechanics in [b]Darksiders III[/b] feel a bit cheap and clunky (the game feels almost like something from the seventh generation of video game consoles), level design is either too dumb and straightforward or forces some really cheap and annoying puzzles on you (which aren't hard at all, just... you know, annoying as heck and can even cause some cheap deaths), the weapons / tools are not satisfying at all, the bosses are pretty boring and uninspired, [b]DLC[/b] doesn't add anything interesting (seriously, one of those is just a ridiculously cheap arena), etc, etc, etc. In other words, [b]Darksiders III[/b] is totally playable and even has its moments now and then (I actually liked the fact that there are more puzzles than we usually have in [b]Souls[/b]-like games), there's just... no real reason to waste your time on it. There are way, [i]way[/i] better [b]Souls[/b]-like games on market, while [b]Darksiders III[/b] fails to provide you with a single strong reason to choose it over many others.

Menus are simple in design with a couple of minor annoyances (sometimes you have to exit one menu upgrade and then re-enter to get items to populate). Music was slightly on the short side with not much selection. Sounds and effects were done right with key moments being part of the game (ie: If you hear something either through an enemy or collectable, then consider yourself notified). Game does require some significant hardware upgrade (which is what I did - I'm now using an i7 12th Gen with RTX 3080) but ran very smooth. Loading, transition points were quick and in-game saves were plentiful. Another point to note was the camera: Allot of cheap, free shots from enemies because the camera didn't swing around fast enough, so take your time with playing...try to draw out one enemy at a time from a cluster either through noise or using your throwing weapon. Story was interesting to follow and your compass helped with navigation in case you got lost.\n\nThe combat is challenging in the first 20-30 levels, but once you figure the counter attack, you're going to use this ALL the time. You deliver both base damage and arcane damage (stacked) if the counter attack is done correctly. I was able to harness my chain and fire weapons to +11 for each before upgrading the rest. You are also going to find that allot of enemies are more predictable when you eliminate their range attack, so stay as close as you can, to help with the counter attack. Wrath and Havoc attacks are treated independently. Use Wrath for minor boss battles and Havoc for major. Using each at the appropriate time will go a long way. There is going to be moment in the game, when you realise that the saving grace to your character are going to be 2 things: running for avoidance and dodging for extra counter-damage.\n\nThe best part of the game was the exploration and collectables. Multiple types of puzzles with different solutions. You most certainly will use all 4 types of character forms. I spent more time trying to find all the hidden items than anything else. The game offers different scenarios and environments to explore. Don't forget to look for small tunnels or openings in the ceiling (that red glow you see in the roof probable leads somewhere important).\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing whats next in the Darksiders franchise - maybe with Strife?", "timestamp_created": 1649041786, "timestamp_updated": 1649041786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113298363": {"recommendationid": "113298363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838147152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1445, "last_played": 1649793158}, "language": "english", "review": "TBH, nothing like the previous games....\n\nYes there are cool mechanics, but there are a lot of things that are not done well.

I played it on easy with classic combat and got a Darksidersesque experience. I had a 4 hour playthrough on the soulslike difficulty settings and I just didn't enjoy it, I wanted to play Darksiders not Darksouls. They've downgraded since Darksiders II and went back to the old inventory system that Darksiders had. There are no weapon or gear drops with random stats. You'll only get consumable items as drops throughout the game. Crafting is very minimalistic and not engaging or interesting to say the least. If you have mats, dump them on upgrades and that's literally the jist of it. Story in comparison to the previous titles, DS3 somehow tries to be more but ends up being much less than what it's striving to be. The story for an old fan of the series is questionable rather than enjoyable. It's that cheap modern WoW mindset of random twists and raise questions but don't answer anything. They wrote the main story so poorly that the ending narrative for the game was a side quest. Enough said. Combat is fun, combat is engaging and very well done.\n\nI'd give Darksiders III a 7/10 rating. It's not a poor game in itself, it's just a poor installment in the Darksiders series. I would play this over the first title game but I would also pick Darksiders II over this any day.

RE would mix up their strats and could confuse you sometimes, but as you play you would adapt to them. They also don't attack one by one or wait for you to do a combo, they WILL gang up on you and that's a plus from me. The bosses on the other hand were bland and I could've cared less fighting them. I think maybe some QTE and better phases could've spice up that area. 3/10 bosses 7/10 enemies\n\nStory: Basically same like the others just with the current horseman event. Fury is charged with collecting the sins and she discovers the truth to the Armageddon on her journey. 6/10\n\nFew gripes: missing textures, a weird crash if you minimize the game sometimes, abysmal Armour in a DLC, no side quest, a bit short (first run in under 20 hours).\n\nLoved: Gameplay/combat, fury herself, the music, the environment, the difficulty, it didn't drag the story one forever and that it was less buggy than DS2!\n\nI give this a 7/10, I had fun and that's what was important to me", "timestamp_created": 1646682761, "timestamp_updated": 1646682761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111710862": {"recommendationid": "111710862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198975733350", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 657, "last_played": 1669082434}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy buen juego", "timestamp_created": 1646608571, "timestamp_updated": 1646608571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111676407": {"recommendationid": "111676407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275492426", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1646573245}, "language": "english", "review": "poor game design with repetitive and meaningless battles.

But i enjoy in-game art, and different weapons are really nice, some mechanincs with weapons nice too, boss fights could be better, but again dodge mechanics are a pain especially with input lag. Animations/art/colors and overall visuals are good, fight system is good you feel the dynamic and hits and i love games with NG+. Overall Game is Good and if you buy game on a good sale it will be a good purchase to collection even in 2022 and if you want to play on TV and relaxing enjoyable walkthrough - choose story and enjoy story and exploring - dis difficulty will save your time and give you a pleasure.

Since I'm not a total noobie in slashers so I decided to play on the hard difficulty (the one after the default one, not the hardest and even not the one before that).\nEstimating this game I based on such a classics like DMC, for example.\nThe main thing in any slasher is the battle mechanics. All other stuff is mostly for background. And unfortunatelly battle mechanics in this game is quite disappointing.\nWhat moves we have: attacks (different weapons and combos, not so bad finally), jump with aero attacks, evasive shift (with counter) and... all. Yes, DMC didn't have much more, but why it was much better?\nThe problem is in the dynamics. The only way to preserve from been hit is attacking and staggering enemies or the shift. But both are quite problematic in Darksiders III. If you are fighting with one enemy, you may have it being permanently staggered. And that is not guaranteed for some of them. But if you have several of them, here comes the trouble since you won't keep them all staggered even with wide sweep attacks. And they'll attack you rather rapidly.\nOk, then the shift comes into play. But most enemy attacks are rather difficult to evade with having counter, otherwise you'll once be hit anyway. And this is the most disappointing. I'm not a person with the best reaction but usually games with such a demand for counters suggest another techniques to balance that. For example, Mortal Shell having too difficult parry technic also provides hardening feature. Others have blocks or range advantage. I don't say that the enemy attack window should be soooo loooong, like in Gods Fall so that it is difficult not to do the parry (especially with additional skill). But it should not be usable just by fighter aircraft pilots.\nAnd being hit is also a trouble since they deplete the healthbar really fast. The replenishing heals are not enough.\nThe quick run is slightly quicker than the usual speed. It doesn't really help fighting (how is was in MGS Revengance or Sekiro). And no replenishing reburth for ocasional deaths. Damage is not enought to kill them before they manage to hit you.\nThe third-person camera is also not the best thing for such a dynamic slashers since you just can't control the space out of current scope.\nTo sum up. It is difficult to control the battle, to shift with counter and not get hits, and hits kill fast. Yes, I played not so long, but I don't see what can improve the situation. I managed to move forward, some battles can be skipped, but that is all just boring. I'd say that It doesn't cost its full price.

Tengo que cambiar a ventana, moverla y deshacer los cambios.\n- Las pantallas de carga son eternas. Literalmente pueden durar 5', aparecer, moverme 2 metros y que se congele la imagen otros tantos minutos porque quiere cargar m\u00e1s cosas. (me da que no est\u00e1 muy bien optimizado)\n- Las texturas se bugean. Tras la eterna pantalla de carga llega la carga de texturas. Poco a poco (MUY poco a poco) los enemigos empiezan a transformarse de una masa homog\u00e9nea de textura a un modelo hecho y derecho.\n- Una vez est\u00e1 todo cargado es verdad que es precioso. La est\u00e9tica y los dise\u00f1os me encantan y es el principal factor por el que continuaba la saga.\n\nJUGABILIDAD:\n- Los controles son un tanto toscos al principio, sobre todo al intentar agarrarte a una tuber\u00eda para balancearte. \n- Los combos no los veo muy \u00fatiles, ya que una vez tengas un movimiento preferido/m\u00e1s \u00f3ptimo/m\u00e1s da\u00f1ino, lo repetir\u00e1s continuamente dejando de lado todos los dem\u00e1s porque son m\u00e1s complejos y no aportan tanto.\n- Se siente bien cuando pegas enemigos y les bloqueas acciones, pero c\u00f3mo molesta cuando te rodean y te lo hacen a ti.\n- Pocas o ninguna mec\u00e1nica interesante para los jefes. el que m\u00e1s interesante me pareci\u00f3 fue Gula, pero tambi\u00e9n costaba saber qu\u00e9 era lo que ten\u00edas que hacer exactamente.\n- Niveles bonitos y algunos muy buenos. Est\u00e1n bien, pero me parece que se pasan de intuitivos a ser simples. F\u00e1ciles y, en la mayor\u00eda de ocasiones, unidireccionales.\n\nHISTORIA:\nMe encantan la tem\u00e1tica mitol\u00f3gica, lucha entre cielo e infierno, tema del Apocalipsis, personificar los pecados capitales, etc. La premisa del primer Darksiders no es sencilla, me parece muy compleja y con muchas inc\u00f3gnitas. En el 2\u00ba te desarrollan sobretodo el personaje de Muerte y cuentan un poco m\u00e1s sobre la historia interactuando con personajes carism\u00e1ticos. Pero me parece que han sido poco ambiciosos.

I replayed Darksiders 1 and 2 after this one, and they are indeed ways more fun.\n\nCombat system in Darksiders 3 is really boring, mostly you just press or hold down X (or Y for the secondary weapon). Darksiders 1/2 had so many fun combos and takedowns, but the most effective way to kill enemies in Darksiders 3 is simply by mashing X or Y. Oh, and counterattacking after an evade. Also with X/Y.\n\nPuzzles are boring as well. Not that they are absolutely horrible, but significantly less interesting than in Darksiders 1/2. The same goes for bosses: Gluttony fight is more or less ok, the rest is totally forgettable, including the final two bosses.\n\nThe story is a mess (unless you are a seven years old), the writing is cringy af (some dialogues are unskippable, of course!). and the world exploration aspect is much worse than in the previous games. The secrets are dull, overall location design is uninspered, and generally it's simply not interesting to navigate these environments.\n\nTechnically the game is also a mess. It mostly uses only one CPU core (is it year 2005?), so it frequently drops below 60 fps on Ryzen 3600, mostly when streaming in new parts of the location. And sometimes, despite 16 GB RAM and 970 EVO SSD it even totally freezes. I had stable 60 fps in AC Origins on ultra settings, this game looks way worse and has much smaller locations.\n\nAnd, of course, it doesn't have a proper ultrawide support (cutscenes are in 16:9 and are also locked to 30 fps), proper gamepad support (can't rebind the buttons, and there is only one control scheme in the game which is inconvenient.

the interviews the team has done about Darksiders 2.\nFury is a pretty fun character, she is also able to get pretty OP off of her main weapon alone.\nMusic was kind of none existent which is sad, in some parts while platforming you might get some snippets but music was really mute in this game.\nA hack and slash really needs that good music and this one unfortunately didn't have that.\nAll in all in the sound department the game was lacking a lot.\nStory is not that different from the beats of Darksiders 1 and 2, builds up the same way, and leads to the reveal of betrayal we all know by now.\nControls are not bad but not tight enough and it has mostly to do with the default button choices.\nEvade on R1 and the horseman form activation and the weapon swaps.\nAll really weird choices honestly and idk if the bad response to evade button and direction is rising from this bad default setup or there just is some clunkiness to it.\nHowever the biggest issue in the game is the camera and the lock on system.\ncamera easily gets forced down and behind the character and you lose all perspective and the lock on does not work smartly.\nMany times I would press the target lock on button and the game would lock on an enemy far away while the threat was right in front of me.\nThis made the situations more frustrating than it had too.\nBut the game is still very much fun and the game world very well built with every single element of it being connected together.\nA true marvel to behold, reminds one of Dark Souls' attention to connecting parts of the world together.\n\n\n",

Its not particularly deep, it\u2019s not particularly complex and, while the skill celling is higher than the prior titles, its mostly gratuitous silliness that amuses for a weekend or two and that\u2019s it. While that may sound damning, its not. It does not hold a candle to other classics in this style it is still a very enjoyable romp for those who are looking for something that reflects the old Soul Reaver games.\n\nThe whole Darksiders franchise is a great example of \u201cimitation is the sincerest form of flattery\u201d. The first game was 3D Zelda with God of War. The sequel added a looting system akin to Diablo to the mix. Darksiders 3 takes the prior basis (Zelda via God of War) and adds some light soulslike mechanics to them. As is, Darksiders continues to bring nothing new to the table and simply apes that which has existed before it. However while it does not bring anything new, what it does it does quite well. It also keeps the series somewhat fresh as, rather than just repeat the prior titles with new faces and locations, it always changes up the formula slightly, so each horseman is distinct from the last.\n\nThis distinction seems to have caused a lot of fallout on the game\u2019s release and there seemed to be a strong negative backlash toward it. Yes, DS3 ditches the loot system from the second title and goes back to the more simplified and limited armoury seen in the first title (which I did not fully enjoy because of how broken it could be), but what it trades in for excess it is a far more skill based system. Now granted, there are soulslike elements, but they are frequently overstated. The main considerations are that Fury, the protagonist, is more of a glass cannon. The prior main characters, War and Death, were far more tanky and could take more damage, so while there were more nuanced layers to the combat you could effectively button mash your way through them. Here Fury needs to consider trying to mitigate the incoming damage as much as possible to survive. While War could block / parry and riposte enemies, and Death could whizz about in a flurry of blades, Fury needs to do timed dodges which grants her huge counter-attacks. This may seem annoying initially, but once it is mastered it is quite a satisfying gameplay loop to get into, but if you hope to just button mash your way to victory like in DS2, be prepared for disappointment.\n\nBesides the more fragile protagonist the other soulslike elements are set reset points (vulgrim portals are the equivalent of bonfires) where on death the levels repopulate as well as grabbing ones souls from where you fell previously. Bar that things like stamina and VERY careful use of attacks are, thankfully, nowhere to be seen. Yes combat is far more risky here, but it still has the satisfying bashing of buttons to achieve their goals. Similarly, Fury is far more agile and spritely than any of the traditional Souls titles, with jumping, platform puzzles and general traversal. While a souls game tends to take place on flat surfaces that wind out from a point, Darksiders sprawls vertically in ways that requires you to take in your full surroundings to get the most of it. In this regard not only is Darksiders 3 less of a souls like, but the whole series is more akin to a metroidvania in 3D, or more fittingly, a Soul Reaver alike. Indeed if you are a fan of the old Legacy of Kain titles then Darksiders is, in my opinion, the best substitute there is.\n\nSo for a Legacy of Kain\u2026 like (?) how does Darksiders 3 fare? Its fine. Is it as good as the original or the sequel? No, not quite. Its good, and its certainly better than a lot of the backlash it got seems to indicate, but its not a classic. It\u2019s a perfectly suitable middle game in a series that not only experiments with the systems it has as well as being a surprising title that many thought would never happen due to the death of THQ. If you want a good time killer for a wet weekend that is fun but not world changing, Darksiders 3 is very much that kind of game.\n\nFINAL NOTE: If you do buy this, do so [i]only[/i] during a sale. The price is absurd considering the mid-grade quality it has, and considering it is a few years old now the fact it is the same price as a new game is absurd.

Multiple times where the compass brought me to a section that was still blocked and only got unlocked later after story progression.\nI never played the Souls games, but even then it's clear where the inspiration was found for the souls and dodge mechanics. After the game launched the developers added a classic mode to improve dodging behaviour, but its disabled by default. Once i discovered that and lowered the particle effects (so I could actually see when to dodge an enemy) I was finally able to start enjoying the combat and atmosphere. \nThe game really looks great, performance is a bit unoptimized due to it being a console port probably.

Some of my thoughts changed, some didn't. Then I ran into a save file breaking bug that apparently cannot be fixed. I just have to start the game over according to every forum post I've seen. Waiting still on THQ support to help me. So here's my review as the game stands now.\n\nPositives first:\nThis game is beautiful on ultimate settings.\nThe combat is fine. It's not as good as the previous 2 games, but it's fine.\nThe weapons you get are cool, they're kind of rip-offs of stuff in DS2 but they're cool.\nIf you liked how Dark Souls 1 strung areas together using shortcuts, you'll appreciate this game as it is very good at doing that. Not as good, but still impressive and cool.\nIf you like Metroidvania style games, you may like this? Lots of back tracking to get more items as you gain new abilities. If you enjoy that, you'll probably like this. There's a good bit of that. More on that later.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe story is lame. Makes no sense as to how it weighs into the rest of the story we've had so far. Would have LOVED to have finished the story to see if that rings true at the end, but I am roughly halfway through now with a busted save file, and besides felt no sense of purpose in the game. Why am I hunting the sins? Cause the Charred Council said to because literally everyone else is busy. Cool way to make me feel awesome, everyone else is busy so I guess you'll do. [spoiler]Why do I serve the Lord of the Hollows kind of? I dunno he gives me weapons sometimes and that's cool.[/spoiler] It's just not that good.\n\nFury as a character isn't interesting. Feels like they wanted to make her come across as this super tough badass but the whole time it just fell short for me since we've had War, the ultimate super tough badass. The beginning of the game is literally her whining about how she's so much more of a super tough badass than her brothers and that's kind of her only motivation this game. The first DS game, War was trying to figure out what happened, since he knew he didn't purposefully start the apocalypse. The second game, Death is trying to redeem his brother War and rescue humanity. The third game, Fury is trying to prove she's cool or something?? Half of the cutscenes are so beyond bland and dull I have to fight not to skip them. The story in them always becomes a demon trying to convince Fury to give in to temptation and she's just like \"nah I gotta be the cool one\" and that's literally the extent of it.\n\nThe boss fights are stupid easy with the exception of 1 so far. Even on higher difficulties, I am playing on the one just below apocalyptic and have burned through every boss no problem except for Lust.\n\nThe game is sorely lacking the puzzles the first 2 games had. Most of the puzzles are \"go into this room, kill the dudes, hit a switch probably using the fire ability you got 4+ hours ago at the beginning of the game\". \n\nThis game tried to lean very hard into the Dark Souls thing and it just didn't work. The combat, again, is fine, but to me it's not fun enough or challenging enough to give the satisfaction a real Soulsborne game gives you. You level up using souls, you pick up soul items, you heal using essentially an Estus flask, die and you lose your souls, you upgrade your weapon with their equivalent to the shard/large shard/chunk/slab method, and putting fuck you ambush enemies hiding around corners because that's almost the only way you'll get hurt.\n\nThe Metroidvania bit I mentioned at the top: the items you backtrack for are absolutely worthless. The only items you get are single use items, most of which don't do much or it's just more souls. There are no hidden weapons, no better gear. Just single use items and XP.\n\nOn to the performance: This game runs like TRASH. I have a 3080, 32GB RAM, and a Ryzen 7 3800X and half the time can't manage to pull a consistent 60 frames if I have settings anywhere over Medium. The game is hardlocked to 60 fps, cutscenes are all in 30 so they look like butt (not that they're interesting anyway), and the game has MAJOR crashing issues. I've played 6.3 hours over the course of this run at the game and haven't had a session that didn't end in a crash of the game. Also, 9 times out of 10, if you start the game through Steam, it will just crash at the start menu. You pretty much HAVE to launch it from the install directory.\n\nAnd to top off this steaming pile of garbage, I'm 6 hours into the game, was having a decently fun time. Suddenly, I go to load the game today and it's not detecting DLC anymore which ruins the save file. The file can't be launched till it decides to detect the DLC that I own, have owned, installed, and have had installed the entire time. I've reinstalled everything, checked windows updates, driver updates, all of it. This is an issue that has been around since the Crucible DLC released, and has never been fixed. Per the forums and subreddit, there is no fix. If it happens, your save file is dead and you HAVE to start over if you want to play the game more.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to like this game. I can deal with the things I found to be \"meh\" because there are fun things about it. There really are. But the constant performance issues, crashing, and such make it so hard. And to top it all off with this game breaking issue is just sad. I contacted support 4 days ago and haven't heard back yet. I love this series, 1 and 2 were incredible, Genesis is pretty fun with a friend, and I was enjoying this game. But to have a game breaking bug like this and not have a resolution anywhere at all is absolutely insane. I'd recommend avoiding it and just watching a story summary if you even care.\n\nPOST Review Edit:\nI forgot that they also removed the executions!!! Literally one of the big things that made the last 2 horsemen feel like absolute badasses since they would absolutely manhandle any non-boss enemy once the enemy's health hit a certain point.

I just read that the controls can be changed to not be so..dark soulish so I'll try that the next time I play. \n\nThe problems I have are that it kind of feels like a Darksiders game, but it's like the developer was making a Darksiders game, and then the publisher or funder was like, \"Hey you hear about this popular game called Dark Souls? Can it be more like that?\" Then they tried to add in features that kind of made it feel like Dark Souls, but it didn't work. They should have picked a concept and went with that. Right now the Darksiders side fails in that the combat doesn't feel smooth, and you don't necessarily feel like you're a Horseman of the apocalypse. The game kind of feels like a slog.\n\nThe Dark Souls side fails in that the controls don't feel responsive enough, and so everything ends up just feeling slightly 'off'. There are also instances of stuttering or huge drops in framerate. Honestly, a few times I had to laugh because I'm playing Fury, but this game was literally causing me to go into a fury. It doesn't do a good job of guiding the player with increasingly difficult puzzles either. The environments are also really bland, and for me to notice environments it has to be either amazing or awful.\n\nI normally never play a game on 'story' mode, but it's not enjoyable enough to endure the learning curve of fights and whatnot.

I liked the different hollows and their special abilities, although I mainly used the Storm Hollow.

The bosses are very unique, and the story is interesting and easy to follow.\n\nApocalyptic mode is not very balanced (as is clear from its name), so some enemies will one-shot you.

After reading the reviews on the web I would have expected a mediocre game, instead I can say that for me it deserves an 8. It is certainly inferior to the first Darksiders, but slightly. Even if the story is not the most original, it is still sensible and with some twists and turns.\nThe graphics is well done but do not expect much, even at the maximum detail it is definitely not in step with the times (the game is from 2018). There were never any crashes, only once Fury got stuck and I had to reload.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to previous Darksiders. Explore, fight, collect items, improve equipment through the demon Vulgrim.\nExploration is composed by paths forced by the plot and other secondary ones to gain souls and objects. Generally it is clear where you have to go, some points are unclear and you can solve it by searching the net. The map is divided into areas with different environments, each with points where Vulgrim appears, which acts both as a shop, a recovery point in case of death and as a point of rapid movement.\nThe combat is dynamic, fast and well done. It's a soulslike, so you die quite often but, unlike in Dark Souls, it's not a problem as hard battles are close (or almost) to a restore point. I don't like soulslike games, but this one is not Dark Souls, so if you hate it don't worry, you can play Darksiders III. The main bosses are all different, someone you will beat on the first attempt, others maybe after 10 times.\nThere are not many type of objects, they only are used to improve the equipment, or as a booster for the character. Often, they are hidden and you have to find paths that are not easily visible.\nPersonally, I recommend Darksiders III to those who play action adventures but, given the low cost when it is on offer, also to those who want to try a soulslike game, but easier than any Fromsoftware title.", "timestamp_created": 1640981707, "timestamp_updated": 1640982018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106952276": {"recommendationid": "106952276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024986893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1641622580}, "language": "english", "review": "Sick story, but not if you play on apocalypse mode. but still super sick.", "timestamp_created": 1640918107, "timestamp_updated": 1640918107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106872185": {"recommendationid": "106872185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070207344", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 4637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2917, "last_played": 1641260289}, "language": "spanish", "review": "porfin pude terminar el juego arduo tiempo titanico me llevo.", "timestamp_created": 1640830534, "timestamp_updated": 1641347034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106869259": {"recommendationid": "106869259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086593733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2665, "last_played": 1641178590}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the first two Darksiders. This Darksiders is also a ton of fun now that the the original Darksiders difficulty setting is an option. Prior to the change, Darksiders had succumb to the fad of creating only a Dark Souls setting so the game sat on the shelf. Not everyone has weeks to master the 'dark souls' controls - maybe when I retire I'll get back into Dark Souls. I CAN appreciate learning to use the controls to the max after some practice - Nioh 1 is a good example of a difficult game to beat but doable after learning the mechanics and practicing a reasonable amount of time.  Dark Souls, IMHO, is just unreasonable; it's a shame that game developers mimic this difficulty WITHOUT also  giving the option of a just plain old play Hard setting.  Anyway, back to the game:\n\nGood - Character customization.\nGood - Weapons customization\nGood -  Fighting (as a result of the above)  - I like to mix up the skill but this would probably benefit from a more  Nioh-like (not Souls- like) learning curve so that people don't end up just mashing and dodging.  \nGood - Story\nGood - Loot hunting. \nDecent - Puzzles \nGood - Graphics \nGood - Mix of environments \n\nGood - Game", "timestamp_created": 1640827167, "timestamp_updated": 1640827167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106868057": {"recommendationid": "106868057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009317041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2301, "last_played": 1640823491}, "language": "english", "review": "i have zero ideas why this received such lukewarm reception when it was launched.  i almost din't gave this a try. i thought maybe it felt a rushed like 2 was, since darksiders development history is rather troubled. but that's not a issue either.\n\nwhat i do see most complaining about is that this is a \"store brand dark souls\" and the only thing i can say about that is:\n\nhahaha... no. \n\nthe combat comes straight out of darksiders 2 but with bigger emphasis on dodging counters, which were already a thing in 2 just more important now. and the exploration is still pretty much darksiders 2 and 1, except they cut out all the prince of persia like plataforming that 2 had.\n\nthe only way i can see someone comparing this to dark souls is that if someone who only heard about dark souls played this, saw some superficial similarities, thought this was hard(it ain't) and went: \n\n\"well dark souls is supposed to be hard and i'm not getting my dopamine fix, so this must be like dark souls!\"\n\n\nanyway, this is a good game. like all the 2 previous games in the series this is the perfect definition of a 8/10 game. a game that is not perfect, won't blow anyone's mind, but when you done with it you are happy you took the time to play it.\n\nhowever there is two things that people should be aware, first there is backtracking. i don't mind backtracking myself. but feels like general consensus nowdays is that backtracking is the gaming equivalent of genocide. so you been warned.\n\nthen there are some technical issues i encountered. there are bunch of minor ones that are just annoying, but whenever you go between zones (which in some places can be anywhere, not only near doors) the frame rate stutters as it compile shaders/load textures/whatever. \nif you are willing to tweak things under the hood you can make it \"less bad\", but i never managed to completely make it go away and seems like some people never get those issues to start with.", "timestamp_created": 1640825831, "timestamp_updated": 1640825831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527464866638183594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106866705": {"recommendationid": "106866705", "author": {"steamid": "76561199140632395", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2102, "last_played": 1640823882}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego en s\u00ed mola much\u00edsimo.

More often i just go to a bonfire......err Vulgrim location and dump my souls and then let an enemy kill me.

A fun single playthrough game but otherwise, I'll never touch it again. \n\nGAMEPLAY - \nA big change in terms of gameplay to the previous installations which are more 'hack and slashy':\n- enemies will be significantly harder, when playing above balanced and hit HARD. \n- if playing a difficulty above balanced, when intitially starting out - you will die a lot. \n- you can 'time' your dodges, and perform a counter if timed perfectly, leading to increased damage. \n- no customisable skillset was a bit of a shock, compared to DS2 creating a more simplified levelling system with the choices of; health, damage, arcane damage (counters, secondary weapons). \n- weapons can be enhanced with runes and the runes themselves advanced. \n- armor is only purchaseable from Vulgrim, enhancing a preferred style for your secondary weapon but again, doesn't give you the same ability to make a character of your own. \n- bosses can be a bit too simple at times and clearing to them becomes more challenging than the actual boss.\n\nSTORY - \nThe initial introduction to the character made me have a heavy distaste for her, but over time she becomes a little more tolerable, relatable and eventually maybe likeable. So bear with it, if you found it difficult to stick around at the start - I know I did, but I enjoyed it for the most part. I found the order of the sins to be a bit predictable unfortunately, I always hope to be shocked but this had barely any-to-no surprise at all for me. It's decently written but rather predictable if you've been exposed to anything with the seven deadly sins as a writing piece before. If they turned the order, or power levels on it's head - it would've made for a far more interesting story.", "timestamp_created": 1640584176, "timestamp_updated": 1640584176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106553956": {"recommendationid": "106553956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188770834", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2379, "last_played": 1640498232}, "language": "english", "review": "If you by chance played the first and or the second game prior to playing this, you will, quite appropriately, get -whiplash.-I've only ever played the first game seeing as the second's Steam port is broken beyond belief. Because of this I'll be referencing the first game for my comparing and contrasting. The first game showed off an interesting world and an expanse of good characters with an average narrative. The combat was hack-n-slash and also featured some button mashing and some finishers. The world-building and story quality has either stayed the same or improved, I can't tell, the combat however is quite different. And while I don't think that's inherently bad it's pretty condemning if you go in expecting it to be the same. This is very much a 'souls-like', a term that gets needlessly tossed around a lot. I'm not too bothered by this change, personally. The new mechanics are great, it's the old ones that got removed that bother me, mostly. \n\nThe idea of having a horse as a horsemen is completely absent in this game, which is questionably one of the better changes. In the first game it felt very tacked on and often offered the least engaging combat. \"The Horsemen is not defined by the horse,\" or something like that was said in the game by the Watcher; honestly, this couldn't be anymore true. Mechanics aside, the horses have never added anything to the narratives in these games. They've only ever been there to look edgy and help you get around quicker.\n\n I really liked the finishers in the first game and I'd have loved to see what creative, animated kills Fury could have pulled off with that serrated whip of hers, but alas, these have been removed entirely. Well, technically, there is one boss in the game you can do a finisher on. I honestly don't know why they included it, but they did. It's cool, but when you realize it's the only one the game it's sort of salt in the wound. I don't really understand why they did this at all either. You can make a souls-like with finishers where they're not just insta-win button prompts on screen. Jedi Fallen Order managed it.\n\n The map was removed. The reasoning for this if I recall correctly was to \"encourage exploration\" and \"allow players to move around at the their own pace.\" Now, I could be remembering that wrong, but I don't see why a map would deter players in doing this, if anything NOT having a map would be the bump in the road here. If a player wants to speed-run the game and or explore every nook and cranny of the world that should be their right, and a map would have been ideal for both. This sort of just came off as lazy to me. \n\nI can't really comment on the game's narrative. I thought it was more memorable than the first's, but I'd be hard-pressed to say if it's anything better than \"okay.\" The dialogue is good, as well as the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the banter between the Watcher and Fury. And of course, it goes without saying the game is damn gorgeous to look at it. I do genuinely enjoy the style. Some enemy designs look meh, but I think most of them work.

Firstly, the combat gets very clunky fast and sometimes button inputs fail to render so my dodge does nothing. Yes, I played on *Classic* combat mode so I should be able to cancel my attack animations and make a proper dodge mid combo. Anyways combat is not the only issue I faced. Unnecessary puzzles that exist only to lengthen your playtime get annoying quick. I got you your three swords why do you make it a puzzle to climb up the bridge? I made far higher jumps before but now the game breaks its own rules and puts invisible barriers, so I must go around. Darksiders 3 also introduces a new swing mechanic that like many other things at first felt nice but as time passed got annoying. Sometimes it is not clear if you have to swing on something or jump, because the prompts to do so do not appear until you are nose deep in the fucking bar you should swing from. Backtracking is also one of my biggest problems with Darksiders as a whole. I do enjoy going back to areas I have explored and finish up on loot I have missed. However, in this game there are paths blocked constantly that can only be accessed later when a new upgrade has been unlocked. This would be fine if there was a map or someway to know where you can still find valuable loot. Now I just have to remember where I can\u2019t go yet and where I should. All that just makes you do a full rerun of all the areas you explored which feels to me like another way to lengthen everyone\u2019s playtime. It is ironic because even with all that effort to lengthen the game Darksider 3 is still the shortest one in the trilogy. I mentioned before that button prompts can sometimes feel delayed or not work at all and that does not always happen in combat because even switching stances or weapons can take a few extra button presses. I am not saying that Darksiders 1 and 2 were great because both of those games have annoying combat flaws and movement problems, but you would think that by the time they make the third game that they would finally find that sweet spot? Darksiders 3 introduces interesting new game mechanics that I have mentioned bits of before but not all of them are great. The new leveling system is nice and upgrading your gear is fun. But then there are the hollows that replace your wrath skills and feel too basic to bee enjoyable. In this game the developers clearly tried to combine everything that was fun from previous games and make it explosive but all we got is a soup of ideas and conflicting game mechanics. There is a saying: If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. Something like that. I mean for fuck sakes the map is gone? Why? Overall, this game is not bad, but I found a lot of things I hate in it. The overall experience feels like an uninspired attempt to milk the franchise more. The story is about nothing new just gives you slightly more context to why war was betrayed in the end. It is as if the writers are afraid to move forward after the seventh seal was broken or have no idea how to move forward.

But then again I feel kinda sorry for putting this game at the last place. Puzzles in this game are really fun. Very nostalgic.\n\n\n+Fury journey from unlikable to almost relatable character\n+Enemies hiding behind objects(at the start of campaign)\n+Exceptional puzzles(like that one after Lord of Hollows where u had to use multiple jumps)\n+Puzzles in general\n+Hollows are fun mechanic that are more than player-environment interaction mechanic. Its your weapon source! \n+As u get better at the game u feel progress of your character\n+Souls wont disappear nor appear in awkward places(YES IM TALKING ABOUT ONE FRANCHISE IN PARTICULAR)\n+-First Darksiders let u buy new moves, attack combinations, skills gained new effects. This one has enhancments that u can upgrade and generic lvling. U have all of the attacks from the start which I didnt even know about. Im on the fence if i should do a minus or plus. On one hand games shouldnt guide u at all, but on the other hand Its just waste of resources. There are so many attack combinations that are redundant. One combination could break their armor, other grant wrath etc etc. So many possibilties but They decided to leave it as it is.\n\n\n---------------I hate dark souls\n-imbalanced enemies. Basically any shooting enemy can be your downfall\n-locations and enemies are so god damn dark. Thankfully there is fire hollow\n-one boss in particular. What do I do with those homing mines? Answer is simple but u must do one of the dumbest things anyone would imagine\n-no map\n-extremely buggy. U cant buy from Vulgrim more than 1 armour at the time cause ur mouse disappear. Also dont use Fire hollow jump in \"secret\" places. Otherwise u might end up stuck in the ceiling. yay\n-Music. Its better than darksiders 1 (barely) but comparing a 20 year old game to a 3 year old? Lame for a such huge budget\n-Activation of skills/shards etc. is so fucking weird. U need to stop pressing attack and movement buttons in order to use them? Is this poor PC port or just design flaw?\n-FPS drops. I dont know if its my pc? or just this game is badly optimized. Doom Eternal loaded in 5s, had 60fps constantly etc. I guess Im asking for too much\n-There is barely any dialouge in this game from second and third plan characters. Darksiders 1 was so much better at story telling. Samaeal, Vulgrim even Charred Council was better. Speaking of Charred Council WHY DO WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT THEM?! This game could finally change that. In total we see them 2 times in this game and Watcher is a fangirl that envies the hair of Fury.\n-Plot falling apart. Since when Vulgrim knew about betrayal? Charred Council became a cartoony villain wothout any depth. Just wtf happened. I cant find any justification for their actions. DS1 writers are spinning in their chairs at 6G.\n\nEdit. U know what?

A younger, even more impatient me probably would have refunded it. But eventually I came to enjoy this title a bit more then the first game, but less so then the second. That's the short version. If you're like me and lamented this series being cast into limbo years before by the collapse of THQ, it would appear to be not quite dead yet. I do wonder if the original idea of a four-player-coop title will ever come to pass, however.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the Darksiders series is an exaggerated, comic-book reimagining of the biblical apocalypse told through a lens of brutal action, melodramatic dialogue and where-the-hell-is-that-last-collectible world design. It generally makes up for shortcomings in certain mechanics and aesthetic design elements through overall fun factor. Each title in the series thus far has cast the player as a different one of the legendary Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The first game starred War, the second Death, and then things get weird- Famine and Pestilence/Conquest were replaced with Fury and Strife, with Fury taking center stage for this title. Strife would later finally be made playable in the top-down Darksiders: Genesis. The chronology is also non-standard- the first title is chronologically the last in the series, but opens before the events of 2 and 3.\n\nEach title also notably different mechanics from each other despite a central unifying theme of hack-and-slash gameplay. The first was essentially a Zelda-like with God of War's combat The second expanded on this, adding much wider open maps to explore and action-RPG mechanics like dungeons and statted gear, and replacing the first game's block with a dodge. This third entry instead goes into left field, taking on aspects of Dark Souls: A health item with charges a la an Estus Flask, using currency to level up (which, funnily enough, was already souls), using found items to incrementally upgrade weapons, dropping currency when you die, and so on. There's also an evade counter mechanic wherein if you dodge at the right time to avoid in attack you can use a powerful counterattack. I highly recommend getting a hang of doing this as it will make your life much easier, especially if you upgrade and use the spear weapon to do so.\n\nTo be frank, Darksiders 3's weakest aspects are those taken from the Souls series, most egregiously the total lack of a map screen where the first two games did have maps. Thankfully there is no invasion mechanic- not that would make any sense in the game's context. Still, the game is significantly easier then any Soulslike I have played, you just might get saddled with a few cheap respawns until you can upgrade and/or figure out the timing for evasion counters.\n\nIn contrast to the dimension-hopping escapades of Darksiders 2, he player as Fury, much like War in the first game, is again confined to a ruined Earth for this adventure. She must explore an interconnected world of urban ruins, underground temples, intertwining tree branches and more, even including the poison swamp area that Soulslikes are contractually obligated to have, in search of the Seven Deadly Sins, who make most, but not all of the game's boss fights. In the questionable absence of a map is a simple compass that points the way to the closest Sin boss, and it works well enough to keep you from getting stuck. Usually. Scattered about the game are various items and upgrades, some of which are used to upgrade your gear in Souls fashion while others provide new traversal abilities that open up new areas and passages to older ones in the manner of a Metroidvania. \n\nAs I gathered souls and upgrades and my overall power level began to comfortably exceed that of most enemy encounters, the game's feel shifted from cheap to enjoyable- becoming more like Darksiders, in essence. Still, the game's difficulty is at best inconsistent- large groups of regular enemies coupled with the game's low default field of view tend to be a much greater threat then any singular boss fight. Thankfully there is an easy way to extend your FOV detailed in one of the Steam Guides, though it should really be an in-game option.\n\nDSIII also surprised me with the quality of its writing, perhaps surprising given its origins and emphasis on spectacle. Where initially Fury comes off as the exceedingly brash, uncharismatic virago her name might suggest, replete with ridiculous stiletto heels built into her armor, she undergoes a significant amount of character development that I will not spoil here. Suffice it to say that her personal growth was actually one of game's strongest aspects.\n\nDarksiders 3 is an overall decent action title and I recommend it to fans of metroidvanias, character action games, Soulslikes and returning fans of the series. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1639034337, "timestamp_updated": 1639034462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691016435623168945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105491268": {"recommendationid": "105491268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047206202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1639006899}, "language": "english", "review": "Darksiders used to be felt like a zelda kind of game with different story, the more you advance the more mechanics you have to beat enemies and go trough progress in your on personal playstile, this games forces you to play a given style for a given stage, looks like THQ nordic wants us to play a poor dark souls game, not even a roguelike just a plain poor copy with Darksiders skin", "timestamp_created": 1639007142, "timestamp_updated": 1639007142, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105404288": {"recommendationid": "105404288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061791175", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1673262764}, "language": "english", "review": "\nWhile the graphics look disappointing, the game still can be fun.", "timestamp_created": 1638879393, "timestamp_updated": 1638879393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105386270": {"recommendationid": "105386270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051433194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1396, "last_played": 1614624406}, "language": "english", "review": "First Darksouls like games and now IM hooked", "timestamp_created": 1638845136, "timestamp_updated": 1638845136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105375384": {"recommendationid": "105375384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152014437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1638823396}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Fun action game if you can stand some annoying puzzles and are willing to look up Internet Walkthroughs in order to pass certain sections to enjoy the action [/h1]\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n+ Very fluid combat and well optimized game\n+ Fun combat\n+ Very nice color palette\n+ Varied environments\n+ Kept me going to the end of the story \n+ Includes a decent first difficulty level for people who are busy and just want a fun experience and to finish the story.\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n- A lot of terrible puzzles which are mandatory in order to progress in the main story and for which most people will have to seek internet guides if in a rush to just enjoy the action\n- Nonsense conspiracies story, which is not sufficiently explained or detailed\n- Shallow characters. \n- Trial and error platforming that is pretty frustrating if you are low on time and just want to have fun. \n\n[h1] About [/h1]\nI really tried to get into the Darksiders franchise but I didn\u2019t enjoy the previous games.

I have loved the series greatly. So, it is with great disappointment, that after my second playthrough of Darksiders 3 that I felt it necessary to leave this review. I'll just do some bullet points and call it there.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nStory - Continues the Conspiracy and the Story started in 1 & 2. I do hope that it is continued at some point.\n\nCharacters - Some Old Characters return and are expanded more. Fury herself goes through notable character progression through the story. The Lord of the Hollows is a character that is crucial to the overall story, pay attention to him. \n\nArt Design - Continues the Darksiders, and doesn't ruin the universe by attempting to redesign anything.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nCombat Difficulty - Someone thought Darksiders should be Darksouls, after 2 games that were very Zelda-esqe. Items are scarce, and often require the player to stop attacks or even movement to be used at times. Using a healing item is not a guaranteed heal, as enemies are able to kill the player before the items can work.\n \nDodging - Dodging is piss poor, but core to the design of combat flow in the game. There WILL be points were the player is hit in a dodge when they are invincible to one enemy but not another. \n\nGeneral Difficulty - The Game FAILS to explain or instruct the play at almost every turn. There numerous mechanics that are never explained (Stasis being able to freeze some things but not others). Additionally, the difficulty settings are deceptive. Story is able as hard as normal verging toward hard of the prior games, and \"Balanced\" is frustrating at times. That people have completed the game on harder settings is impressive, but the grading is ridiculous. \n\nMap - There isn't one. You will get lost, and it WILL SUCK,\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS - \n\nIf you love the series, save your money. Watch a youtube of the story cutscenes. Play Genesis instead.

I explain my issues with the combat in the Gameplay section below. The story took too long to entice me, but I wound up liking the story in the end.\n\nIntro:\n\nI played Darksiders 1 several years ago on the PS 3. I didn't think highly of it, but I enjoyed it well enough to get the second game, also on the PS 3. I thoroughly enjoyed the second. I could easily recommend the first two games. I liked them enough to also get them on Steam, and I was eventually given the Warmastered and Deathinitive Editions of 1 and 2. I've yet to complete Darksiders Genesis as of writing this review so I will say as little as I can about it unless to convey any point I want to make. My time with the first two games encouraged me to get the third. \n\nStory: \n\nThe Darksiders games are about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Fury, Strife, War, and Death. While drawing inspiration from the biblical Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse the games are a separate matter. Darksiders 1-3 basically take place concurrently with each game exploring the erroneous triggering of the Apocalypse and the roles that each of the Horsemen play during this concurrent time, in particular regarding War, Death, and Fury, respectively. Strife has no game yet, but hopefully one will come; Darksiders Genesis does allow you to play as Strife and War, but the numbered games are strictly about War, Death, and Fury. \n\nI wasn't particularly invested in Fury's story as it unfolded, but the ending and some character growth along the way really changed my mind on this matter and the game as a whole. It is because of this that I actually do want to recommend this game. \n\nGraphics:\n\nNo scenery stood out as memorable in a good way. A particular region is quite ugly, but that, presumably, is by design given that it's home to either insect or arachnid-like creatures, so it's at least justified. The game is prettier than bland but not particularly pretty. Darksiders 1 and 2 in contrast had some absolutely gorgeous areas.\n\nSound:\n\nThe game has some unpleasant sounds, but I am overly sensitive to light and sound.  Fortunately, this never proved problematic and I usually recovered quickly. \n\nThere is a soundtrack. That's almost all I recall of it, sadly. I really liked the piece that played on the character screen and would often pause the game just to hear it. I do not mean to say the music is bad, just that I cannot recall anything to actually voice an opinion on it. Contrast this with Darksiders 2 where I routinely play the soundtrack while doing chores, studying, artwork, etc. I am disappointed at how forgettable I've found the soundtrack to be with Darksiders 3 after the masterclass soundtrack of Darksiders 2. I never once felt that the music added to or detracted from the general experience, probably because I really never noticed it, but I'd much rather this than a soundtrack that actually detracts from the experience as is the case with some games.\n\nThere is some good voice acting but I generally consider it inferior to the voice acting in the first two games. This, however, does not mean that I dislike the voice acting. There are some well-delivered lines and the emotions behind the speech generally fit any scene in question. A few characters really stood out in good quality. \n\nGameplay:\n\nI have completed this game and earned all the achievements. \n\nThe combat is what kills it for me. I find it cheap, and difficult for the wrong reasons. I have read comparisons to the Souls games but I have never played any of those so that means nothing to me. Darksiders 1 has been compared to God of War. I have completed God of War 1, 2, 3, Ghost of Sparta, Chains of Olympus, and Ascension on their hardest difficulties. I have also completed Ninja Gaiden Black on Master Ninja a few times, though I am by no means good at NGB on MN. While I am not aware of anyone comparing any Darksiders game to NGB, I bring it up to show that I am not unaccustomed to difficult games.\n\nFury, as one of the Horsemen, is, canonically, one of the most feared and powerful beings in all of creation, even prior to the Apocalypse, but this game presents her as a weakling. This game takes Segregation of Story and Gameplay to the extreme. It is often necessary to whittle away at enemies while even the weakest enemies can often kill you in 2-3 hits. Dodging often feels useless and there is no way to block attacks. All too often, if you don't time a dodge perfectly, a Perfect Dodge, then you will almost invariably get hit as the enemies' aim is almost infallible, with incredible homing. Further, if an enemy hits you once then it will usually hit you a second time with a follow-up, meaning you're often effectively one-shot. Worse is that the Perfect Dodge is not just a useful gimmick, like it is in Darksiders 2, but effectively necessary for survival. \n\nYou can try to isolate and kill one enemy at a time, and you should, but the game has an annoying habit of throwing multiple enemies at you at once, often in small arena-like areas. While two enemies isn't usually so bad, three or more quite often means you're dead because you can't block and dodging is largely useless if not perfect as well as the fact that you can be hit during the execution of a Perfect Dodge by at least one of the other enemies nearby. This game seems to think you should kill slowly, one at a time, but then throws multiple enemies at you; It appears to be confused as to what it thinks it is, and I think it's fair to say that I am certainly confused as to what the game thinks it is.\n\nNever do I feel powerful as I progress, only less weak. This is in stark contrast to War and Death. Fury is the weakest of the Four, but this does not readily explain why she so easily dies. I think if Fury started with double the health, 1.5x the attack power, and had a slightly more useful dodge then things wouldn't be so bad, and to compensate for these changes I would make it a bit more difficult to gain levels. \n\nDespite my complaints about the combat, I have actually enjoyed several of the boss fights and boss-like encounters. I don't really know what to say on this point, but I thought I should share it all the same.\n\nYou can level Fury's health and physical and arcane power, but it often feels moot until you get weapon enhancements, and even then it depends on which you get, which you equip, and how you upgrade them. These can potentially end up making a significant difference, especially when combined with a certain item and a particular piece of DLC armor. These enhancements can improve both offensive and defensive abilities. If you have the Keeper of the Void DLC then you can equip more enhancements, due to an increased number of weapons, making the game that much easier. Each enhancement has a passive and active effect, with the passive effect always active if added to a weapon and the active effect only active if it is on the currently drawn weapon. You can only use one enhancement per weapon but the combined effects of the passives means that this doesn't particularly matter much if you've taken care to level them and you equip them efficiently. \n\nThe game's world feels big and small at the same time, but I have no idea how to explain this. There is a pretty good amount to explore and a pretty good amount to find. I really enjoy how seemingly unconnected areas can be connected through hidden passages. I know of no map and I have read there is no map. This can make exploration a pain. A good amount of the world requires story progression to enter. Collectibles are in areas that require plot items so there will be backtracking. I've read this game is a metroidvania; I'm not particularly familiar with this term and am not actually comfortable using it myself.", "timestamp_created": 1637701981, "timestamp_updated": 1647157551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587245345115661621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103325636": {"recommendationid": "103325636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090587326", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2194, "last_played": 1638635088}, "language": "english", "review": "Writing this review to show my love and support for the franchise and to say I really hope and wish for a Darksiders 4.\nI started this game after hearing people talk about it being \"lower budget\", \"souls clone\", \"weakest entry in the franchise\" and things like that, so even after playing 1 & 2 and absolutely adoring both, my expectations for this weren't really high. To my surprise (which shouldn't be a surprise at all, knowing the franchise) I absolutely adored the game from the start. Story/lore is just as interesting as ever. The mistery behind the nature of the characters, the universe of the game, the badass feeling of playing as an almighty horseman of the apocalypse, it's all amazing. The gameplay, while it feels a little bit simpler than previous games with less combos, is still fun as hell and a lot more challenging this time. Yes, it is inspired in the souls series, but heavy emphasis on \"inspired\", cause it still feels like a darksiders game. Fury is fast and has cool/powerfull looking moves that really has not that much resemblance to any souls game. It is also really awesome to see her progression as a character. Even characters in game refer to her as \"too impatient\" or even \"dumbest of the four\" XD, but by the end of the game Fury is much more mature and not only a blind stereotype living up to the meaning of her name.\nLong story short, I had a blast playing this game. I didn't realize how much I missed playing a darksiders title. Will definitely be getting Genesis as soon as I can, replaying the first 2 (which I already own) as soon as I 100% this one, and again, I really, really hope we will get a Darksiders 4.

Most of the time, one ability unlocks the next zone, which leads to another ability that unlocks another zone, etc. It feels quite linear in that regard, and most of the backtracking I did only led to some minor currency or power-up. In some instances I went back, unlocked a passage from a previous zone and it led me to another block I could not unlock with my current abilities, which made it feel like a waste of time. Instead, I should continue down the linear path until I get enough abilities that I can go back and clear everything at once, but then all those power-ups are meaningless.\n\nIt tries to be a \"souls-like\" game by using limited healing, checkpoints and a souls currency which is used to level up. It does not go very far in build customization, you basically allocate each level up to either health, regular damage or counter damage. You can also upgrade weapons and slot stones into them which have passive effects, as well as upgrade those stones. Finally, combat is also designed to include a lot of dodging and countering and punish mashing (there seem to be a setting to disable that if you dont like it), which I enjoyed but it quickly becomes repetitive when countering attacks is the only optimal way to go. In that regard it feels more like an Arkham-style fighting than Dark Souls. The souls aspect is also made a bit trivial because you can die as many times as you'd like and still are able to collect your souls back, they don't disappear if you die on the way to get them back. On top of that the NPC that makes you level up accepts as many souls as you have, even if it is not enough to level up (so if you have 1000 souls but need 1500 to level you can still give him those 1000 souls and no longer risk losing them). It made me feel like I was playing Dark Souls on some kind of easy mode and felt a bit condescending.\n\nThis game also errs on the side of games like Devil May Cry, with multiple weapon options that each have their own combos and encourages you to mix and match, two different meters that fill up when fighting which enable you to use a powerful ability and an invicibility ability, but like I said most of that is trivialized by the fact that enemies don't stagger too much (the souls-like aspect) and countering their attacks is required to stay alive and is anyway optimal since it deals the most damage.\n\nAll in all I commend the developers for incorporating so many different systems and mechanics into the game, but it feels like there is something missing to bring it all together harmoniously.\n\nNow on the topic of story, I heard this game was praised for giving a female character a strong lead, but I have to say I am hugely disappointed. I may upset some fans for saying this but Fury is a typical example of a female character written from a male perspective. She's rash, impulsive, frequently makes a fool of herself and needs to be \"steered\" in the right direction by the supporting cast of male side characters. The whole game is supposed to showcase her growth and be the story of how she became a better person but it just feels demeaning and very remote from any kind of female empowerment story. At least to me.\n\nI did not really like the fact that this game is a(nother) prequel to the first Darksiders and is just here to fill in some gaps and explain some things that happen in the first game. It basically is a whole story in itself but in the grand scheme of things it is ultimately completely pointless, since we already know how it is supposed to end since we know what happens next.\n\nTo conclude, I would say that this game deserves some love, it looks great and plays alright and I am sure some people will have a blast with it. It offers a lot of content if you're into exploring every nook and cranny and building up your character, however it falls short on many aspects and I could not bring myself to spend more time playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1637417310, "timestamp_updated": 1637417310, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103051648": {"recommendationid": "103051648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031235763", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 259, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1637327407}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls are a little clunky and after dying you are set back a very long way.

The first four to five hours I spent on this, I was baffled at how this game could have been so poorly received online. The visuals have a fun 90s comic book aesthetic to them, the combat, while somewhat frustrating at times, was still pretty fun, and the sound and story were pretty enjoyable. Then came the later stages of the game.\n\nDarksiders 3 tried experimenting with a mesh of some character action/beat-em up style combat, but with the Darksouls inspired take on \"don't bite off more than you can chew\" and fight too many enemies at once. In theory, this is pretty fun, especially since Fury is meant to be a very experienced warrior, making many of her fights 1v1 or 1v3,4,5, etc. seems cool. The problem is that, unlike Dark Souls, which features pretty forgivable hitboxes and a bevy of tools to avoid, mitigate, or negate their damage, the enemies in this game are absolute lethal killing machines, and you have exactly one maneuver to prevent them from hitting you. Fury can 'perfect dodge' to avoid 100% of the damage of an enemies attack and then land a pretty strong counter (provided you're close enough); the problem here is that enemies frequently get behind you and outside of a small red arrow and a quick sound queue that will appear to indicate their attack you will have nearly no warning when one of these flanking enemies attacks you which can lead to some cheap-feeling deaths and frustrating combat encounters. It's also worth noting that when you're fighting the larger rooms of 7-10+ enemies, these sound queues and red arrows are so numerous that it's really just not helpful, and in addition, in the traditional mode of the game, you are locked into an attack animation and cannot cancel that animation to dodge; meaning you get locked in on one enemy and hit by another very frequently, especially in larger fights. You are able to use Items, a leveling system featuring stat upgrades, and special weapons from unlockable forms that can help here, but do yourself a favor and toggle on classic mode (A decision I made way too late into the game), which will save you from a majority of these combat-related headaches. \n\nAside from combat, you have your traditional Metroidvania-style puzzles to progress through the map. I personally did not really love or hate these puzzles. None of them really stuck out in my mind as particularly fun or terrible. The puzzles that involve slowly waiting for bugs to ingest some power up and then chucking them really quickly to destroy a wall just sort of felt like a needless chore, in my opinion, though. \n\nWhere my main gripe in this game comes from is the last two levels, in which, without giving spoilers away, I will just say feature both the least fun boss in the game \"Gluttony,\" which is just an unfun chore to fight, as well as probably the worst most unfun level in the entire game \"Lowlands\" which features several instant death moments (genuinely a majority of game deaths I had came from this one level). This is a shame because, as I mentioned, prior to these later areas, I really enjoyed exploring the world of this game, but my desire to go through the side paths to unlock shortcuts and secrets died and in its place a desire to just be done with the game formed because of these two final areas. \n\nLastly, the story. I hadn't played any of the Darksiders games previously, so I was confused by the grander context of the universe (fair enough since I skipped the prequels), but even the more graspable story of Fury wasn't really all that great I found. Your mileage here, as with everything else I mentioned, will vary. However, for my money, I sort of started tuning out what was happening in the end. It really feels like something I could have read in an issue of Spawn back in the day, which might sound incredibly appealing to some and very offputting to others. \n\nOverall, the bones of a genuinely cool game are here, but it just doesn't feel fleshed out enough for $60. If you can get it on sale for $20 or less, then I'd recommend it, but otherwise, unless you're a fan of the series or a Metroidvania fiend, I'd wait.  6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1636625775, "timestamp_updated": 1636625775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102498647": {"recommendationid": "102498647", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992852381", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1636502359}, "language": "english", "review": "GREAT 3D METROIDVANIA STYLE GAME!!!\n\nThis game is fun and it's a good 3D zeldaish-metoidvania.

there's a crash error happens randomly to people so put that in mind also before you buy the game cuz that crash error might prevent you from starting the game .\nAlso there's some bugs and glitches

The first 2 titles were not simple affairs, by any means, but the creators of this one clearly took some inspiration from Dark Souls!

If you are a stubborn and or/tenacious sort, like me you'll knuckle down, learn the mechanics, git gud and take great pleasure in slaughtering everything in your way by the end.

My least favourite to fight against was gluttony, he's a cunt. Thumbs up if you agree\n\nNow for my least favourite part, I found the map irritating and puzzles infuriating. Had to look up online how to do some because they just weren't obvious in the slightest and those fucking tornados on the last map made me want to marry my dentist who pulls my teeth out with door and string as it would be more pleasant than having to replay that part of the game but as it stands I'm a masochist so.....\n\nGonna get all of the achievements for this game now.... \n\nI have a problem...\n\n\nPlease help...\n\nFuck.\n\nEdit: \n\nI've perfected the game now...\n\nMy sanity is the size of a peanut...\n\nAnyways yeah this game rocks!\n\nI completed the game for the first time in under 16 hours and then as being one of those filthy achievement hunters decided to go on to Armageddon mode, which.... lets just say if I only had Armageddon to do after completing the base game this would've been such a drag but the DLC was definitely fun even though a little short. I love the new weapons it provides especially for the Stasis and Storm hollow.\n\nThe Crucible was a fun under taking however I spent a good few hours just trying to understand why It wasn't letting me skip levels are I made it to Level 26 on the Crucible, turns out because I had started another NG+ it doesn't give you the option to go finish the Crucible until after you've finished most of the game.\n\nNow a few negatives, I did not enjoy some of the grindier achievements such as reach level 100 or the kill 666 enemies whilst in havoc mode, earn 1 millions soul however it was fine because I still had to defeat the game on Apocalyptic as one of the last achievements I needed and wow what an absolutely pain in my fucking rectum this cunting wanking fuck stain of a difficulty spike made me want to shave my testicles with a miniature bear trap and a butter knife as that's how it felt also what probably helped get me through it was 50+ Havoc shards.

Controller was vastly more comfortable to use. With that being said, the controls are not that good on either one. Fighting camera angles was the number 1 problem in most fights. It positions the camera in such a way that it's like you're standing directly behind Fury, not behind and slightly above. I was constantly having issues trying to gauge enemy distance because the attacks have various distance with your whip so it's a learned experience, but the camera angle doesn't help you in learning. It holds tight to your body so it makes it difficult to fight multiple enemies and there are numerous enemy types in the start of the game that are ranged attackers. Dealing with them is just tiresome because the enemies can easily cleave you to bits in about a second or two so you are trying to prioritize the big boy in front and the so the ranged attacker is just constantly peppering you with shots from outside of your view. This game was a poorly designed Darksiders/Dark Souls hybrid. They created a hack n' slash and probably later incorporated Dark Souls mechanics without understanding why the Dark Souls mechanics work. You don't just add a Dark Souls playstyle without first knowing why and how it works the way it does. Very early on in Dark Souls I felt like every little bit of progress was a reward for my efforts and learning. It was a good system of rewarding you based upon how much effort you feel like investing. At no point during this game did I ever feel like I was rewarded. Not for a single thing.

Played Darksiders I, Darksiders II and finally arrived at Darksiders III.\n\n It does things a little different then the other ones. Combat is waaay more methodical. I used to have a \u201cWar Cry\u201d whenever feeling powerful on the other games, but not on this one. It keeps you on your toes. You must pay attention and be careful during the fight, there is no room to be careless\u2026 AND I LOVED IT!\n\n The game is gorgeous, the soundtrack slaps and the history are great. War still my favorite horseman \u2013 gotta love that voice \u2013 but Fury is cool.\n\n With the Lance of Scom as my \u201cmain secondary\u201d weapon it was delightful to dodge an enemy attack and throw my lance at their face!\n\n A point some peoples like to complain is the lack of a map, but believe me, you DON\u2019T need it. The Compass do an outstanding job guiding you to objectives and you get a clear freedom to explore. This is the only time I\u2019ll defend a game not having a map.\n\n If it isn\u2019t clear yet, I loved this game and can\u2019t stress enough how much I recommend it to anyone who likes the Darksiders series.

The games biggest flaw is that it can sometimes be very far to run to bosses from the vulgrim save points after wiping.

Darksiders III is the best of the three, hands down. finished the game in 20 hours on Challenging, with mouse and keyboard. \nTLDR: wait for it to go on sale and get it if you are a fan of the series and don't mind Soulslike gameplay too much. exploration is a major selling point. \nthe world is beautiful, each region is distinct both aesthetically and mechanically. the water level is just incredible. I prefer DII's art style, but DIII is still good. \nthe level design is great at what it sets out to do, borrowing heavily from the Souls series. the puzzles are mostly great, some are tricky. There is one really, really bad puzzle I had to look up the solution to, and judging from the comments on youtube I'm far from the only person who found it atrocious.\nthe exploration is exceptional and for me personally the best part of the game - there is always something for you to find and upgrade and with each new power-up there are always new places for you to explore and come back to. it's fun to get lost going around the map when you get all of the power-ups and then stumble back to a checkpoint. there rewards for exploration are meaningful enough that you get the things you need at a nice pace, but not too fast. great balance in that regard.\nthe combat system is enjoyable, but could have definitely been handled better. I also don't think it was a great fit for the story. the bosses are hit-and-miss. some you can easily destroy on your first attempt, while others took me 10+. [spoiler]Gluttony was def the worst.[/spoiler]\nthe Inventory system is the best out of the three games. all around tight and intuitive. the menus are very, very bad and bugged in a couple places, on the other hand.\nthe story and characters suck. it's Darksiders. what do you expect? [spoiler]the B plot in particular goes absolutely nowhere. it was also weird to get your first narrative choice 15 hours in.[/spoiler] the lore is better, but I'm not a fan.\nthere is also ludonarrative dissonance you can't shake off if you pay any attention - Fury dies way too quickly for somebody who's supposed to be quite powerful from the very start and they just had to put tunnels you have to... crouch in? the former you can explain by their choice of combat system and the latter, I guess, is to ease the load with textures and world design. It's still jarring. \nchanging some of the settings didn't work for me. there was also a major bug that didn't let me attack when I repeatedly smash LMB or RMB to attack. I tried to look for fixes - none worked for me and it seemed to be quite rare.  thankfully that's about the only bug I came across that affected anything. the frame rate was surprisingly stable - I'm playing on a laptop from work. the game never crashed or froze in my 20 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1633364662, "timestamp_updated": 1633364818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100494733": {"recommendationid": "100494733", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986467745", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1706, "last_played": 1633341537}, "language": "english", "review": "So, to start with: It's a bit scaled-down from Darksiders II, but it still fits. The theme, visual identity, and story are all recognizably Darksiders, and all satisfying enough. Enemies are varied enough, especially considering how few enemies it takes to pose a threat, and nearly all of the bosses are at least memorable in their design, and sometimes in their combat styles. It's hard not to love [spoiler]Sloth, a boss carried around by his minions because he's too lazy to walk -- I've never had a boss be too lazy to fight me before![/spoiler]\n\nThe story is... not [i]good[/i], but fun. Think of it a little like Warhammer 40k: A little absurd and a little over-the-top, doesn't completely make sense, but can Rule-of-Cool its way to a good time anyway. (Also, way less grimdark, despite being literally apocalyptic.)\n\nOf the DLC, I skipped The Crucible, but I can recommend Keepers of the Void as at least a reasonable set of Zelda-dungeons that were somewhat missing from the base game. The only problem is, the DLC bosses are all absurdly more challenging than anything in the base game, and the reward for defeating the final one is pretty powerful, which means the rest of the game was [i]much[/i] easier afterwards.\n\nXbox Controller works fine and is probably recommended -- there's no precise aiming that would make a mouse useful.\n\nIt's hard to describe what kind of game it actually is. It's definitely not an ordinary sequel.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nPerformance is kind of all over the place. On a Titan, struggles to maintain 60 at times, but can usually manage at least 40-50, and there's a config file hack to unlock higher refresh rates. High refresh rates don't seem to cause problems, except maybe some framepacing issues, so I also played with a frame limit of 120. Most cutscenes are locked to 30 for some reason. There honestly doesn't seem to be enough going on here to justify these issues, but it was rare enough and minor enough that it didn't kill the experience for me.\n\nOnly one crash-to-desktop for me, and it didn't cost me any progress.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nSo what about the actual mechanics?\n\nDarksiders (as a series) does plenty to establish its own visual theme and story, but it also tends to borrow mechanics wholesale from [i]many[/i] games. I actually kind of like that, and the first game played out like a mixtape of a bunch of my favorite games... but it's not like the Crossblade is \"inspired by\" the Zelda Boomerang. It just is that boomerang with different artwork.\n\nSo when this one is described as a Souls-like, it's not just that it has hard bosses, a parry system, and a death-run mechanic. It's more like talking about Bloodborne, where you may as well give up talking about \"blood echoes\" and \"bloodstone\" and so on, they're just reskinned souls and Titanite, respectively. In this game, Lurchers are souls, Adamantite is Titanite, and Lurcher Clumps (and Clusters and so on) are soul items. Nephilim's Respite is Estus, and I honestly can't be bothered to remember the equivalent of Firekeeper's Souls.\n\nWhere it differs is the hollow system (an elemental system, probably closest to DmC), upgradable enchantments, wrath and havoc attacks, and difficulty settings... and otherwise being pared down significantly, even compared to Dark Souls 1. There are, maybe, ten weapons and ten armor sets in the game, each a single item (not a separate helm/torso/gloves/boots/etc), no equippable accessories (just permanent upgrades), and of course no equipment load system. With so few items, there's no real item-text-as-hidden-storytelling. You can't murder friendly NPCs, and it's not like they'd drop anything interesting. There's no mana or refillable-at-bonfire spells -- the closest is wrath and havoc bars, but these can only be used when full. You can't really build a mage, the closest you can do is find equipment that refills those bars faster when you have to go back to melee.\n\nAll of which is great for me, and probably great for fans of earlier games who might not have [i]wanted[/i] a Soulslike. I bounced off Dark Souls as both too difficult and too [i]inaccessible[/i], to the point where you kind of need a wiki to understand basic mechanics. This one might lean towards too much handholding, but the game should have enough difficulty settings to provide a reasonable challenge both for actual Souls fans, and for people who [i]don't[/i] want to Git Gud.\n\nBut it's worth pointing out that while this game stole most of its mechanics from Dark Souls, there's a lot to Dark Souls that didn't make it into this game.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhat about other stuff from the Darksiders games?\n\nIt's been a long time since I've played those, so it's hard to tell, but it seems like a [i]lot[/i] is missing. Gone is the horse-riding, and also most areas big enough for a horse to make sense. Gone is the [i]entire[/i] item ecosystem from Darksiders 2, and Fury is the first Horseman who doesn't seem to have a gun. The upgrade [i]tree[/i] is gone entirely, replaced with only three stats you can level up, plus leveling up equipment.\n\nThere's still the Zelda boomerang, and it can carry your Hollow element. And there are [i]very[/i] occasional Zelda-like puzzles, most of them extremely simple -- you need the DLC if you want a puzzle challenge. And there's a setting (separate from difficulty settings) to make the combat more forgiving, allow more animation-cancelling and such, to at least make the hacking and slashing feel more familiar.\n\nThere's also still wrath and Havoc attacks... but that's really all I can think of. Gameplay-wise, it's almost better not to try to compare this to the rest of the series. You get a much better sense of what it is by comparing it to Dark Souls.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWith all that said: It's hard to know who to recommend this game to. I guess: If you liked the first game and you're willing to try a Souls-like, give this a shot?

Some interactions with the main character and the others can be entertaining too.\n\nFury's on the squishier side so she can die pretty quickly, but dodging your foes' well telegraphed attacks will keep her alive, with proper timing allowing a deadly counterattack. This and her regular attacks are all satisfying to perform on the various enemies you face.

Exploring the world is enjoyable overall, with the main annoyance being the lack of an overall world map. It can make it a little hard to figure out whether you're going the right way, and you might experience confusion when trying to figure out which fast travel destination is where.

It was divisive because it strayed away from the hack and slash / action adventure roots people were familiar with from the first 2 games in favor of a Dark Souls approach. Haven beaten the game I think this would have been a better game if it dropped the Souls  portion and stuck to its roots. The game is good but could have been better.\n\nI really had to push through the beginning of this game because all the little mobs were killing me quickly. Often times it would be the off screen goons jumping in and sniping hits at me leading to quick deaths. There's a depth of field mod to help with peripheral vision but I skipped it and played the game as it was intended. Once I'd learned to filter enemies into single lines or lure them away from mobs things became slightly better.\n\nThe next frustration was the check point system. Early on check points were a minute or two from bosses which meant tracking back through mobs you'd already killed every time you died to a boss -- and remember, it's early on in the game, you're still learning the systems and are underpowered most of the time. I hated this approach in Hollow Knight and I hated it here. Later on in the game, check points were more frequent and outside boss rooms AS THEY SHOULD BE. \n\nSouls act as currency in this game. You trade souls accumulated for items or to buy attribute points needed to level up your character. Souls are lost when you die forcing you to track back and collect them where you died, a mechanic I'm not fond of as you might as well just respawn me at the last checkpoint with whatever I've accumulated at that point. Fortunately, souls also come in crystal form and are preserved when you die. You quickly learn to dump your raw souls into purchasing attribute points while keeping crystal souls in stock for bigger purchases or stat pumps.\n\nAttribute points are split into health, physical damage and arcane damage. I ended the game with 700 health (20% boost from an item), +50 phys and +200 arcane. Why so much arcane? Because your Wrath, Havoc and all charge moves are arcane based. Havoc form sees Fury transform into giant form that is impervious to damage, heals itself and does arcane based damage. Wrath has various effects governed by which form Fury has equipped but all deal arcane based damage. \n\nPersonally this attribute point system could've been skipped with weapons determining which stat they relied on with weapon slots and other equips giving rise to customization. Speaking of weapons...\n\nWeapons come too late into the game. By the time you've gotten them you've already started upgrading some of them and the resources to upgrade them are either bought with souls, gained from drops or are limited items needed for final upgrades. Souls are better used buying relics and attribute points so you're more or less depending on what you find to upgrade weapons unless you want to grind souls. Weapons are tied to the exploration powers you receive from beating bosses. I would have made all weapons available from the start so that players can pick a playstyle and make builds around the weapons and have exploration powers not be weapon dependent. \n\nThe last complaint I have is the absence of a map. The world is well designed. Everywhere you go is distinct. I do not have a perfect memory though so some system of tracking where doors, obstacles, hidden items or points of interest are would have been appreciated. There are hundreds of little blobs, colour coded obstacles and snaking paths in this game. Backtracking is better saved until you have the last exploration power up or you'll burn yourself out revisiting and combing thru areas after each power unlock. \n\nAsides from these gripes, I had fun with the game once I understood its systems. I played on normal difficulty and classic playstyle (dodge cancelling enabled). Some difficulty was encountered with getting the game running but once I did it ran fine.\n\nIf you've played the previous Darksiders entry then this one is worth a go with the caveat that it takes some getting used to. I've never played a Souls game before so maybe the folks who have will have an easier time with it. \n\nOnto Genesis for me. :)", "timestamp_created": 1632799357, "timestamp_updated": 1632799357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100057759": {"recommendationid": "100057759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007028840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2654, "last_played": 1632775781}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Todo.", "timestamp_created": 1632775899, "timestamp_updated": 1632775899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100056173": {"recommendationid": "100056173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264619970", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1442, "last_played": 1632773124}, "language": "spanish", "review": "buen juego aunque es mejor el 2", "timestamp_created": 1632773234, "timestamp_updated": 1632773234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100043262": {"recommendationid": "100043262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048876051", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 5117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2037, "last_played": 1633881286}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1632754778, "timestamp_updated": 1632754778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100038798": {"recommendationid": "100038798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292447291", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1632747581}, "language": "english", "review": "BTEC Ghostrider", "timestamp_created": 1632747651, "timestamp_updated": 1632747651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100035890": {"recommendationid": "100035890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061336506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1668808932}, "language": "english", "review": "pros:\n-game design\n-large intertwined levels give a sense of an open world experience, which is nice\n-engaging and fun combat\n-interesting, robust and fun lore for those who are familiar with the series\n-visuals style and the presentation overall \n\ncons:\n-buggy\n-poorly optimised - playing on a laptop R9 & RTX3080 and the framerate has been all over the place\n-combat controls don't feel perfectly responsive; I wish the dodge was taking precedence over all other actions like it happens in Shadow of Mordor - effectively, even a well timed dodge will not save your bum if the player character's trajectory of movement crosses any of the enemy attacks, which feels very unfair when dealing with multiple enemies - this is just my subjective view though, some people, I imagine, like it this way better.", "timestamp_created": 1632742138, "timestamp_updated": 1632742138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100028412": {"recommendationid": "100028412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025714020", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 2476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2476, "last_played": 1607508380}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as the previous two but still enjoyable, most notably the Hollow forms & bosses.

A few spots feel a bit rushed, like after meeting Lust she seems to jump a bit forward. But overall I like it and I think Furry has a very good design visually, really looks angry and scornful and gets the idea of Furry across.\nSecondly the gameplay: I complained that the first one was to stale and just became the \"Smack enemies till they die like a brainless ape\" game real quickly and the second one had better combat but ended up having a strange difficulty curve from the random equipment drops. This time they seemed to find a good combat system that is a mix of Dark Souls and Bayonetta of all things. Furry is more nimble and relies on her ability to dodge and counter much more which ends up making the game a dodge and counter game and it REALLY works. So every battle is tense and enjoyable as enemies can do major damage to you so you have to be on your toes to deal the most damage back to enemies. Plus the four different elements were really fun to work into combat, with the exception of the gravity one because its to slow and heavy for the quick movement and attacks.\nThird I want to say is that the story is kind of good, not like amazing, but I followed it more then the first one. It sets up the major elements that are your overall objective, then introduces a wrinkle into the plot with someone trying to betray you. Not having finished the first game, or the second, I didn't really follow what the betrayal was about but I'm willing to bet it is explained.\nFourth and this is a really important one: I really liked the designs of the sins. Sloth being an insect that uses its hoard to move is an interesting play on that and makes sense, Greed is some little goblin that steals shit, Lust I really appreciate it isn't just sex lust its lust for all things but most of all power, Gluttony being a giant sea monster is a take I really appreciate beyond the fat fuck type, pride looks fantastic and is so high and mighty and lastly Envy who I think their design works the strongest in the narrative sense.\n\nOver all very good game, would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1632446613, "timestamp_updated": 1633262034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99847828": {"recommendationid": "99847828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069754493", "num_games_owned": 421, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3187, "last_played": 1650134408}, "language": "english", "review": "All in all a pretty good game.

Part 3 trades in the 'beat em ups meets Zelda dungeons' approach of 1 and 2 for a more Dark Souls inspired combat system in an interconnected Metroid style world. If you were a huge fan of the previous 2 games you may find the changes in gameplay really off putting but as someone who enjoys the kinds of games Darksiders 3 is borrowing from, I didn't mind too much.\n\nYou play as Fury, the whip wielding 3rd horseman of the apocalypse on a quest to find and kill personifications of the 7 Deadly Sins. Its a fun adventure. Nothing super original but TBH what in this series is? The story is very serviceable and I really enjoyed Fury as a character. She's brash and snarky at 1st but has some character growing to do before everything is said and done. Her design is also very nice with tons of detail and she looks great in action with some truly excellent animations.\n\nFury controls really well and using her whip to attack enemies and weave in and out of groups with her invincible dodge feels amazing once you get it down. The dodge is your only real defensive option but a perfectly timed one grants a cool slow mo counter attack that always feels great to pull off. As you progress, you'll earn new elemental abilities that come with their own sub weapons that can be wielded simultaneously with the whip to string together some flashy and damaging combos. There's also a special attack meter that fills as you attack and dodge that gives access to the equipped sub weapon's magic attack. Use this often cause you'll get it back in no time and it can be very helpful. Fury also has her invincible Havoc Form which is a kind of super mode that you'll want to be much more conservative with but can turn a fight around in a pinch. Turning this on and watching Fury let loose on a tough enemy or devastate an entire group is so much fun. Healing is handled much like Dark Souls with a limited but rechargeable health item that can be upgraded and dropped by enemies. The game also has consumables you can use for temporary buffs and finite heals. These items have a use animation that can get you tagged if you're not careful but finding the right time to use them mid fight is vital to success. The combat is tough but never feels unfair and difficulty can be lowered at any time if you're struggling. I suggest anyone looking to test themselves to check out Apocalyptic difficulty.\n\nDarksiders 3 also has some light RPG mechanics so you can carve out your own playstyle with different stats to level and focus on as well as equippable items that can do everything from buff your magic attacks to passively heal you. Its not super deep but it does help to flavor the action quite well. The elemental powerups I mentioned previously also add to your exploration options with things like double jumps or gliding through the air. The world is all interconnected and going back to old areas with new powers can be very rewarding with all the secrets hidden around and the fast travel system keeps backtracking from ever being a chore. The game takes place in a post apocalyptic city which can make the world a little boring visually from time to time, but the game is still quite colorful so nothing is ever too drab to look at.\n\nEnemy design is really well done and there's tons of variety in the enemies you fight. The bosses can be pretty unforgiving while you learn their patterns and have that 'Simon says: you HAVE to dodge here, then attack exactly twice' problem the soulslike genre is often pretty guilty of but they can be fun dances once you get them down. Apocalyptic was what I played on my 1st run and it was pretty frustrating at points but the normal mode should be a nice even challenge for most folks. \n\nThe game clocks in around 10-15 hrs depending on how much side content you do and there is some replay value with new game plus as well. The Keepers of the Void DLC adds some (honestly pretty samey but still fun)  dungeons and bosses you can fight for new sub weapons and The Crucible DLC adds a survival arena. They're both pretty fun and I recommend them on a sale. \n\nI was surprised how much I enjoyed Darksiders 3. There isn't really anything new on display but what is here is very well done. I think anyone looking for a Souls style game with some character action flair or even just a solid action game with some fun exploration could do a whole lot worse.", "timestamp_created": 1632346501, "timestamp_updated": 1632346501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99800328": {"recommendationid": "99800328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978753978", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1634585321}, "language": "english", "review": "If you die, you can repeat a whole section to get to where you were.

There is no simple answer to that question. And the reason behind this is that this game is quite peculiar. Also it may be love or hate for many people. So, let's begin.\n\n\nGame is strange mix between concepts and genres. At first I was mad, because game was a [i]wannabe Dark Souls[/i] for me and mechanics bringed from the game in question is what is, in my opinion, making it worse. You go back to the checkpoint when You die. You lose Your souls and that [strike]elevated difficulty[/strike]. Game wasn't actually that hard after I learned that rumors about level scaling are what they are - [b]rumors[/b] and they have nothing to do with reality and You can actually level up and overcome the difficulties. It was still challenging, but I wouldn't call it balanced. For me it was okay, as I am used to hard game and I call Dark Souls an [i]easy[/i] game (though I generally call it medium, it's easy for me as I got used to it), but people who dislike difficult games may be in quite a pickle there.\nExcept Dark Souls mechanics, game has lot of backtracking, so I even called it metroidvania for a joke, although this may be truer than You think. You are constantly blocked by different things, that You can't cross, when You walk or run through the game (and yeah the joke about disclaimer is... that there is no horse in this game). Yes, many games use blockades to stop player from reaching certain place, but this game overuse that mechanic and almost make the new powers being only usable to get to an old more or less secret place. And because there is no map in this game, it's quite annoying. Path is rather linear and where it is not, You have a compass to told You where to go, so lack of map makes it only annoying when You want to go back to specific place, but forgot where it was. Game world itself isn't bad. It's actually quite like in Darksiders 1, linear, but with secrets, but because there is no map, I didn't want to search anymore, because I really tried to go back to certain path, just to constantly ending up in the \"hub area\". I just stopped trying to search for those collectibles and things.\n\nGame isn't of course as bad as it may sound right now. It has very interesting... combat/power mechanics, Unfortunately except for combat, it is not really used well. Powers give You not only combat capabilities, but also let You traverse the world, which I already explained. Although concept is quite amazing and if it was done... better, It would have been a hit. Don't get me wrong. The mechanic is awesome. Different powers You get gives You different movements, but in the end it doesn't really matter. You just use either any weapon You have at that time \"turned on\", or use one specific in all situations. That's a big miss for that. Great idea with bad execution.\n\nI love bosses in this games. Generally, characters to be precise. Although story was very disappointing. For me they made a mess with a timeline here. Especially that retcon in second game about certain character will be overused everywhere no. So what War didn't know suddenly everyone else knows well. If You want details, here's a spoiler: [spoiler]Ulthane Blackhammer was not dubbed a Maker, before second game. War didn't know he is one, Death learned about Makers, but Fury suddenly knows Ulthane is one, when he sees him.[/spoiler]. Generally I didn't like that suddenly this game has elements non existent in previous games and You didn't see any trace of it anywhere, It's not maybe something major, but it broke the immersion for me. I'm talking about Serpent Holes for example, but also items You use or obstacles on Earth, the You can't see anywhere.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nSo, is this game for You? Well... I can't answer this question. Neither can probably this review. I am unable to provide You a valid source of answer to Your question. Even things I mentioned may sound more important (or maybe less important) to You than it really will be in Your own point of view. But I just want to give You a clue, what can You find there.\n\nDifficulty is definitely higher. While Darksiders highest difficulty was a piece of cake (and I don't lie!), Darksiders II was somewhat harder, because of annoying target locking. The locking persist in this game, but somehow it wasn't that bad after I learned how to use it. Maybe it's a bit more responsive to dodge? Although You can't really fight more than two bigger enemies that takes more than few hits to die. I mean, You can, but it may be annoying in III. Dying here is more fair than in II, though.\n\nAnd because the game is mix of many things, it's really something I can't compare to anything. I said Dark Souls, because mechanics, but the game is [b]not[/b] Dark Souls. Not even for a little bit. But it's different from Darksiders I and II as well.

Movement is great and the combat feels fluid and smooth, unlike the previous games that were clunky as hell (especially Darksiders 2) \n\nDifficulty is challenging enough, some players may be bummed out due to it's similarity to Dark Souls, but if that troubles you, just play in Story Mode, which won't take your souls after death, but I do encourage people to learn the patterns of the boss and try the game on higher difficulties, as someone who played on challenging, it was a nice feat to see some actual challenge that does not require button masshing. \n\nAnother thing this game does differently than the others, is that it doesn't have a map or minimap, which I found it to be among the best things in this game, in Darksiders 1 and 2, I found myself looking more at the minimap rather than the scenery itself, having no map makes you memorize landscapes and levels better instead of relying in the information (that might spoil too much) on a minimap.\n\n8/10\n\nDarksiders 3 > Darksiders 1 > Darksiders 2\n\nTime for Genesis.", "timestamp_created": 1632181555, "timestamp_updated": 1632181555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527363181114196777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99641856": {"recommendationid": "99641856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133136698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1693094852}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Dark...souls actually", "timestamp_created": 1632078712, "timestamp_updated": 1632078712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99641716": {"recommendationid": "99641716", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991307481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2744, "last_played": 1632183356}, "language": "english", "review": "Weighty combat, great voice acting and animation, and inspired level design.

No block but you don't really need one. One of the things that makes this a lot easier than Dark Souls (imo) is that when you die you drop your souls but if you die again before you collect them you don't lose them forever, it just creates a 2nd / 3rd / etc patch holding the latest souls you dropped, in addition to the original.

It all feels like an actual Darksiders game, except with harder, sometimes even frustrating, combat. But gone are the dungeons of old, as is your mount from the second game and some other small stuff.\n\nTraveling through the world feels responsive and all of the areas seem to be well connected, with a boss fight at the end of each area and plenty of items to be found. There\u2019s a bit of (optional) backtracking involved so it still has a little bit of a Metroidvania blueprint in it.\nBetter equipment can be found and unlocked and you have a whip at your disposal when you first start the game. There\u2019s nothing that helps you block damage, instead you have to rely on dodging and trying to finish the fights as quickly as possible (but it isn\u2019t necessary if you don\u2019t want to). Enemies will drop souls that help you level and power up and if you die there\u2019s one more try to retrieve them; die again and they\u2019re forever lost.\nThe boss fights can be difficult, but never as hard as Dark Souls\u2019. With controls that can be changed (one of the first patches gave this option, because sometimes the original movement and layout didn\u2019t quite work as good) and plenty of items that can help in combat it might take you a few tries to take one down, but generally speaking it shouldn\u2019t take you over 5 tries or so.\nFinishing the game should take you anywhere between 12 and 15 hours I\u2019d say.\n\nThe visuals of the game aren\u2019t brilliant, but they fit the style of the Darksiders games for sure. Fury seems be nicely animated.\nThe voice acting is also solid, with a few enemies here and there speaking in an over-the-top manner, but also making it seem more like a spectacle than it actually is in the process, which is a positive.\nI didn\u2019t really have any issues, except for a few issues where the camera didn\u2019t do what it was told. And the controls which were a little weirder in comparison to 1 and 2, but that issue was quickly solved with a patch.\n\nThe big question is: would I recommend this third Darksiders game? Yes. The combat may be hard(er), but it\u2019s also quite enjoyable once you get into the flow of the game. It\u2019s a smaller, tighter game in comparison to the previous titles, but that doesn\u2019t make it any worse. In fact, it was kind of refreshing to play something a little more direct, a little more linear, after all of these open world games the past couple of months and years.\n\n[quote]If you enjoyed this review please consider following me: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41144728-markdj/]curator page[/url] [/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1631465807, "timestamp_updated": 1631465807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808078408241271973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99216845": {"recommendationid": "99216845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380022554", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1182, "last_played": 1631434725}, "language": "english", "review": "Darksiders 3 was fantastic the story was simple but it makes more exciting with a twist of lore of 7 deadly sins.\nGameplay was superb good,playstyle is your choice which i love the darksouls type was challenging which i love.\nOverall its 9/10 the replaylability was soo hard.", "timestamp_created": 1631435881, "timestamp_updated": 1631435881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99212986": {"recommendationid": "99212986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354569128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2560, "last_played": 1598664099}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game, not difficult at all i found but looks stunning, very stylized like the other darksiders games.", "timestamp_created": 1631430266, "timestamp_updated": 1631430266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99185329": {"recommendationid": "99185329", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971349578", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 596, "last_played": 1632872440}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Dark Souls game since Dark Souls", "timestamp_created": 1631389574, "timestamp_updated": 1631389574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99106887": {"recommendationid": "99106887", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044516485", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1680547633}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice addition to the franchise!!", "timestamp_created": 1631287040, "timestamp_updated": 1631287040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99084234": {"recommendationid": "99084234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006577952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1498, "last_played": 1631432972}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente continuaci\u00f3n de la historia de los juegos anteriores... seguimos con los combates brutales y profundizamos en la historia del fin del mundo", "timestamp_created": 1631251542, "timestamp_updated": 1631251542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99001174": {"recommendationid": "99001174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058097346", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 780, "last_played": 1631177060}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a decent hack and slash.

The third instalment of the series depicts a tale of Fury, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, sent to hunt down powerful demons known as the seven deadly sins. Being an avid fan of the first two games I was more than happy to once again see my favourite depiction of the biblical horsemen. However, for all the pretty notions of \u201cthe miracle of life\u201d - the act of birth itself is a rather nasty business. The first steps of Darksiders 3 were much more alike those of a toddler than the mythical fiery bird. After a messy launch it took the developers time, plenty of performance patches and 2 DLCs to raise the newborn Darksiders into a game it is today. In short, the title in question is a decent action game in itself, albeit one that falls flat in comparison to the rest of the Darksiders franchise. \n\n[b] Vulgrim\u2019s fireplace [/b]\nWhen it comes to the long answer as to why Darksiders 3 is an odd one out, perhaps the best place to begin is the fact that the game can be accurately described as \u201csoulslike\u201d. What will immediately draw the attention of the franchise veterans is a significantly different combat system. Now it relies heavily on dodges which, when timed well, allow the player to perform a powerful counterattack. Furthermore, Fury\u2019s simplistic moveset forces her to single-out enemies, forcing a much more methodical approach to combat. No more hurling the Horseman into the heat of battle and decimating groups of foes with devastating combos. Now a group of 3 sturdier enemies may prove a deadly threat. Moreover, take note that the game\u2019s primary currency of souls is now used foremost to level up your character; and needs to be spent at the trader. The souls are also lost on the player\u2019s death, but may be retrieved from the place where you met your end. Let\u2019s just sprinkle on top the fact that the game is now only saved upon reaching one of Vulgrim\u2019s serpent holes, requiring the player to replay significant parts of the level after dying and note that primary healing item is an upgradable trinket \u2013 Nephilim\u2019s respite (not-an-estus\u2122). The above doesn\u2019t make the game bad, however it does paint a picture of severe identity crisis.\n[url] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594393382 [/url]\n[b] Redemption Arc [/b]\nStorywise, Darksiders 3 feels more at home. Called forth by the Charred Council, Fury is sent to eliminate the latest threat, capable of tipping the balance in the endless war between heavens and hell \u2013 the seven deadly sins. Taking place shortly before the main events of the first Darksiders, Fury\u2019s mission takes her to a post-apocalyptic Earth. Basic familiarity with Wrath\u2019s chapter of the story is strongly recommendable for context, as Darksiders 3\u2019s plot is for the most part confusing mess.\n\nAn example of how the events tend to unfold in Darksiders 3 should speak volumes for itself. At early stage of the game Fury summons her steed, Rampage, only to find it writhing in agony from multiple angelic lances piercing its hide. As Fury watches in horror, her enemy uses the confusion to deal her a grievous blow, only for the broken horseman to get whisked away into a magical portal. A mysterious Lord of the Hollows reveals himself and straight-up tells Fury that she\u2019s being used as a mere pawn - now serving as an enforcer of the council, not the balance her superiors are supposed to uphold. Fury brushes off the blunt piece of exposition as ridiculous. In response, Lord of the Hollows develops a habit of \u201crandomly\u201d summoning Fury, bestowing the now horseless rider with elemental powers and wooing her back into the action, conveniently equipped with means to progress the game. Oh, and Rampage? Fury brings up the matter in a single conversation and the plot thread is dropped there, unresolved. \n\nWhat I mean to highlight with the scene above is how Darksiders 3 repeatedly appears to set up events and characters as far more relevant than they eventually turn out to be. To make matters worse, Fury begins the game as a painfully uncompelling character. True to her name, she\u2019s moody and impetuous, in a manner unbecoming of her station. The reoccurring theme of redemption, involved with horsemen quests, in case of Fury is conquering her bad temper. To the game\u2019s credit, it has a surprisingly decent ending, which really takes by surprise considering to how silly most of the plot is. If only it didn\u2019t include a mysterious trinket that everyone allegedly knows about, short only of Fury and the player. Over and over again, the story is all setup and no pay-off.\n[url] https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594392679 [/url]\n[b] Two steps forward, one step back [/b]\nReception of Dark Souls inspirations is a matter of taste and some may forgive story shenanigans in an action game. Truth be told, the core gameplay of this title is positively decent. Tailored around new combat system, the fighting does feel satisfying once you get used to it. Especially numerous and varied encounters with the bosses are the definite highlight of Darksiders 3, providing both a challenge and a jolt of adrenaline. The game heavily encourages exploration, inviting player to revisit areas after acquisition of new powers as to reach new secrets filled with loot. Playing a gatherer proved a surprisingly fun way to fill time between the fights, as environmental puzzles are extremely downplayed in Darksiders 3 to the point they no longer play this part. \n\nSadly, the second you begin to consider this title as part of the series, it all becomes a downward spiral. Those familiar with previous games may as well forget that Darksiders 2 ever happened. Any notions of an open world, the grand scale, RPG-like loot system are well out of the window. Comparable only to the first game, Darksiders 3 prefers its environment up-close and personal. The entirety of the game takes place exclusively on the ravaged Earth, considerably downplaying biblical inspirations and aesthetic that should be the staple of the game. To make matters worse, the game consistently uses the models from the previous two titles, perhaps the most obnoxious example of recycling being Darksiders 2\u2019s arena made into a DLC in the third game. It is fun to play, however seeing what used to be part of base game sold separately just nails the coffin. In Darksiders 3 defence, the puzzle-centred Keepers of the Void DLC does prove that you could get inventive with Fury\u2019s powers, and delivers by far the best bossfight of the game. It\u2019s a shame that it takes extra content to experience this variety, sorely missing from the base game. No matter how you look at it, as a part of a franchise, Darksiders 3 is a step back in almost every regard.\n\n[b] Beating the dead horse [/b]\nClosing summary of Darksiders 3 proved to be unusually conflicted task, as the game left me with extremely mixed impressions. Despite all the criticism I have for the Fury\u2019s chapter, I did enjoy this title. It is a fun action piece, fully capable of delivering several evenings worth of a good time. This would normally earn the game a \u201creluctant pass\u201d mark, although I do struggle to find an audience I could genuinely recommend this game to. Being a sequel, it would normally be the fans of the franchise, however Darksiders 3 is foremost guilty by association \u2013 decent as it may be, the game fails to meet the high standard established by its predecessors. In fact, the fans of series are the ones most likely to get disappointed.

Try as I did to fight it, consumerism holds me in its unyielding grip and I'm a slave to my desires. Boy would it have sucked if this turned out to be awful.\n\nWell it didn't. It's a great game. Perfect? No. But great? Yes. The world is beautifully made, three-dimensional, and well interconnected. I took like, a lot of screenshots. For the memories and stuff. Music was good enough I guess, and the voice acting was, for the most part, outstanding.\n\nGameplay itself - combat and puzzles. The combat, well, it's not exactly what you'd call intricate or complex. You click the mouse buttons. A couple different attacks depending on the order and timing but it never evolves past wait wait wait dodge click click click wait wait wait dodge click click click for the stronger enemies and spam click for the few weak ones. Still, it looks cool. The animations and effects feel satisfying. So I never stopped to consider being bored. Despite all this, combat is pretty challenging. Dodge timings are pretty tight and it doesn't help I have subpar reaction times. It usually takes a few rounds of attempts to download the bosses attack timings before you realize \"wow this boss is easy\". All the 7 main bosses feel simple once you get the hang of it, it's just a matter of execution.\n\nI stated that you \"wait wait wait\" before dodge then attack and I meant it. You really just stand fucking still until the boss starts their attack animation and time your dodge and counterattack. Because you can't get away with being offensive at all. Either enemies won't stagger or they'll completely block your attacks. Still, it's something of a challenge in a 1v1 but when there's multiple not-pathetically-weak enemies, combat just gets frustrating. You can dodge one attack but unless you get the perfect timing and counter, you'll get hit with another enemy's attack right after. This leads to some secondary bosses being harder than the main ones because while the main ones are usually a 1v1 fight, smaller bosses could leave you outnumbered. The game offers you a way to deal with multiple enemies in the form of wrath attacks though, you just gotta not be stubbornly greedy with holding onto max charge \"until I really need it\". You already really need it. Overall, I enjoyed combat. It's fun, but nothing to write home about. Text home about. Language gotta evolve.\n\nThe puzzles eh were hit or miss. A few felt neat. Others felt dull. They're not the real meat of the game though, so I can honestly just skim past it.\n\nI was surprised by the story, it was actually really good; interesting plot with an existence of character development. You go from \"huh, really Fury?\" to \"hmm ok Fury\" to \"you're growing on me Fury\". I suggest you don't have doritos and mountain dew for dinner as you play through the final act because apparently it'll leave you feeling kind of weird. \n\nAnyway, closing thoughts and recommendation.

I don't understand which idiot made the choice to make this into a trashy copy of a souls game with broken combat since it's literally the worst choice they could've make for this type of game.\n\nYou're playing as a Horseman of the goddamn apocalypse yet fury in combat feels nothing more than just pathetic...how are you supposed to take on the 7 deadly sins when you can barely do any damage to some trashy cannon fodder enemy? It just doesn't make any sense to me at all.\n\nWhat was the reason to scrap the combat of first 2 darksiders games and make it even clunkier than the first game is beyond me.(and i can understand why the combat of the first darksiders was like that since you play as war...you wouldn't expect a big hulking mass of pure muscle wielding a massive sword to do wallruns,,,) I've done runs of the entirety of darksiders 2 on highest difficulty without taking a single hit, the combat mechanics are that solid....why would you try to fix something that isn't broken ?\n\nThe level design is just horrid. Enemy placement just feels random and none of the areas really give you the same sense of awe upon entry you'd get from the first two games. If you won't get randomly stun locked by the enemies even though you dashed through their attacks at the right time you'll get most likely stuck on some randomly placed piece of trash in the environment and not to mention most cutscenes after which you get placed into a fight...you'll just get hit right after the cutscene ends.\n\nit's really sad cuz the character/enemy visual designs are beautiful it's just the gameplay doesn't feel satisfying at all. Either fury is the absolute weakest horseman out there...literally even weaker than the crowfather or something just isn't right. The entire game just feel like it was made by an amateur indie studio that had absolutely no idea how to make this game feel solid and just copied the most popular series at the time.\n\nI'm not gonna recommend this game nor will i change my mind on it. This game should've been postponed until the original studio was done with battlechasers and they could continue working on this series proper cuz the first two games felt like an adventure....this game feels like a goddamn chore.\n\nIf you want to play a solid game with beautiful sprawling environments with satisfying solid combat system and good pacing for getting upgrades just play darksiders 2...oh and guess what THE CRUCIBLE IS JUST IN THE GAME NOT SOLD SEPARATELY AS GODDAMN DLC!\n\nAnd if you wanted a quick pros and cons list here it is : \n\nPros: \n+Looks pretty\n\nCons:\n-Unsatisfying/Inconsistent combat with a stupid dash gimmick that was done better in the 2nd game since death doesn't just have one dash that leaves you in an animation lock...DEATH HAS 3 DASHES THAT YOU CAN EASILY CANCEL!\n-Poor level design (a lot of the spots have pointless shortcuts you can unlock later that nobody will ever use anyways)\n-Enemy placement makes no sense and it's done solely to waste your time and add artificial difficulty\n-boring story and characters\n-I'm not even gonna continue listing things cuz it'd take too long to do this entire game is just a really bad bootleg ripoff of dark souls.", "timestamp_created": 1629823464, "timestamp_updated": 1665504711, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98152493": {"recommendationid": "98152493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060611414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1016, "last_played": 1630647368}, "language": "english", "review": "superbb!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1629815730, "timestamp_updated": 1629815730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98152192": {"recommendationid": "98152192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395154480", "num_games_owned": 465, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1196, "last_played": 1629814967}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.

It leans heavy on Traversal mechanics from Metroidvanias or Zelda, combined with a hack-y-slash-y form of Souls combat that finds an interesting balance focusing on mob fights and solo fights. The story is decent (it starts out a little rough and gets better as you progress) and how it slots into the Darksiders story and what it does with its characters is more compelling than you'd expect.\n\nHaving just completed an Apocalyptic campaign on Default Mode [can't cancel attack animations] as my first playthrough, I felt like the bosses were perfectly tuned -- but enemies were a little overtuned at times, often straight up 2-shotting you. Especially when you're fighting in many mob fights throughout a zone, this can get irritating. I'd likely recommend Apocalyptic on Classic Mode [can cancel attack animations].\n\nAs a final note for Souls-veterans, other games like The Surge 1+2 offer a stronger \"Souls\" experience (e.g., slow progression, feeling lost or trapped, very tactical gameplay, etc) but ultimately are less polished than Darksiders 3. Darksiders 3 on the other hand, is a bit more on the 'Souls-lite' side of things at times, but feels very smooth to play.

I hoped for the devs to fix it later on, because I really like the darksiders franchise. Too bad they didn't. As I can see they added a classic combat mode to tackle the critics complaining about the revamp, but nothing has been done about the horrible camera for a soulslike-light game. If you fight on even ground you often cant see your opponent, especially when locking on (which actually has the purpose of not having to fiddle around with the camera), because the MC is blocking the view. This is especially annoying with ranged enemies. One can probably get used to it, but I don't see the point of soldiering through it and reward bad design. Shouldnt be that hard to fix the camera and enough people have complained about it. Main Character is too edgy and forced, even for the darksiders franchise. \nThen there is the fact that the game cant handle full screen display in multi monitor setups (which are really common nowadays) so you are forced to play in window or borderless window mode. All in All 6/10 (-2 for camera (navigation AND combat), -1 for technical issues, -1 for Story and MC).

Nope, animation to heal too.

But I feel compelled to write these few lines because I know how I felt after few hours in Darksiders II and both games are VERY similar (playing the Classic combat, not the default one).\n\nThe beginning hours in the Darksiders II had exploration, puzzles, the combat was interesting, the graphics was nothing short of amazing. Darksiders III few hours from the beginning seem a semi-worse copy of all of the said. Also, sadly, there have been no puzzles so far, and there has been very little to explore apart the \"main road\". \n\nThe similar things, sometimes even bit better, have been the first boss, and the humor. The general atmosphere is on par (kinda paradoxical, but true). The developers could've omitted nice details in the scenery, but they didn't. That warms my heart. Characters presented so far are epic, to the point of the lore, well written. Great work here.\n\n\nAll of this considered, I can say the game's definitely worth the try (costing 11 USD now in the sales is a steal). Were I to know the game would've continued like this, I wouldn't want to pay the 59,99 full price. But I don't know that yet. Only more hours ingame will tell - some games show their potential really only after a longer time.\n\n-------\nEDIT\n-------\nOh boy, I do take back the thing about not existing exploration.

Your mileage may vary on different difficulty levels and/or with Classic combat mode.\n\nIt clearly borrows a lot from Dark Souls, which I'm a great fan of, and I think this is the biggest \"feature\" what makes this game so great:\n- Large interconnected greatly designed levels with numerous shortcuts and no map\u2014check.\n- Almost certain death on encountering new types of enemies until you understand how they work\u2014check.\n- Clever enemy placement so you need to plan your approach beforehand\u2014check.\n- Tens (or even hundreds) of retries on late-game bosses until you learn their attacks and figure out what moves and weapons to use\u2014check.\n\nThe controls are very tight and responsive which makes combat a joy. The combat itself is not very sophisticated, you can use any type of weapon on almost any type enemy and feel good about it. Dodge and parry windows are certainly more accessible than those of Soulsbourne games.\n\nEnvironmental parkour puzzles have been turned down a notch (apart from the last level) compared to the previous games.\n\nThe game looks (if you omit facial animations) and sounds great. \n\nThe story is disposable, 7 sins theme I personally find a bit cringey.\n\nOverall, I think this game is a gem.", "timestamp_created": 1628493970, "timestamp_updated": 1628493970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488372087478637695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97157830": {"recommendationid": "97157830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157240004", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1629622072}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game", "timestamp_created": 1628409743, "timestamp_updated": 1628409743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97062716": {"recommendationid": "97062716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073006568", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1628273281}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried to give this one a fair chance, but it's just bad.\n\nDarksiders has always blatantly copied other games, and this time they went for the Souls series.

Unfortunately, it is not. The combat hinges in a single mechanic: evade. There's no nuance. You don't need to consider distance or if you need to evade backwards or to the sides.

While the Darksiders series isn't known for an overly-complex plot, the games have a general theme they follow and the MC's quest makes sense in the greater scheme of things. But in DS3 you fight the Seven Deadly Sins which just exist and don't pose any immediate threat aside from the Council wanting you to kill them. The story seems even cornier than the rest of the franchise and this comes from an actual fan of the series.\nIn terms of gameplay the Soulsborne-inspired elements are a cool idea and addition to the theme of getting inspiration from other franchises for each game. However, I do believe they're poorly implemented. I'm going to leave the easier difficulties aside and talk about the harder ones. I'm a fan of playing difficult games and most of the times I always play at the highest one available. The general rule is that no matter how difficult a game is, it should be fair. I don't feel it to be the case here. On the higher difficulties, you either spam dodgecounter, which becomes broken and the entire games is reduced to a 1-button gimmick, or you don't and die mostly instantly. This leads to an unbalanced experience.\nThe biggest problem the game faces, however, is related to its performance. Darksiders II had a ton of bugs and performance issues related to the lack of time and financing caused by THQ's bankruptcy. But Darksiders III was released in 2018 by a new subsidiary that should've fixed said issues. This did not happen and the game runs horribly, with an unacceptable amount of stuttering and loading, framedrops, audio issues, crashes, resolution problems etc. A game priced at 60 Euros has no right to present itself with that kind of problems.\nOverall the game is the worst in the franchise but still decent enough at its core.

I clarify this because the game I played is quite different from what it was at launch.\n\nCombat Mode: Classic is the developers' (late) fix to a TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE combat design flaw in this game: NO ANIMATION CANCELLING. \n\nWhy is this bad? - you might ask. Well, no animation cancelling means you 100% commit to your attacks: once you swing your weapon, you can't do anything else until that animation has ended. This works perfectly fine in 1 vs 1 scenarios, like in Monster Hunter: World, but is ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING in 1 vs many scenarios, like in Dark Souls or Darksiders 3. If you want to know more about why is it so bad, a perfect example is SkillUp's review for Godfall (you can check that on youtube).\n\nWell, this mess was fixed in Combat Mode: Classic. Now there's animation cancelling and combat is smooth, as it should've been from the start.\n\nNow, with the actual review. I played it on an AMD Radeon R9 290, 16 GB RAM and AMD FX(tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor @ 1440p. I enjoyed stable 50-60 fps with settings at medium / high. The only flaw I found was a weird flickering white screen issue that I solved by cranking up antialiasing to max. I still see some white flickering textures sometimes, but it's barely noticeable.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous. The music is pretty decent. Most importantly, the story is interesting and makes sense. The voiceacting is on point. \nThe combat (again, in classic mode!)  is smooth and challenging, and takes many ideas from the Dark Souls games. There's a DLC Boss designed to oneshot you with several moves, but still didn't feel cheap or poorly thought. For me, this is something amazing to achieve.\nThere's enough variety in enemy design and weapon design to not feel boring, even after my almost 40h campaign.\nThe puzzles are okay: not too easy, not too frustrating. \nExploration feels rewarding, and there's a LOT of loot to be had if you decide to stray away of the main path, including optional bosses.\n\nAs a side note, I am not a fan of the Darksiders franchise.

"language": "english", "review": "(this review is my ps4 review i bought the game for the fun of it and decided to re upload my review here just for the sake of it)\n\ndarksiders 3 wow after 6 years they finally released another game will this game be good like the first one or is it meh like the second one let me explain everything in my review\nthis game is a hard core dark souls like hack and slash game that tells the story about the four horsemen of the apocalypse this game takes place in the middle of the first one when war was taken prisoner by the charred council and it happens in the middle of the second one where death goes on a quest to prove his brothers innocence now ill get straight to the pros and cons\n\npros:\n\n-game is awesome combat is satisfying and you finally start with a horseman who is not depowered or wounded\n\n-the fact that there is no map just a compass and that's it just explore makes the game all the more thrilling\n\n-finally you don't need to get other peoples weapons and tools and the only new weapons you get is basically this elemental ones called hollows there is fire ice electricity and force and each one has its own weapon with combos\n\n-fury is easily the best horsemen because of her commentary over things sometimes even breaking the forth wall just makes you laugh and get connected to the character\n\n- the environment is just beautiful and the enemies feel like they are just wondering their own business and not awaiting your attack same goes for the bosses you can actually see them chilling over some place and you needing to get there\n\n- this game punishes you for being greedy with your attacks this game is really hardcore about the combat and you need to dodge and learn your enemies attacks before you attack yourself kinda like dark souls\n\n-the currency in this game is very similar to dark souls and some other stuff you can see where they got the ideas from for example there is a shard called undying shard which is basically like Tears of Denial where when your health drops to a zero you get some health back and a second chance\n\n-there are some jaw dropping moments that even made my jaw hit the ground\n\ncons:\n\n- the story escalated to quick barely giving you a chance to get really into the story\n\n-the parkour and the jumping stuff got a huge downgrade compared to the second game\n\n- the amount of bug and glitches and rendering issues is to much sometimes making me quit the game and take a break from that it needs to get fixed fast\n\n-story is just to short and shallow\n\n- bosses aren't that interesting or challenging plus no additional side bosses or side missions\n\n-the lack of horse riding although you are a HORSEMAN but yea what ever\n\n-no replay value what so ever and no new gameplus\n\n- valgrim is a pain and for some reason they made it harder to buy health shards by upping the price of anything you buy everytime by a small amount but at some point its just to much\n\nin conclusion this game is really good and i had a blast playing it it does have some bad moments but i gotta give some slack to thq nordic because this game was really low budgeted unlike the other triple a games in the market right now i wish they will learn of their mistakes and the next game they make will be a 10 but for now i give darksiders 3 a 7.5 out of 10\n\n\ndlc reviews: \n\nkeepers of the void: \nthey added more weapons which is awesome and a new map they did kind of deliver a weak short story to show you how easy it is  to manipulate fury is and how super greedy vulgrim can get besides the new weapons and armor if i'm not mistaken that's kinda it the dlc was really short and easy i beat it in two hours and of course the new bosses are recycled  and the final boss was hard just because of how cheap he is\n\nin conclusion this dlc is just a cool little side quest nothing more i don't really recommend it \n\n\nthe crucible: \nits a cool addition to the game basically its a 100 round arena where every 25 rounds there is a boss fight and there is a awesome secret boss surprise if you continue it to the end all in all i recommend this DLC and its a cool ad on to the game", "timestamp_created": 1625215176, "timestamp_updated": 1625215176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458015263080596924",

The story is centred around the horseman Strife and her character journey to be less angry (oh and setting up a bunch of plot elements for future games... which may never happen).\nThe graphics are pretty decent, environments are really nice, the music is pretty good (series has always had a good soundtrack), and the voice acting isn't too bad. Sad that the actual gameplay is a let down.\nOn higher difficulties (where you're forced to engage with the combat mechanics) you'll find most encounters to be annoying, with poor telegraphed attacks (usually the mobs, bosses tend to be better at telegraphing although there timing can be a bit messy), attacks are often wider than your dodge range (so you better get those perfect dodges in), and enemies that attack you from off-screen (in general fighting more than 1 enemy in this game is a pain even with off-screen attack indicators). Combat does get (a lot) better as you unlock additional items such as a range weapon so you can lure enemies to you (or play a game of find the exploit), and you even get an item to increase iframes and health regen, but these only come half-way through the game. So a big chunk of the first portion of the game is a slog, they've changed how checkpoints work so you respawn at this games version of a bonfire and all the enemies you killed will respawn... so I hope you like the feeling of having your time wasted.\nIn fact the checkpoint change was probably the biggest issue, since I can overlook occasionally bad combat, and the cheap deaths, but when you suffer a cheap death (say your dodge didn't go through correctly or you're surrounded and dodge one attack only to be hit by another and that kills you, or you've just met a new enemy type which has a couple of one shot kill abilities that you couldn't know about ) the worst part is the game punishing you for dying in those cases.This builds more frustration and satisfaction with each death.\n\nThe game has a simple level and attribute system, this works decently well on lower difficulties where you can adapt to your play style, but the developers approach to high difficulty was to increase enemy health-pools and attack damage (so the laziest way possible), so you're more or less forced into a glass cannon build (spending points into health is meaningless if you're still getting killed in 4 hits instead of 3), which just means the issues with dodging become increasingly apparent.\nThe developers have attempted to patch some of the worst parts of the combat, so now your dodge can interrupt your attack animation but even with this the combat feels off probably due to hit boxes being too large, some enemies requiring a perfect dodge, attacks tracking your dodge and chained attacks still hitting you.\nThere's difficult and rewarding, where the mantra of 'git gud' is spouted a lot and each death feels like a screw up on your part (something to improve), and there is difficult and frustrating because death was unavoidable because the mechanics weren't polished enough. Sometimes the game is in the former, more often than not the game is in the later.\n\nOh and the puzzles that the Darksiders series was known for? Well they've pretty much removed all of that so you have more time to... engage with the combat. There are a few, but they're not particularly deep of complicated, and only appear later in the game when you've unlocked more puzzle-y abilities. It's a bit sad really, the first game was basically a puzzle game with some combat, the second one has some drawn out and tediously samey puzzles but had more combat, and this one had most combat but not a lot of puzzles for variety.\n\nIf you know anything about the development backstory you'll known Darksiders 3 had a rocky history, and although I should be luck as a fan of the franchise that there even if a 3rd game I'm just sad that it's not an evolution of the Darksiders series (in terms of mechanics and gameplay) but just them copying some mechanics from other games and pasting them over without the needed polish (always a risk when you decide to go in a different direction with an established franchise). If there is a 4th game maybe they can try and polish the combat up, and really make it shine more (and do away with the dark souls bonfire and give us proper checkpoints again).\nI don't think we'll see a Darksiders 4, sadly...

Some games just have dodge be dodge, some games make a bunch of timing aspects where you need to dodge within time windows, then some games put finicky timing windows in with you character having the toughness of a wet paper back so unless you have exact reaction times to attacks you haven't seen before expect to die a lot and even to attacks you were used to dodging.  This falls into the last group.\n\nHonestly I play Monster Hunter and even in the worst of times there it's more consistent feeling than what I'm getting here.

That's because, even though I really love the story, and I love the challenge presented...I just can't get over the enemies re-spawning when I die.\n\nIt looks like they took a page from Dark Souls, well THQNORDIC, put that page back. I Feel this game, as compared to the last two, lacked a great deal of refinement.\n\nIf that where the worst part, my review wouldn't be so long. I only recommend this game to those in need of a good story, and just want to hurt things with a sword whip.\n\nYou get, a Hammer, a Whip, a Halbred, and nunchakus. I'm not going to complain, but I would have liked to use the hammer with fire, or the nunchakus with lightening. The fact they had to be tied to a specific element just limited their uses for me. I whipped things 90% of the time. \n\nDarksiders 1: Gauntlets, Scythe, Bigazz sword, shuriken, Hand-gun, a magic horn, the \"get over here\" chai. Your combos where locked up and you had to train (buy) them. So progression felt better just based off this fact alone.\n\nLet's compare that to Darksiders II real fast, where you get...Dual Scythes, Hammers, Maces, Spears, A gun, a talent tree with like, 6-8 different abilities that can be upgraded...there is a wiki page that is quite long on the list of weapons. I mean, it was awesome. I felt I had even more freedom than Darksiders 1 to play to my style. Your combos again where locked and you had to buy them with a new currency \"gilt\". That was still fine, it was even more improved because you could typically buy all of them less than a quarter into the game.You also had side quests, and a place to see that information/track it.\n\nDarksiders III...you get 6 weapons, each can have 1 unique ability that can be equipped...you can upgrade both abilities and weapons but it doesn't present anything new...just stat increase. Unique/legendary weapons where removed, maps removed, fast travel removed, horse removed, talent tree removed, quest log removed, side-quests depreciated, leveling system is payment based, all combos are unlocked from the begining (making it real hard to get used to using the right combo at the right time). Blocking has now totally been removed, your character flinches at everything, every enemy has immunity to flinch on a specific move set, instead of only SOME of the enemies having immunity to flinch. \n\nBosses where rushed, 1 dimensional, boring as hell and often left me thinking \"is there another method? Is there something I am missing?\" Well, there is sometimes, but it's so subtle and you are given exactly 0 clues about it, in most cases trying to do it on harder difficulties just results in death.\n\n As I mentioned. Major step back...they took the map, fast travel is now Darksiders 1 style again...Just what the hell happened? I would recommend this game only for the story, don't play it for the game-play. Just shift to easy and coast through. \n\nProgression feels like progression only when you gain something from it. If you are constantly just gaining numbers, while the enemies are gaining the same numbers (if not more frequently on the harder difficulties) the game is not \"fun\". It becomes a task with no surprises. The first playthrough I remembered thinking, \"ok, got nunchucks with fire, and a spear with lightening, wonder how many elements i collect in this? will there be an ice bow? or perhaps a water lance?\"\n\nNo...you get a slow ass gravity hammer that is unusable on harder difficulties without the timing and attention span of the big G himself.\n\nAnyways, great story...but what happened guys? Did you blow the budget on graphics? I feel like buying this game on release was a lot like buying a puppy with parvo.\n\nShould I bother with Darksiders Genesis? When will Darksiders IV come out? Will you correct those mistakes made in III?\n\nAnyways, my two cents, hopefully THQNORDIC finds it useful, I enjoy what you guys do, take care.", "timestamp_created": 1623948495, "timestamp_updated": 1623949472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758932173252105713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93871703": {"recommendationid": "93871703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050572818", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 603, "last_played": 1623877094}, "language": "english", "review": "bugs bugs bugs\n\nPlayer gets stuck in unreachable spots, souls get stuck in unreachable spots, ctd's, missing textures, missing audio\n\ntook the boring out of souls like games - \"crawl through a tight space twice with 2  long runs and a simple jump to get back to the boss\"\n\nNo proper finishers like DS I & II\nNo gear system (sure upgrade some weapons and buy armor that looks exactly like the one you have) Like there was in DS II\n\nthe guys that set up keyboard support clearly never played with one\n\ngame needed more cooking time, and when a studio fails to get the game done and goes through some backhand processes to release but still publishes at full sale point it becomes a ripoff\nthis game released 2,5 years ago, yet missing textures are still a thing\n\nVA's are great, but can only carry a game so far\n\nenvironment clearly had massive holes they just filled with some random rocks and whatnot\n\nI had hardened myself seeing reviews and playing the first 2, but now it's gotten to the point where Im writing a sad review instead of running back dropping dead to reach my bugged souls", "timestamp_created": 1623875721, "timestamp_updated": 1623875721, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479452043771743774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93849690": {"recommendationid": "93849690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117748226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1455, "last_played": 1543691205}, "language": "english", "review": "Is game good ?

I first played this on my ps4 and hated it due to the performance issues, and so I tried it again on steam when it was on a deep sale. \n\nSo where to begin? First, the camera. Since this game is trying to be a souls-like, it makes sense that the camera would be zoomed out enough so that you can react to whats happening around you. Not in this game however. Instead, if you lock onto an enemy not only is it near impossible to see what your other enemies are doing, but it's also difficult to see what the enemy that you are locked is doing as well because the camera likes to stay directly behind Fury, your character, instead of being above your character like in the soulsborne games (or zoom out the camera even more, like it did in Darksiders 2). And this problem gets even worse in areas with tight corridors.\n\nThis game's combat is worse than the previous two titles. The first problem with the combat is Fury's defensive capabilities. She has none. All she has is a dodge that has too long of a recovery time to be of any use unless you're either using it for perfect dodging, allowing you to retaliate with a powerful attack afterwards, or for fighting someone one on one.  However, if there are multiple enemies in the mix then dodging while locking on is a bad idea because you could be dodging into another enemies' attack. In that case you might think that it's best to not lock on and instead dodge (or rather dash) away from the enemies for breathing room, except Fury's dash doesn't travel far enough to be of any use and on top that it takes too long for her to recover from each dash, meaning the enemies are going to put in some cheap hits. War in the first game has a dash that is just as terrible as Fury's, but to compensate he was able to block attacks. In the second game Death was able to roll three times in quick succession, with his third dodge having a long recovery time to prevent players from spamming the dodge button. Strife in Genesis has two guns and he can set up traps. The game tries to be an action game like the rest of the series, but the souls-like mechanics don't compliment the combat in any way and instead clashes with it.\n\nThis game also has some miscellaneous issues as well. For one, during your second encounter with Wrath, his first phase is not fun in the slightest because the only challenging gimmick to it is that he constantly runs away to heal himself by killing angels and demons that re fighting each other, in other words you have to out dps his healing, which even though I'm lvl 40 and almost have my whip and secondary weapon fully upgraded, I still can't damage him enough in time. There were also instances where some objects (not a lot though) had missing textures and I had enemies get stuck on terrain. \n\nLastly, The Scar. FUCK. THE. SCAR. If you want a prime example of poor level design, look no further than the scar. It has enemies that spawn multiple enemies when you fight them, (and I've already rambled on why fighting multiple enemies at once is terrible), bullshit enemy placements such as ranged demons from multiple platforms away attacking while you're busy attacking other enemies who are in your way (and dashing away isn't going to save you), and puzzles that are either unclear ( how was I supposed to know that the tornado is unable to lift a heavy block if it's frozen ) or require you wait a few moments othrrwise the puzzle won't work ( again that freaking tornado ). \n\nThe only praise I can give this game are the seven sins themselves. Their designs (as far as I'm aware) are clever and unique. Sloth is a big, fat bug that lets his drones do all the work for him; Pride looks like an angel and acts like she's better than anyone ( she even refuses to fight you unless you prove you're a worthy opponent by killing the other sins ) even though she wears a mask that hides an imperfect face underneath; And Lust is no longer a depiction of sexual lust but rather all forms of lust ( a lust for glory and a lust for power being great examples ) and wears awesome looking armor. As I said, the design for the seven sins are great. It's just a shame the rest of the game isn't all that great.\n\nIn short, even if you are a fan of the series, save your money, time, and sanity by giving this game a pass. This is my first time writing a review this long, so I'm sorry if it's somewhat of a mess, but as a fan of the series I needed to get this off my chest. I may beat this game a second time, this time on steam, but it's really trying my patience.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1623010064, "timestamp_updated": 1623010064, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509933769702911377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93301224": {"recommendationid": "93301224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000334671", "num_games_owned": 689, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 819, "last_played": 1622989090}, "language": "english", "review": "Finishing the 'Metro: Last Light' left me a unpleased feeling.

It is basically a Devil May Cry / metroidvania game with some Dark Souls mechanics (not difficulty). \n\nLess of a button masher than DMC and a lot more forgiving than DS, it's a nearly perfectly well balanced action game as far as difficulty goes. You are kind of a glass cannon that can dole out crazy damage and combos but you can get stomped very easily if you are not careful. The exploration is also top notch. Using new powers and techniques to revisit old levels and unlock huge new areas is a treat. The boss battles are great, and the game runs smooth. \n\nThe graphics are serviceable, it definitely feels like an older game even though it's relatively new. The effects are good, the art is crisp, animations are smooth but it does lack detail and some textures are really muddy and the lip syncing is pretty old school. \n\nI really like the character you play as, but she can be off putting. You are basically playing as Xena with super powers. Voice acting is good, story is serviceable and has some cool things going on keeping you intrigued as to what is going to happen next.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have only unlocked two of the multiple forms, and they offer different play styles. I soon found that having multiple tools at your disposal wasn't just helpful for traversal, but you can spec the different weapons with upgrades for different jobs. For instance, I configured my whip to reap more currency from destroying the environment since it has a crazy long reach, you can trash a room quick for a bunch of extra $. Daggers I have poured a bunch of money and upgrades into to make them my burst damage weapon of choice for 1v1, while the other weapon (forget the name) is spec'd to generate fury so I basically kill small mobs with that, go to daggers for big guys and have a steady stream of fury attacks. Each weapon has a special fury attack that needs to be charged up first but can unleash devestation and can really get you out of some sticky situations. \n\nThere are different armors available, but they are few and far between, I wish there was a bit more in that regards. \n\nThe biggest complaint is targeting enemies. The camera angle it puts you in when you target an enemy is horrible especially when facing off with multiple enemies and leads to you getting hit in the back or from off screen a lot, HOWEVER, with a mouse/keyboard I am able to play without targeting at all very easily and the issues with getting hit from behind disappear as you can easily view your surroundings when not in the targeted camera lock. If you have trouble with getting hit from off screen I would strongly suggest giving mouse/keyboard a shot. \n\nSome complaints about the game are just untrue. I saw a review from IGN stating that if you level up you never turn into a badass and can constantly get creamed and have nothing to show for your work (like skyrim or something where all the creatures level up) this isn't really the case by what I can tell. Enemies in different areas will be higher or lesser level and it IS possible to get to places you aren't really meant to be yet if you are good at exploring (though they do a decent job locking big difficulty spikes behind powers you have to obtain first when you are a bit more powerful). In the metroidvania style, once you have some new tools under your belt you are supposed to go back to previously traversed maps and do some exploring. I can tell you the enemies there have not leveled up with you and you do end up feeling like a shredder. Some enemies that caused me a hard time I came back to and just obliterated them no problem. \n\nThis game doesn't do anything new or innovative in any way, but it is a well balance game with combat that can be best described as 'difficult but fair'. I'm probably half-way through the adventure and having a blast with it though and will certainly be playing it to its conclusion and quite possibly explore whatever DLC it has to offer.

There went quite some effort in making an interconnected world with lots of secrets and - of course - metroidvania like progression with new skills that you get after certain boss fights.

I stopped for the first time when you defeat for the first time the Wrath. Than i came back to it and i fall into it. Pretty interesting story, nice character, Fury is just waifu \"LULW\". Than there is a Watcher, which i personally dont like much, but it can be pretty nice character, this is just personal preference. All the bosses, Envy the first \"fake\" one is tutorial one and its so obvious and its pretty easy on any difficulty. Avarice is pretty funny one, throwing things at you, like bathtub, cabinet and more. Just foking funny to be honest. Sloth is pretty easy and theres nothing much to say about. Big Bug Big Slam. Glutony.... i was raped by this boss. I spend on him around 12-15 minutes, so for me the hardest one. Lust is pretty nice boss, i enjoy this one so much, when you dodge her, it is so satisfying. Pride, this is the one boss which i dont like for one simple reason. The second phase is that much bullsh*t she \"summons\" a head, which is spreading lazer around the arena (i got insta killed personally). She also use a shield so you have to destroy  the shield, gave her around 5 hits (depends on wepon) and again. And second phase.... Abraxis is hidden one and you need him for hidden achievement, its quite visible that hes not mean for the main game. Now the Watcher or Envy...  I guess this is the boss created just because we need it. Envy/Watcher/Snitcher is just about spam. When you spam the sh*t out of her, and you learn how to dodge you have no chance to die. \nI finnished the game on APOCALYPTIC and now am playing on the hardest difficulty which game offers.

Does it live up to the hype? Is it a satisfying pay off to the long wait? Hard to say really.\n\nTaking a turn from the previous games hack and slash/rpg models, DS3 takes a Souls like approach to the series, with a revamped combat system, overhauled world design, and a stronger rpg focus on stat builds over its predecessors.\n\nPro's:\n- Highly satisfying combat mechanics that actually feel like they pack a punch, far more satisfactory than any of the Souls series for that matter. \n- Excellently themed score with a great mix of the divine, dark, and the chaotic elements of the balance of the war of the ages. \n- Large spanning map with loops and bends that all link up quite effectively. \n- Unlocking new core skill sets feels akin to the Ocarina of Time days, opening new opportunities to explore and attack enemies.\n- Large variety of weapons and attack animations, from massive hammers to darting claws. \n- Vastly improved art style over the older games, makes for not only a more modern look, but still the timeless design it always was.\n- Relatively well written story that connects neatly into the original title, without too many holes, and a greater mystery hinted at to fuel your curiosity. \n- Relatively good puzzle mechanics that won't seriously halt you in your tracks, but some will require a bit more of a think. \n\nCons:\n- Fury as a character feels poorly portayed. Fury doesn't equal rage. She's much too hot headed and the voice actor doesn't feel the strongest for conveying that emotion.\n- Lack of a map means no real ability to gain bearings. This is an odd step away from the traditional game designs. \n- Sometimes, very unclear mechanic explanations with little-to-no hints about them. \n- No currency scaling and hence, no reason to grind the late game areas for loot. You're better off killing the opening area mobs as they net the same reward. \n- Abundance of resources that overall seemed a tad pointless. I cleared the game only ever using a couple strength shards and heals. \n- Left/right directional quick inventory system rather than a scroll wheel or other form, more of a pet peeve really.\n- MASSIVE Save game glitch that reverts potentially hours of progress and happens at random, no known fix and no fix in sight from THQ. I myself lost at least one sit session of progress.\n- At times, very unfair enemy attack chain capabilities against your lack of ability to stagger. Massive hits on small mobs sometimes barely phase them, but you can be stun locked.\n- What feels like a lack of voice actors, same voice for numerous npc's.\n- Pet peeve: no consistency in character sizing in regards to humans. War absolutely towered over humans in the first game, now he's the same size. Why?\n\nStory: Certainly not bad, but not as satisfying as the previous games. Most characters are voiced well and the plot is clearly drawn out for you. Only complaint is most of the characters of the Seven Deadly (the main bosses of the game) feel more comically designed rather than kind of biblically. Greed feels very much out of place in the universe, same for Sloth, Gluttony, and perhaps Envy. We get to see an array of familiar faces again, including all of the horseman, Ulthane, and everyones favourite, Vulgrim. Adds some new characters along the way, but they feel a little lacking compared to the mains. As for Fury, she is far too short tempered and this damages her character presentation I think. Her bark is far worse than her bite it feels as she is constantly mocked, ridiculed and jeered at for being the weakest link of the Four. Though she might prove triumphant in the end, I feel like she's only really just scraping by, and not growing as she really should. She may be Fury, but that shouldn't render her uncompromising.\n\nGameplay: Arguably the most divisive aspect of the game. Trading hack and slash for a Souls-like experience was granted to stir a ruckus. Honestly, I didn't mind this. You can opt to play with a more traditional combat design, but the game was purely designed for the new experience. Fury never really feels underpowered, but she certainly never feels as powerful as she should be. Travel outside of serpent holes is slow and tedious, but at least serpent holes are no longer an area to explore in their own right. Puzzles aren't anything too fancy, but those present in the area The Scar are a little drawn out and the area generally feels overly designed. Much more twisty and turny than the others. \n\nGraphics: Not much to say. Sharper, more vibrant, and a much nicer lighting system over the previous games. Far more detailed than the previous games, and will age better. \n\nSound: Gorgeous sound design. Everything feels adequately representative of what you see on screen, from the low hum and fizzle of waxing lights, to the grind of monolothic stones, to the slosh of swampy and murky waters, to the crack and crunch of soil beneath your feet. The music is a great accompaniment when it plays and the main menu theme feels foreboding yet empowering. \n\nOverall Verdict:\nThough a divisive entry into the series, it's certainly not unwelcome. A slower, more careful approach is required here as you delve into the beginning of humanities doom, and the all time conflict between heaven and hell. As someone who has been a fan of the series since its conception I do recommend this game for continuity, at a price of course, a bargain, a devilishly one at that. Not an amazing, stand out experience, but nothing that you'll shovel under trying to forget about.\n\n7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1621080486, "timestamp_updated": 1621080486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92031200": {"recommendationid": "92031200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076419422", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1683823140}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is very glitchy\nits combat system is also not good\nits armor and loot system is too trash\neven darksiders was better\nOverall its an OK game\ni would recommend it for a new experience though\ni also love its new concept of Hollows\nand the Lord of hollows too\nbut i hated the most is Rampage's death>\nits and nice game for hardcore players", "timestamp_created": 1621072500, "timestamp_updated": 1683813513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92019801": {"recommendationid": "92019801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036327396", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1621021025}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what i wish the new castlevania games would have been", "timestamp_created": 1621053380, "timestamp_updated": 1621053380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91969212": {"recommendationid": "91969212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003694429", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1620980438}, "language": "english", "review": "There is only 1 reason I would never even recommend playing this game, even if you got this product for free like I did.\nGrappling is a joke, I can not think of the amount of times that I've seen the grapple indicator, hit \"X\" and just swung at nothing in midair before falling.\n10/10 Waste of time XD", "timestamp_created": 1620980536, "timestamp_updated": 1620980536, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91941412": {"recommendationid": "91941412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085894149", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1003, "last_played": 1620847714}, "language": "english", "review": "Plays quite differently than the first two games.

I think a map plays a crucial part in any Metroidvania in order to keep track of the rooms you have already cleared and to make the backtrack more enjoyable. And believe me there is a LOT of backtrack. The levels itselfs are very well designed and convoluted. Its cool to unlock a new shortcut or to come back to a previously locked area hours later and remember when you visited it first time. However because of the lack of a map I did not know where to go two or three times after defeating a boss.\nThere is a little compass on your HUD but to be honest I did not feel like it was much of a use.\n[b]remove the compass, give the player a proper map and the game will improve a lot![/b]\n\n[h1]Puzzles and abilities[/h1]\nWhile this game starts as a simple fighting game you will find yourself solving more and more puzzles as the game progresses. They have done a good job balancing the amount of fights and puzzles. You are given 4 different forms each with an unique ability, while they do not really differ in fight they still provide unique feelings and are important to solve different tasks.\n[b]Nevertheless I feel the combat would improve a lot if the enemys actually had strength and weaknesses[/b]\nRight now you will just skill one weapon and always use it to fight. Imagine having to adapt to every enemy even during combat and always change forms, it would add a whole new level of depths to the game.\nAnother criticism regarding the different forms is: It is kinda wasted to not give your default form any ability, once you get your first special appearance you will never again use the default style.\n[b]I think they should have given the default style an ability too[/b] furthermore it is a questionable decision to give your Hero a purple color scheme and at the same time to make one of your special appearence purple too, it just felt out of place.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\nAs already mentiond you should not expect too much from the combat system. It still is a hack'n'slay, that means you are given two different buttons to smash plus a dodge. While u might feel like you do not have any control over the fights at first, you will see a vast improvement if you actually spent some time learning your enemys behaviour and how your weapons and attacks CAN be combined. It took me around 6 hours to fully understand how the combat is meant to be.

At the time, THQ declared bankruptcy; all of their IP's and studios were bought up minus Vigil and Darksiders. With no owner, the IP was under threat of becoming abandonware. Then came Nordic Games to purchase the IP. Purchasing the THQ license as well, they would become THQ Nordic and a few years later we get this.\n\n\tDS3 flows seamlessly from DS2 in a way that sequels developed by different studios typically don't. Gunfire Games is behind this one, and what percentage of the staff are remnants from DS2 and 1 I do not know. What I do know is that it feels like coming back to familiar territory here. As with every new game in the franchise, there's an attempt at introducing new ideas by parroting game tropes from other genres or franchises of the time. Darksiders 2 added elements of loot-based games and Prince of Persia. Darskdiers 3 mimicks Dark Souls.\n\n\tA much, much easier Dark Souls. A lot is made of how 'hard' this game is, but it was either updated when I actually played it or a large swath of people are just bad at video games. Unlike Dark Souls, there are frequent shortcuts you unlock in levels that allow you to more quickly reach your objective. Meaning that when you die, it's not a huge loss since you just opened a gate that allows you to skip all the work you did. And these shortcuts are plentiful: you will never die and feel like you lost a world of progress like you would in Dark Souls. \n\n\tEven the penalty for dying isn't as harsh as in DS. In Dark Souls, you have to make it back to the point of death to recover any currency lost due to dying. In Darksiders, it's much the same, only that failing to recover it and dying again doesn't permanently lose your gains. In essence, there is no penalty for dying other than a respawn. You can even partially put in what you have towards your next level increase, rather than carry around all that currency. \n\n\tThe 'Metroidvania' aspects are there, but never to the degree of the Souls series. For the most part, this is a linear game that keeps you on track for the majority of the time. It's never designed in such a way that you are either lost or just exploring for the sake of it. As in the Metroid series, you unlock new abilities that allow you to go to previously inaccesible areas, but there really aren't a lot of optional sections here besides the odd cliff here or the small room there. There are a few shortcuts between areas, and some optional loot (that you can otherwise buy) which require abilities. It's the most straightforward 'Metroidvania' experience, with abilities used to block off areas and bosses so you play the game in the intended manner.\n\n\tThe combat is what puts some people off. The 'problem' is that enemies do a shitload of damage and aren't staggered off their attack animations. So you can't just mash incessantly and barrage them with so many hits that they either die or are in their 'I'm being hit' animations. You actually have to watch their attacks. Which is fine, since dodging in time gives you a powerful counter-attack. But the camera gets in the way at times since it never zooms out to give you a larger perspective of the battlefield. So you'll get hit from the back or side by one of the 7 enemies attacking you. It's a situation where it can be annoying, especially at first. But as the game progresses it gets easier, since the nature of Fury's attacks are large, sweeping blows all around her with her whip. With increasing attack strength, the minions around you die quicker so you can focus on the 2 or 3 actual threats.  Increasing FOV also massively helps.\n\t\n\tThe majority of negative reviews take issue with the combat, but it's legitimately the same as before. Each weapon does not carry any fewer moves than in any other game in the franchise. The layout for combos is very much the same. And unlike Dark Souls, you can cancel every move almost instantaneously into the dash. The only legitimate complaints, in my eyes, are that the camera doesn't do you any favors in fights. Otherwise, even the addition of a 'classic' mode for the combat is pointless since it doesn't actually change the combat in any discernable manner.\n\n\tIs Darksiders on par with 1 and 2? No, but in my case it's because it lacks the lore and secondary characters that the first two games had. Perhaps the developers wanted as few cutscenes and story sequences as possible in an effort to mimic the quiet and solitary nature of Dark Souls. Whatever the case, I also feel that the game world is small and linear, so it doesn't take advantage of the Metroidvania style of game. But these grievances don't destroy the game for me, and the mega negative reviews are wild. DS3 continues the franchise with a level of quality that keeps on par with previous games. We're just lacking an exclusively Strife centered game to wrap up the horsemen.", "timestamp_created": 1620594669, "timestamp_updated": 1620594669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407432079315185547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91732113": {"recommendationid": "91732113", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989277103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1383, "last_played": 1622824502}, "language": "english", "review": "very enjoyable, smooth combat experience, inherits the title and lore of the other games well", "timestamp_created": 1620594223, "timestamp_updated": 1620594223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91719495": {"recommendationid": "91719495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123590127", "num_games_owned": 915, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 1184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 588, "last_played": 1620857556}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a solid action game", "timestamp_created": 1620578919, "timestamp_updated": 1620578919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91717160": {"recommendationid": "91717160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138999820", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1138, "last_played": 1620573235}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know whose idea it was to turn Darksiders into a Dark Souls clone but it kinda works.", "timestamp_created": 1620576097, "timestamp_updated": 1620576097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91709241": {"recommendationid": "91709241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033628997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1416, "last_played": 1620565898}, "language": "english", "review": "This game Screams \"We spent 90% of the budget making it look good and had nothing left to design a game\". \nA leveling system with diminishing returns and very few options, it could have been left out and would have had no impact on the game. \nA combat system that says \"we made a dodge feature and you WILL USE IT\" and with no real options rather than being playable in your own way its boring and the same fight every fight.\nThe enemies look neat but end up being a never ending re-skin of about 6~ enemies with a couple of special encounters.\nI loved the last two games and that's the only reason I even bothered with this, it falls short, I completed it in under 24 hours and literally couldn't be bothered with the bonus content. \nAlso the world is really small.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1620566717, "timestamp_updated": 1620566717, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91707352": {"recommendationid": "91707352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044458534", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 706, "last_played": 1620907259}, "language": "english", "review": "A good attempt at what is a Souls-like game.

Not being dynamicly prepared to respond to the character's moves, and failing to smartly adjust to the proper angle view.\n\nBasic enemies and frame timing evading. With a poor moveset of only 2-3 attacks, enemies designed combat behavior is a constant loop of the same brawl moves, in the exact same order, with no variety in between. Dodging has no room but a single frame, which i call the frame timing evading. Each attack has the exact same dodging opening, making combat too easy and repetitive, or too bad and frustrating, depending which attack is we try to dodge at the right time. \n\nDodge is only optimal when targeting an enemy, if not, another dodge will trigger, with a too long of a time recovery. Targeting is only viable if you are against a single enemy, more than one is counterproductive, not being able to see more than the targeted enemy. Dodging without targeting, most of the time is ineffective, traveling an inefficient distance, most of the times, even making combat harder.

Nothing special tho\nIf you like what was in DS1 and DS2, then you should be satisfied what DS3 has to offer\n \nWhen writing and dialogue was pretty average in DS1 with War being as stiff as a wooden board, \nDS2 was a bit better with Death entertaining sassy attitude and more personality than \"I am big, strong, angry RAWR!\" War had\n\nIn DS3 there are huge improvements on overall script and characters.\nWriting is clever, jokes are on point and dialogue is really outstanding.\n\nStory is nothing special (so just like DS1 and DS2) but this time its far more entertaining to follow from start to finish\n\n\n\n2)Gameplay\nSimiliar to DS1 and DS2 but improved and more meaty.\nBig variety of combos for each different weapon and satisfying to pull out dodge and counter system\n\nConsumables are not worthless anymore and standing still to use them is a nice touch to balance them out. Risk/reward system instead of brainless baby \"click to use in middle of combo\"? I freaking love it!\n\nCombat encounters doesn't feel like a snore fest due fighting joke enemies for 90% of the game (yes, I am looking at you DS1 and DS2)\nand upgrade system feels way more enjoyable than in previous game\n\nThis time developers actually designed deep upgrade system for both Horseman and weapons that is way more fleshed out than glitchy mess that was in DS2\n\nYou level up one of your stats (health, damage, arcane) by feeding Vulgrim with souls. Weapons can be upgraded for more damage and awesome enhancement system allow you to buff Fury permanently with active and passive buffs giving you HUGE amount of freedom on choice\n\nAlso I love how collectibles are super useful in the game: find 20 survivors and each 5 will give you a huge perma passive buff and one of them is just straight +30% max HP\nI cannot describe how much I freaking love this game for doing stuff like this!\n\n\n\n3)Platforming\nDS1 had terrible platforming with slow as molasses climbing animations\nDS2 platforming was still horrible but at least Death did climb way faster\nDS3 improved on those even further by completely removing that bollocks from the game\n\nPlatforming now is way faster and more fun than in previous games\nNo more dull, boring, tedious and slow climbing on walls but there is more fun jumping, swinging and using abilities to traverse\n\n\n\n4)Level design\nWay better than anything in DS1 and DS2 by mile\nNo more giant empty maps, idiotic horse riding or flat dungeons with baby brain dead puzzles\n\nAreas are now way more elaborate, complex with shortcuts and multiple different paths filled with secrets, items and optional boss fights that reward you with good stuff\n\nThere is a lot unique locations and each one have own set of enemies\nNo more crappy reskins and reuse of assets like it was with DS1 and DS2\n\n\n\n5)Puzzles\nHands down improvement over so called \"puzzles\" that was in DS1 and DS2.\nNuff said!\n\n\n\n6)Graphics and optimization\nGraphics look great, particle effects and sparks are fancy but dear god this optimization is horrendous\n\nThe game does run in perfect 60 frames per second on max details on my GTX 1070 Ti with SSD but so many times the game just pause for 10 seconds to load rest of the game and no matter your graphical settings - whenever you spin the camera you can see the game loading and unloading\n\nI had random 5 crashes when using fast travel and 1 right at the start of the Void DLC\n\nTo be honest I should expect that from those developers. DS1 and DS2 had also horrendous optimization, lots of bugs and crashes but surprisingly DS3 still crashed way less times than DS1 or DS2 did so hey - there is an improvement here at least\n\nSmall but always something\n\n\n\n7)Sound and music\nNothing special here. Its just as generic as in DS1 and DS2\nThe weirdest thing that often the game doesn't have a music while exploring areas but whenever you pause the game you hear \"hype fantasy song #4\"\n\n\n\n8)Basic enemies and bosses\nDecent variety of normal enemies each with unique moveset\n\nSame with bosses that are FAR more interesting in both design and combat than any garbage that was in DS1 and DS2\n\nEach one of them is not \"attack my weak spot NOW\" type anymore but an actually proper boss fights that you should dodge and attack in right moment\n\nDesign of both normal enemies and main bosses is also improved, each distinctive enough with way less copy pasting like it was in previous games\n\nThere also couple of optional boss and miniboss fights which are basically bigger, stronger versions of normal enemies with new attacks\nThose are alright and welcome addition to the game, especially that killing them gives a really juicy reward\n\nAnd the most important thing - each boss, miniboss and normal enemy feels different to fight\n\nAlso worth of mentioning is that main bosses feel like an actual characters that are part of the lore and there is a proper build up to fight them unlike majority of bosses in DS1 and DS2 that was basically \"hey, its a me a boss of this area - fight me now buuu me so big and scary\"\n\nAnd then those died in less than 3 minutes with brainless button mashing or doing same boring \"puzzle thingy\" 3 times in row to expose their weak spot\n\nSo in short - DS3 actually feels like a proper video game when it comes to enemies and boss fights unlike it was in DS1 and DS2\n\n\n\n9)DLCs \n\"The Crucible\" is a horde mode with a score system rewarding you greatly for doing good and punishing you for doing badly (as it should be)\n\nExchange score to get upgrade materials and new unique equipment.\nReally fun addition to already great game!\n\n\"Keepers of the Void\" gives you a big new labyrinth like location with fun puzzles,  lots of cool secrets, new awesome equipment, enemies and 5 fantastic bosses to fight\n\n\n\n10)Personal nitpicks\n>I really wish you could customize what consumbles you want to display and in what order in your quick item use bar\nThere is a lot of great consumables and there is way too big risk of using wrong one in the heat of battle because of this\nAlso going slowly thru each one of them on the list is annoying especially that you don't scroll them as fast as you can press a button\n\n\n\n>Speaking about consumbles, another stupid thing is D-pad controls\nUp to use, Left/Right to scroll, Down to quick select your \"potion\"\nWhy the f*ck its like that? Why do I need to click Down and then Up to heal myself?\n\nWhy not design it that Up is using a consumble, Left/Right to scroll and Down to USE your \"potion\"? Its just a baffling oversight on developers side\n\nAlso why the heck controls screen in menu doesn't mention what Down on the D-pad does? \nIt took me 15 hours to even notice that Down had actually some in game use.\nI mean the screen with all controls didn't told me that and it took the game 15 hours to show me a loading screen hint telling me what Down on D-pad actually does?\nLike cmon, developers!\nThat information would be so much useful earlier\n\n\n\n>Why the list of unlocked Serpent Holes is not in chronological order?\nWhy oh why?\n\n\n\n>Would be nice if upgrade screen for enhancements was displaying which enhancements are equipped on what weapon. It does that in your equipment menu but not in upgrade menu? \n\n\n\n>Shame that Ulthane does not smacks with his fancy hammer your weapon/enhancement/Rider's Mercy whenever you upgrade them. He just stand there, boasting about his work\nI wish he actually had some \"work\" animations.\n\n\n\n11)Verdict\nOverall this game is a HUGE step into right direction for this franchise and I hope developers will improve even more on this formula in the future\n\nHeck, DS3 is so good that the more I play it the more I despise all boring and garbage things that was in DS1 and DS2\n\nExploration and discovering new secrets is addicting, combat is really enjoyable, boss fights are really fun and unique, unlike it was in DS1 and DS2\n\nI rate Darksiders 3 with 9.5/10.\n\nWell, on my way to New Game +4 on hardest difficulty", "timestamp_created": 1619640737, "timestamp_updated": 1633266718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345597177743911743", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91035365": {"recommendationid": "91035365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021222928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1618516159}, "language": "english", "review": "Really not enjoying the game, here's why :\n\n- There's no map, so you better either write off where you spotted that 1 thing that you could not (yet) reach on a piece or paper, or just forget it ever existed (or explore the entire map everytime you unlock a new form)\n- No matter how much you invest in your hp, it feels like mobs will always 2-3 shot you, just don't spend point in anything else than attack\n- The \"RPG\" element is basically \"Put all points in attack and upgrade the first weapon of the game\", if you do something else, you'll quickly regret\n- When you die and you quit for this gaming session, good luck finding your corpse again, RIP all those souls (exp + currency)\n- Consumables are pointless (except for strength + healing)\n- Game is open world with no map (see first point), you quickly get lost, so all it sums up to is \"Go to the skull, kill the sin, rince and repeat\".\n\nI don't think i'll ever finish this game, i'm disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1619579394, "timestamp_updated": 1619579394, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496610134840011597", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91025295": {"recommendationid": "91025295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045151980", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1620148809}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent SoulsLike game, the difficulty can get quite frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1619559648, "timestamp_updated": 1619559648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91014719": {"recommendationid": "91014719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071357475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 381, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 841, "last_played": 1619543166}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ESPECTACULAR!!!!!!! este juego no necesita presentacion. Se presenta solo. Asi que solo dare una opinion personal. Con este juego ya he terminado toda la serie darksiders. Este a diferencia de los anteriores y la precuela, la historia no es tan brillante, pero es muy interesante de seguir. Es como esos discos de heavy metal de tu banda favorita que no es tan bueno como los que mas te gustan pero aun asi suenan muy bien. Ya que en este juego te enfrentas con los 7 pecados capitales. Me parecio una genialidad ya que cada pecado tiene su respectiva personalidad. Y con un dise\u00f1o muy orioginal y personal de la franquisia. Ademas me ha parecido una muy buena idea que este a diferencia de los otros sea un juego mas lineal y enfocado a la accion. Ya que venia de los demas juegos que eran mas complejos con sus mecanicas y de mundo abierto. El estudio fue muy valiente al simplificar las mecancias para hacerlo mas frenetico. Y les salio genial. En vez de recurrir a la tipica idea del sandbox soso.\n\nTambien me encanto que en este juego la protagonista es furia. La hermana de los jinentes del apocalipsis. A pesar de poseer una personalidad testaruda, tiene muchisimo carisma. Ya que como su nombre lo indica. Es una furia imparable, muy fuerte y tenaz. Ademas de hermosa.\n\nOtra cosa que me encanta es que en esta serie toman todos los elementos de todas las religiones, la mitologia del mundo y de la historia. Ademas de que con una genial idea la serie se pudo vender muy bien desde que salio el 1. Y mantener su calidad. No cualquier juego puede hacerlo incluso en esta generacion.\n\nLo unico que le hecho en falta es que esta entrega a diferencia de las anteriores no esta bien optimizada. Asi que antes de jugarlo asegurate de que tu pc sea de gama mas bien alta para arriba.

Story\n- I am interested and invested to the Darksiders story so imo its a good story.\n- the main antagonists here are the 7 deadly sins. so maybe in your mind you're like: \"oh 7 deadly sins? so fight 7 bosses straight back to back with no puzzles?\" no its not that simple.\n- I liked the distinction and character between the 7 deadly.\n- the protagonist here is one of the 4 horseman of the apocalypse: Fury. I liked her character and they way she developed throughout the game.\n\n\n2. Collectibles\n- the collectibles here are a bit different, its like a rescue mission but there are collectibles that can powerup your arsenal so win win right?\n\n\n3. Environment\n- a major improvement of art style and graphics from Darksiders 1 & 2. \n- most of the game takes place on Earth.\n\n\n4. Gameplay\n- there are 2 types of combat and you are allowed to choose at the beginning of the game whether the default mechanic(which is the new one they are introducing in this game) or the traditional hack and slash(like the previous game) I chose the new combat style and imo its a hit and a miss some combat sequence can get you fall off the ledge and fall, the grappling hook system is not as \"fluid\" as I expect it to be like I would know that I successfully executed the grappling hook when I see it works but theres a big windows of error on that part of a mechanic, happened to me a couple of times but it wasnt annoying just deserves a mention. so dodge counter is the strategy here in order to win every fight. plus the enemies block so thats very annoying.\n- theres no map. yep no map I think the developers wanted to do here is encourage exploration rather than objectives which btw is great imo because the world looks amazing.\n- boss fights are the same thing just like the previous game, some kind of gimmick you need to get used to in order to defeat them.\n- the puzzles here imo are minimal compared to Darksiders 1 & 2. I dont know thats just what I felt like, most of the time you go between corridors and fight enemies and then an occasional puzzle comes along then boss fight. rinse and repeat but more enemy fighting rather than puzzles.\n", "timestamp_created": 1619257795, "timestamp_updated": 1619257795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90827626": {"recommendationid": "90827626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045936075", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2003, "last_played": 1619281067}, "language": "english", "review": "Some of the boss battles are a joke but the game itself is fun.", "timestamp_created": 1619256254, "timestamp_updated": 1619256254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90809162": {"recommendationid": "90809162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079103972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 417, "last_played": 1619224840}, "language": "spanish", "review": "MALISIMO.

I loved the game.\n\nI have not played the first 2 Darksiders games. I directly started with 3, as it was one of the cool games available on GamePass and it was going to expire soon. The game's story is not linked to the first 2 games, as far as I can tell. It might be, but it's set up well in a way that it can stand out without you having to have played the first 2 games.\n\nI do not like the game's control even a little. I don't mean the actual gameplay, because that's fine. I mean when navigating through UI. It is a real pain. Playing on 4k settings here, most of the buttons in menus and other UI just does not work with a mouse click. There is no way to bring up the Resume/Options/Exit Game settings screen using the Gamepad/Controller. It is annoying to have to press the Escape key on the keyboard, or navigate the UI using XBox controller when I'm actually using the keyboard. The settings are just weird.\n\nI have no complaints about the gameplay, I loved it. I loved the detailing in the models and all, the animations. Absolutely loved the armour on the protagonist, she look like one, and is a real badass. The watcher, enemies, NPCs, all are very well done, and the detailing is really worth commending.\n\nIt's really confusing sometimes, to turn on Havoc form, I still can't seem to get the hang of it. Even changing between the storm form, default form is a bit confusing. Way too many controls to remember. It's kinda like Prince of Persia Warrior Within on steroids.\n\nI would also like to add, the adventure part of the game is exceptionally well made. The locked passages (without the specials needed to unlock them) are not overdone, where it feels forced. This game has done it exceptionally well. One of my friend thinks that even Hollow Knight has a decent structure of blocking off paths if you've not completed certain goals, but I feel that it feels a little bit forced there. But we both agree that in Darksiders IIi, it is definitely done better than Hollow Knight. So if you like that sorta thing, you should definitely try it out.\n\nThe game has DLC achievements, absolutely horrible idea.\n\n7.5/10 would recommend, definitely play at least once.

Every area has many nooks and crevices to explore rewarding players with loot, enhancements or upgrades. As you progress through the game you acquire new abilities allowing you to explore more of the world or backtrack to collect any collectables you may have missed.  \n\n+ The story is decent but I like that it never gets in the way. For the vast majority of the game you are always in complete control of Fury. The main character herself can be annoying at times but at least she evolves through out the course of the game.  \n\n+ Upgrade weapons and slot enhancements based on your playstyle. \n\n+ Boss battles were well done and find the right mix between challenging and fun. Each boss requires you to learn new enemy attack patterns so you are always constantly engaged.  \n\nThe Average:\n+/- Combat is functional, dodging enemy attacks and landing a counter attack feels great, you can use sub weapons and wraith attacks. The main issue is that combat was not designed around multi enemy encounters. Once you start fighting more than 2 enemies things start to get frustrating and getting hit by enemies off screen becomes a common occurrence. \n\n+/- Certain areas are poorly optimized. \n\n+/- A game like this could really benefit from a world map\n\nThe Bad:\n- A few crashes \n\nConclusion: \nA know this game got mixed reviews in the beginning but Gunfire games did a good job of fixing/improving some of the problems in the initial release. Even though this game borrows some basic elements from Dark Souls I feel the game is more closely tied to Metroidvania style design. \n", "timestamp_created": 1618788235, "timestamp_updated": 1618788235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628773272037506104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90544736": {"recommendationid": "90544736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343998743", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1618779744}, "language": "english", "review": "the latterly crashing and i cannot continue, this happens a lot and to be honest i'm done with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1618779835, "timestamp_updated": 1618779835, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487895727157592773", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90537463": {"recommendationid": "90537463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013600794", "num_games_owned": 588, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 159, "last_played": 1619378025}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like souls like games, this is one with it's own flavor added in. \n\nCombat in this game is very good. you will use the whip as a main weapon, other weapons, \"hollows\" as the game calls them, can be used in conjunction with her whip attacks creating combos. you can switch weapons on the fly.

I hope the game design team either got sent on a training course or got let go for people who know what they are doing. There are so many nice things about this game and so many lovely little details that the game gets right. But they are all massively overshadowed by the game design teams inability to balance anything or design a game that fits anything.\n\nOh hey you're a big bad a$$ Nephilim who forsook their already powerful abilities for even more powerful abilities you can go toe to toe with demon lords but oh wait, is that 4 wimpy skeletons in a corner? Watch out they might combo you to death cause the combat sucks. Oh you want to put on a defence potion? cool here you go. Oh you want a healing potion? sorry all potions are time locked so you can't use more than one at once (what sadist designed that, have they ever even played a game before??) \n\nOh hey look at this real nice dungeon with a tree growing through the building and oh sorry you're dead, you didn't see that enemy standing literally behind the corner waiting for you who saw you before you saw him because wall hax, what are you a scrub you should get better at the game because there's no other reason for us to have designed such a sh**ty level this way, it's clearly cause you're bad and not cause we're total a-holes for putting enemies that way #DarkSoulsStyle.\n\nAt least the combat mechanics are really expressive and varied. You have multiple weapons with different styles and combos but oh wait sorry, the combos are so long and easily interrupted that you'll never use them so forget about them. If you try one you'll probably die mid fight as some other enemy walks in and stabs you knocking you out of sync and in that window you get shanked and die. Nice combo though got to whip nothing in particular. then you get the enemies who can guard forever, here is wimpy skeleton number 1, he has a rough show well beaten hunk of metal he wields like a sword. When you attack him too often he will start to block FOREVER until you stop attacking. What a sensible mechanic, here I am a max rank nephilim ranked up by the council and further ranked up with magical abilities I got playing the game and I can't break this guys guard because why exactly? again, game designers here can literally f**k right off, prime example of people not knowing how to make a game engaging. Even better is when there are multiple other enemies around you. You'd think that would require fast thinking and adept combat moves but no, the enemies just turn on infinite block or random counter attack mid go and when there's 10 of them it doesn't really matter what you do they'll just gang bang you into a corner  with a rubbish camera angle so you can't see sh*t and get shanked and die. Wonderful play design, really enjoyed those scenes. \n\nAt least when you die you get your respite heals back, but wait you don't get the potions back? What why? fine what about havoc or wrath mode? no they're gone too if you used them, but i had them going into the fight and when i respawn i spawn right next to the boss fight how am I supposed to build these up again? #Shrug I dunno I'm an #ExcellentPlayDesignTeam get gud and you'll be alright. Maybe die several times rebuilding your bars up then give it your all #Strats. \n\nmercilessly talked nothing but smack about this game for about 1 month now with my friends who have played this game, and we all say the same thing. They did wonderfully in some areas, but so shockingly sh*t in others it really makes you wonder how this ever came to pass. This would be the first game ever, EVER that I recommend you watch the cutscenes on youtube and then skip on to the next game, because this game is hot, salt-inducing, crappily patched together trash and I am really disappointed to have to say that after the rocky release of the game and the dev team finding their feet and all that but I don't care. This game has too many issues for me to honestly recommend this to anybody. Except sadists and anyone who wants to be disappointed. Sorry THQ but this game sucked, and I don't know how your design team came up with some of these things they made you build and deploy but they should be hauled over coals. I hear alot of people saying it's supposed to be 'souls like' and it really isn't. whatever you went for is a weird combination of too many things and feels bad overall. \n\nSome good things I will point out, and I will caveat this with my overall feeling of the game is do not recommend but if a dev or designer does ever read this I will comment what bits I find actually worked. Some SPOILERS ahead.\n\nEnemy diversity, way better than last games\nEnemy functions, like invisibility or ground attacks basically diversity of attack patterns\nscenery, really great. level design in that way is actually really nice when there's no enemies near by\nvariety of potions, lovely touch\nplatforming with the swing mechanic, awesome liked it. Bit awkward at times like for some reason doing an air swing then missing the swing entirely that wasnt fun when it happened\nvariety of powers, they're great except the last one. the ability is cool but the fighting is just weak and weird and ineffective and causes more problems with timing dodges than it does deliver extra damage\nPowering up things, this was neat it used non shared resources and not souls so it felt nice to be able to not juggle Vulgrim and made for nicer interactions overall there.\nTelling us what items and weapons do, way better that ds2 thank you that was so stupid putting in random descriptions rather than telling us what they did exactly. like descriptions were NICE but they werent informative so why would i ever bother using them. so good to see that replaced by exact descriptions with flavor text\nvariety of each area, feels super unique every one is different and iconically so. very clearly good design there.\nplatform/puzzle aspects, sometimes were unclear but on the whole were good enough.\n\n\nill stop there becauseive started to think about the negatives as a list and its about 3+ times as long as this positivity list so ill leave it at that and a whole hearted \"watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=303qNRg5DIM&ab_channel=GameIntros%26Finales and then get the next game instead of this one\"\n\n\n##########################################\nJust on random play test there, here's how the mini-boss went against an angel boss.\n\n32 dodge counters to kill it. One hit was an insta-kill so I can't miss a dodge or try go toe to toe with playstyle so I held the joy stick to the right, pressed dodge in time and then counter attack to deal damage. 32 times. With no variance. This is the exact type of combat mechanism that let this game down.\n", "timestamp_created": 1618232865, "timestamp_updated": 1618505551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506655991077423096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90176815": {"recommendationid": "90176815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082821177", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1357, "last_played": 1618213462}, "language": "english", "review": "Man.\nJust play it.", "timestamp_created": 1618215311, "timestamp_updated": 1618215311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43724551796913147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90145705": {"recommendationid": "90145705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206493992", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1036, "last_played": 1618337176}, "language": "english", "review": "its cool if you like the apocalypse and stuff\n", "timestamp_created": 1618163914, "timestamp_updated": 1618163914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90144377": {"recommendationid": "90144377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198934417474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1618249778}, "language": "english", "review": "This game sucks, the combat is terrible, there is no map at all, Fury is having problems with a bunch of regular skeletons.

Fury is a badass with legitimate character development from the start of the game to the end. The story itself is interesting and well-written, not amazingly deep but appropriate for the series and style of game. Graphics are gorgeous and the art style fits the rest of the series. The different hollows are a fun concept and definitely make gameplay a little more engaging. I do wish the game included a map. I personally didn't have too much trouble following the objective markers but being able to at least look at a full map of the game world would be helpful. The combat is really the only other place I have complaints. The biggest issue is the controls can feel a little sluggish at times, especially when using healing items which leads to extra deaths. The camera can also be an enemy in and of itself, but that's common with pretty much any action game. The combat itself is not overly difficult once you get your dodge timing down, but it leaves a bit to be desired. Basically, combat is 80% dodge-countering, 20% mashing X/Y. If you're coming from Nioh/DMC/Bayonetta/etc. that require more advanced strategies and/or memorizing movesets you may be a little disappointed in the simplified combat here. On the other hand, it's also very different from the combat in the previous Darksiders games so if you're expecting to just button mash your way through every enemy like a god among insects you will definitely be disappointed. I don't believe it's a particularly bad combat system, it's just not what fans of the previous games were expecting and I think that's why it gets so much hate. It sort of feels like the devs played Dark Souls and then said \"that's cool, let's do that but make it easier so people don't rage quit (as much)\" and this is the end result. Not bad for creating a hybrid between two very different combat styles, but also not really like either of the original styles at this point so it can be frustrating to get used to but it's pretty satisfying once you do.

Para los pecados capitales, cada uno de ellos tiene su zona asignada y totalmente personalizada, por ejemplo, avaricia, nuestro combate sera en un escenario repleto de torres de oro y cosas de valor.\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/h1]\nEl juego se mueve mediante el motor gr\u00e1fico Unreal Engine, me ha gustado bastante ya que el escenario esta plagado de detalles. Tiene unas f\u00edsicas de movimiento en vegetaci\u00f3n y banderas realistas. Optimizacion rocosa, solo alguna bajada en zonas de carga, pero son muy leves. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2424446690\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2425686004\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2422686270\n[h1]Jugabilidad:[/h1]\nEn este apartado cabe destacar que bebe mucho de sus anteriores entregas, pero hay un peque\u00f1o matiz, se ha implementado un sistema de combate muy parecido a Dark Souls, digo muy parecido, no igual. Por ejemplo al curarnos, tenemos un contador de 10 segundos en el que no podremos tomar nada mas, ni pociones de ira, fuerza, devastaci\u00f3n, fragmentos de nefilim, pociones de salud o pociones de fortificaci\u00f3n, todo esto se traduce en una mayor concentraci\u00f3n en el combate. Para mi los otros han sido mas f\u00e1ciles que esta tercera entrega, y ha decir verdad, me ha gustado mas por que es mas desafiante. Furia con su l\u00e1tigo puede aferrarse a tubos para balancearse y atravesar zonas. Un pero por decir algo, peca en ciertas ocasiones a la hora del combate, sobre todo si fijas al enemigo, ya que a la hora de esquivar si no eliges la direcci\u00f3n correcta de que lado quieres esquivar te vas a llevar un tortazo. \n\n[h1]Sonido:[/h1]\nMe ha parecido correcto en todos los sentidos, el juego viene completamente traducido al castellano en voces, asi que pasando de subtitulos. Una cosa a mejorar en este aspecto en la mezcla de sonidos especiales, estos sonidos hacen referencia a sonidos ambiente y dem\u00e1s, en la mayor\u00eda de ocasiones esta por encima de la voces as\u00ed que recomiendo bajar la barra a la mitad desde el men\u00fa de opciones de sonido.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n:[/h1]\nMe ha gustado realmente esta tercera entrega, si quer\u00e9is un Hack and Slash combinado con un toque souls en combate y un sistema de plataformas bastante decente es vuestro juego. Otro punto positivo es que el juego a medida que vas desbloqueando poderes tienes la posibilidad de volver atr\u00e1s mediante vulgryn y sus agujeros de serpiente y desbloquear zonas secretas. Otro gui\u00f1o a Dark Souls es su sistema de escenario comunicado, hay ciertos atajos que vuelven a la zona inicial. El juego tiene un \u00e1rbol de mejoras, tanto para armas como para furia, desde salud, pasando por fuerza y a la hora de hacer una esquiva perfecta el contraataque sea mas poderoso. Otras mejoras son ciertos amuletos que se pueden implementar en las armas que llevamos, se puede mejorar para a\u00f1adir mas poder al ataque, tener un % de salud....\n\n[h1]NOTA: 7,5[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1616423342, "timestamp_updated": 1616423482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687980949878692627", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88676713": {"recommendationid": "88676713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092438396", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 177, "last_played": 1673216010}, "language": "english", "review": "Too much time lost when I died.

Playing it on higher difficulty really gets you in the zone and you have to get your dodges down right. \n\nTo the people struggling with this: this game isnt a mindless button masher, you have to think about spacing and timing in combat. Which enemies you can stagger and when to dodge to make use of the invulnerability of the counter attack. I highly recommend playing on mouse and keyboard, having dodge on right click and attack on left click is super crisp. I also recommend this because the lockon camera is awful and I honestly wouldnt touch it for the whole game. \n\nThe DLC gives you something more to chew on for post game enjoyment. You can farm upgrade mats in the crucible and round out your gear.\n\nThere are some stutter and crashing issues. I feel I am having more crashing on my second playthrough than when I played it however long ago that was. It sucks and the crashing can really pull down the experience when you lose progress.

There are also a broad variety of enemy types unique to these different areas as well as a number of challenging bosses.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure from the original games however.

Gone are the open worlds, complex dungeons and puzzles of the first two, which are replaced by a more linear world with shortcuts that enable backtracking. Side quests are also gone and a world map is also absent. The shady demonic merchant Vulgrim returns however as a fast travel/bonfire mechanic and means of cashing in souls to level Fury up.

Skills are good as well with variety depending on the weapon though i missed the skill tree from previous games. Story as well is good and is a good continuation of the previous.

I haven't finished the game yet but so far it's fun and interesting. I like that there is no map. It's up to you to remember where you've been and what pathways you couldn't access before progressing more into the story. It reminds me of the game, Metroid: Prime. You will come across areas where you need certain powers to access. Those powers can only be obtained by progressing more into the story. Those secret areas often obtain items that are helpful for leveling up or boss fights. As for the fighting and character movements, I find the moves to be fluid and okay to use. Not much to complain about. Now for the difficulty, if you just want to enjoy this game, play it on normal mode or less. I played this game on Nightmare mode and I die very frequently. I tend to try and counter attacks than dodge them. So, that's why I die more often. Also, when I get surrounded by enemies attacking from multiple directions, it's almost impossible to avoid getting hit. You might be a better gamer than me at this difficulty. It takes a lot of souls to level up your character in this game. Be prepared to do some soul grinding. I love the powers the character has. My favorite is the dark power. I can break most of the enemies defense with the mallet. I like using the whirlwind attack too when enemies surround me. I don't know what it's called when she goes into her rage status but I find it very useful. It sucks that it takes a long time to build up before using it. It reminds me of the game, Onimusha. If you ever played it, Samanosuke can transform into his Oni form after getting enough purple souls. As for bugs, I had the game crash on me twice. I don't know why.

The problem with that is it doesn't always take into account that you may not have opened up the shortcuts to take the shortest route, On a few occasions I found myself literally going in circles chasing a skull on the compass. \n-As with other Darksiders games the lock-on system will sometimes cause you to lose sight of Fury during boss fights and cause you to swallow a whole heap of damage because you couldn't time a dodge properly.\n\nThose are the ones that immediately come to mind, but overall I love the story of the fight between heaven and hell/the charred council, and the callbacks to the other games in the series. \nUnfortunately there isn't the ability to pick up loot and weapons as in DS2. I really loved outfitting Death with armor and weapons. Instead you have only about 4 armor sets available to you and 4 weapons if you stop at one playthrough.

I personally recommend classic over default, mostly due to the fact that I prefer the combat style of the previous games and the default style is close but juuuust slow enough that it can feel a little clunky since the difference is like .25 seconds of extra time before you can evade/heal. Also I would not suggest playing this on anything above challenging, At the bottom I mention a list of annoyances that together make anything harder than challenging not sound like a fun experience. Plus this game is way harder than every other DS game so even normal is fine if you want an experience closer to the previous games.\n\nDarksiders as a series loves changed, and this iteration boasts some of the most drastic changes of the series. Gone is the more open and zelda-esque (for the most part) structure as this game embraces a much more narrow dark souls approach. In darksiders 3 you're largely going along a straight forward path to your destination with the ability to diverge and explore every not and then but overall is a VERY funneled experience. \n\nLevels don't feature that many puzzles and the puzzles that are there aren't super complex. It's only until the final area where puzzles become much more unique, interesting, and common as you have all the puzzle items and they want to really put them to the test. It's actually some of the most unique puzzling in the darksiders series, which is unfortunate given how little of a presence it has. But this might be due to the fact that this game allows you to do a few of the bosses out of order.\n\nBut, their shift of focus from sprawling open maps and large scale puzzle dungeons let them craft some very interesting levels. While it's largely a straight line, every part of the level is laid out well enough that you are constantly opening up shortcuts for yourself in a fairly believable manner. In some cases the difference between a level on your first time walking in and when you're finished can be so drastic you pretty much ignore 70% of the level you just played because its all so interconnected and/or you got a power to help bridge a gap that you previously were walking around. Not only that but the levels in general just flow from one to the other really well. This game is essentially just a giant circle where it steers you in the right way forward constantly outside of little side places for items and collectibles.\n\nAs I mentioned, this game lets you do some sequence breaking. To my understanding you only really need to kill the first major boss then you can just leave the area and explore the other half of the world. The 2nd power is only to access bonuses along the way. If you complete those sections of the world and get the \"third\" and \"forth\" power, you can basically skip straight to 2 bosses that you skipped because the game connects with itself in a really cool way to allow that. But of course you don't get much out of it besides shortening the game for yourself. it's just cool to see a game with a narrow focus like that be so interwoven like that.\n\nLast good  thing i'll talk about is the story. It's surpsingly good for a darksiders story. Generally darksiders stories have cool setpieces, ideas, or implications for this grand plot they are trying to tell. 3 on the other hand has a much more personal story to the character and one that actually shows the protagonist noticeably change in satisfying ways as you go through even if a few elements here and there don't entirely hit home. Now it's not anything amazing or deep, in fact it's symbolism is pretty in your face. But it's a much more interesting and engaging story nonetheless and cemented Fury as my 2nd favorite horseman. Strife in genesis is too good to ignore.\n\nWith all that out of the way it did have some annoyances. Nothing that personally stopped my enjoyment that much but stuff that still bothered me a little bit. Occasional clunky controls like the whip swinging detection, some puzzles are actively not fun as they can involve instant death or clunky timing, some areas which should trigger a \"fell off the ledge teleport back up\" is actually fatal, in one area it will put your lost souls in an unreachable position, some bosses had less than fun mechanics and some of them attack immediately out of a cutscene, the final boss has an attack which creates an entity that can steal your lock-on focus when it should be untargetable, same boss by sheer bad luck can stun lock you, and for no reason at all you are locked out of any optional bosses if you fight the 2nd to last boss despite letting you freely explore the world again before the final boss. It tells you of this before you go, but there's just no good story reason this happens and I didn't realize I was missing an optional boss until after I beat the game. Also pray you have an SSD when you do the final boss because you're required to sit through a loading screen just to enter the fight every. single. time.\n\nProbably the biggest issue of all is occasional unfair nonsense, most notably these insect eggs/cocoons in one are which litter the entire level, but only some of them will break open to attack you instantly. You pretty much have to learn which ones break and then get used to the range where they shatter to attack you. It sucks and even on challenging it's more damage that I want to constantly take.\n\nOverall, very fun game from the standpoint of someone who really likes darksiders. It scratches a lot of my darksiders itches while advancing the story to its hopeful conclusion while also offering another different experience like what 1 was to 2 and what genesis was to the rest of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1613438242, "timestamp_updated": 1613438858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86711264": {"recommendationid": "86711264", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996615599", "num_games_owned": 965, "num_reviews": 206, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1613832744}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad que lo estoy disfrutando mucho m\u00e1s que el Darsiders 1 y 2.

Very similar to Dark Souls yes, but it isn't a deal breaker for me since it is one of my favorite franchises. The exploration is good, the level up mechanics are simple and fine, and the bosses are more memorable than the other games, for the most part.\nThough, it still has issues with the combat itself, because enemies sometimes make little to no alert that they are going to attack, and since you cannot stop mid combo (with the Default gameplay style) you get hit even if you can react to the attack.

Now that I've had time to breathe I decided to play it through again and, thankfully, I was able to finally beat it! Now, Darksiders 2 still remains uncompleted for me also due to a bug.\nAnyway; this instalment is heavily inspired by the Souls series of games while also keeping the essence of a Darksiders game. You can choose between the Souls-like combat or go for the \"classic\" style which I've heard makes the game a cakewalk; I would always recommend playing a game the way that developers intended but if you're not looking to let the combat challenge you then there won't be much else left in this game for you. There's plenty to explore, though rewards are typically nothing special. Combat is quite addictive and challenging, and while it doesn't quite have the diversity of a Souls game, it gets the job done well enough. The story does well to keep the player invested while also providing some terrific voice acting and well coreographed cinematics. Overall the experience wasn't anything spectacular but a single playthrough on Medium/Challenging difficulty will provide you about 10-20 hours of fun depending on how much you like to explore. I would recommend the Keepers of the Void DLC for some more puzzle-based gameplay, though I won't blame you for turning down the difficulty for its bosses as they are more health-sponges than challenging (except the final boss of the DLC which does deserve a well-done).\nIf you're a Darksiders fan, I'd suggest getting it if you're interested, at least to support the developers.

Played this because I enjoy souls style games and metroidvania style games.  This game was a very good time and an easy one to recommend.  \n\nAs an aside this would be a great place to start with your first ever souls game.  This and Jedi Fallen Order are great jumping on points since they are much more flexible in terms of difficulty than those games.\n\nI think it executes quite well on all the gameplay goals.  It wasn't overly punishing as a souls game which I welcome.  It also wasn't overly confusing in how it employed its metroidvania elements so I didn't spend hours trying to figure out where to go next.  \n\nThe reasons for an 8 and not something better were that the story failed to grip me in any way.  It was also pretty confusing.  Admittedly this could have everything to do with the fact that I haven't played Darksiders 1 and 2.   While the combat was definitely FUN it lacked the added tactics and satisfaction you get from other souls games.  My solution to 98% of the problems in this game was to mash attack until I saw an attack animation play out, dodge and repeat.   There's definitely a lot more to it than that in other souls games as I didn't really feel like I had to learn patters or gain any sort of mastery of the system here.  I played on balanced difficulty for anyone whose curious.  Other issues were that environments or areas overstayed their welcome from time to time and the game started to drag for me.   There's were minor pacing issues all told but they exist. \n\nAs a more personal nit pick...I'm sick of feeling forced to smash all objects in the world because devs hide so many trinkets in them.

Some elements may be a bit predictable and it's by no means a perfect game, but it's still one of the better ones out there IMO. There are difficulty settings for everyone's liking too.\n\nPros:\n- Great storyline and game concept\n- Much more character development than you'd see in some other modern games. Protagonist is badass.\n- Lots of areas to explore. Personally I really enjoyed the fiery pits (The Hollows), felt a bit like a part of Hell).\n- New types of enemies and frequent boss fights throughout the game ensure that it doesn't become boring\n- Provides a tough gameplay experience for those who want a challenge, but there is an easy mode for those who don't.\n\nCons:\n- The save system is pretty brutal. When you die, you'll be teleported back to the last Vulgrim location you visited (NPC vendor). The Lurchers (currency) that you've collected will be dropped where you die, or close to that location and you'll have to get them back. Any unlocked puzzles, opened doors etc. will not reset though so that's something at least.\n- Even in the medium difficulty modes, the game is quite challenging because you can die quite easily and don't deal that much damage. Not as hard as Dark Souls games but still challenging. Mastering the dodge-counter maneuvers really helps, especially once you put some points into Arcane damage.\n- Initially I disliked the lack of a map. It would be complicated because the environment is quite 3D so buildings and dungeons on multiple levels would be a pain to map out and navigate, but anything would be better than nothing. However, once you get to know the map a bit and you learn to use the compass, it's not that much of an issue. A horse would have been welcome though for faster riding through some areas.\n- The upgrading system for your weapons is a bit of a pain. You need to collect specific items, but you won't find enough to upgrade everything to the highest level unless you grind them out in pointless killing of respawning trash mobs.\n- I wish that there was more motivation to use the different kinds of weapons. I finished most fights with just the main whip and the Fire Hollow active, but almost never used any of the others. If they were not needed to navigate and solve puzzles, I wouldn't have touched them at all.\n\nAll in all, still a great game - don't let people tell you it's a terrible game because if you give it an honest chance, I think you may like it. As I said, it's not perfect, and I have a few frustrated moments too, but it's still absolutely worth it IMO.", "timestamp_created": 1611970358, "timestamp_updated": 1611970358, "voted_up": true,

If you were expecting some kind of violent breakthrough, revolution, fashion trends or an emphasis on a complex plot, then you simply made the wrong game. Don't say that she has a self-determination crisis. Everything is in order with her orientation in the game space: this is still the same Darksiders, which has always been a collection of different ideas served under the sauce of corporate identity.

But Darksiders 3 brought back my memories of that apocalyptic world. I want to thank the developers for recreating the same mood. It feels good to be back and to see the recognizable art style.\n\nStory-wise it's a proper addition to the existing universe. Fury has her own mission, but we will meet some familiar characters in the meantime. It was fun to replay it the second time, with the full knowledge of what is about to happen. The story and its twists, the characters and enemies, the voice acting and the soundtrack - everything is done on a very good level.  Fury herself is awesome on her own: her character is evolving throughout the game, but she is awesome in the beginning, and she is still awesome in the end, but in a completely different way.\n\nGameplay-wise this game is now closer to a souls-like. I think this change is justified by the fact that Fury is the weakest among Horsemen, so it's natural that her fighting style heavily relies on dodges and that she can be defeated in just a few hits. I played my first time on Apocalyptic difficulty, and I died quite a lot, especially on bosses. However, after leveling up enough and upgrading my weapons I became a bit overpowered, so the last 2 or 3 bosses were defeated on first or second try.\n\nEven though I liked the game in general, some moments were not that good. Blocking enemies are annoying. Your whip is long, yet it usually hits only one or sometimes two enemies in a crowd, and you don't have any means of crowd-control. There are a lot of unavailable places, reachable only after obtaining one of 4 powers, therefore it leads to backtracking for the sake of exploration. Consumables are mostly meaningless, because after using one you are blocked from using another for half a minute. \n\nI may be nitpicking for some more time, but even despite the flaws it's still a good game, which is mostly fun to play and which has a remarkable story.

So this review is \"Recommended but with caution\". \n\nThe good:\n+Good story and character development- provided you play the whole way though. \n+The devs adding \"classic\" mode to make the combat more like Darksiders I and II is a HUGE and welcome addition. They also added \"checkpoints\" which save any puzzle progress youve made so if you die you wont have to repeat them again. \n+Extra weapons and upgrades are all back again, and the menu interface is mostly the same (even the font) so it's easy to navigate these. \n+No crashes, glitches or bugs. \n\nThe bad:\n-No map. Some reasons a dev actually said about this is, \u201cWe didn\u2019t think players like them,\u201d and \u201cWe want players to get lost.\u201d For a game as big as this is with its connected world, you either better remember where that certain special pile of rubble you couldnt get to before, write it down or forget about it all together. All you get is a compass with a skull showing which direction to go for the closest Seventh Sin (boss). Thats it. Not even a minimap either. Whats kinda baffling is that there IS fast travel at any Vulgrim location, but you cant actually see it on a world map. Dumb.\n-In order to sprint you always have to push a button to do so. Wouldve been great if I could just hold the analog stick all the way and run like other games do instead of having to push down the left stick every. single. time.\n-Many of the puzzles are really out there and some of the solutions are just dumb. The creativity of D1 and D2 puzzles are nowhere to be found here. \n-Difficulty. This game is hard, even on \"Balanced\" (Normal) difficulty its quite brutal. I know people have compared the combat difficulty to the likes of Dark Souls and Ive only ever dabbled in Demon's Souls on PS3 so I get the idea...But I think the biggest problem with this is that low level grunts can literally kill you in 3-4 hits. And when you die? You respawn at the nearest Vulgrim spot that you discovered. So you can be in a boss fight, die, then youll get sent back alllll the way to a Vulgrim spot in which youll have to make your way back to the boss. And this just isnt for bosses either. If you die anywhere on the map youll still get sent to the nearest Vulgrim spot and you will most likely have to spend some time making your way back to the place you died- with all enemies respawned too. And those checkpoints i mentioned earlier? Yeah, they only save puzzle progress. \n-FOV is way too close. Thankfully there is a mod in the steam forums that fixes this, but not having an FOV slider built in by default to a third person action game is just stupid. \n-The locations all have this samenyness to them. Lots of cave areas and metal crates everywhere it seems like. \n-Some people didnt have this problem, but for me a lot of the time the FPS would drop to the 40-50fps range constantly. Theres hardly any loading in game so its most likely an issue with streaming assets in but it doesnt do it very efficiently.  \n\nSo if youd made it this far in my review you may be asking yourself if its really worth buying this game because they changed so much. Well,  if youre wanting more of a D1/D2 \"feel\", the best advice I can give you is switch the difficulty to \"Story\" (easy) and the combat to Classic, which is exactly what I did.

So much so, that I was going to write a review before I finished it.  Comparisons with Dark Souls abound, and I was going to write that while it wears Dark Souls influences on its sleeve, certainly Darksiders 3 offers nowhere near the same difficulty.  In fact, you will not find a Smough and Ornstein equivalent battle (the yardstick against which I measure video game difficulty).  And then I was surprised with a boss fight that was exactly Smough and Ornstein (although, it turns out, not nearly as difficult).  So I held my tongue to the end.\n\nFor me, Darksiders 3 was incredibly entertaining, and I enjoyed myself throughout.  Some of the boss fights were challenging -- the Keepers of the Void DLC boss fight was the hardest, and it probably took me 20 tries to finish.  I loved the exploration and how the environments fit together.  Combat was a blast.  Story was acceptable.  Fury sounds like she is voiced by a death-metal singer, but is actually voiced by the same actress who played Delilah in Firewatch.  Talk about range!  Fury's cut scenes were a little over the top.  But I enjoyed the boss's taunts and insults as you fight them -- that was a nice touch.\n\nI think if you enjoy Dark Souls like games, but would prefer a more casual challenge, Darksiders 3 has your ticket.  And if you don't want the Dark Souls influence, there's a classic mode setting for easier combat (which I didn't try).  \n\nI got this in a bundle, so price to entertainment value was amazing.

There are so many things wrong that I have to make a list :/ :\n- Lack of minimap, half the time I spent in this game was just me looking up google \"where to go\". Seriously it is so frustrating there are so many side-ways, hide-outs, bits of paths here and there and NO WAY to tell which is the main one. \n- Annoying puzzles. They are not clever because seconds in you know what to do. It's what you have to do sometimes requires timing so precise, that one mistake and you have to start a sequence all over again. And completing these didn't grant me any satisfaction, honestly I felt like smashing my keyboard. \n- Bland enemies and mechanics. Nothing you wouldn't have already seen somwhere else. Oh look, water levels with lot's of diving! Oh, a swingshot, groundbreaking. With story so poor you would expect a combat based game to have something to compensate for but no, not there. Enemies sometimes bug themsleves and are stuck on infinite block mode, with nothing you could do to break it. Outside of that I have to give that a few bosses were quite cool. \n- Poor story. It is a combat based game so it's obvious there won't be much story here. but even so this story is not as good as it was in Darksiders 1&2. You play Sindel form Mortal Kombat X, following the \"hero bad, things happen, hero solve things, hero good now\" type of plot and the game is trying desperately to prove that nothing is purely good or bad, but these efforts are so shallow it's just \"eh\" at times.\n- Propably the biggest f***k you to the Player is making the title with UNFINISHED story that does not explain anything then leaving with annoucement that \"no continuation at the moment\" wow. \n- Music is boring and generic,  I seriosuly can't reckon even a single piece that I would remeber, which is is pretty sad. \n\nTL;DL - This game tried things, exceded at nothing.

Some people hate the changes, but after getting used to the gameplay, I liked it better than the older style. All you need to change is swap to the Classic combat and you are good to go. \n\nIt is called the Dark Souls of Darksiders for several reasons:\n\n- there is no map, so you have to find your own way, but since the locations are fairly small and loop back and connect with one another in multiple paths and shortcuts, the world feels really accessible (not sure why some complain that they don't know where to go, especially when the boss location indicator changes direction at every turn showing you the direct path)\n\n- weapon upgrades use the same system you can find in DS, with lower levels needing smaller upgrade stones and going to bigger and rarer as you get to higher levels with the option to buy the basic supplies later in the game\n\n- combat has to stamina, but you'll need to dodge a lot, which is easy to get used to and you'll be able to execute the perfect timing dodge with counter attacks in no time (especially with Classic combat mode, were you can cancel you actions to dodge)\n\n- your primary healing item is similar to the Estus flask, it just refills while killing enemies instead of while resting, plus you'll find upgrades for more uses (you start with only 2, but I ended the game with 6) and more healing per use, just like in DS\n\nThe art style is great, character design pretty good as well (excluding the human models, as they just don't seem to fit the setting), but for some reason the game is still not optimized, so it runs poorly even with decent specs (turning down shadows and foliage quality along with AA are the best ways to improve performance, plus setting it to Fullscreen seemed to eliminate most of the stuttering).\n\nThe game is locked at 62fps with some cutcenses locked at 30 (seems random, and in one scene a camera angle might be at 30fps, then the other change back to \"unlocked\" then go back to 30 again in half a minute). But you can unlock the gamplay fps in the config files, so it's not a major issue.\n\nThe story the basic but enjoyable and fits Fury's character. Voice acting is great along with sound design in general.\n\nPlayed on Normal difficulty, had some minor trouble at first (was more of a training period to get used to the combat, rather than the game being too hard) and ended up OP af by the end of the game, so if you are good at DS and don't want a walk in the park, you should start the game at one of the higher difficulties.\n\nMost of the weapons seem to be useless in combat - ended up using the default Barbs of Scorn with the occasional swing of Chains of Scorn as I was running around with the Flame Hollow from the moment I got it.\n\nFinished the first two games twice (the original releases and then the remasters) and have to say that I enjoyed this one the most (but what do I know, I also prefer Mankind Divided to Human Revolution).\n\nOverall I'd rate it at least 8/10.\n\nPlayed at 1440p on 3900X with 1070Ti and 32GB memory and struggles to maintain stable 75fps.", "timestamp_created": 1610477588,

utter fucking garbage for gameplay i want to play darksiders not fucking dark souls at least dark souls has a fucking block button like jesus fucking h christ with this dodge\n  \nyou cant tell if they will hit you with an over head or swing or a slash why does this matter a new player might ask cuss if they slash at you youll need to not move and press dodge and if they are over head swinging you need to move doge but again you cant tell what they will hit you with so you have 50 50 chance to doge and like i said its fucking dark souls so 2 hits and your dead\n\n and its sad when a basic skelly can kill me in 2 hits becuase he gets a combo breaking attack (CANT CANCEL COMBOS WITH DODGE BTW but you can cancel attacks with dodge just not combo animations) BUT A FUCKING 7 DEADLY SIN will hit you like 3 or 4 times and everything is fucking dandy\n\n there are so many diffrent kinds of enemys in this game all with diff animations so learning patters is fucking impossible lots of fights i swear have random patters cuss right when i learn in boom hits me with a 3 swing or a knock back \ncombos dont even activate right half the time i even have combos activate mid air when im swinging or jumping and boom fall to my death ohhhh and unlike darksiders 2 when you fall you do get placed back on the platforms but you lose half your fucking health like whhhhy \n\nwell thats combat brutally destroyed what about leveling and exp managment .....well souls just like dark souls leave on death they can be picked up again close to were you died not sure what happens if you fall to your dead or even if you can or if will just leave you at perma 1 h.p cuss you know falling takes half your total h.p now cuss that was smart in a platform styled maps... \n\nnow souls also act as currency to the well known valgrim but every time you buy anything levels, health shards anything the price will increase there are even guides that tell people not to spend any soul crystals early game becuase if you do the levels will cost so much ypou will spend about twice the time farming souls then if you were to use all t he crystals you have saved becuase they have alot of souls in them and mosters exp given to players vs what they need to level is just not even close to time friendly \n\nno comment on story at this time becuase im going to youtube the rest of the story becuase this game just wants you to hate it with how its played but from what i have read and what i have expericed rn its deff forgetable as well as repetitive with out touching really on the other darksiders games other then small bits at the start with war as well as learning again for the  3rd  time that the hourse men have been fucking framed like holy shit we get it ..... \n\nSO I AM PAST GLUTTONY AND JUST FINISHED THE TORNADO PUZZLE SECTION and let me fucking tell you how close i was to uninstalling this game at part 3 of the puzzle 1st off i never finished the puzzle cuss the game gliched out and the  door was open only after 50 plus trys pretty sure it was bugged any way cuss i would freeze the block and right as i would get past frozen block the nado would suck me up and i watched 3 different youtube vids on it and even tried going frame buy frame with the vid and it would allways suck me up at the half way point \n\nand in general this puzzle makes no sense cuss like the dust kicks up tell you whe nthe nados gana suck you up but when you get to the other side you can see the cube lift up and the dust kick ups  and you can just jump right in and nothing will happen intill the cube starts moving towards you witch makes no sense whe nthe cube prob is 1000 time heavyer then me \n\n(this is also not the first time puzzles with the blocks have bugged out cuss the one were you need to freeze the belt to jump in the middle of the blocks to get on the ledge the blocks would only drop one at a time and only when i freezed the belt i.e i freeze the belt and one block would drop and becuase  spacing is a thing when wall jumping having to freeze and unfreeze the belt to get it the correct distance from each other was supper fucking retarded so you can prob see my malice  when faced with the nado parts right after this 2 hours of trying to work with a bugged puzzle allready )\n\nNOW FOR MY COMMENT ON STORY BECUASE I AM ACTUALLY PLAYING THIS GAME AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT ITS JUST MEEAAAAA LIKE THE WATCHER HAS WAAAAAY BETTER LINES AND CHARACTER THEN FURRY ........LIKE SHE ASKS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COUNCIL OR OTHER HIGHER POWERS THAT IM LIKE HUH YOU KNOW THATS A GOOD POINT OR THATS A GREAT QUESTION ...AND THEN FURY IS LIKE .....I liKe HuMaNS NoW ....or LoOk im FuRrY aNd I dOnT tAlK lIkE a SpOIled RicH bItCh anymore yea cuss we havent seen that character arc like 1000 times its so sad becuase its such a feminine driven arc for the sake of a women horse men when thier genders and self mortalitys should have 0 affect on thier character becuase they are the 4 fucking horse men of the apocalypse and im like what 15 hours into the game excluding the time had to fuck with this bugged out mess and what story is thier really so far you were sent to kill the sins and then lord of hallows shows up idk if i missed somthing about him in the prev games but i have 0 clue who this guys is and even the watcher doest really tell you much when you first meet him ..... so ligit the hole game has been me talking to the watcher and my you know how i feel about that dialogue \n\ni really hope this game is almost over and the ending is acually worth this much effort and like i said before this game just wants you to hate it\n\nSO END GAME TALK  SPOILERS AHEAD \n\nall most could acually beat the game cuss i would click yes on the end game alert and then my character would load in and i would be on the same side of the portal and i would have to hit the end game alert agian did that 5 times before it would let me \n\n\n\n\n\nLIKE WOW WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED THE WATCHER WAS ACUALLY THE BAD GUY LIKE EVEN BEFORE IT WAS HINTED THAT THE COUNCIL LIED ITS RED FLAGS FOR ANY GAMER WHEN I RANDOM NPC JOINS YOUR PARTY THAT HAS 0 CONNECTION THE THE P.C ...was cool that it was envy that was a cool twist but like they dont explain how the council dint know the hole time \n\nhow does taking furrys powers allow her to use every other hourse mens wepons other then furys cuss if im not mistaken she had everything other then furrys weapon ????? but agian how does stealing furys powers allower her to use like deaths and strifs weapons like i can understand war cuss what if she stole it off screen kinda thing but yea idk am i missing somthing about that orrrr \n\nok cool everyone wants the  humans dead but like whyyyyyy though the only reasom i could take was that the council blamed them for all the corruption as furry says but that doesnt explain why heaven wants them dead when the angles are clearly helping humans like i dont even need to question hells motives but like such a big plot hole imo also makes deaths sacrifice to save humanity pretty point less and i thought the end of dark siders 2 allready sucked considering you spend the hole game trying to free war and prove his innocence just for this end game choice that has nothing to do with the main plot but this unexplained revolation just makes it 100000 times worse \n\nsoooo d4 better have like a really long explanation at the start of the game to why strife only shows up ligit in the last 5 secs of the game cuss like we all ready knew the next game thats who we were playing as so that reveal is just another why moment in the plot other then to hint at who the next playble charater was \n\nalso the lords of hallows never talked to me after def wrath when i killed that demon dude still got the secret ending though was gay that envy had that aoe lord of hallows form in the boss fight though  \n\nin shorter conclusion your game fucking sucks the mechanics dont even work half the time and the story falls flat on it self to many times to count", "timestamp_created": 1610430712, "timestamp_updated": 1612505683, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

That would describe my experience with Darksiders III. I played through it once, shrug it of right afterwards and hit the uninstall button. \n\nThe good: \nWell, the form-change of Fury according to the elements is quite refreshing, though the only thing that really got me is that you can walk on water while freezing it when in ice-form. Other than that, it is pretty standard. \n\nBest I would think is the design of the 7 sins, they were nice to look at and fight. \n\nAnd, that's about it. \n\nThe rest: \n* Level design is boring. So boring I could not motivate myself to go through it near the end and discover new secret areas. It is just so bland and have-been-done 100 times before. Also, it does not help that the world looks ugly as hell (well, hell in this franchise would certainly look better). \n\n* Weapon choice and combat movements are there, but they never seemed to have any big impact for me. Just choose what you think looks cool, and then it is button-mashing all over (at least on balanced difficulty, I cannot speak for the others). If you want to do a souls-clone, do it right. Then implement a combat system where blocking and evasion really matters. Here it seems only necessary for (mini-)bosses, the rest of the enemies is a straight go and get them. \n\n* DLC: I rarely ever comment on this, but it is so boring and badly done (just rock-skins over and over, and the 4 bosses are not even reskins, they are only reCOLORED).

It was very clearly made on a tight budget while still trying to honor the original Darksiders games and bring them up into the modern spotlight. Hack and slash glory is still to be found, albeit recontextualized within a From-Software framework. You have limited healing items, currency/experience that you drop when you die, scattered checkpoints that you use both for fast travel and leveling up, etc. More often than not, this merging of gameplay styles results in an enjoyable experience, but Darksiders III never really reaches the full potential of either genre. \n\nCombat is free in flow, with Fury definitely being the most nimble of the Horsemen we've had so far, but launching enemies into air and tackling them with differing styles and weapons never feels right. You're unable to swap weapons mid-combo, instead waiting on a full second delay in order to switch, by which time the enemy has already recovered and is making ready to strike. If the developers had allowed you to swap styles mid-combo, it would have improved the feeling of Darksiders III ten times over, and resulted in an experience that's pretty damn good for the action game genre; unfortunately, they elected to keep things difficult and \"grounded\" in an effort to appeal to that FromSoft inspiration. \n\nThat decision reaps little fruit, however, as little of FromSoft's magic can be found in this game. The devs give it their honest effort, and I'm always willing to applaud that, but of the game's twelve or so boss fights, I can only think of two that I would call great. Only one is \"bad,\" but the rest are so blase they might as well be forgotten, and I only beat the game yesterday. They rely on the same combo time and again, so once you learn how to dodge in tandem with it, you've pretty much got the fight won already. There are the rare attempts to introduce second phases, yet more often than not, the mechanics those new phases introduce are so incredibly forgiving that the impact they have on the overall encounter is next to null. \n\nYou might wonder at this point why I'm recommending Darksiders III. I always believe it's important to highlight a product's failings up front, so you can know whether or not the game appeals to you. Combat in Darksiders III is fun, and often satisfying, but it fails to live up to the quality of either its predecessors or its inspiration. However, this review isn't \"Is Darksiders III a good Darksiders game\" or \"Is Darksiders III a good Souls game?\" Looking strictly at what III has to offer, I honestly enjoyed almost all of it, and don't regret spending a dime.\n\nThe game's story was surprisingly pretty good; it's nothing truly exceptional, but Fury is my favorite of the Horsemen by a significant stretch. Her initially unlikable ice-queen attitude peels away gradually, revealing a character defined as much by her faults as by her strengths. She grew on me before I really realized it, and by the game's end, I was honestly hoping to see her again in Darksiders IV, just to see where she ends up. \n\nThe actual world design is something I'd also like to take a moment to praise. While never coming near Lordran in complexity, it does a wonderful job of weaving interconnected levels right next to each other, with those connections opening up in surprising locations once you have the proper tools. It's deeply satisfying to see a door you think you'll have to come back to hours later to open, only to be knocking on the other side and pushing it to reveal a familiar locale. \n\nI bought Darksiders III during the Winter Sale at $15. At that price, I think it's a steal, but $60 presumes polish this game simply does not have.

This game just kind of dropped the ball in a few places, though.\n\n[b]The World[/b]\nYou play this game mostly on Earth, after the Apocalypse, but before the events of DS1. My main problem with this is the size of this world. In 2009, this was totally acceptable. But for 2018, I expected something much, much larger (Open World in fact). The map size is comparable to that of DS1 and it feels even smaller because [spoiler]because you don't get to ride your horse.[/spoiler]. Maybe that's why they got rid of the minimap in this game, to not draw as much attention to the size.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nNot bad. The new dodge system is a lot of fun (if you can do it right!) and the enemies are new ones mostly that weren't present in previous games. There are no executions though, which I miss. As far as weapons, you have your whip (very long reach by previous games' standards) and secondary weapons based on the hallow you are using (for closer combat). There is also the cross-blade that we saw in DS1.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe graphics are not very impressive to be honest. They don't look all that much improved from DS2 in 2012. This is especially evident in the human character models. They kind of look like Fortnite characters. Some of the other characters from DS1 look much the same as they did 10 years ago. This game came out 6 years after DS2, but you couldn't tell from the graphics or world size.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\nOverall I enjoyed the story and playing through, enough to play it a little more in Apocalypse+ mode. There was a lot of potential that I think was left on the table, whether because people didn't have time or vision. Too bad.

This game is most likely a perfect example of a publisher dictating creative design - something they have should no say in, ever, in any part of the games industry.

It was great to explore and had the classic Dark Souls-like level/world shortcuts you can unlock to make exploring rewarding. Everywhere else, especially the fights, it has no right to be in a Darksiders game. Compared to previous DS games this one devolved into smaller 1-on-1 fights with an emphasis on dodging.

Sin embargo, eso no mancha el muy buen juego que es este Darksiders III.\nPara m\u00e1s sobre videojuegos https://www.yukharyan.com/", "timestamp_created": 1610045600, "timestamp_updated": 1610045600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559748470783233643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84217408": {"recommendationid": "84217408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083960266", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1248, "last_played": 1610021859}, "language": "english", "review": "So I finally finished the darksiders trilogy, and I have to say, I can not recommend Darksiders 3.\n\nThey took a good look at Dark Souls and thought \"we can do that too\" but they botched it.\nThe game is way too easy and it is way too hard, the puzzles are an insult to intelligence, 1 and 2 were way better at it. \nThe combat is a bore, there are 3 types of enemies with a sort of fourth one:\n\nAll are fought the same way\n1) basic cannon fodder\n2) ^%$holes who spend all their time shielded\n3) ranged ^%$holes\n4) way too strong enemies\n\nThe combat sucks, why?\nWell...\nThe difficulty is extreme, not because of the enemies, no no no, all enemies are defeated by deftly spamming the attack button and hitting the dodge every now and then.\nSo easy then, right?\nNo, controls are extremely unresponsive, just as with 2 the directional input is horrible, IF the dodge button works (and yes I know, you can't dodge-cancel) you will find yourself jumping into the hit instead of away from it.\nAnd then there's the camera, I think the games biggest enemy and threat is the camera, you can't fight what you can't see. It \n\nThen there's BS like you heal, you notice your Estus, I mean respite, being used, the number goes down, BUT YOU DON'T HEAL YOU JUST DIE INSTEAD. There's BS where you get stuck in or against walls en just hammered down by basic enemies and ranged attacks, and when you want to dodge out, sorry man, but an invisible obstacle blocked you.\n\nO and also, the difficulty scales by having enemies do more damage... they all have roughly the same moveset, they just shield more often and kill you in 3 hits instead of 5, even when you mainly up your HP stats.\n\nThe combat apart from that is a total bore, you dance around whipping and smacking the same dance the whole game long.\n\nThen there's the puzzles, they suck, why do they suck. Well once again the control issue, when you have to climb ledges but the camera just rotates in a way where you suddenly move the other way and fall down, you don't ledge grab and fall. It's not the puzzle that's hard, it's actually maneuvering it that makes the difficulty. The puzzles themselves are boringly easy.\n\nThe story, yeah it was somewhat fun, I chuckled every now and then, but Fury is \"the angry one who learns a lesson\" and that's about it. It's cheap, simple and bland. I found myself that every time Fury and her watcher decided to have a chat I thought \"shut up let me move on\".\n\nI have to give credit were credit is due though, visually it's actually a pretty decent game, especially if you sat through the whole trilogy. Darksiders 1 and 2 were impressive as well, and they did a good job at 3 too.\n\nBut: all in all, this was by far the worst in the trilogy.\n\nTL:DR\n-Boring combat\n-Difficulty due to poor controls\n-Mindnumbingly easy puzzles\n-\"meh\" story\n-Camera hates you", "timestamp_created": 1610023613, "timestamp_updated": 1610023613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546859800815582275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84172003": {"recommendationid": "84172003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027303158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2106, "last_played": 1609955842}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome.

I [u]loved[/u] those games. They had some quirks and bugs but they were really good. Instead of working on those tiny issues they decided to make this game a dark souls wannabe.\n\n[i]If you have played previous games, these are the changes they made:[/i]\n- No save system. You die and you get ported to last Vulgrim. One of the dumbest decisions right from the start.\n- When you die, you have to get your souls back. Yeah you heard me. Just like Dark Souls\n- You are weak. Yep just like in dark souls, you get killed easily by random cannon fodder. Heavily reliant on dodge just like Dark Souls. Even on lower difficulties. Its as if you were expected to farm souls ...\n- There are no weapon drops like they used to be in Darksiders 2.\n- You can upgrade your weapons with items you find in the world. You have to find Ulthane and he will upgrade them for you. Yep like Dark Souls.\n- Levels are now tied to souls. You need to visit Vulgrim to spend souls and level up. Each level gives you an attribute point, which you can spend on Health, Physical damage and Arcane damage. Yep, spending souls to lvl up just like Dark Souls.\n- Attribute points get weaker the higher your level is so after a couple of levels, each point you spend gives you less of a stat increase.\n- Enemies now drop shards. There are multiple types in the game yet the devs thought that the best idea is to color them all orange when on the ground so you cant tell what you're getting. JUST LIKE DARK SOULS. Most of the shards are buffs. Undying shard is obviously the best one since it stops a fatal hit. Health shards are now for healing. No health potions. Wrath shards are for wrath of course.\n- Health shards are used for healing and now they have a 20s cooldown. Its a global cooldown for any shard you use. So if you buff yourself, you wont be able to heal yourself for 20s which might cost you a life.\n- Enemies now drop also Crystals. Guess what they do? oh you can break them to get souls ... I wonder which game has similar mechanic ... DARK SOULS\n- There is no map anymore, just like in dark souls ... Vulgrim offers you a list of locations to teleport to.\n- There are bugs. Found one right from the get go. When you buy a weapon enhancement, your mouse disappears. You cant control the menu correctly without it. Sometimes Fury just doesn't feel like grappling onto stuff so she just falls to her death. Teleport confirmation breaks if you click too fast on Yes.\n- They even added some camping mobs that jump you out of nowhere just to get a cheap hit in so you have to use health shards or die and return to get your souls back...\n- You can buy shards from Vulgrim but in this game, but they cost more each time you buy it.\n- There's no horse. You have to walk everywhere.[spoiler]It gets killed early on in the game.[/spoiler]\n\n[i]Things I like about this game:[/i]\n- The story is good.

Dodge, swing, sideways dodge, counter-attack, heal, repeat. \n-Lock on camera was insanely awkward at most times; like a half sideways view that messes up your perception of the target. You end up missing jumps, dodges, or jumping too early because it throws you off. \n-I couldn't stand how sometimes you would enter an area and the Watcher would talk and you slowly have to walk to your destination without jumping/sprinting or anything. Why? What was the point of a 2-3 minute Watcher conversation and not being able to move quickly at the same time?\n-Puzzles were okay but not really challenging or thought provoking enough like the Zelda themed Darksiders II.\n-Would have loved to see the loot system come back like in Darksiders II with different tiers and stats for different weapons, but alas no such thing really.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n+I loved the idea of fighting the 7 deadly sins.

Different than the other games but a decent try I'd say for branching out.\n+I enjoyed going back to old levels with new Hollows to find secrets and obtainables. Always thought that was a fun concept.\n+Level design and environments were pretty cool and refreshing.\n\nThis might be the only Darksiders game I won't really care to 100% all the achievements for. \nDecent game, but it didn't have the fun spark the other two had like stated before.

This is just trying to be dark souls too damn much. \n\nLets start with dark souls resemblances. You die, you drop your souls. You level up by paying souls to Vulgrim. You pick up \"lurcher clumps\" which you can crush for souls. Previous games had map, this doesnt. No quest log or anything to see what your objectives are. The combat was so similar to dark souls that they had to make an option to choose either \"Classic\" or \"Default\" combat, classic being more like the old games and default being more like dark souls. I wont go in-depth with differences of them, but i understand why people were mad because the game is supposed to be dark siders, not dark souls. Also leveling up the weapons is very similar to dark souls. I completely understand trying to get new ideas from other games but this just goes too far. I enjoyed previous games because their unique feeling, now it feels like im playing dark souls with Fury. Theres probably more resemblances to dark souls but yall get the point. Lets move on.\n\nIve only played the game for little over 6 hours now that Im writing this review, so Im probably modifying it after playing it more, maybe deleting it and making a completely new who knows.

I was almost not disappointed. Almost, because it crashed once and i encountered a few bugs that ruined a bit of the experience. \nThe story is appealing and gives you a rundown of what's happened so far in the universe at the start of the game, from there you are on your quest and Fury has a great character growth and you actually get to feel and experience it. I like the Darksiders universe because it feels fleshed out and it also has other media to help you with the lore (even if not everything is cannon, only the games are to be considered cannon). \nThe main enemy of the game is the camera angles (my arch enemy we meet again), in certain moments and fights it can kill you faster than i can eat a swarma. While the dodge system reminds people of dark souls it also reminded me of their other title Remnant: From the Ashes. It seems becoming a dodge master in Dark Souls will help you in other games as well, wish i could dodge bad decissions IRL the way i managed to dodge some attacks in this game. \nIts a Darksiders game, because while playing you see different areas that you cannot pass without certain powerups (Hallow's for this game) until later in the game and the fact that you don't have a map or a mini map will make it difficult to remember where you have to go back to, or figure out where you have to go to fight the next deadly sin. I got lost more than once and backtracked so much, my walking app would be jealus of how little i moved from my chair the past week. \nThe puzzles we're quite good, using your new powerups in the next area is something that the game does quite often and at a few of them i was just like \" huh i wonder \" and apparently that was the solution xD. \nOverall, its a good game even with its flaw's that will make some people rage quit, but for the fans of the game it will be a good sequel and they will enjoy leading Fury on her quest to catch the 7 Deadly Sins. Small side note here, this is of the best representations of the 7 Deadly Sins that i've seen so far in various media, in both speech and appearance they feel like the embodiment of what their sin is. \nI would recommend getting this game at a sale, but i'm sure fans of the game won't mind paying full price for it. \nAnd now ... we wait for the next game ...

What do I mean? Just a few quality of life improvements would tremendously help its core concept, which is fantastic. Lemme explain.\n\nThe main character is awesome, she's funny and insanely badass-- her design is crazy, Fury is legit. Her moveset alongside the upgrades you get make her one of the dopest characters I've ever played as in a videogame, however...\n\nThe enemies are uninspired, some hollowed half-butt made characters that are just there for you to completely crush and yet, it feels... not satisfying at all. The big bois are where the game starts showing its problems; the dodging mechanic is wonky, which makes things a tad frustrating to understand and sometimes the enemies just chain combo you nonstop and well, here's why I cannot recommend this game.\n\nThe checkpoint system is beyond archaic for a game like this-- a game that has a soulslike combat (somewhat), priding itself in being difficult yet every time you die you respawn waaaaay back whenever you saw the friendly demon dude that sells you upgrades. In Dark Souls, the bonfire mechanic works because it's placed in ways that actually help-- plus, usually, you have a multitude of paths to choose if one doesn't work. Yeah, here we don't have that luxury and also, we have a good amount of Estus Flasks uses and here... it's scarce-- you can choose between upgrading Fury or buying health shards, which is super lame.\n\nDarksiders 3 is linear, storydriven for the most part and having to redo the same path over and over again doesn't bode well with me-- it kills my interest in continuing because some cheap stunlock enemy decided to empty my health bar. Ever heard the good ole \"hard but fair\"? Yeah it doesn't apply here.\n\nRemember I said dodging is wonky? Yeah, it's the game's main idea, which works in theory but fails miserably in practice. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't-- comparing again, in Dark Souls you're in complete control of your rolls (plus I frames) and here... the clunky nature of the game just doesn't allow you to survive sometimes. The game makes you try hard to keep progressing but it's simply not worth the effort.\n\nThe lesson here is: Be careful implementing a bonfire mechanic in your game because it can make it or break it-- and in this case, it broke what it could've been a very, very good experience.

Regarding Abbraxis, not a bad fight but not really that impressive for a \"no other demon can match me\".\nNot much else to add, regular monster fights are nothing special, the A.I's feel kinda generic and those knife throwing bastards are annoying as hell, a lot of recycled coloration on the monsters but who cares, at this point i feel like the game had a 3 month budget where they only put some thought into a few important things.\nI also grew to enjoy the upgrading system, it's simple but it feels nice, whatever it is you decide to do with your points and materials, still vastly inferior to the great system of Darksiders 2.\nThe DLC is super cheap in it's content, it is only good to acquire new cooler looking weapons and the Crucible for rewards, i simply skipped it all cus i just wanted to get over with this game.\nLastly, STAY AWAY FROM APOCALYPTIC DIFFICULTY.\n", "timestamp_created": 1608222460, "timestamp_updated": 1608222642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82567973": {"recommendationid": "82567973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359705162", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4615, "last_played": 1607972356}, "language": "english", "review": "Adopting a more Souls-like approach to gameplay mechanics this time in favour of the traditional hack & slash that fans are used to from the previous instalments, Darksiders 3 continues the epic story arc of the 4 Horsemen.

The story arc for this game runs in parallel to the events of the first two games, and expands ever so slightly on the overarching plot that the Horsemen are entrapped in. \n\nI for one enjoyed the game and found the difficulty suitable as I do love the Soulsborne series and most Souls-like games for that matter.  Character designs are impressive as always and the story functions as expected alongside the other entries, but Fury's redemption or more specifically her growth as a character doesn't seem as natural as we see with War or Death, even though the voice work was sublime. That doesn't mean she wasn't without her highlight moments and does come across as likeable in parts. \n\nIf you are considering this game, I would highly suggest playing from Darksiders 1 and traverse the remaining games from there, since most gamers have only reached this point in the series due to their investment in the characters, lore and progressional story.

De momento el DS 1 me sigue pareciendo el mejor de los 3, dando mucha importancia a su historia que sirve como eje central de la saga y teniendo personajes interesantes, di\u00e1logos muy buenos y algunos \u00e1ngulos de c\u00e1mara en las cinem\u00e1ticas que son interesantes.\n\nDS 2 mejor\u00f3 la jugabilidad respecto del 1, a\u00f1adiendo m\u00e1s armas, habilidades, la posibilidad de cambiar equipos y un mundo abierto que podemos explorar casi con total libertad, lastimosamente \u00e9sto signific\u00f3 que dejaron de lado la historia (quedando en varios puntos \"pausada\" hasta que juntemos 3 objetos) y ahora los di\u00e1logos son m\u00e1s mon\u00f3tonos, menos interesantes y con \u00e1ngulos de c\u00e1mara que, si bien no siempre son plano contra plano, tampoco son tan geniales como los del DS 1.\n\nTeniendo \u00e9sto presente voy a pasar a opinar del DS 3, de momento es mi segundo favorito, con una historia mucho m\u00e1s interesante que el DS 2 pero ni de cerca como la del DS 1. El mayor cambio en \u00e9sta entrega es en la jugabilidad, acerc\u00e1ndose m\u00e1s a un h\u00edbrido entre un souls-like y un hack 'n slash, no como las entregas anteriores (aunque tambi\u00e9n tiene un \"modo cl\u00e1sico\" para aquellos que quieran una experiencia m\u00e1s aproximada a lo que ven\u00eda siendo la saga), teniendo un combate m\u00e1s met\u00f3dico, que castiga bastante los errores y premia la esquiva de ataques. \nAc\u00e1 no vamos a tener una variedad de armas enorme ni un mundo abierto como en el DS 2, pero en cambio tenemos un mundo interconectado y un abanico de armas m\u00e1s que necesario para masacrar a nuestros enemigos. \nEn lo que a la historia respecta, se deja entrever lo que ya nos enteramos en el final del DS 1 y vemos la evoluci\u00f3n de Furia como personaje, quien empieza siendo una egoc\u00e9ntrica hambrienta de poder y gloria, adem\u00e1s de enterarnos de algunas cosas interesantes que por obvias razones no voy a detallar.\n\nEn general me pareci\u00f3 un excelente t\u00edtulo, no se me hizo pesado en ning\u00fan momento (como si sucedi\u00f3 con el DS 2) y el hecho de que el juego recompense la exploraci\u00f3n me gust\u00f3 bastante, aunque creo que no se castiga demasiado al jugador en los errores que comete, lo que lleva a que en ning\u00fan momento lo sent\u00ed como un juego exigente (como si sucede en el DS 1 o en los Souls, que es el tipo de juego del cual obviamente est\u00e1n tomando inspiraci\u00f3n).

During the first 2 hours of the game I was frustrated with how easily everything kills you, the controls are all different from the first 2 games, and timing is so much more a part of combat than i was used to, but that aside, Fury is a seriously cool horseman.  The story of Darksiders III is so in-depth and well fleshed out I have no words, it was just so good!  There were many new gameplay elements introduced into this installment that actually were nice improvements on previous titles in the series, most of which are just there to give you a bit of an edge if you are willing to put in the time to find all the goodies hiding around the massive world.  Oh yeah, the world is MASSIVE... The open world areas to explore and continue your mission are constantly trying to kill you, but the rewards you get from taking that risk are totally worth it.  I really liked this game a lot, but I do have some minor complaints...  The FPS is capped at 60, I tried changing it via several methods and according to the Steam forums, there is nothing you can do about it.  Many times while playing, the world would simply load in too slowly and there would be white areas of the screen for just a split second when coming around corners: this was probably the most annoying thing in the whole game.  Also, I personally am not a huge fan of the \"Souls-Like\" type of games where if you make one wrong move, you're toast.  For a decent amount of the game you are stuck in this situation where if you take 2 hits you are absolutely going to die, then your character development starts to pick up and you can eventually be set up to where a boss can barely harm you.  The learning curve is a little steep, but I got there eventually.  Other than that, i really did love this campaign and it was tons of fun at the end of the day!\n\nTL:DR\nGood game, some odd glitches (having to do with using a normal hard disk i think), Souls-Like would be an accurate description for the first 2-3 hours of the campaign, Fury rules, have fun, kill demons!", "timestamp_created": 1607923562, "timestamp_updated": 1607923562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82316715": {"recommendationid": "82316715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054184779", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1630530071}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down, the best Dark Souls game ever.

Pretty much everything suffers because there's a noticeable change in the game's structure and core elements, like, for example the heavy Zelda influences that both the first and second held in their sleeves. And the Zelda influence isn't a bad thing, it always felt like a love letter. And while I wouldn't call it a complete overhaul either it's still noticeable. Everything from level design, combat, puzzles and cutscenes lack a little \"something\" and the end product is a painfully average game. I wouldn't pay 60 euros for it, let alone half the price. It's good fun if you pick it up while it's heavily discounted but you'll soon yearn for something more when the eventual cracks start to show both in gameplay and technical side because the game itself doesn't run too well.

Tengo un i7-4790 y una RTX 2070 acompa\u00f1ados con 16GB de memoria y juego a 1440p. El juego suele rondar los 60 y pico y 70 fps. Tiene zonas m\u00e1s livianas que puede subir hasta los 100 pero son zonas puntuales. Y tiene mini ca\u00eddas a 50 fps pero que duran un segundito como mucho y no son nada frecuentes. Eso en mi equipo, por supuesto. Si tuviera que mojarme dir\u00eda que es un trabajo decente, pues los mapas son grandes, hay mucha vegetaci\u00f3n y est\u00e1n llenos de cosas, pero tampoco es un pulido perfecto, pues el juego no es tan puntero gr\u00e1ficamente ni tiene tecnolog\u00edas tensas que demanden mucha m\u00e1quina. Por eso esperaba m\u00e1s que 6X-70 fps, pero bueno, no est\u00e1 mal, dir\u00eda que no es un portento de la optimizaci\u00f3n y tampoco es un desastre. \nY ya que hablamos de los gr\u00e1ficos vamos all\u00e1. El juego no tiene las mejores texturas, ni los mejores modelos, no tiene raytracing, ni tiene nada raro. Pero se ve bien. El resultado es muy redondito, muy bonito y coqueto. Se ve bien sin m\u00e1s, pero junto con el estilo del juego es eso, bonito. Adem\u00e1s, los efectos son bastante chulos. Furia tiene 4 poderes de los cuales a\u00fan solo tengo 3, que inundan la pantalla de colorines y movidas que la verdad es que queda muy bien. Gracias a esto los combates tienen un aspecto muy atractivo. \n\nY mencionados los combates pasamos a la jugabilidad, que es lo importante. No soy ning\u00fan experto en este g\u00e9nero, al contrario, pero podr\u00eda decir que el combate de Darksiders III es menos complejo que el de DMC5, por ejemplo, que creo yo que ahora es el m\u00e1ximo exponente y el rival a batir. Darksiders III no se le acerca a Devil May Cry, ni lo pretende, apostando por un sistema de combate mucho m\u00e1s simple y horizontal. No hay combos eternos en el aire ni puedes hacer combos infinitos, pues los enemigos, m\u00e1s reducidos en n\u00famero que en otras propuestas similares se defienden y se cubren. El juego incluye una mec\u00e1nica de contraataque, pues, si esquivas un golpe enemigo en el momento justo el tiempo se ralentiza y puedes propinarle un ataque cr\u00edtico basado en tu nivel de da\u00f1o arcano. \nFuria maneja en un principio una \u00fanica arma, un l\u00e1tigo, bastante espectacular y agradable de usar. Pero no solo de l\u00e1tigos vive el hombre, y Furia va adquiriendo poderes/formas a medida que transcurre la aventura. Se llaman Vac\u00edos, y te los entrega un se\u00f1or que no dir\u00e9 quien es por eso de no spoilear gratuitamente. Hay cuatro y solo puedes tener uno activo, pero los puedes alternar en cualquier momento. El primero que conseguimos, el Vac\u00edo de llama, le otorga a Furia un arma nueva, poder usar fuego para interaccionar con el escenario, super salto para llegar a sitios elevados y, con la barra de ira llena, explota, se prende fuego y da\u00f1a a los enemigos cercanos en el tiempo. Cada vac\u00edo le proporciona a Furia un arma nueva, una nueva forma de usar la ira y un salto distinto. Adem\u00e1s, Furia cambia su aspecto f\u00edsico seg\u00fan el vac\u00edo que lleve, cosa que es bastante espectacular. \nEl arma principal, los cuatro vac\u00edos, la ira y el esquive hacen que la jugabilidad de Darksiders III sea espectacular a la vista, aunque no tiene la variedad de otros t\u00edtulos m\u00e1s exigentes. Quiz\u00e1s si vienes de echarle 100 horas a DMC5 para dominarlo se te quede corto este t\u00edtulo. Si solo quieres pasar un buen rato zurrando a monstruitos es una muy buena opci\u00f3n. \n\nPara acabar, el juego goza de una m\u00ednima progresi\u00f3n que en mi opini\u00f3n se la podr\u00edan haber ahorrado. Un sistema t\u00edpico de niveles podr\u00eda haber estado mejor. Cada enemigo que mates te da almas, que por cierto, las pierdes al morir aunque puedes ir al lugar de tu defunci\u00f3n a recuperarlas. Estas almas las puedes llevar a Vulgrim, un demonio que te las cambia por puntos. Con los susodichos puntos, puedes aumentar tu salud, tu da\u00f1o f\u00edsico o tu da\u00f1o arcano. Adem\u00e1s, encuentras materiales que se los puedes llevar a un herrero para que te mejore las armas. Y tambi\u00e9n le puedes comprar a Vulgrim armaduras que potencian los vac\u00edos que llevas equipados. Es una progresi\u00f3n muy light que a nadie le importar\u00eda si no estuviera, como digo, un sistema de niveles estar\u00eda mejor, pero imagino que habr\u00e1n querido mantener aunque sea m\u00ednimamente la progresi\u00f3n que es un cl\u00e1sico de la saga. \n\nPodr\u00eda hablar de algunas cosas m\u00e1s, como el mundo y sus conexiones consigo mismo, los objetos consumibles, los enemigos y jefes, pero considero que eso s\u00ed es mejor ir descubri\u00e9ndolo uno mismo a medida que va avanzando.", "timestamp_created": 1607875991, "timestamp_updated": 1607875991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561752974987030029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82223335": {"recommendationid": "82223335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003801690", "num_games_owned": 1316, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 844, "last_played": 1607791719}, "language": "english", "review": "I wasn't sure about the Souls-lite approach at first, but it works for the most part.

Yo jugu\u00e9 primero a este y ahora he jugado al I. As\u00ed que hago esta rese\u00f1a comparando un poco con el I y con los Soulsborne, ya que se habla mucho del parecido de este juego con dicha saga. El I est\u00e1 fuertemente inspirado en los Zeldas (en el Ocarina of Time y posteriores), pero est\u00e1 lejos de ser un Zelda. El III est\u00e1 inspirado bastante los Soulsborne, pero de nuevo est\u00e1 lejos. Por cierto, soy fan de ambas sagas, tanto Zeldas como Soulsborne. \n\n-El combate: tengo que decir que me gusta mucho m\u00e1s el sistema del combate del 3 que del 1. En el 1 hay gran cantidad de movimientos que puedes ir adquiriendo (comprando), pero se puede hacer pesados el usarlos. De hecho hay algunos movimientos que es mejor no comprarlos para evitar hacerlos cuando est\u00e1s intentando ejecutar otros. En el III la mec\u00e1nica es m\u00e1s parecida a los SoulsBorne (y de hecho al propio Zelda). Pero es m\u00e1s sencillo. Aqu\u00ed tiene un elemento que es el esquivar en el momento justo y contraataque. En los Soulborne lo que tiene parecido son los parry, pero para hacer estos lo que haces no es esquivar, y si lo haces en el momento incorrecto te puedes ver en un apuro, si bien si te sale bien la recompensa es muy grande. Aqu\u00ed sin embargo si no esquivas en el momento bueno para el contraataque, igualmente esquivas. As\u00ed que en este sentido el combate es m\u00e1s sencillo que en los souls. Por cierto, vas sin escudo, por lo que es m\u00e1s como Bloodborne que Darksouls, nada de protegerte. Adem\u00e1s tienes la opci\u00f3n de convertirte de vez en cuando cuando se llena cierta barra en una bestia invencible (al igual que en Darksiders I), lo que facilita la cosa. Resumiendo, la batalla se parece bastante al tema de los souls, pero aqu\u00ed por un par de cosas es m\u00e1s sencilla.\n\n-El escenario: en el 1 el escenario es m\u00e1s lineal, aunque luego las mazmorras son unos laberintos muy parecidos a los Zeldas. Quiz\u00e1 este es el punto fuerte del I, las mazmorras laber\u00ednticas. Pero su mapa general es mucho m\u00e1s lineal y pobre que el de los Zelda. Pero sin embargo considero que el mapa global del III es mejor, hay muchos caminos para ir de un sitio a otro, puedes enfrentarte a los jefes de distinta forma, en fin, un mapa mucho m\u00e1s rico globalmente.\n\n- Tema de las hogueras, viajes. En los darksiders hay viajes r\u00e1pidos entre ciertos puntos. En el III el viaje es m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido, como en los souls.\n\n- Tema de las almas (aqu\u00ed \u00e1nimas, en bloodborne ecos de sangre). Sistema parecido a los soulborne. Vas acumulando al ir matando a enemigos y las puedes usar luego para comprar objetos o subir de nivel. Y adem\u00e1s las que no llevas gastadas las pierdes al morir aunque puedes recuperarlas. Parecido s\u00ed, pero no igual. Primero porque si tienes 5000 animas y necesitas 10000 para subir nivel, puedes gastar las 5000 que tienes para dejar pendientes las otras 5000 con lo que ya no las vas a perder. En los souls tienes que llevarlas encima hasta llegar a 10000 arriesg\u00e1ndote. Pero es que en los souls si te matan, al renacer puedes recuperarlas si llegas al punto donde te mataron, pero tienes que llegar a la primera, las almas de 2 muertes atr\u00e1s se pierden definitivamente. Aqu\u00ed no, aunque te maten a la siguiente las almas siguen estando ah\u00ed, por lo que sabes que aunque te maten tarde o temprano las recuperar\u00e1s. Eso hace que no sea tan chungo morir como en los souls. Y por si fuera poco los objetos que puedes romper para usar almas (tendr\u00eda que estar diciendo \u00e1nimas, pero se me entiende) digamos que son m\u00e1s grandes en este juego que en los souls, por lo que la mayor\u00eda de las almas que se van obteniendo est\u00e1n en objetos que no pierdes y que puedes romper justo antes de romper. As\u00ed que si te agobiaba el tema de las almas en los souls, aqu\u00ed en realidad no es para tanto. En el I ni las pierdes al morir, y se usan para adquirir cosas (no para subir de nivel).\n\n- Subidas de nivel. En los souls al subir de nivel cada vez te cuesta m\u00e1s almas. Aqu\u00ed tambi\u00e9n. Pero en los souls las mejoras adem\u00e1s por subir el nivel van disminuyendo. Si le das a aumentar vida lo mismo al principio te dan 20 o 30 puntos m\u00e1s, y m\u00e1s adelante te sube 3 o 4 puntos incluso si subes mucho parece que no sube. Aqu\u00ed hasta donde he llegado (d\u00e1ndole la vuelta al juego 2 veces) no parece haber descenso. Adem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n hay objetos que te permiten subir de nivel autom\u00e1ticamente con usarlos, y no s\u00e9, pero lo mismo puedes encontrar 15 por partida. En los souls no existe esto, bueno, quiz\u00e1 alg\u00fan npc te permita alguna subida instant\u00e1nea, pero no tantas veces por partida, muchas menos. Adem\u00e1s los atributos a subir son tan solo 3, m\u00e1s sencillo. En darksiders I no hay en un principio mejoras de nivel, sino que mejoras con el equipamiento.\n\n- Mejoras de armas y armaduras. Las armaduras solo se pueden mejorar en nueva partida + (osea, d\u00e1ndole una segunda vuelta al juego). Las mejoras de armadura son considerables (en los souls no). Y la mejora de las armas dir\u00eda que es similar, tanto en la forma de subirlas como cu\u00e1nto se va mejorando. En darksiders I la mejora del arma es autom\u00e1tica con su uso.\n\n- Forma de contar la historia. No es tan ca\u00f3tico como los souls, de hecho se explica lo que pasa de forma bastante clara.\n\n- Decisiones importantes y finales. Nada, muy poca cosa, hay 2 decisiones que puedan variarte el final del juego, y la variaci\u00f3n no es gran cosa tampoco. En darksiders I ni eso, m\u00e1s lineal.\n\n- El caballo. Hay gente que se queja de que es un jinete sin caballo, que el caballo no se usa en el juego. Pero vamos, en el I si bien es cierto que se usa el caballo, sale muy tarde y solo se usa en un par de momentos (aparte de para poder recorrer zonas ya exploradas). No lo veo como un elemento tan usado en el I como para que se eche tanto en falta. No s\u00e9 si en el II sale m\u00e1s.\n\nEn fin, el juego est\u00e1 bastante bien, a mi me ha gustado. Comparando con el I, pues s\u00ed, le han quitado varios elementos Zelda, la m\u00e1s importante quiz\u00e1 las mazmorras laber\u00ednticas (aunque aqu\u00ed lo que es laber\u00edntico es el mapa general). Luego otras diferencias menores (no hay cofres, no hay \"cuartos de coraz\u00f3n\" y cosas as\u00ed). Pero a su vez tiene cosas mejores, desde luego el sistema de combate me gusta m\u00e1s.\n\nY respecto los soulsborne, s\u00ed, hay muchas cosas inspiradas en los souls, pero como he detallado m\u00e1s arriba, hay algunas diferencias que hacen que no sea tan chungo (mec\u00e1nicas de batalla m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles, mejoras menos limitadas, el tema de perder las almas mucho m\u00e1s light, etc), adem\u00e1s de poder elegir el modo de dificultad.\n\nPor cierto, en mi primera partida eleg\u00ed la dificultad m\u00e1xima y me cost\u00f3 mucho el primer jefe final, que sale enseguida, sin embargo en la segunda dificultad m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil me lo pas\u00e9 a la primera. El primer jefe sale muy pronto cuando todav\u00eda no te has adaptado a las mec\u00e1nicas del juego, pero lo cierto es que una vez que las controlas no es para tanto.

As we learn throughout the game, the R4CPP is a horsewoman of the apocalypse whose goals are to traverse a number of low budget jumping puzzles, defeat seven deadly sin based bloat-bosses and slay gruntingly horny monsters. The ejaculatory phallic tentacles of \u201cGluttony\u201d were particularly revolting.\n\nThe primary pleasure of playing this game comes from the combat which is quick, sometimes button mashy, and can be very satisfying - as you gain new powers, such as fire, lightening, \u201cpurple drank\u201d and ice. Like many things in this game, the abilities have obliquely vague names like stasis core among others. What these really translate to are Zelda-like skills that allow you to perform better in combat and open new areas on the map. It would have been very helpful if the game had more tutorials on how to use these.\n\nThe story of Darksiders 3 plays like a bad action movie, and is best ignored. Even if you pay attention you will be left wondering why any of this matters, and if your time is really being well spent. Do you really feel like investing in the success of unrelatable Nihilists with vague agendas?  \n\nAt Hot Runs Reviews, we found most of the dialog confusing and especially irritating to sit through in the sections where you are forced to \u201cwalk\u201d and observe R4CPP listening to the Watcher.  The overall aesthetic lends itself to the fantasies of teenage boys in Sega CD commercials and horny Nu Metal fans.  Thankfully, the soundtrack did not contain any Nu Metal - with the majority of the sounds in the game being generated by the distant jerking-off-in-a -corner far away ghouls you encounter.        \n\nThe game does suffer from some performance issues, particularly when entering a new area.  Your computer will hang with no \u201cloading\u201d indication, leaving you wondering if purchasing a GFX card from eBay was wise. Fear not, you probably do not have a sh1tB@g- the game is just loading, and even if you have a Hot Runs Brand SSD, your run will be significantly cooled by these screens.\n\nOur Expert Hot Runner did beat this game and did not regret playing it. However, he was not compelled to \u201csave\u201d all of the humans or proceed with new game plus. In end though, due to the inclusion of a Certified Bloated Boss - we can recommend this game to any fans of 3D platforming and end-of-world fetishists to play from their LAN equipped Bug Out Bunker while listening to \"Rollin Rollin Rollin\" by Limp Bizkit.", "timestamp_created": 1607713285, "timestamp_updated": 1607713853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468266695737838745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82038309": {"recommendationid": "82038309", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993943302", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1607228381}, "language": "english", "review": "You cannot remap the controller...

First issue i had is a bad console port and 60fps lock. I set unlimited frames in game files and found out why devs left it to 60fps on PC, the world loading is total garbage. World loads in sections and when other section starts to load there's a big lag from my 144fps all the time to like 40-50 and stuttering. Sad devs just mindlessly ported this game from console and didn't take time to optimize it for unlimited frames. Other issue with this game is lack of any tutorial for new skills/mechanics. Game just throws new things as you progress and that's it, no info whatsoever. Have to admit during my game i had to google 2 things because i had no idea what to do and then found out that one of my abilities had some use that was never introduced to me. I see a lot of people complaining about difficulty and no minimap/guide mechanic but i think it was fine. There's no map or any guide arrows to show you the way to the next boos, you actually have to visually remember whole map and its sections. Only thing you get is a compass like icon on top (kinda like skyrim where it shows locations). I personally think it was fun to explore myself and not mindlessly follow markers/map. As to difficulty (i played on normal/balanced mode) i think this game is really challenging at the start and the more you upgrade/level up its becomes really easy. I didn't even farm or search for additional materials/souls and i had one weapon maxed out with maxed out rune. I didn't die even once at the last 2 locations and first tried all end bosses.

My gaming time is precious and I'm not wasting it on something that's shitte.\n-Once again the next Darksiders game in the series is a completely different sodding game and unlike the first 2 it utterly fails.\n-The developers thought they would cash in on the dark souls trend but in the laziest way they could.\n-Despite maxing out graphics there are very few sections that actually look good. Facial models are utterly terrible and no effort was made to lip sync. The facial animations and look seem to get worse the longer the camera focuses on them.\n-The story is just like the others, as in it is there because it has to be and not because it wants to be. Which makes it all the more critical for the combat to be facking good.\n-The game loves to freeze when loading in or moving into a new area that requires a camera angle change.\n-Main character is extremely annoying and just her talking segments makes me want to stop playing, I hate the donkey that wrote her dialog.\n-So many weapon combos and all are worthless except the ones that include interrupt potential.\n-I had to swap to a controller again because the game feels very clunky and slow to respond to K&M input.\n-Camera loves to wander at awkward moments.\n\nOk now comes the area that hosts basically the rest of the issues in this game and that is the game trying to copy DS.\n-Locking on to targets causes the camera to cant to the side and slightly up which becomes a huge problem if you are by any objects as they can easily obstruct your view because of this angle change.\n-Enemies blend strangely with the environments which becomes a massive problem when you find out that this is a dodging game and it can be extremely hard to see enemy telegraphs especially when you are mobbed by monsters and cannot see them winding up.\n-The game mechanics seem to be specifically designed for the DS style of single combat, but you will almost always fight a minimum of 2-3 enemies. \n-The game REALLY wants you to use the target lock and you will usually be forced into it because trying to do without is utter cancer. And it works fine........ until a the very first section when you run into several enemies and the camera starts spazzing out because you are locked on and it wants to pan in a circle. \n-Upon death you get to start the level over again, loose all souls, don't get back any items you used, and get to fight everything again.\n-Leveling and purchasing are tied to........ you got it SOULS because of facking course it is.\n-Unlike DS or even the previous game you get a pathetic weapon selection of 6 and they are staggered through scripted events as well as armor of which there are 11 and you can only get through the store. There are no loot drops at all besides the random shards.\n-No more semi open world to have fun in, and in it's place you get a super linear slog.\n\nI went to hating this game so quickly it surprised me, and I chalk that down to the fact that I've played so many other DS style games that do this so much BETTER! In fact here's some of them \"Hollow Knight\" \"Dead Cells\" \"Remnant\" \"Dragon's Dogma\". All of those are vastly better than this game.\nThe first game is showing its' age by now but still good, and the second one was more my style and I enjoyed it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1607334882, "timestamp_updated": 1607334882, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81765082": {"recommendationid": "81765082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198992085291", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 743, "last_played": 1628623704}, "language": "english", "review": "its not the worst thing ever", "timestamp_created": 1607318986, "timestamp_updated": 1628624236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81759642": {"recommendationid": "81759642", "author": {"steamid": "76561199108034461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1616004561}, "language": "english", "review": "Another awesome game in the series!", "timestamp_created": 1607308359, "timestamp_updated": 1607308359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81757630": {"recommendationid": "81757630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112290680", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2239, "last_played": 1612878837}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game mechanics and graphics, but holy crap are there alot of bugs.

This brings a nice balance between the aspects of the first and second Darksiders games as well as offering a totally new outlook on how this game should be enjoyed and played. Darksiders Warmastered Edition felt more like a \"gather collectibles for more rewards, and just enjoy more of a straightforward story\" game, Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition felt more like a \"dungeon crawler, mercenary, rouge-like\" almost where gear was the main aspect of how your character progressed, and this game brought a souls-like aspect. As far as gameplay is concerned, this definitely beats the other two. Fighting is very smooth and feels extremely natural, and the hollows add on more to the fighting experience which was a welcome change. Fighting in this game felt less like it was dependent on memorizing combos and when best to use them, and required more instinctual reaction time, with reward for dodging within a range of time of an attack. The story is rich and engaged me more than the past two games where it felt almost too overwhelming at the beginning and I had to pick up the pieces along the way, while in this game it all felt smoothly controlled and developed throughout the whole game extremely well.

Regardless of the combat style you choose its always fluid. The overall story, despite plot twists you can see coming, the story and character growth in the story is done well. The voice acting being solid helps bring the world the life, the background music is appropriate, but nothing really stood out to me. I wont lie I am a sucker for the art style they decided to go with as well. So I would definitely recommend this to any Darksiders fans or anyone looking for an action/adventure game.

I played a small amount of the first game but I didn't really enjoy the combat so I never finished it. I played through the second one several times, though, because I really enjoyed the combat, the variety of play styles, and the crucible, which honestly made the game worth replaying all on its own. Then we come to 3.\n\nI got this game from humble bundle and was super excited. I was playing the crap out of it and loving basically every second of it. The bosses were fun to fight, the enemies were varied and interesting, fury and the watcher were hilarious, the environments were fun to explore and traverse, it was really a great experience. Then I got about half way through the game and things changes.\n\nI still liked fury and the bosses were mostly ok but some of them sucked, enemies were just becoming an annoyance with super amped up damage and health, gimmicky mechanics and super armor as far as the eye can see, not to mention getting less varied, the watcher was getting annoying and seemingly was written by three different people. Environments became a bit bland and repetitive with less and less exploration, to the point that the final area seemed to have none unless I'm just blind. There were side stories that go nowhere and twists that seemed forced, with a general decrease in the quality of the writing, plus the crucible being a dlc unlike in darksiders 2 and there's basically no build variety because there's no skill tree. I'm going to go into more detail now but if you want to avoid spoilers then I'll say: play it if you love the series, love hack n slash, or it's on sale, and play it on easy if you want to stay sane.\n\nThe biggest problem was the bosses so I'll start there. The bosses that bothered me the most were gluttony, pride, and envy 2, I guess you would call her. Gluttony was a weird mix of boring and frustrating. He has a grab that has fairly little warning so if you're in melee range it could happen any time and if you don't have a lot of levels in health or you're already hurt it will likely kill you which leaves you sitting back and waiting to counter with the spear for a ranged attack, he has these flaily attacks where he retreats inside the tentacle and then does two sweeps and 1-2 slams and for some reason these attacks are undodgable as far as I can tell; no matter when or what direction you dodge, even if you trigger the perfect dodge and even if you have the enchantment that increases your dodge i-frames, you will get hit by them, so that further pushes you to the walls of the arena, but if you're far away he'll do an attack where he spits pools of acid where you are that stay there forever which means you can't get close but you can't get away either, and in the second phase you just end up underwater trying to make him do this attack where his kraken portion tries to suck you in then you make it suck in a bomb and it's nothing special.\n\nPride wasn't that terrible but after the first third/half of the fight she pulls the head off of the statue at the far side of the arena and makes it float around the arena shooting out a beam that never stops, the head can't be destroyed, the beam is undodgable, it does absurd damage, and can get you combo'd to death instantly if she attacks at the same time you get hit by it. It's not particularly hard but it's not that fun either because of the beam and it honestly just feels like a lazy attempt at difficulty that ruined an otherwise serviceable fight for me.\n\nThen there's envy 2, lord help me. I was REALLY enjoying the fight with envy 2 at first. She uses the talisman, after taking it from you, to summon the souls of the other sins to use attacks from their fights. But. She has an attack that hits 360, is undodgable, does a significant amount of damage, and is so fast that if you are doing anything when she starts the animation you cannot get out of range. But that's _not even the worst part._ The wrath attack that she uses is from the second fight with him where he creates three shockwaves back to back. The shockwaves are undodgabel so you have to jump them. Except. If she does an attack while wrath is out then 99.99% of the time you'll get hit by one while avoiding the other. If that happens you will get stunlocked to death by her combo and his shockwaves hitting you. This one thing killed me 6 times and ruined the fight for me because every time I saw wrath I would think \"if she does anything I'm dead and I have to start over\" and that's not a fun or fair way for the fight to work. There are also a lot of bad hitboxes in this fight specifically that will have you getting hit by attacks that are nowhere near you.\n\nAs for the normal enemies, they get very repetitive (to the point that the final areas only have like five different types of enemies throughout,) they are just given a ton more health and damage to make them a continued threat, which feels extremely lazy, anything bigger than your average demon gets significant super armor, sometimes seemingly infinite super armor, and they get very gimmicky. One enemy will summon much weaker clones of itself to attack you. I don't know if there's a limit but I've seen it have at least two clones summoned at once. That same enemy also has extreme super armor so you can't stun it basically ever AND fairly high damage that will decimate you if you get stunlocked by it and one or two clones. Then there's another enemy that summons enemies but it summons full power enemies, not weakened versions, it can buff them, it has a metric ton of health and super armor, hits like a truck, and to top things off it has a shield that is always active so if you end up on it's left side while trying not to get ganked by the adds you're shit out of luck for doing damage.\n\nThe watcher was a pretty disappointing loss with the quality of the writing. Like I said, her writing is very inconsistent. Sometimes she's intentionally annoying to fury, sometimes she respects fury, sometimes she's just an asshole, and while I think any one of these approaches would have been good they really tear each other down. It's very confusing when in one sentence she's being silly, the next she's complimenting you, and the next she's treating you like garbage.\n\nThere's not a lot to add to what I said about the environments. The city, the catacombs, and the subway are all pretty good, they have a wide variety of locations and designs, good enemy variety, etc. but the later levels, the last area and the bonelands in particular, are very one note and have a small number of enemies that are just copy/pasted all over the map and very little to find, most of which isn't even really hidden.\n\nThen there's the side stories that just don't matter. The lord of hollows, henceforth known as gwyn, tells you to kill abraxis, abraxis tells you he's gonna free BBEG supreme and gwyn is going to hollow the entire planet and he's using us to achieve it, then you can kill abraxis or tell him you'll kill gwyn. I killed abraxis and then went to gwyn and he was like \"yup, i'm gonna hollow everything. you gonna kill me? because now's your only chance.\" So I did. And then that was it. You don't get anything for it, the council doesn't say anything about it, it doesn't change anything. Maybe there's more story if you only kill one but I don't know.

I Played through the first one, and part way through the second. When I saw the reviews that this was a souls like game, it actually made me excited. I'd been wanting to play a new souls like game that was polished. Boy was I wrong. \n\nFirst off, for those that think this is a souls game, it's really not. This is a poor imitation of a souls game. In a souls game, when I die, I know what killed me. I know where I messed up and how to improve. In this game it just seems like horrible mechanics overall. \n\nThe dodge works maybe half the time, (There's no block or parry). They really don't have good windows for the dodge mechanic is the only explanation I can think of. A lot of the enemies have simple enough move sets, and if this was built in an actual souls game this would be considered one of the easiest there is out there. The issue is that the game doesn't work the way a souls game should. \n\nSouls games should make you feel like you're building yourself up, but you can never get cocky about it. You feel accomplished when you finally pass an area that was giving you issues. You get that \"Oh F***K NO\" moments when you see an enemy standing somewhere you need to go, and it's one that looks scary and you don't know it. \n\nThis is some weird mix of what the game was and them trying to make it into a souls game. They need to pick one side or the other and stick with it. Honestly I hope they don't do this same format for the 4th game, if they ever do a fourth game. If you must play for the story, there is a story difficulty, but I'm not sure how easy it is, otherwise if you're looking for a souls game, I would look somewhere else.

Every element it borrowed for its own mishmash of mechanics are all poorly executed, even parts of its predecessors! Funnily enough, the blood mark system from Dark Souls is the least offensive in this stew.\n\nThe whip feels like a flaccid piece of string, only good to repeatedly flinch enemies that approach you, which rarely works out as their recovery is so fast that a missed swing from this sequence of attacks immediately has them ready to counterattack you between your own swings. Even with the first unlocked dual fire whatever weapon that lets you rush down, it's a constant recurring theme that if you want to play this like an action game - you know, like Darksiders has been in the past - you'll need to dodge constantly.\n\nGood grief this game almost fetishises dodging. If you're up against more than one enemy, you'd best swing once at most and dodge right after. Don't dodge too soon, though, or any swing will just hit! Which is a great thing to see happen when there's five enemies clobbering at you and didn't dodge just right. What happens is usually instant death unless they were all measly mooks.\n\nI'm playing on the difficulty above Story. I think it's called Normal and there are about five more difficulties harder than it, yet I find myself dying in two swings against those red... lanky goblins? I don't know what they are, but they're quick, annoying, and they love waddling off right out of your camera.\n\nAhhh, the camera, the single worst part of this game. If you don't use lock on, enemies will quickly find themselves out of your field of view, but this isn't a Capcom game! They'll gleefully take free swings at you that you have no way of properly dodging in time. So as soon as you notice one going off-screen (and you don't always notice - what with some of them blending in the bland decor) you're pretty much going to have to back off so you can move your thumb from the attack button to the camera thumbstick.\n\nWhat about lock-on? I'm glad you asked! Left bumper is an almost vital part to controlling the battle, letting you activate whatever super modes I can't bother to remember the name of or letting you switch elements. Too bad left trigger requires to be held for lock-on to work. There's a toggle, you say? Well the problem with that is that as soon as the enemy dies that its locked on to, lock-on just disables again. Not to mention that the lock-on camera does not solve the above paragraph's issue and enemies will gladly stab you in the back as they're very quick to position themselves to.\n\nThis game is a practice in frustration, quite fitting for the horseman's name. None of the enemies feel good to fight against in any situation. Singled out they're a pushover, in a group they're a bother that drag out combat with the necessity of constant dodging. \n\n...but let's go deeper! Darksiders has never played to the strengths of its protagonists. The final horseman is a shootey guy, but he's now in an ARPG? Even though some of the best parts of previous Darksiders was the shooting in third person? Why not have Fury in there instead? Whips and the focus of more ranged melee fits right in the ARPG genre! More so, why not have Darksiders 2 like that? It had a loot system that, again, fits an ARPG much better than a sleepy third person platformer/hack'n'slasher.\n\nAnd War. I never finished the first Darksiders, but at least swinging a sword felt satisfying enough. A combination of range and umpth. Fury's whip has ranged, but not enough to make for a real advantage and lacks any kind of satisfaction. I picked up a sword that's part of a puzzle but I'm literally just ignoring the puzzle and going through other parts of the world because its moveset and damage are more satisfying to use than a measly whip. Sadly the animation leaves me a touch more exposed, leading to more frequent deaths.\n\nDarksiders III needed serious reflection on what it borrowed and what it iterated from the predecessors, and has failed on all accounts. I can't recommend this game in good faith, and I already got it from Humble Monthly, so consider the already low bar it failed to meet.\n\nOh, and here's the kicker.

Pun fully intended as Darksiders 2 is easily my favorite in the franchise.\n\nLong story short: If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and Gunfire Games now NEEDS to fix it. I can only hope they treat Strife with more respect than they've shown Fury, and a remake is absolutely MANDATORY with true Darksiders feel, cuz this doesn't FEEL like Darksiders...", "timestamp_created": 1607014359, "timestamp_updated": 1607014359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81535427": {"recommendationid": "81535427", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970750409", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 5200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2192, "last_played": 1647222333}, "language": "english", "review": "This is definitely my favorite game of the trilogy.

The latest installment in the Darksiders series where you play as Fury. Supposedly, you are 1 of the 4 Horsemen but it is not the traditional 4 Horsemen (Pestilence, War, Famine,  Death). The objective is to level up and kill the final boss in a linear fashion.\n\nGameplay-wise, controller is best. If you are using a PS controller, you cannot change the controls. It is pegged to the Microsoft Xbox controller.\n\nConclusion, Darksiders 3, just play it on Story mode. Balanced mode is very difficult.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Sufficient Fun\nNot much depth but above average.\n\n2. Puzzles\nVery interesting. The steps are not so obvious. The obvious step is wrong. So, you have to think and guess what the level designer intended. E.g. 3 swords puzzle.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Unnatural Worldbuilding\nThe apocalypse has come, now all of a sudden New York city has underground demonic paths and caves? It's disjointed design. It doesn't sync well. The environment is very \"meh\". You don't go, \"This is amazing\". You go, \"Meh\".\n\n2. Attacks don't Connect\nDespite using the Unreal Engine, DS3 doesn't have the same auto-hit like Batman. You end up swinging your chain at empty air. Unsatisfactory feeling from a hack-and-slash game.\n\n3. Reload Screen\nIf you die, reload. This is such an archaic and old method. If you die often on the higher difficulties, you spend 10 seconds each time reloading the stage multiplied by the number of times you died.\n\n4. Weird Glitches\nDying in the lift at the Maker's Forge if you don't call it up. Dying in the acid sea and you can't reach your body.\n\n5. No Real Secrets\nJust in some alcove somewhere.\n\n6. Shiny Orb\nWhy does a shiny orb represent everything?\n\n7. Resetting the Fiery Weapons\nAfter getting Salvation (ranged weapon), you turn offed the Fiery Weapons. \n\n8. Salvation is Unoptimized\nInstead of aiming and auto-targeting, you have to Right Thumbstick, hold Left Trigger, move Right Thumbstick to target, Right Trigger to fire. 4 steps to do 1 thing.\n\n9. 4 Hollows Don't Make Sense in Context of the Game\nIncoherent. \n\n10. Changing Forms is Tedious\nLB + ABXY? So difficult to carry out in combat.\n\n[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Let Your Attacks Connect But the Enemies Can Block\nLet the attacks hit but if you make a mistake, the enemies block.\n\n2. Optimize Salvation\nJust hold LT, move Right Thumbstick to aim, release LT. 1.5 steps. Don't forget to let it hit the enemy on the boomerang.\n\n3. 7 Sins, 7 Weapons\nPride - Long Spear (Melee and can be thrown in combat)\nGreed - Ranged Salvation (Greedy so it grows stronger with the number of Sin Weapons you collect, Ranged only, multi-target, Ignore the puzzle requirements levels up with other weapons)\nSloth - Shield (Slow and doesn't move around, Freeze, Passive, Increases your Counter Window)\nLust - Armour (Sexy body, Lightning, Passive)\nWrath - Axes (Like the game, Flame)\nEnvy - Dual Edges \nGluttony - Gavel (Hammer, Void)\n\n4. Upgrading Sin Weapons Increase their Potency\nE.g. Gluttony's Gavel would gain AOE smash effect, followed by black hole effect that pulls enemies in before the AOE smash effect\n\n5. More Uses for the Lightning form\nPower up engines, teleport to hard to reach places.\n\n6. Instead of Changing Forms, Change Sin Weapons\nJust LT/RT to switch between the Sin weapons you have.\n\n7. 7 Sins, 7 Zones, 7 Types of Monsters\nEach zone to have monsters that reflect each sin. E.g. Greed would have creatures that drop more items and steal the Souls that drop. Sloth would have big armoured creatures that are slow but hard to kill, Lust would have beautiful, elegant creatures that either lure you towards traps and ambushes or bait and run away, Wrath would have creatures that enrage and go berserk when they see you.\n\n8. No Linearity\nChoose the other in which you kill the 7 Sins. No Envy is first and Pride is last.", "timestamp_created": 1606896774, "timestamp_updated": 1607244926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81447725": {"recommendationid": "81447725", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990947284", "num_games_owned": 5276, "num_reviews": 1297, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1608393913}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring.

I'm an okay fan of the series so it was a little disappointing to see something that I felt had a lot of promise just bombed. Playing it for an extended period of time really drives into why this isn't a great game. That being said I've definitely wasted my money on other things and I don't fully consider this a waste, especially because I got it on sale.\nPut simply, you'd get a better experience out of an extended demo than this. There's a decent amount of like, such as the combat and continued world building, but not much else. Once I got to Gluttony the game just lost all of its charm. Apart from it being one of the most annoying boss fights I've ever faced I just felt like I had seen all the game had to offer. I don't really feel like playing any further to see if it gets better or not because I doubt it can. Environments blend together, you either get into the swing of combat or agonize over it, the bosses are interesting or feel uninspired, you grow to like Fury or you feel she's an 'edgy' character that just got crammed full of badass tropes that never seem to stick. It really does feel like she's the only girl among the horsemen and that's where her character development begins and ends. Sure she has motivations but they can all be chocked up to the trope of \"singular female character in a group of all men\". I feel a better writer could have done a lot with her but instead we get an angrier version of War who tries to be cooler and edgier than Death and fails at both pretty badly.\nI would recommend this to a fan of the series but if you're a fan you already have 1 and 2 (maybe even that other game in the series), in which case I'd tell you to just replay those and look up a story breakdown on a wiki or something.", "timestamp_created": 1606785571, "timestamp_updated": 1606785571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81290435": {"recommendationid": "81290435", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085233882", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1237, "last_played": 1606773612}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si has disfrutado los dos primeros este te gustara, la verdad el juego no defrauda, fiel a la historia y jugabilidad te pasas un buen rato.", "timestamp_created": 1606775373, "timestamp_updated": 1606775373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81260795": {"recommendationid": "81260795", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970849530", "num_games_owned": 3454, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 3584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3584, "last_played": 1606760978}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good shit.", "timestamp_created": 1606761157, "timestamp_updated": 1606761157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480348378419876099", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81249607": {"recommendationid": "81249607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039446842", "num_games_owned": 3733, "num_reviews": 171, "playtime_forever": 2268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1628629206}, "language": "english", "review": "Fury: - It is possible to die of boredom?!\nDeath: - I can arrange that!\nWar: - This means Waaar!\nRampage: - 5 kills, and counting!\nStrife: 'tending to other matters.", "timestamp_created": 1606756275, "timestamp_updated": 1606756581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81155601": {"recommendationid": "81155601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058979232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1612368546}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the first and the second.

Combos are easy to learn, the story is kinda okay so far.\n\nSo, if you dont have a screen like mine and are okay with crashes and corrupted save files, then I recommend getting this game for the story and gameplay ONLY if it is on discount.

I understand that this was a deliberate design decision. It was a bad one. Any game that makes dodging THIS important as a mechanic (in so much as I'd say it makes up about 80% of any combat), you should always be able to cancel an attack to dodge.\n\nCaveat: They DID release a classic combat mode in which you CAN in fact, cancel your attack animations to dodge, which made the game at least playable, for me, but you still have to completely stop what you're doing if you want to heal, which is a big problem for 2 reasons: Your dodging/sprinting are not very fast, and all the enemies move faster than you can get away from them, which means you can effectively only heal between combos, if ALL present enemies are either stunned, dead or too far away to hit you, because even if you DO manage to get your heal off, it's not instant (even in classic mode) and takes about a full second or two to actually replenish your health.\n\n2) Enemies to not get stunned from hits consistently, some hits stun them, some do not, some enemies get stunned more than others, and some can straight up block your attacks, which may all sound pretty par the course for an action RPG, except this is a game that seems to favor careful and deliberate combat, wherein you dodge a lot and wait for an opportunity to strike (which in itself seems to against the theme of the main character, who is impatient and hot-headed, yet you the player are expected to play her as if she is careful, methodical and cunning). The issue with this, is that you can dodge, attack, and all but ONE enemy will get stunned, and if that enemy happens to be outside your FOV you'll never notice until he hits you and chunks you for a good 1/3 of your health, despite being a trash mob. \n\nPut simply, nothing about the combat feels consistent. The difficulty, enemy stuns, the amount of enemies, and even the damage each enemy deals (I fought one mini-boss about 17 times, most of my deaths due to spamming the heal button over and over and it not healing, and sometimes, for absolutely no reason, one of his base attacks would 1-shot me from full health, when every other time it only dealt maybe 1/2 to 1/3 of my health). Your attacks feel unresponsive at time and when they DO go off, they lack weight on even the lowest tiers of enemies. The dodging, while significantly less clunky on classic mode, never feels great, because even when you DO dodge and go in for a counter, if you miss or fail to stun even one enemy, you are still going to get hit and lose a massive chunk of health, which takes away all of the rewarding feeling of pulling off the otherwise rather stylish dodges/counters.\n\nAt the end of the day, the reason I stopped playing was because the game simply wasn't fun to play. It felt challenging for all the wrong reasons. I felt like I was struggling more with the controls and combat mechanics than I was with any of the actual enemies, with the except of certain sections where the main struggle was due to the encounter being designed in such a way that the basic mechanics of the game do not properly equip you to deal with, such as hordes of trash mobs dancing outside your extremely limited field of view, blocking all your combos, and forcing you to dodge, but never actually letting you get more than 1 attack in your counter-combo off because if you try to you'll get hit by something else.\n\nIf you want to get into the franchise, get Darksiders 2, that game is absolutely amazing. If you are already a fan of the series and want to play another game that's different in a GOOD way, get Darksiders Genesis, it takes the series' hack n' slash style back to its roots and was actually really fun. If you want a souls-like game, just go play one of the MANY souls-likes out there. Literally the only reason to play this game over any of the others is either to suppor the developers in hopes they make a 4th game that will ideally learn from these mistakes, or because it's on a huge sale for $20 or less and you want to find out for yourself what all the polarizing reviews are about.", "timestamp_created": 1606606956, "timestamp_updated": 1606606956, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502283096313476563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80958553": {"recommendationid": "80958553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077688587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 2824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1607279215}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Han eliminado el caballo, pero como no hay que recorrer grandes distancias tampoco se echa mucho de menos.

This is also a new game design (Dark Soul-ish) in the Darksiders game series and one that does not please its fans. Nevertheless, the game is good and can be entertaining for any gamer, especially if on sales event. This is one of those games that make you love and hate them at the same time.\n\n[h1] DISCLAIMER [/h1]\nRemember, in this game, DODGE, DODGE, DODGE. Don't be turned-off by so many bad reviews, players get easily frustrated when the dash & slash does not do wonders killing everything in their favorite game. If you play it properly, it is a good game. Just do timely dodges, learn the proper combos commands when moving on walls and you will be safe from frustration. Failing to dodge fast when required is often a recipe for a guaranteed wipe. Dodge and upgrade your skills constantly and you will finish the game smiling.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n- Good story and mythological references, along with the usual humor.\n- The overall design of the game keeps you involved from the beginning to the end, it gives you reasons to reach the end of story.\n- Good enough graphics and art-style, though some areas could be improved.\n- Decent voice-overs and soundtrack.\n- Decent combat system and skills-tree (again, you must properly use the DODGE skill).\n- Interesting puzzles to solve in order to advance, some of them pretty smartly designed (just think out of the box).\n- Interesting wall movement mechanics.\n- Well designed boss fights (saying for the third and last time, in this game DODGE is your friend for both mobs and bosses).\n- One of the games where skipping content and mobs in the way is really not much of an option (yeah, sorry, I dislike speed-runs, games should be played as they were designed).\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n- Harder to play than previous games. Maybe too much. On harder difficulties you may find the game frustrating, at least until you reach the higher level of upgrades for your character. At some point, unless you upgraded your character skills enough, you begin to wonder if you play the mighty FURY the horsemen of Apocalypse or just a pale shadow of her.\n- Occasionally, you may find it difficult to seek your direction towards main objectives, in water and underground.\n- Dodging in combat requires fast reactions, sometimes too fast.\n- The save-system consists of automatic checkpoints, so if you don't reach Vulgrim NPC (or interact with him for manually save if you made a level re-loop) and get killed you must start over from the last checkpoint.\n- FPS count may vary a lot even on best gaming computers.\n- The lack of map / minimap may confuse some players used to get straight directions by consulting them.\n\n\n[h1] [url=store.steampowered.com/curator/32839936-Proxydus-Gaming/] CHECK CURATOR PAGE FOR MORE REVIEWS [/url] [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1606403591, "timestamp_updated": 1606839065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70913243293762207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80330341": {"recommendationid": "80330341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192236119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2524, "last_played": 1559060039}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet another amazing instalment in the darksiders saga", "timestamp_created": 1606401756, "timestamp_updated": 1606401756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529304385185241699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80301186": {"recommendationid": "80301186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047232788", "num_games_owned": 699, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1816, "last_played": 1606397106}, "language": "english", "review": "Good combat that is more dark soulsesque than the previous games in the serious.

I know this game gets a lot of hate because of the deviation from the first time, but it was honestly refreshing. The gamestyle takes a page (or several) out of Darksouls with a slightly less grim take, which fits nicely with the character being portrayed by Fury. She wouldn't fit into the mechanics of the first two games, and for good reason. For as much of a drag Darksiders 2 was (personally, though it was still a great game), Darksiders 3 brings ideas and a new feeling to the table that I didn't think I would enjoy as much as I did until I reached the final cutscene and reflected on everything that happened. Another thing to note is the great amount of lore it adds to the franchise to better develop the story of Darksiders. The writing was notably improved, not only for the story but for the objectives as well. Where Darksiders 2 felt like fetch quest after fetch quest, Darksiders 3 has a much nicer ebb and flow to the open world genre.
