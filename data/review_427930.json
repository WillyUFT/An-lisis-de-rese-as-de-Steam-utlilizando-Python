[i]Army of Tentacles: (Not) A Cthulhu Dating Sim[/i] is a supernatural parody visual novel with RPG elements by Stegalosaurus Game Development. It features a female or male protagonist by the name of Perry Hollycraft who is tasked to lead the Deep Ones (subterranean dwellers living in a remote volcanic island) to conquer the inhabitants of Innsmouth, a small coastal town in New England.\n\nThe New Game+ DLC features romance and dating sim elements. In this expansion, Perry Hollycraft is in a dream where he/she enrolled in Miskatonic University during summer. Perry gets to know a cast of characters, some of which are variations of characters from the main game. Perry will complete quests for some of these characters and can also start a relationship with one of nine possible characters (Baldur, Cthulhu, Hamlet, Hamlet's Ghost, Hollywood, Keziah, Riley, Thatcher and V. Raptor) across three semesters.\n\nAlthough the title of this game suggests it is a weird game catering to a certain fetish for tentacles, this game is a spoof of the Cthulhu mythos with plenty of parodies on various pop and geek culture for teenage audiences and above. Sadly, a lot of the jokes and humour are in the game's battle system where the protagonist has to choose one out of four possible dialogue choices to counter an opponent's remark or insult. Some of them are good trivia which challenge the player's knowledge on the subject, but most of the time, I ended up guessing through trial and error.  This caused me to load up the game many times because it is very easy to get defeated and return to title screen after about two to three wrong answers in a battle. Rather than attempting to memorize the answer to the dozens of correct dialogue choices for every battle segment, I decided to rely on the Cheat Mode DLC that allows Perry to skip and automatically win every battle after a while.\n\nThe New Game+ DLC has considerably fewer battles, although there are also a few instances which require guesswork, trying out different answers and having to load from a save after being defeated. Thankfully, only one of them is hard.\n\nAlthough the artwork in the game is cartoony, they are cute and sometimes funny especially for the characters in the New Game+ DLC. In terms of the voice acting, some are okay, some are comical, and some are slightly jarring. It is a mixed bag.\n\nThere are also a few cons for this game. First, there are instances where the game time and menu is hidden and it is not possible to toggle it to check the date and time in the game, bring up the menu to save/load game, or to check on Perry's list of allies and armies.\n\nSecond, there are instances where dialogue options for certain characters are not available for some reason. This can affect the storyline, ending, and some Steam achievements in the game.\n\nThird, I find that some DLCs are close to being superfluous. The Charity Pack DLC only gives one stat point and doesn't add anything else. The Halloween DLC and San Diego Comic Con DLC offers in-game weapons and armour. Unfortunately, the game doesn't feature Perry holding that weapon or wearing that outfit to render them as cosmetic DLC items. These DLC items are also needed for some Steam achievements and 100% completion, and the item stats in the DLC to confer any advantage in battles are redundant. Especially when the Cheat Mode DLC is also needed for a Steam achievement and cheat mode enables the player to simply skip every battle as long as cheat mode is turned on.\n\nAfter reading the text (including every battle and their possible answers), listening to the voiced dialogue and obtaining every achievement in 10 hours, I can recommend this game with the New Game+ and Cheat Mode DLC when they are discounted at an attractive bundle offer. For achievement hunters who want to collect all achievements for this game, the Halloween and San Diego Comic Con DLC are required for a few achievements.\n\nAs a supernatural parody with humorous scriptwriting and dialogue, [i]Army of Tentacles[/i] is funny in some parts with a cute cast of characters. The game's battles, dialogue options, comical artwork, large variety of romance options in New Game+, and the developer's responsiveness to bug reports means that I can forgive the faults in the game and recommend this game with the listed DLC when they are in an attractive bundle offer.\n\n[h1]Visual novel, JRPG, Anime Steam group - Join the group and consider following the group's curator list for more reviews or funny games[/h1]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/vnislife", "timestamp_created": 1591165029, "timestamp_updated": 1630946508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756174623966217041", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62577656": {"recommendationid": "62577656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198824302304", "num_games_owned": 887, "num_reviews": 534, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1580896972}, "language": "english", "review": "Complete trash, lots of weird bugs make the game unplayable i.e. your quests randomly dissappear and at multiple points in the game a certain action is impossible because you get an error were you get a bunch of code thrown in your face and you have to close the game.", "timestamp_created": 1580228359, "timestamp_updated": 1580228359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558479964733123779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56162605": {"recommendationid": "56162605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017682285", "num_games_owned": 1447, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1569952238}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a huge Mythos fan and as such I feel myself implored to own everything there is, even remotely connected to it.\n\nBut this game...

It was a fun little story about a person (pick your gender) who happens to be a half breed of the old gods from Lovecraftian lore that needs to amass an army to destroy Innsmouth. However this game does it in a Visual Novel type presentation that also happens to be an RPG, cause you have a few stats here and there that affect the game. Also there are multiple branching paths you can take depending on your choices throughout the game. You can tell a lot of time and thought was put into the design of the overall product and how it functions. Also the humor reminds me a lot of the sarcastic, trope ignoring, 4th wall breaking, pop culture referencing, snarky humor you'd find in a game like The Bard's Tale, and I enjoyed that quite a bit actually. It's what kept me playing to the end. \n\nThat being said, this game isn't going to appeal to everyone. The humor type alone may put off some people, while amusing others. Also you have to get past the art. The way it's presented is with photo backdrops with artistic renditions of the characters that are talking. The art and characters aren't bad though, you can just tell it's done with multiple artists with different art styles (which strangely works for the type of quirky game this is). This can be jarring at first but I was able to quickly look past it. \n\nOverall I was looking for a fun story with Cthulhu/Old Gods type mythos in it, and I got it! Also the price point is cheap enough that even if it slightly piques your interest in it you should go for it! \n\nTL;DR  \nFun Visual Novel/RPG Hybrid game with qwirky Bard's Tale type humor which you may love or not that suggests multiple plays due to branching story paths. Also if you can get over the inconsistent art style and photo backgrounds and see the charm in it then you'll enjoy it.

This game is well made.  Very well done.  But it is a comedy set in the Cthulhu Mythos.  I realize that there is a lot of fatigue going around for those right now.  This game had an extended development time, so I am not going to be holding that against it.  Games like Cthulhu Saves the World weren't out when the writing on this game was started, so I am not going to sling mud about the concept.  I am evaluating the game on its own merits not as an entry in a crowded field.\n\n\n\nThe good:  Great humor, seriously laugh-out-loud at times.  The humor ranges from broad to very sophsiticated, from generally funny to pop-culture referential and frequently stretches into the surreal.\nThe combat \"system\" involves arguing with enemies and their weaknesses force you to try to figure out what answers are likely to stymie them, either by patterns in their dialogue or knowing their personality.  These refer from triva contests ranging from 80s television to shakesperian insults to classic riddles to your knowledge of tabletop gaming.  A tremendous amount of content for the price, including a DLC that has a decently long campaign.  Creative story that coasts about the Lovecraft Mythos without ever getting too serious.  Also manages to do Lovecraft without accidentally importing Lovecraft's endemic racism, which can be hard to excise from his works.  The battle system offers plenty of allies with skills that can help out if you just can't figure out what the enemy wants you to say to beat them, which lowers what might otherwise be a high difficulty bar without encyclopedic knowledge.  \n\nFully voice acted, with some great VO work for an indy game, seriously good.  Nice variety of VAs too, which avoids the \"wait which one is Chigara again?!\" syndrome some visual novel VOs suffer from where it's hard to tell people apart.  \n\nThe bad:  I feel almost bad writing a bad section, because they're all forgivable especially in light of the price point here and the fact it's an indy developer.  Some combats are difficult to figure out the pattern of answers the enemy is looking for, some tip you off with their dialogue, some do not.  Some of the combat takes seriously broad cultural knowledge from 70s sitcoms to Shakespere to tabletop roleplaying games.  This is made easier with ally abilities that give you hints or lessen the penalty for wrong answers.\n\nThe Ugly:  If a bug-free game release eludes AAA devs like Bethesda and Bioware, what chance does an indy have? especially when they're pushing the boundries of what their engine can do?  I did have bugs but the developer was very responsive in fixing them.  So I'm not taking off points here, I forgave Skyrim, I forgave Fallout: New Vegas and I sure as hell can forgive an indy dev.\n\nBuy this if:  If you enjoy fourth wall breaks, if you enjoy parody.  If your favorite part of Mystery Science Theater 3,000 was when you got an obscure theater reference they made (\"don't talk about our son, Martha!\") and feeling really clever about it.  If you enjoy visual novels with a light strategy game coating to keep things interesting.  If you're not SURE if you like games like this, then pick up a copy and see, it's worth the price and a good representative of the better parody games.\n\nDon't bother if:  If you think Cthulhu Mythos has jumped the shark beyond the point parodies are funny.

I am a sucker for dating sims, as my library can attest. This one keeps it interesting by not letting you date everyone at once, and having the characters actually mention something about it. Unfortunately, no one appears to be polyamorous, but there's definitely more than just heterosexuality, which I know a lot of people look for in a game. The quests here are still just as ridiculous, but I grew even more attached to characters, especially ones I didn't know you could recruit in the base game!

The game breaks the 4th wall many times and keeps a light mood. Few critisisms but will list them below:\n-There are no aspect ratio options even though you can go full screen (still includes black bars)\n- You can go to a lot of places even though there's nothing there\n- No apparent way to see your current quests. \n- It'd be nice to be able to rest for more than 1 day at a time (like a slider to sleep for 10 days to get full health or something)\n- Inventory system is unintuitive. If you equip an armor piece, it replaces the one you have (no purchase neccessary) unless you put it in your empt slot first.
