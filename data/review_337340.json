What an absolute superb emotional journey. [/b] [/h1]\n\n[h1][b] Gameplay \u2013 [2/10] [/b] [/h1]\nThe gameplay for Freebird games has never been their defining area. In Finding Paradise, the gameplay consists of (excruciatingly slow) walking and some small puzzles. There\u2019s not much else to say here as its mostly a visual novel with some light gameplay. \n\n[h1] [b] Graphics \u2013 [2/10] [/b] [/h1]\nPixel graphics. FP makes it work, but I\u2019d much prefer more modernized 2d if possible. Really nothing noteworthy here. \n\n[h1] [b] Audio \u2013 [10/10] [/b] [/h1]\nMusic is a core part of the story, and as such, the music in FP hits so hard. It\u2019s very rare to have music invoke such strong emotions in a game for me, but this is 2 of 2 for Freebird Games, I\u2019m not ashamed enough to admit that I definitely teared up when the score hit. \n\n[h1] [b] Content \u2013 [9/10] [/b] [/h1]\nWhat a delightful adventure through the life of a dying man. This game and its characters are written so well. The humor is on point, the story is so meaningful. An overall joyous experience. \nI decided to take a point off due to two main reasons: \n-\tA tiny bit of a slog getting to the peak. \n-\tOnce at the peak, [spoiler] the story descends into ridiculousness for a solid ~30 minutes. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] [b] Replay Factor \u2013 [1/10] [/b] [/h1]\nOnce you experience the story, the only point to replay is perhaps to notice certain scenes in a different light. There is only a single achievement for completing the game, so, similar to a movie, not a huge incentive to play it again as the playthrough will be the same. \n\n[h1] [b] Final Verdict \u2013 [8/10] [/b] [/h1]\nWhile not perfect, Freebird delivers another solid entry to their catalog. If you can overlook poor graphics, janky controls/movement, and no replay value, then FP is a must-have journey to partake. I cannot wait to check out Imposter Factory. \n\n[h1] [b] Recommend? [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]\n[h1] YES. [/h1] Both To the Moon and Finding Paradise are absolute gems that you should definitely pick up as long as you understand what you are getting into. This is a slower type of text-focused game so you need enter with the right mindset. Like curling up under the blanked on a cold, rainy day with a book and hot coco, Finding Paradise should be experienced in a similar mannerism. \n", "timestamp_created": 1697961738, "timestamp_updated": 1697961738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148578866": {"recommendationid": "148578866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123120127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 405, "last_played": 1661605609}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish I could forget this game so that I can experience it all over again", "timestamp_created": 1697859832, "timestamp_updated": 1697859832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148479372": {"recommendationid": "148479372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019324674", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 504, "last_played": 1697671837}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished it last night.

I would recommend playing 'To the Moon' first though if you're just now starting out new. \n\nAnyway, back to this 'Finding Paradise' game, it has the same mechanisms of gameplay [i](find the orbs to smash the protection of a memory, and then prepare that memory via somewhat basic puzzles and then activate it to get to the next stage)[/i]. I promise the repetitive orbs/puzzles are worth it as you get towards the end - warning though, you [i]will[/i] tear up and may need tissues for your leaky eyes. The controls are pretty easy, it's just the arrows and spacebar needed really, but also 'ASWD' for controlling directions in the mini shooter/fighting games. There's quite a lot of dialogue/reading to get through, but that's not surprising for a bittersweet game like this.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing this; it was quite captivating, and emotional, and it shows that you can do so much in your short space of life, or during the time that you have left. It's definitely one of those heavy life-lesson types with a mix of comedy [i](thanks to Dr. Watts witty personality)[/i]!\n\nI wanted to also say that this game teaches you about love, happiness, loss/grief, childhood, perhaps amnesia or hallucinations, family, the reality of life, and more importantly.... the following - it's okay to have an imaginary friend no matter how old you are, it's okay to have some regrets in life and to learn from them, and it's okay to let some things go even if we don't want to just yet; they may or may not be holding us back.

The story follows the same premise as To The Moon, you play as 2 doctors who are able to grant a dying patients last final wish by going back through their memories and changing the course of their life in order to help them fulfill said wish. While the premise is the same between the two games, the narrative choices are very different. Without going into spoilers, Finding Paradise plays out very different alternatively and I think the game is better off because of this. It helps to separate it from its predecessor. Finding Paradise innovates not only thematically but in its gameplay as well. It does a couple things differently though the core gameplay is very much the same. There are a couple extra little gimmicks here and there that added to the experience. So far so good, right? That's what I was thinking to myself as well while playing until I got about 80% through the game and was met with perhaps the biggest 180 in my enjoyment of a game ever. Without going into spoilers, there is an event that happens that completely sucks you out of the games story right when it's really getting going and what should be an emotional, heartfelt moment turned into 40 minutes of being forced to do awful minigames, and suffer through a complete tonal shift in the games narrative. It turned an 8 or 9/10 game into maybe a 6/10 game for me, it was that jarring and confusing. While I appreciate what the developers tried to do with it, and what they were going for, it really did not work for me. In fact, I went back to watch a playthrough of the game on YouTube and just skipped this portion of the game entirely and it made the story SIGNIFICANTLY better in my opinion. I feel like an extra 5 minutes of dialogue instead of this section would have drastically improved the game. That really is my only real negative about the game, and I still think the game is worth checking out, hence my recommended rating. The themes in the game are handled brilliantly and the soundtrack and story are beautiful. For more game reviews, follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40795588/] curator page.

Like the first game, it ponders some philosophical and ethical questions about memory, privacy, and truth. Also like the first game, it's an excellent experience.\n\nMechanically, [i]Finding Paradise[/i] operates similarly to [i]To the Moon[/i]. The general mechanics of memory traversal are the same, with slightly more interesting puzzle minigames; the most interesting part is the discovery process the game guides you through as the player. I appreciated that it didn't block me from progressing in the story with annoying tasks, but also gave me enough to do that I felt some agency throughout: it's a very fluid playthrough. The dialogue, including both its humor and its melancholy, is wonderful and the character emotes are expressive for such a pixelated visual appearance. Audio cues are gracefully integrated into the gameplay, and the soundtrack is likewise fitting and impressive. The level design is strong, keeping the player engaged with a good mix of linearity and backtracking.\n\nI really enjoyed how the game leaned into the humor of one of its characters in particular in the hilarious \"combat\" scenes (if you can call it that). The narrative cleverly separates the player characters in ways that lead to interesting and fun gameplay, as well as a sense of mystery and urgency. It also keeps the door open for an interesting follow-up game!\n\nPerformance was fine and I experienced zero bugs.\n\nOverall, I was pleased with [i]Finding Paradise[/i]. The writing and art direction are wonderful and the gameplay is fun. It's short and sweet, just like its predecessor.

The price tag is well justified and I would encourage anyone who likes a great story to jump on this one - and the others (To The Moon, A Bird Story, and Imposter Factory) IMMEDIATELY. This is a series you NEED in your library.\n\nThe thing that makes these titles so special is the fact that they're very thoughtful and have complicated storylines, and they run the gamut of content - from light and funny, to dark and serious, to hopeful, heart-broken, upset, happy, and everything in between. This series is one of those that when you start one of the games, you just won't be able to stop until it's finished, and each one has a lot of content/story. Once you start playing, you'll be gripped by it and just HAVE to know how things turn out.. and you'll probably sit there playing until it's done. AMAZING, AMAZING stories.\n\nBasic concept (which, I don't think this will be a spoiler, but I'll hide it anyway): [spoiler] Ever had something you know you're going to regret on your deathbed? Maybe you wish you had done this thing, or made that choice. Now your life is over, and you're regretting how things turned out. What if there was a way to truly believe you HAD done that thing or made that choice? The company Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene work at does just that - on your deathbed, they burrow into your memories, find out what makes you tick, and implant a series of new memories into your head - overwriting the old memories - so that as you pass away, you do so happy with the way things turn out.[/spoiler]\n\nThe great thing about each story is diving into it, figuring out what makes each character tick, finding out all about them... and it's told in such an amazing way. I can't tell you enough how fantastic this developer is at telling stories.\n\nMy recommendation is to play them in order. While each episode is a \"self-contained\" episode, it really benefits the player to play them in order. Kinda like how if you watch different episodes of your favorite TV show... sure, each show might be a self-contained story, but you don't get the full context unless you watch them in order.\n\nTo The Moon\nFinding Paradise\nA Bird Story\nImposter Factory\n\nSome folks might disagree and say A Bird Story should come before Finding Paradise, since it sorta comes chronologically before FP... But one of the things that makes each story great is \"getting to know\" the people involved... and I feel like \"A Bird Story\" is better viewed as the \"deleted scenes\" of a movie, rather than as a prequel. If you watch the deleted scenes on a DVD first, maybe it won't \"spoil\" the movie, but it just doesn't feel right. Play FP first, and then dive a little deeper with ABS.\n\nGet all 4 of these immediately. This is one of the few storyline games that got me a little choked up. I absolutely LOVE the characters and every bit of these stories was phenomenal. I couldn't possibly recommend them any more. They are well worth the full price. I had... SO much fun, and I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting the next chapters from this developer. STUNNING story. Easy gameplay.

But hear me out when I say that I watched multiple playthroughs of this game and recently played and finished through it again with my fiancee on her account (after we finished To the Moon and Bird Story). I might play through it again on my own account just for novelty sake of having the series completed and the Steam achievement. Either way, I just felt the need to finally chip in my take on it as it is an exceptionally good game/story.\n\n[h1]Not every story is meant to be told..[/h1]\n\nBut when they are, it makes up for a rollercoaster of emotions when flawlessly executed. The header being a partial quote from the game as I lack any better idea for another header title. Also because there isn't really much I can say about the game without potentially spoiling parts of it, and for a game that is all about storytelling I think it's crucial to leave it fully intact for new readers/players. In comparing it to the first 'episode' To the Moon, I will say that for me personally it was a bigger heartfelt tearjerker even though I felt To the Moon was a lot more melancholic. But of course this will differ for everyone because of the individual sympathy one may feel for each of the stories and it's characters.\n\nThe only real 'critique' I could give this game would be for the limitations of it's engine. But I wouldn't really call it critique more-so than something to keep in mind. The best stories are often told through simplistic engines such as the likes of visual novels, and RPG Maker happens to be one of the good old mediums that also offer certain interactivity. Finding Paradise does seem a bit more interactive than To the Moon was and it feels like they tried improving on it by introducing other new elements. The puzzles are still fairly easy and by no means do they impede on the story. Coupled again with another delightful soundtrack, it makes for a full course meal.\n\n[h1]Words of Advice[/h1]\n\nRealizing that I don't want to say anything else about the game that could affect someone's experience, I do want to close it off with some words of advice for a possible issue that some people may have with the game's engine. It will initially stretch to full-screen by itself which you can force to window mode by using the Alt + Enter shortcut, but it will be locked in a teeny little window. The former might also change your native resolution which may be a bit annoying. To solve that, just right click the game in your library and select properties. Then select the 'Betas' categories and select the 'alternative' version in the drop-down menu. This will install and update the game to where you get a proportionally correct scaled full-screen or a re-sizable window through using the same shortcut keys. Much needed if you don't fancy squinting or looking at ant farms.\n\nOther than that, it goes without saying that I would recommend people play To the Moon first if they haven't and consider Bird Story as well for a much deeper context before starting Finding Paradise. In total these games average to about 4-5 hours playtime each (depending on how fast/well you can read) with Bird Story being a shorter one around an hour or so.\n\n[i]\"The ending isn't any more important than any of the moments leading to it..\"[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1683439466, "timestamp_updated": 1683439466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522233724594116211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137907349": {"recommendationid": "137907349", "author": {"steamid": "76561199501591774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1683408650}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good story", "timestamp_created": 1683408714, "timestamp_updated": 1683408714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508816123008728027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137891013": {"recommendationid": "137891013", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241379708", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1683338684}, "language": "spanish", "review": "cre\u00ed que la historia no me hab\u00eda pegado tanto, y 3 minutos despu\u00e9s no pod\u00eda ni ver la pantalla por tantas l\u00e1grimas.

That's just good writing right there.\n\nI enjoyed my time getting to know the characters and grew to like them. It helped seeing how their differences make for amusing moments, like how the serious Eva assumes the mantle of the more responsible adult to the playful and anime-obsessed Neil! \n\nSome characters also complement each other as in how a certain loopy and free-spirited character pushes the overthinking Colin forward to do what he wants to but is too timid to do on his own.\n   \nThe music score is simple and perfectly sets the mood for the heartfelt story. It also masterfully changes according to the scene.\n\nI was going to list the game's lack of Steam's screenshot functionality as a negative, but on second thought, it isn't. Sure it sucked not being able to share special moments in the game but all in all, it's actually better that way to avoid giving away spoilers.\n\nThe game has an extended scene with the full works, including dialogue, animation and accompanying music score, in homage to the opening scene of one of my favorite movies of all time. :] I won't say which so you can have fun with it when you do! \n\nThere were moments when I felt like I'm in Tron Legacy while playing this game. One of the best things is that some parts are skippable without affecting the game's outcome. \n\nIt took me 9 hours to play the game from start to finish while exploring everything and going through all the dialogues. There's only one achievement in the game that pops up once completed, so you can just enjoy the ride.\n\nIf you really want to know what the game is about and don't mind a semi spoiler, here: The doctors' core job in Finding Paradise is an improvement on what you find in that Jim Carrey movie [i] Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind [/i] meets the Animus from Assassin's Creed meets Make a Wish foundation. \n\nIf you watched the movie and played even one AC game, then you can imagine the possibilities of where the story can take you! If you haven't, even better, you'll experience this yourself first hand :)\n\nPlay Finding Paradise when you're tired of long RPGs and shooters and just need to relax with minimal gameplay and a simple, engaging story that may or may not leave you with something to ponder about life in general. Highly recommended even for newbies to the Point and Click genre, like myself lol\n", "timestamp_created": 1681312268, "timestamp_updated": 1681312268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732744038105010986", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136577034": {"recommendationid": "136577034", "author": {"steamid": "76561199162794812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 663, "last_played": 1681062432}, "language": "english", "review": "i liked it", "timestamp_created": 1681310596, "timestamp_updated": 1681310596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136371491": {"recommendationid": "136371491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298438227", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 603, "last_played": 1680988469}, "language": "english", "review": "loved it", "timestamp_created": 1680988561, "timestamp_updated": 1680988561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136232583": {"recommendationid": "136232583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868088259", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1664837830}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Freebird games no defrauda nunca en el \u00e1mbito narrativo, y con esta obra maestra se consiguen superar profundizando en temas existenciales, sentimentales y familiares.

Using oldschool RPG Maker graphics to strong effect, a simple but highly engaging soundtrack, and a pair of amusing protagonists, Finding Paradise slowly unravels a story that I suspect will resonate with many adults and make them want to reach out and hug their loved ones after (I sure did).\n\nIf you're looking for an example of \"games as art\" or \"games as highly effective interactive storytelling,\" you'd struggle to find Kan Gao's beautiful series.

The story follows two individuals; Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene. The two provide a service that allows individual's to have another chance to live once again from the beginning. The only drawback is that it's only in the individual's head. Due to how the service works, the last thing these individual's will remember is the second artificial life they live in their heads, and because of this is only offered to those that are on their deathbeds. \n\nThe story encompassed within Finding Paradise isn't one that tries to hide the overall narrative. Perceptive players may realize early on what is going on, and others may realize only when the game tells them. The answer is always there to begin with, the pieces are just out of order. In the process of reviewing the patient's (Colin's) life the player lives and experiences another's lifetime. By the end, Watts and Rosalene must discern what Colin most desired and provide him with it. Some may wish for riches, status, or a dream vacation, Colin's wish isn't quite as simple and cannot be easily explained. The story doesn't stand out due to luck or various other events, but because of how simple it is. Colin's story could easily be our own experiences and his desire in life to be what many of us also hope to achieve. The story in Finding Paradise works effectively because of how easily players are able to relate to it with their own experiences. Which in turn allows players to empathize with the characters feelings in certain events. \n\nThe Music and Art of Finding Paradise are intricately sewn into the story as well. The music and sounds amplify the mood of the scenes and can turn what was a seemingly humorous moment back into a serious one. There wasn't a single moment while playing where I felt that the music didn't fit, or noticed an obvious loop in a track. The music here flows seamlessly into the next scene. The art is all original and beautifully animated. There are multiple minute animated details that further draw in the player ranging from the playing of an instrument, to a character taking the extra step to lay down on the ground. Simple movements we see in our everyday lives but in many pixel based games are often overlooked or unneeded based on the genre. It's the care that is placed into these small details that further bring the game together and allows the narrative to flow seamlessly from one point to the next.\n\nThe puzzles of the game served as a reference point for unlocking a memory through a physical means from the player. This was likely to stimulate not only the idea of how memories are tied together through repeating objects of interest in our life, but also the action of recalling a memory. That moment in time when we stop to recall and think upon a memory from a long forgotten moment. \n\nIn the beginning I didn't like how slowly it seemed the characters walked, and instead tried to find a way to progress around the map faster. It wasn't until I went through a few memories that I realized I didn't care about that anymore, and now having finished the game am glad there wasn't a run. The game told the story at its pace and no faster. When it wanted you to run, you would run; when it wanted you to walk, you would walk. This kept the game flow consistent but also allowed the player to establish a connection to the story and dwell in the moment on the events within each memory. \n\nIt likely comes as no surprise that by the end, when the story has been played out Colin passes. The service is only provided to those on their deathbed after all, and yet despite this I still felt as if I had lost someone close to me when that heart monitor finally fell flat. That's when it really hit home just how well Finding Paradise was able to get me to care about the characters and their story. It's games like these that remind me why I continue to play smaller indie titles over games from larger studios. Because at the end of the day the stories that stick with you are the ones that left an impact on you. It's the games that made you care about the lives and stories within them, and that is exactly what Finding Paradise has done for me. I look forward to playing the rest of this series, and the other stories that are left to be told.

It directly follows the story of [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/To_the_Moon/?curator_clanid=2750327]To the Moon[/url][/u] (plus its DLC) and [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/327410/A_Bird_Story/?curator_clanid=2750327]A Bird Story[/url][/u], and precedes [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182620/Impostor_Factory/?curator_clanid=2750327]Impostor Factory[/url][/u]. Overall, I highly recommend it due to its fantastic cast who is fun to be around and spend time with, its great writing and jokes, its gripping story with unseen twists, the very interesting premise that forms the core of the franchise's worldbuilding, and its absolutely amazing soundtrack.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[quote][b]A C H I E V E M E N T S[/b][/quote]\n\nThe game has a single achievement which is acquired when you beat the game. A normal playthrough takes around 5-6 hours depending on how much you explore the world to try and find extra conversations between the characters but, as of the writing of this review, the world record time for a speedrun of the game is 2:26:04 so you can finish it much faster if you're just in it for the achievement.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[quote][b]R E V I E W[/b][/quote]\n\n[h3]Gameplay[/h3]\nThe gameplay is fully linear while the interactive elements have a minimal amount of interaction but these suit the game just fine since the gameplay acts as an accompaniment to the story (which is the true crux of the game). The interactive elements involve walking from point to point, exploring restricted areas in order to find and collect objects required to progress, solving a number of \"match 3\" puzzles which have some unique twists to them, a few other unique mini-games, and optionally exploring the more open areas to find extra conversations between the characters. However, I do have two gripes with the gameplay: the characters walk around [i]very[/i] slowly and it would be nice if they walked a little faster to shorten the travelling aspect since it doesn't add much to the game, and you are limited to three save slots which is very little in this day and age.\n\n[h3]Graphics[/h3]\nThe graphics are very pleasing pixel art reminiscent of the later 16-bit era of games ([u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/613830/CHRONO_TRIGGER/]Chrono Trigger[/url][/u], Star Ocean, etc). The sprites are very well animated and the character expressions are quite clear which both really add to the emotion of the game.\n\n[h3]Sound[/h3]\nThe music is comprised of a number of atmospheric songs, which are used more often and suit the mood of the scene that they accompany quite well, and a few beautiful piano pieces which are used for the more pivotal moments in the game. In both cases, the music is fantastic and is a joy to listen to even on its own. The credits song is also a pleasant change of pace with its inclusion of vocals.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is the true heart of the game and I found myself captivated by what was going to happen next at every point in the game. The post-credits scene took this a step further by making me very curious about what will happen next in the series and the world as a whole. The gripping story is supported by its very likeable and relatable cast of characters, the amazing jokes and puns (especially the funny phrases that are sometimes used in place of swearing), and the enjoyable light-hearted interactions between the characters who have been developed very well over the course of the franchise so far.\n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. In fact, I began to clap when the credits appeared and I'm extremely excited to play [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182620/Impostor_Factory/?curator_clanid=2750327]Impostor Factory[/url][/u] so that I can see what else happens in this world. I have high hopes for this franchise and will continue to support it for as long as the developers keep putting out quality content, and I hope you do the same as this is definitely a developer worth supporting.", "timestamp_created": 1675165181, "timestamp_updated": 1676373501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131921317": {"recommendationid": "131921317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869884842", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 653, "last_played": 1675141184}, "language": "english", "review": "would cry again, good game", "timestamp_created": 1675141310, "timestamp_updated": 1675141310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131885983": {"recommendationid": "131885983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198999202408", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1675066605}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy game with a great story", "timestamp_created": 1675104502, "timestamp_updated": 1675104502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131853130": {"recommendationid": "131853130", "author": {"steamid": "76561199258273235", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1675980270}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a masterpiece.

It may not have had much depth to it, but it introduced some neat ideas and wrapped it up in a story that was pretty good given its brevity.\n\nFinding Paradise has much of the same core as To The Moon. The core concept of a machine that can rewrite memories shortly before death, the same two characters overseeing that process, and a dying patient with some sort of lingering regret that they want fixed. But a sequel needs to do more than share the same core. It needs to either go deeper (exploring the original's concepts and ideas in greater depth) or it needs to go wider (introducing additional ideas that somehow mesh with the original). The problem with Finding Paradise is that it does neither of these things, instead resting on the laurels of the original game without anything new to say about them. \n\nEven putting the lack of new ideas aside, the core story still feels like a downgrade. The patient is far less interesting of a character and the stakes are far lower. More attention is shifted to the machine operators, Rosalene and Watts, but I honestly found this to be the worst aspect of the original so the increased focus here is honestly a net negative.\n\nI suppose if you really loved To The Moon and want more of the same, this might still be worth your time.

In fact, having finished \"Finding Paradise\", it feels like playing both of these games was a waste of time.\n\nSPOILER WARNING, I DON'T CARE\n\nI'm sorry, because I can see the passion and creativity behind this, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who love this, but I thought \"Finding Paradise\" was WORSE than the other two.\n\nMy same criticisms from the other games still apply here; it's a story that doesn't work as a video game, because it's too automated and doesn't give the player enough wiggle room to actually interact; the first act repeats the same formula of finding a bunch of \"memory links\" to a \"memento\", travelling through time, and then daisy-chaining different memories across a person's life together. The two scientists still spend most of the game fighting back and forth and annoying each other, making them poor protagonists to see the story from their perspective.\n\nBut the story here isn't even GOOD. \n\nThere's an interesting subplot where Dr. Watts is tampering with his company's equipment, and his colleagues start demanding answers, but it's just there to set up the plot for the next game. \n\nBesides, the main plot is one big paradox. It has good ideas, such as how a person's outside experiences can sometimes alter their memories, and how an imaginary friend can influence a person both internally and externally.\n\nBut here, the writing hammers you on the head with its message, and it makes the plot of this game, as well as the premise of the whole series feel pointless. All it boils down to is people can alter their own memories to make themselves happy, and they don't need to hire scientists to put them through an expensive process with fancy gadgets to do that for them. Even then, people don't HAVE to alter their own memories if they got everything they wanted, and only had a few embarrassing moments along the way. That's what I got out of this game.\n\nI can only recommend this to hardcore fans of \"To the Moon\" and \"A Bird Story\". Anyone else will be bored at best, annoyed at worst. \n\nOnce again, I suggest watching a Let's Play and buying the soundtrack on the developers' Band Camp page.

It starts sometime after [b]To the Moon[/b], with the same concept of two doctors that are digging into a dying man's memories to fulfill his wish. [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/327410/A_Bird_Story/]A Bird Story[/url][/b] ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132503739/recommended/327410]my review[/url]), a side story that was released between this and the first title, was also connected to this game and will give extra information for those who have played it.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Beautiful music that helps to bring out the emotion of the story\n- Interactable objects that can be easily missed are made sparkle to make it easier to notice\n- Puzzles for more variation to the game\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Slow walking speed and you can't sprint to speed it up\n- Some texts are advanced automatically without confirmation\n- Sound effects like question marks and sleeping can be hard to see due to the background color\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like [b]To the Moon[/b] and want to play another game with similar storytelling, buy this game, although expect it to be of lesser quality.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\n[b]Finding Paradise[/b] uses the same style as [b]To the Moon[/b] with interiors that rely on ambient lighting and soft, piano music that accompanies it. Just like its predecessors, characters' sprites are drawn in great detail: instead of reading what the character was doing from a dialogue, you'll see them doing it in action. This helps to focus more on the narrative, especially since there are a lot of action scenes in the game. The ending also becomes more impactful with this decision, showing what matters with so few words.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nJust like [b]To the Moon[/b], [b]Finding Paradise[/b] uses the same concept of two doctors that are trying to fulfill a dying man's wish. Those who have played the first game might think that they will experience the same procedure, but the game gives a little twist. Since the original procedure won't be explained in detail, those who haven't played the first game might feel overwhelmed with the amount of information, especially since they need to process existing information from the first game on top of new information that is happening in this game.\n\nDialogues are short and brief, making them easy to digest. There won't be any wall of text for you to read, and conversations use words that are easy to understand. However, there is no way to automatically show the whole dialogue in full unless you play the alternative build, and the default text speed is slow.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1775803988\n\nThe main theme of the story can be a bit vague. Unlike [b]To the Moon[/b], the doctors are tasked with a harder case that can leave you to speculate. What is the best way that you can do to fulfill the patient's wish? What is the cause of his regret? Those kinds of questions will linger in your head as you play, and the game does no better than giving a vague conclusion to them. It's as if the developer wants the players to reach the answer themselves, which can backfire when they couldn't arrive at an answer. I felt like I was missing something after seeing the ending despite knowing what happened.\n\nThe story has a lot of mysteries. In addition to the mysteries from the first game, you'll also have more from this one. To be honest, I was more interested in this than the main story, simply because there wasn't much information about what was happening and I couldn't make any guesses. Moreover, I already had assumptions about what was going on in the main story early on so I had some room for thought.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1332070449\n\nHowever, despite all the vagueness and mysteries, the story can still get as emotional as it could be. I admit that I was confused when the game was almost ending - I was in denial that the game was ending and was thinking that there could be something more that I missed. However, I also had my share of confusion as to why it touched me so deeply without me realizing it. I usually could feel emotions coming from miles away when I was playing emotional games, but with this game, tears came out of my eyes before I realized what has happened. It could be because of my age, or maybe it's because of the game's charm, but honestly, I'm lost for explanations.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nJust like the other games from [i]Freebird Games[/i], [b]Finding Paradise[/b] combines both story-heavy narratives with interaction scenes. You'll move from place to place all the time, interacting with objects that you think can give a clue to what happened. It wasn't hard to find the objects either - you can guess them based on the patient's favorite subjects, and the others that don't will have sparkles on them. Moreover, there are hardly any vast areas, making exploration to be quick.\n\nThere are still some areas where you have to do a long walk, though, and the slow walking speed irritates me. I hated the default walking speed since the first game and wished that the developer will increase it more this time. They didn't. Well, there are some areas with an increased walking speed, but it wasn't there where I had to walk a long way at the beginning. Luckily, interactable objects are usually not that far most of the time.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1236245179\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nThere is a customized match 3 game where you need to move some objects in a grid to make a line of 3 or more of them. The game was easy to pick up and serve as a good way to alternate between the whole repetitions of walking and talking. There are also other minigames, but they can be skipped if you are having trouble with them.\n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 4.6h. There is no replayability - there might be some options that you can choose at the beginning, but I don't think it matters much to the main story. I was impressed with how smoothly the dialogue flows after each option, though.\n\n[b]Issues[/b]\nThe game was surprisingly slow to me. I had to switch to the alternative branch just to play it normally. The branch, however, has some differences from the main game, such as the font difference, the lack of achievements, and the feature to show the full text without waiting for the whole text to load. I believe that there is also a scene that was different in the ending, but it might be just me since I didn't pay attention to the game when I replayed it in the main build for the achievement.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]Finding Paradise[/b] tries to reuse the same concept as [b]To the Moon[/b] with a twist. I'm glad that they took this approach because the story will be too predictable and boring with the same procedure, although the story wasn't as impactful as the first one. This game focuses more on its mysteries and how well you can understand the theme that was subtly told in the game, which can be hard to be understood by some people. However, it strangely manage to touch me with its emotional scene, and that one particular scene was done very well as a finale. If you like [b]To the Moon[/b]'s storytelling and are eager for more, I suggest buying this game.", "timestamp_created": 1666536701, "timestamp_updated": 1666578945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746186316013336182", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124233142": {"recommendationid": "124233142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832524457", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1680376430}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1666465950, "timestamp_updated": 1666465950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53947371244430542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124183293": {"recommendationid": "124183293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122073890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 781, "last_played": 1666299414}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10 \"Im done crying.

Finding Paradise brings us once again the dynamic duo of the well-known doctors from part one.\n\nThis time Eva and Neil face a greater challenge with Colin, who feels like he has not lived a fulfilling life and wishes to clear out all his regrets. The thing is, he wants the doctors to change something\u2026 without changing anything at all! Is it even possible? Will Eva and Neil find a way to make that happen and discover Colin's paradise? That is what I will leave for you to explore. But trust me, the experience is worth it.\n\nIt would seem that the sequel would blandly match the first instalment of the series, To the Moon, as that\u2019s what usually happens when a game gets its continuation. But that prejudice is wrong. Finding Paradise perfectly equals in quality to its predecessor while offering a completely new, more intricate plot. At some point, I even started to feel connected with Colin since his story felt somewhat relatable to me. For this reason, I dare say that this game has hit me harder on a personal level than To the Moon.\n\nI feel like it is worth mentioning that Finding Paradise can be played with or without knowing To the Moon and A Bird Story (a short prequel to FP). So if you are familiar with the previous games, good. You will notice some references to them in this instalment. But if not, then all is not lost. You will, either way, understand the plot and take pleasure in it. And that's beautiful about this series. \n\nBuy this game discounted or at full price, get carried away on this journey, and let the tears flow at the end!", "timestamp_created": 1663933511, "timestamp_updated": 1663933511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122656173": {"recommendationid": "122656173", "author": {"steamid": "76561199185434948", "num_games_owned": 2169, "num_reviews": 234, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 570, "last_played": 1663886586}, "language": "english", "review": "How did the doctor get that memory from Faye ?", "timestamp_created": 1663889463, "timestamp_updated": 1663889463, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39682537317276001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122411946": {"recommendationid": "122411946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079595930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1677826830}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this just like I loved \"To The Moon.\" Looking forward to the next game.", "timestamp_created": 1663473996, "timestamp_updated": 1663473996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122313633": {"recommendationid": "122313633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260029664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1662893394}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good example of how \"good games\" are more than flashy graphics and complex game-play.\n\nA simple game that effectively told a touching story that left me with the feels.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1663317935, "timestamp_updated": 1663317935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122234958": {"recommendationid": "122234958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068114951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1689177269}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, I've thoroughly enjoyed the story.

And I procrastinated playing it, since pixel games are not really my type. But a friend recommended it, so I got it,\nHowever \u2013 this game surprised me!\n\nBut, looking back I would rather not recommend the game, as it does have several issues.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nWriting style\nI liked the story itself a lot, but I feel like the writing style is a bit off for the theme. The random whacky humour broke immersion for me and I felt like the tone of the scenes got either interrupted or destroyed completely which was rather annoying. I could appreciate some of the jokes, but it just didn\u2019t fit the theme they were going for.\n\nThe story\nI feel like, you will either love or dislike the story depending on how much you can relate to Colin. The theme feels very niche as it is about imaginary best friends and how you outgrow them. \nI could relate to Colin but didn\u2019t understand why he \u201cregretted\u201d so much. I could understand that loosing something is hard, but I didn\u2019t see why he regretted so much. Especially when it was some minor thing that made his life in my opinion more memorable (in a good way even!). He had a pretty good run actually and his only regret is saying goodbye to his imaginary friend? He does realize that Faye is part of his imagination and could bring her back any time?\nWhile I found the slingshot concept super intriguing, I wish the pacing would have been way better. Because there were so many moments that felt like they didn\u2019t matter at all. Why is this a core memory?  The game has 3 Acts, but 80 percent is just Act 1, 5 percent Act 2 and the remaining 15 percent Act 3. It feels very unbalanced.\nThat being said, Act 3 was a bit annoying to play. Faye is most of the game quite unlikable to me (but who am I to judge \u2013 it is his imaginary friend after all), but the way she refuses to talk with them and just makes Colins state worse, makes no sense to me at all. \nBut I did like the ending. It actually made me cry a little. I found it heart-breaking, that the imaginary friend died alongside of him. I didn\u2019t cry because of Colin, I cried because it reminded me of my own imaginary friends that I had as a child and that they will die once my life has ended as well.\nI also like the overall message of; having regrets is okay and makes your life more memorable. \n\nCharacters\nThe Characters were decent, a bit too whacky for my personal liking but at least they had edges! Which is always a welcome change. However, while I could relate to certain parts of Colins life, I couldn\u2019t understand why he wasn\u2019t satisfied. Why he dwelled so much on something that could have easily been brought back? Sofia and Asher felt so insignificant in his life compared to Faye.\nThe doctors kept interfering with the story with their bickering. I would have found them charming on their own but not in the context of the game.\n\nLore\nI found myself wondering if I accidently skipped text boxes because I had a few unanswered questions. Also, the introduction of the two characters that you play felt a bit sloppy. Only at the end I realized that this game was a \u201cPart 2\u201d of a series. The story does work on itself, but I wish I had known before that this was a continuation of a series.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack is very cute, even though it got a bit repetitive, I still liked it.\n\nGame style\nAs I already said I am not the biggest fan of pixel art, so I am biased here: but it was pretty cute and decent for my personal liking.\n\nGame mechanics\nEasy enough but sometimes a bit buggy. When you clicked on the memory it sometimes made the characters walk away from it while applying the colourful balls. It was not a big hassle though. \nOverall way to repetitive for me, with the same puzzles over and over again.\nI think I would have enjoyed an interactive story more than the \u201cgameplay\u201d.\nThe ending was a bit more difficult. It has a fight/defeat mechanic that is retro.

Pretty much for those that finished/know the the ending\n[spoiler] As someone who doesn't experience nor know how it would be like to have an imaginary friend, this game has really shown me a lot and of how someone could become the person they are today because of an imaginary friend. I don't personally know anyone that does but there could be someone we know that does and is keeping it a secret. It's just interesting to think about how everyone has their ways of coping with loneliness and anxiety. Though some might go a bit too far to the point of mixing fiction with reality, it just shows that we should really appreciate the people around us because we might just be that presence(Im talking about how Faye was that presence that to Colin) to someone with these kinds of troubles.

[/h1]\n\n\"Finding Paradise\" is a direct sequel to \"A bird story\" that follows another episode from Sigmund Corp; the company that works in the field of granting people's last dying wish! Although the game is quite emotional at times, the same inconveniences that plagued the other Freebird games are still present here.\n\nYou control Dr Eva Rosalind and Dr Neil Watts, the same two \"clowns with deep understanding of human emotion\" from the game \"To the Moon\" who, again, are assigned another case of an old dying man with a wish that could be granted. Upon arrival at the scene, Rosalind and Watts immediatly sense that this is not a regular case and they'll try their best to grant Colin Reed's dying wish; who is the same little boy you played as in \"A bird's story\", the same lonely kid with tons of regrets. In \"Finding Paradise\", Colin Reed seems to have made a life and a career for himself, and you'll see it all unfold in glorious pixel-art graphics.\n\nLet me warn you though, that the game will have you choking of depression throughout; I literally cried the first few minutes of the game when Colin is talking about how his life was great but unfulfilling, that although he loved his family, he's had many things he regretted not doing... Such as spending adequate time with his son, who's had a career and kind of ghosted his parents for the entirety of his adulthood... These little things in the game will have a deep effect on your emotions because they are as ordinary as they are real things most people will go through in their lives not paying too much attention to! I guess you'll have to play the game to find out how deeply-rooted in our lives these things the game details are... Hence why you'd require lots of tissues to get through Colin Reed's life and give him a proper farewell.\n\nThe things I've stated before that you should be aware of before getting the game are: The fact that the game's resolution is capped at 640x480, you can only change it to look like a small tab in your huge monitor. The Steam Overlay also does NOT work with the game, and you'd have to perform unnecessary maneuvers to get the game to properly function. Is the story so good that it's worth looking over all of these defects? Yes, it most certainly is. Despite all that's bad with the game, in my opinion this is one game that deserves a sort of prize, an Oscars or something... It's a [b]10/10[/b] emotional journey through an old man's memories; it will have the toughest of players beside themselves with grief, if not straight out crying their eyes out. Play it only when you're in a good place mentally, or it might make your depression much worse before it makes it better.", "timestamp_created": 1657536077, "timestamp_updated": 1667210245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629863977432250977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118572365": {"recommendationid": "118572365", "author": {"steamid": "76561199108469739", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1657416175}, "language": "english", "review": "sob", "timestamp_created": 1657460081, "timestamp_updated": 1657460081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118570842": {"recommendationid": "118570842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085348190", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1514326158}, "language": "english", "review": "What's going on?\n\u25cb It's annoying or not interesting\n\u25c9 I'm in this game and I don't like it\n\u25cb I think it shouldn't be on Steam\n\u25cb It's spam", "timestamp_created": 1657458024, "timestamp_updated": 1657458024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118533368": {"recommendationid": "118533368", "author": {"steamid": "76561199214619110", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1657389854}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished this game and enjoyed it even more than the first game which is saying a lot.

In To the Moon (TtM), the experience is shorter, telling a story that is both as sweet as it is saddening. Here, Finding Paradise offers more extension to TtM's storytelling format, and instead insists to tell a more complicated story using the same medium. In fact, I find the story significantly more complicated to a point I believe I'm either gonna have to replay this game again in the future, or read up on it to wrap my head around it - just to fully understand what exactly happened in this game. This is not a flaw. I am just stupid.\n\nMechanically speaking, though, I find that FP has better sound design and music - and I note for the music in particular, I noticed a fuller, richer listening experience and generally it seemed the music was designed with better articulation. I digress. From a gameplay perspective, the option of using WASD for movement and Spacebar for interaction was an excellent feature that TtM lacked, as it was limited to arrow keys for movement and Enter for interaction. The art in FP also seems to have improved - environments felt more realistic, more colorful, more atmospheric. Animation quality was largely the same, as TtM's animation was already above what you'd expect from a pixel art game already. And lastly, TtM's comedy dialogue felt more awkward and forced, but I actually found myself chuckling quite a bit during FP. Maybe it just grew on me.\n\nOverall, TL;DR - Finding Paradise is a head-scratching, thought-provoking, emotional experience that is comparatively different than it's predecessor. For as long as Kan Gao maintains consistency in writing what I find to be truly real, immersive worlds containing real people who have feelings, I will continue to buy and play these games. 9.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1656643243, "timestamp_updated": 1656643243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117960463": {"recommendationid": "117960463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198809613162", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1656631312}, "language": "english", "review": "i cried again. 12/10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1656631495, "timestamp_updated": 1656631495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117939323": {"recommendationid": "117939323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305821817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1656609066}, "language": "english", "review": "hard to play when these fucking liquid keep flowing out from my eyes, damnit", "timestamp_created": 1656607602, "timestamp_updated": 1656607602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117934038": {"recommendationid": "117934038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101444459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1656601880}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si has jugado a To the Moon y A Bird Story.

things. It's a story with some walking/talking segments along with with a few puzzles.\n\nThis begins at some point after the events of To the Moon. Dr Watts and Rosalene go to change the memories of a dying guy named Colin. Slightly different in this one is that instead of going from old age to youth, this one flip flops back and forth between the two, converging at middle age.\n\nGameplay is mostly walking & talking to people, looking at objects, and an occasional puzzle segment. The puzzles are obnoxious but rarely take more than a minute to complete. The slow walking speed can be annoying on occasion.\n\nFinding Paradise is mostly decent in everything else that it does: Stories, dialogue, characters, development, etc. Unfortunately, the problem is that this ends up only being decent, mostly due to the plot.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the problem with the plot is it almost entirely goes in a circle with very little expanded upon. There is only one tiny change made for Colin, so it ends almost entirely the same as it started and leaves you with little to nothing to reflect upon.\n\nEven more disappointing is that the side story of whatever is happening with the doctors is barely touched on here. Maybe two or three very small things occur involving it, but they barely expand what is happening. Unlike To the Moon, this does not have any free DLC that provides more on that side story.\n\nTo touch on some smaller issues with the plot, what is going on in the plot was pretty easy to figure out well ahead of the reveal. On the plus side, that means it's fair and you don't feel cheated since you could figure it out by paying attention. On the downside, it's not really impactful. Even worse than this is that at some point during the story, two other doctors from the company show up. One of them flat out states that he thinks he knows what's happening..... and then just leaves without telling Watts or Rosalene. Colin is dying. He may not have time for Watts and Rosalene to figure it out, and the doctor leaves without saying anything. Could you imagine if a doctor couldn't figure out some issue with a patient, another doctor knew what it was, and then just didn't bother telling them, especially if the patient was dying? This is easily the worst written part of this as it's distracting and annoying.

Here I am, trying to send the same message because hey, I am one of those who can't decide which one is the best between these three.\n\nI played and finished all these game in 3 days, and I must say that it was a wonderful journey. The writing is superb and the music is very phenomenal. There were some issues with the older game, but it was just very minor compared to overall experience in playing this game. These three games are the good games that make you reflecting your life and asking yourself questions about life. \n\nThe storytelling in this game is exceptional, you can feel the sadness, laugh awkwardly at the dry humor, feel proud for the character's achievement, and even roll your eyes at some jokes. The story is one of the strongest point of these three games, I highly recommend you to play this game without any walkthrough or read spoiler to enjoy the game to maximum level. \n\nThe music in this game is truly phenomenal it deserved a special paragraph in this review. I regrets that I only played [b] Impostor Factory [/b] using my headset. If you have a proper headset or headphone, try playing these games using your headset/headphone to appreciate the music.

Personally, I liked it even more than To the Moon.  And what an AMAZING ENDING.  I was truly moved to tears on this one.  I just wanna say GREAT JOB Kan, and please keep up the good work and keep making these absolute masterpieces.\n\nThis game has everything.  But first of all let me say something to clarify for those who haven't played any of the Freebird games games that this game is VERY STORY INTENSIVE.  And that there is not much interactivity really.  I mean you do a couple of little chores and stuff but that's to get the STORY.  It's ALL ABOUT the STORY!!!  So, if you just wanna play a mindless game with no story go for it, and you most likely won't like this.  BUT if you want to consider being part of a BEAUTIFUL interactive experience then THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  So what do I mean that this game has everything?  Well the story has covers the entire emotional range :)  From extremely funny, to lmfao, to emotionally charged moments, to wtf just happened, to so sad, to omfg it's ripping my heart right out of my chest, and to WHAT A BRILLIANT STORY!!!!\n\nThe concept of this story is so deep it shook me to my core.  All I can say is if you don't play this game, well then, you haven't lived a full life.  \n\nFor those of you who are wondering what is the correct order to play the Freebird games is, then I will tell you.  The games before To the Moon are not related in story.  And after that it looks like this:\n\nTo the Moon\nMinisode 1\nA Bird Story\nMinisode 2\nFinding Paradise\nImpostor Factory\n\nI haven't played Impostor Factory yet.

The wiki uses 'The Sigmund Corp Series,' so I think I'll use that as well.  As such, the visual style has been kept constant.  The characters of Neil & Eva bounce off each other quite well, both with their individual quirks.  The additional characters from Sigmund Corp are a welcome touch, & adds a character that seems to be more vital as the games progress.  Each has their charm as they delve into the mind of their next client, though travelling through in a collapsing spiral rather than a strict timeline this time.  The music stands out just as well as the last, & yes, \"Wish My Life Away\" by Laura Shigihara is definitely the highlight.  Similar to \"Everything's Alright,\" it's used during the climax to great effect.\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u]:[/b] Sadly, only one of the real problems from To The Moon has been fixed.  The game still has a large problem with a plodding 1st act, an incredible sparse 2nd act, & a short but slightly frustrating (though emotional) 3rd act.  The puzzles feel completely unnecessary, & the sudden actions taken in the final act can be a tad annoying.  At least they improved the characters this time around.\n\n[b][u]ACHIEVEMENT[/u]:[/b] Once again, a single achievement unlocks after clearing the game.  Enjoy the story, & receive your reward.\n\n[b][u]FINAL[/u]:[/b] Finding Paradise is a charming, sweet, heartfelt follow up to To The Moon.  If you're coming in to continue the lives of the Sigmund Corp workers from the first title, & have your heartstrings tugged, it fills that niche quite well.

The first component is the level of puzzles the player has to solve, and a great adventure game increases the difficulty and complexity of diverse puzzles as the story develops while providing enough clues that the player AFTER solving the puzzle thinks \u201cThat was rather obvious, why didn\u2019t I think of this from the beginning?\u201d. The second component is the emotional involvement of the player in the story development; an identification with the problems the characters encounter to provide a driving force for the effort necessary to solve the puzzles. Rarely, adventure games address both components, with LucasArts games starting with \"Maniac Mansion\" or \u201cSally Face\u201d being exceptions from the rule. Most games put much work into the first category while neglecting the second leaving the player wondering why-o-why one should even care to find out that you have to put the alien snail into the blender and feed Cerberus with the snail juice. The Freebird Games \u201cTo the Moon\u201d and \u201cFinding Paradise\u201d are on the opposite end of the spectrum, and the puzzles are extremely simple. But the emotional impact is so heavy that this barely matters; if anything, the simplicity of the puzzles ensures that they slow down the game to a speed that the players can digest the implications of the story for their own lives. Of course, I prefer the perfect symbiosis of the two categories as exemplified by games like \u201cThimbleweed Park\u201d. But if I had to choose one of the two extremes, pure puzzles or pure storytelling, I definitely \u2013 DEFINITELY \u2013 would prefer the interactive mangas of Freebird Games.

While I can\u2019t say say that I didn\u2019t enjoy the game, it definitely was nowhere near as good as To The Moon\n\nWhen quality gameplay and graphics are basically nonexistent in a game, you have two legs left to stand on; story and music. With the first game, it didn\u2019t matter that the graphics looked outdated and that there was pretty much no gameplay. The story was THAT good, and the music complimented it very well. While I would love to say the same about Finding Paradise, I just can\u2019t. Despite the music being good, it wasn\u2019t enough to save it. The story was so confusing and strange that I just wanted answers. Yet the game kept giving me questions. I understood the message they were trying to relay in the end, I got it. But it still didn\u2019t leave an emotional impact on me like To The Moon did. And when the biggest element of the entire game falls short, you kinda run out of reasons to recommend it.\n\nDo I regret my time with Finding Paradise? No, I think in the end it just had a mediocre story which maybe I would've enjoyed more if I hadn't played To The Moon first. It's like trying to compare a seven course meal at a five-star restaurant to a burger from Chili's. Was it absolutely terrible? No, but because I've had better, I know what was missing. The ending felt like a cop out for coming up with something actually intriguing. It was really disappointing because I really wanted to like this game.

But even if the initial premise is the same, the exploration of human life, memories, and values in Finding Paradise is dramatically different from the game\u2019s predecessor.\n\nThis time, the focus is on a dying man named Colin who seems to have lived a happy, fulfilling life with his wife Sofia and son Asher. His dying wish isn\u2019t immediately clear, but discovering what he means by it is a large part of the story. Rosalene and Watts delve into Colin\u2019s memories, exploring both his recent experiences and his earliest recollections from childhood to determine what factor they can change so that he believes he lived a fulfilling life. Throughout the story, we simultaneously experience the most important moments in the life of a dying man and the playful yet tense relationship between Rosalene and Watts.\n\nIt is not necessary that you have to play [i]To the Moon[/i] or [i]A Bird Story[/i] to understand [i]Finding Paradise[/i]. The subplot with Dr. Watts doesn\u2019t make much sense if you\u2019re not at least familiar with Sigmund Corp\u2019s work and Watts\u2019 cliffhanger ending in [i]To the Moon[/i]. [i]A Bird Story[/i] offers a bit of context to Colin\u2019s plot, and though it is recapped briefly from the character\u2019s point of view, it helps you understand how his mind works a bit better and may help clever players predict the game\u2019s biggest twist.\n\nOverall, [i]Finding Paradise[/i] tells another \u201cside\u201d of the themes established in a world where Sigmund Corp lets people live unrealities in their final moments. Its characters are beautifully flawed and believably human, which gives the game room to say a lot about the ways we process, shape and contextualize reality and unreality without shoving a moral up our nose by the end.", "timestamp_created": 1631583866, "timestamp_updated": 1663751359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628182470798492432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99264214": {"recommendationid": "99264214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063107744", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1631493500}, "language": "english", "review": "Kan Gao is incredible and so is this experience.

After 4 hours I was set on writing this solely with my middle finger...\n\nWhile the ideas for both To the Moon and Finding Paradise are really really interesting, the game fails to move me in any way. The first Act is really repetative and you have absolutely no idea what is going on. The gameplay is okay though, not interesting but not frustratnig either. The only thing absolutely atrocious is the minigame you have to complete in oder to move on to the next memory. It was bad in To the Moon, it is worse in Finding Paradise. Second Act was the abolute WORST in any game I have ever played. The style changes completely and you understand even less of what it happening in the story. Weird cutscenes and old-style video game fights are thrown at you and you waste 30 minutes to an hour probably of clicking through whatever is going on on screen (comparable to the weird zombie shooting part in To the Moon). There were moments I just wanted to throw my laptop against the wall just to end it.\nAct 3 was surprisingly pleasent, then for a change and I almost regreted wantig to give a negative review. The end and resolution were cool and well presented in cutscenes; the final moments in Colin's life were beautiful.\n\nThe game does not have content for 5-6 hours of gameplay, though. It really dragges on and results in boring repetetive mingames and weird content to add more time. The story could have been told in 2-3 hours. I personally often wanted to skip cutscenes or endless dialoges that did nothing really.\nFInding paradise has a lot of potential and I somewhat get why people enjoyed it. But it failed to get me interested in Colin until the very end, I had no emotional connection to him, was annoyed by the repetitions and filled with hate by the horrible fighting sequences.", "timestamp_created": 1630444621, "timestamp_updated": 1630444621, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.36045876145362854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98575144": {"recommendationid": "98575144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821747293", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1630431645}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like point and click, retro pixel and story driven games, don't sleep on this.

You are almost done, but you want to stop reading for the day but you feel compelled to continue and can't stop. I ended up finishing it in one sitting. With that said, running, or maybe a shortening of the story to make it more succinct would have been good. But the story is still great. \n\nThe other is that I wish there was a log of what was said somewhere. This game allows skipping dialogue (one click writes out the whole two lines of text if you are a fast reader.) When you click twice it skips it. With a game of this much text it's bound to happen once or twice. It would be nice to see what I missed.", "timestamp_created": 1629605026, "timestamp_updated": 1629605026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98001681": {"recommendationid": "98001681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198444464419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1629583655}, "language": "english", "review": "finished the game in one sitting. very emotional and would totally recommend", "timestamp_created": 1629584352, "timestamp_updated": 1629584352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97977998": {"recommendationid": "97977998", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972296911", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1629551661}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was just so much fun.

There were far less laugh out loud moments, which is a bit of a shame, but that doesn't take away my investment\n\nOverall, though, it's a great game.

Much of it can be attributed to Colin's ambiguous wish of a \"fulfilling life.\" Without a clear goal, Eva and Neil were aimlessly wandering around and were simply moving along just to progress the plot. I was hoping the story would focus on his regrets, but instead, it pivoted completely, culminating in a relatively neutral-feeling ending, with a decent message and a \"meh\" conclusion.\n\nStill, the method of story-telling was quite cool, as it mimicked the style of Christopher Nolan's short film Memento, jumping back and forth between the beginning and end of the timeline, such that we finish at the middle. I thoroughly enjoyed how it wasn't just a simple reverse chronological path back to Colin's childhood.\n\nFurthermore, the plot twists and action do spice up the story and do make the game entertaining, though not to the heights of its predecessor. I just wish the story took a different direction and took out some of the hocus-pocus pieces (some of which felt like filler / \"trying too hard\" to me).\n\nIn the end, it's still a worthwhile play, but this isn't a game I'd be dying to recommend to others or a game that I'd ponder over for hours after playing.

There's some grid-based puzzles each time you unlock an item, but they aren't too difficult.

Playing To the Moon first will make you understand the context that appears several times in the dialogue in this game. But if you only have Finding Paradise in your library, it's not a big problem. It doesn't reduce the fun you will feel when playing this game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494317987\nFinding Paradise, if I compare it with To the Moon, gives a more relevant impression to its players. It tells about the feelings of leaving the sweetness of youth days and growing into someone more mature and realistic in life. It also touches a bit about schizophrenia, but I can't cover that aspect for those of you who may have the same situation because it's beyond my capabilities. But if I have to generalize, then I'm taking it on par with the other things that are part of growing up (this is from a non-depth point of view, okay). Finding Paradise also tells about the feeling of emptiness that happens to someone who may look fine from the outside. Even though someone's lives seem comfortable and prosperous, it doesn't mean that his lives are already perfect. Well, sometimes there are times when we are alone and think only about ourselves and realize that there are things that have personal value and are difficult to be shared with loved ones around us. We don't mean to give less appreciation to those who always support and are always there for us, but it is undeniable that it becomes a puzzle piece that doesn't fit with the others.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494314298\nI highly recommend Finding Paradise to anyone who admires RPG with poignant stories. You should also give it a try if you like light games that you might finish in one sitting. This game actually will not only make you touched by its story, but it will also entertain you with its silly and sometimes annoying jokes. There are also some fun mini-games in it!

If you want a story that might start out slow, but build to make a grown man go through wide range of emotions to a climax that will break anyone. This is basically one man\u2019s vision and while niche he\u2019s got the skill to make what most people in video games can\u2019t, a compelling story focused on characters we care about.\n\n [h1]More in depth: [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]WITHOUT SPOILING THE STORY, which is the whole game, this review will be hard. It centers on a man, who we go through his life just like their previous games. To the Moon focused on the regrets of not going to the Moon by not becoming an astronaut, because of emotional reasons and stuff, to not spoil that game. \n\n    [*]Finding Paradise focuses even more on a wider cast of people, like his parents, two women and his own family that is not clich\u00e9 like you would expect. The  core focus is on two relationships and what friendship, passion and happiness means even if you\u2019re actually happy with your life and don\u2019t have any regrets, IT\u2019S A WEIRD THING, TO BE HAPPY AND NOT AT THE SAME TIME, this game does it right unlike me describing it.\n\n    [*]The GAME IS PLAYED ONLY FOR THE STORY which has the classic you can just watch someone else \u201cplay\u201d it and watch and it will be the same experience, but it\u2019s up to whether you want to save money and able to skip the short gameplay stuff or get someone else to watch it with, like a movie. I wish I had someone to do that with. While it DOES HAVE SOME PUZZLES when dealing with activating memories, it\u2019s either go to some objects that then starts this little matching mini-game that I feel was put in to make sure it has \u201cgameplay\u201d which people like me would criticize for not being a game. But the game is played for the story and doesn\u2019t need artificial gameplay to justify anything, these are not hard but could easily be removed and improve the pacing.\n\n    [*] The STORY DEALS with loneliness, what meaningful friendships mean, expectations of one self and loved ones that hit really close to home to me and might be why I loved it so much. The humor is charming enough at times that even though there are some misses, you\u2019ll move on and enjoy the next one, you can tell this guy loves making pop culture references as there are a lot of those in here.\n\n   [*] Their previous titles live in this universe and don\u2019t need to play to enjoy, but it gives callbacks and further expands the world and some characters.  I didn\u2019t play A Bird\u2019s Story and it has some potential big payoffs if you played it, but it doesn\u2019t affect this one, as the story is self-contained, it just gives those that invest heavily into this \u201cfranchise\u201d more reasons to love and care which I just loved the scene with the paper planes notes back and forth on the balconies, and almost all the flashbacks which is basically the whole game, lol\n [/list]\n\n[b]PAID: $3 [/b]\n[b]COMPLETED IN: 5 hours[/b]\n \n[h1]Games similar I recommend: [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/206440]To the Moon[/url]\n    [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/388880]Oxenfree[/url]\n    [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/501300]What Remains of Edith Finch[/url]\n    [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/368340]Crosscode[/url]\n    [*] [url= https://steamcommunity.com/id/calibrojosh/recommended/225080]A Tale of Two Sons[/url]\n     [/list]\t\n[h1]Games looking to try next:[/h1]\n    [*]Imposter Factory\n    [*]Eastward\n    [*] The Red Strings Club\n    [*]Disco Elysium\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1622987173, "timestamp_updated": 1622987173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556127011775970459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93295241": {"recommendationid": "93295241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043614806", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1622984554}, "language": "english", "review": "The game keeps many of the gameplay and musical elements from the first game, but brings a new story and concepts to think about.\n\nThe story is extraordinaraly good, the music is even better.

I was further placed off guard by the charming humor and back and forth between characters.  It lulled me into a false sense of security as I drank in every aspect of the game and the story.  I followed along, enraptured by the events on screen,  trying to silently connect the dots and anticipating what the major emotional bombshell in the game would be.  The game kind of fooled me for a bit.  There were a few moments when some interactions between characters moistened my eyes.  Not a cry... not a sob... not enough for a tear... but MOIST.  I thought that was it.  I HAD WON!  The game had not bested me.  \n\nSince none of you know me... I feel I should elaborate a bit on this now.  Just so you understand... I am a crier.  I cry ALOT!  Sometimes for things that aren't even sad!  If it really touches me in a way I will cry.  Tears will flow.  There's no stopping it... the dams break and the water is unstoppable.  To the moon?  CRY.  SOMA?  CRY.    Subnautica?  CRY.  The Witcher 3?  CRY.  Dark Souls?  CRY (But only because I was mad). \n\nI think you get it.  I cry.  \n\nSo... I was feeling triumphant over the game.  I thought it was over and I HAD WON.  Then the shoe dropped and the game revealed its hand.  I knew it was happening too!  Without spoilers, there was a scene we had seen so many times before that suddenly clicked with me and took on a brand new meaning... and I cried.  \n\nBut, I didn't just cry.  Oh no.  There was no mercy here for me.  The game put its foot on my neck and proclaimed victory as I sobbed... SOBBED.  I'm talking Ugly cry.  I'm talking... inconsolable.  My throat hurt, clenched from my emotions and me desperately trying to reign them in... but there was no helping me.  My face seemed to leak from everywhere.  Days after I finished this game... I still carried the emotion and sadness.  I watched some lets plays as well and cried all over... EVEN THOUGH I KNEW  WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.   \n\nAnyways... the game is great and I am so thankful I got to experience it.\n\n10/10, would (and have) cry again.", "timestamp_created": 1622568873, "timestamp_updated": 1622568873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92937301": {"recommendationid": "92937301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091433569", "num_games_owned": 741, "num_reviews": 505, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 518, "last_played": 1622468442}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this game I can only echo what some reviews say and thats - Thanks you,  thank you for this wonderful game, stellar OST. i wrote a review for A Bird Tale and I said I was laughing and crying at the same time, this game is much longer but at times it made me cry and laugh at the same time and I can't think of any other game that moved me so deep.\nFor me Kan Gao is one of the best composers, great talent and I hope to hear more music from him.\n100 times thank you for this piece of paradise.", "timestamp_created": 1622472834, "timestamp_updated": 1622472834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92910278": {"recommendationid": "92910278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285465073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1622238484}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game with deep and complex plot", "timestamp_created": 1622433465, "timestamp_updated": 1622433465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92906756": {"recommendationid": "92906756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409211406", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 479, "last_played": 1622427569}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy bonito.

Faye's purpose made sense, keeping Colin company and helping him figure out what he wants in life, supporting him when his parents were absent etc, but the story felt a bit slow. I felt like Colin could have been more fleshed out at times, since there was such a focus on his flying yet we don't see as much depth into him or Sofia (whereas with \"To The Moon\", I felt like there was depth shown in BOTH characters equally). I liked how Neil had reservations about things and was wanting to do more than just stick to the contract, that showed his progression of character, that he cared and made an effort, though I was expecting some revelation about him taking the pills, possibly affecting his job or something. There were a lot of great moments with Neil in this game, \"This hookshot is the hookshot that will pierce the heavens!\" and \"QUIT PUSHING ME OFF EDGES, EVA!\"), and quite a few throwbacks to the first game. I think one of the strengths was the music; it felt more varied while still keeping a theme song, but adapting that theme into many scenes without it feeling stale or overused. The \"mini battles\" were a fun addition to the game and not what I was expecting, but felt a bit too drawn out in terms of finding Eva, traversing through the memories again, and facing Faye yet again. I wished we could have seen more of Colin and Sophia together (at least we got the montage at the end), but I appreciated that it wasn't a case of an unhappy or problematic marriage, or that there were any cheap revelations that undermined Colin's love for his family. \n\nAnother thing I really liked with \"Finding Paradise\" was that, despite the familiar dialogue between Neil and Eva and the banter, it didn't feel like a repeat of \"To The Moon\". Johnny and Colin had different lives. Johnny underwent trauma and grief while Colin lived mostly an ordinary life, just dealing with loneliness, especially at home. While I would say \"To The Moon\" excelled in story and I was more invested and found the characters to be far more memorable, \"Finding Paradise\" touched on a philosophical level of acceptance in terms of one's life and death. Colin sought fulfillment, yet it took him awhile to realize he already had it. He had to understand that it's okay to have regrets and at the end of it all, he wouldn't trade any of it in. That's a great reflection on our humanity. \n\nOverall, the story was not as powerful or as compelling as the first game in my opinion, but it was still a solid and worthwhile experience.", "timestamp_created": 1619625389, "timestamp_updated": 1619625493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91060272": {"recommendationid": "91060272", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999714386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 321, "last_played": 1619718983}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game, and a nice story.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD.

I would wait until the game goes on sale for a few dollars because it's not worth $10 to me. The gameplay doesn't offer anything unique that you can't get from just watching a playthrough on YouTube. It's literally point-click, walking around and solving very basic puzzles. The game doesn't even offer any achievements to extend playtime. There is only one achievement, which is awarded upon game completion.\n\nThe gameplay is very linear. You don't really make any choices that matter, which is unfortunate.

The art is pretty cute, but it isn't the strongest point in my opinion. The game tells you a story about an old man seeking one final chance to overcome his regrets and live his \"dream\", which Sigmund Corp can always provide as it is their job. They send the two heroes, Neil and Dr. Eva. You will take a trip inside Colin's memories, reviving his life as best he recalls and fulfill his final wish.\n\nWhile the game doesn't give much liberty or choices, the story it tells will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions. Keep in mind this game is half emotional/half comedy and I laughed more than I thought I would. The game didn't bring me to tears, but I felt a connection and was emotive throughout the second-half of the game.\n\nEither way, I recommend Finding Paradise, it is a great game.

That will allow the player to further appreciate the characters and the references to the previous games much more. There is negligible 'gameplay' differences between the games, as the game has very simple controls bar just a few scenes that need a bit more dexterity (but are very doable).\n\nThis game for most, would be a single playthrough game, and personally, just like the previous game, it was very worth it. The linear story is presented and told beautifully, whilst still managing to inject humor and mystery without feeling forced. This is a story which will resonate differently to different people, but would be enriching none-the-less.

Whether it is as good as To The Moon is subjective, but otherwise it's a must play for people who really care about beautiful stories.\n\n[i]Positives[/i]\n[list]\n[*] There's nothing much to say about this game when it comes to positives, in a good way. It's entire focus is on story and boy does it deliver. A beautiful journey through the life of a man who has regrets that he doesn't want to change, a family he doesn't want to leave while still feeling like something is missing. No matter your age the story is relatable and there are so many quotes and moments that just really speak to you. As far as story heavy games go, Freebird Games has never disappointed.\n[/list]\n[i]Negatives[/i]\n[list]\n[*]There negatives do not at all detract from the story but are still easily noticeable unfortunately. Movement speed is still way too slow, the game has zero options (options menu wise I mean, because there is no options menu, playing in windowed mode on anything higher than 1920x1080 will make you squint and probably go blind, the puzzles are still not fun (although they are better than To The Moon's sliding puzzles) and there is nothing unique or innovative about it's structure as a game. You can tell the only reason to make this story into a game is to get the player involved in the actions and decisions so the story hits heavy and not for any reasons related to gameplay itself.\n[/list]\n\nEXTRA: When I finished To The Moon, I was about 22. I cried like a little girl. It was easily one of the best stories I had ever read. I did not cry for Finding Paradise. I did tear up at the very end, but did not cry. Whether this is due to me not finding the story as unique (not that I can even remember the details of To The Moon anymore) or I have gotten older and more apathetic i'm not sure. I'm 28 as of writing this. I still cry watching sad anime moments, but rarely cry at TV shows. I still cry watching video game characters I know and love go through emotional or physical turmoil. I don't particularly care what happens to characters in TV shows.

This game is a direct sequel to both To the Moon and A Bird Story, which by the way makes me rethink my view that A Bird Story is a bad game. I would say I recommend it solely for the purpose of enhancing your experience with Finding Paradise. So, let us go for it.\n\n[h1] Story/Characters: 10/10 [/h1]\n\nAs in To the Moon, the story is simply well written and well delivered. Another touching, sentimental master piece. Do note that the aspects of both games are entirely different, as the goals of the dying character are entirely different. Fortunately, it delivers an equally good story.\n\nMinor spoilers below:\nColin is a human being. He lived, basically, the best of his life. He married, had a son, lived his dream of being an airplane pilot. He fulfilled almost everything one could wish for in life. But he still feels some void. He still has some empty space on his heart, that he does not understand, and, as his dying wish, he wants to fill that void. But there's a catch: he wants that without any changes to his life, because, as I said, he loved his life. He loved his wife, his kid, his job. He didn't want to lose any of that. So, how to make someone that doesn't feel completely satisfied... feel satisfied without changing anything?\n\nWe find out what is the void, and we find out a way, or at least we hope so, to fill it. And in the meantime, as usual, we learn a little bit more about life, about feelings, about insecurities, about everything human. This is the beauty of this game.\n\nAlso, [b]it has Rudog[/b].\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] Gameplay: 8/10 [/h1]\n\nSame as To the Moon. Fairly simple object-finding scenes and puzzles. As in to the moon, the gameplay is not a way to deliver a challenger, rather, it is a way to deliver the story. In a game where story is the key element, the challenges being easy enough that they don't break the immersion or make you frustrated is, in my opinion, the best thing you can do.\n\nThe reason it's not a 10/10 is simply because gameplay isn't the focus of the game, so you can't say it has an incredible gameplay when, being fair, there is so little of it, even though it serves its purpose perfectly.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] Visual Art: 9/10 [/h1]\n\nKan Gao actually managed to improve some details from To the Moon. The scenery are so beautiful, the character design is charming, the color choices are perfect. The game is simply truly beautiful.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] Soundtrack: 10/10 [/h1]\n\nOh well, another masterpiece from Kan Gao and Laura Shigihara. Wish my Life Away is one of my favorite video games music, along many other works from Shigi.

After Bird Story, which cranked everything tedious up to 11, I was really worried about the direction of the series. But, I was quite pleased with Finding Paradise, which returns to an excellent story and course corrects on the gameplay mechanics. \n\nThere are fewer opportunities to uselessly sidetrack, and several of the options for doing so have a bit of extra optional dialogue that removes the feeling of wasting time by walking down the wrong path. The game makes some incremental progress in the varying the light gameplay that pads out story scenes: for instance, while you still solve quick puzzles before jumping between life scenes, the puzzle mechanics develop throughout the game, mildly reducing the repetition of the scene - puzzle - scene loop. It's not groundbreaking, but a nice iterative improvement.\n\nThe most annoying remaining scrap of tedium is your incredibly slow walk speed. Charitably, it's perhaps intended to control the game's pacing, but any benefits of that aren't worth the wasted time. Cynically, it could be meant to pad out the game's playtime for sales purposes. Regardless of why, it ought to be significantly increased so the player can focus on the story, rather than walking down long hallways (of which, at least there are fewer in this chapter). There's a point at the end of the game where, after you've viewed each memory, you're allowed to return to them; the walk speed is approximately doubled in these retreaded scenes, and that ought to be the walk speed for the entire game.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the iterative improvements, and the story is well written to continue what's been great about the series so far.

Although I do not write too many reviews or even serious ones, I feel I need to write it for this game specifically. It is a decent game but there are too many problems for me with this game to like it. \n\n[h2]What I liked[/h2]\n\n[list]\n    [*] I liked the soundtrack. The \"scale theme\" is easily one of my favorite pieces in gaming actually, which was a real surprise for me\n    [*] Great pixel art graphics. If you like pixel art, then this is a beautiful game.\n    [*] Story is all right but not my taste. It had some fun moments, but mostly disappointing for me. I will explain below why, if you are interested. It did set me to think about life a bit, so I can give that some credit, but not more than this. \n[/list]\n\nSadly, that is all she wrote on the positive side imo.\n\n[h2]What I disliked[/h2]\n\n[list]\n    [*] The gameplay feels old, and not in a good way. I feel this games goes back 20 years or more in terms of gameplay. This is definitely not necessary. I think pokemon emerald had much smoother gameplay than Finding Paradise for instance. It is so weird to control. Tried different methods but all were really bad imo. I get that the game does not have to play as fast as emerald, but you can implement a system like in Enter the Gungeon where you walk anywhere you like. That would fit the game much better. \n    [*] Why does this game have puzzles? Like for real, I found this relatively boring most of the time. It slows down the flow of the story imo and is also not necessary. I think the game is better without them, which includes searching for [spoiler] Memory shards/orbs of Colin's life and perparing the new memories. [/spoiler]\n    [*] It was made in 2017/2018 and there is still no options menu? For real? I could not find anything in game. Searching the internet for any options is not the way to go. This should be in every game by default, no matter if you are an indie studio or not.\n    [*] The hitboxes in this game are also not great. Clicking on certain objects will accidentilly move the character somewhere else. Really dissappointing, since this is imo immersion breaking. \n    [*] What is the use of inventory? There is a character menu, ok. There is an inventory menu, ok. There is a notes menu, ok. But then the developers actually do not do anything with this? I like the notes menu if you have not played a while or you want to examine things more closely, but the rest is obsolete based on my playthrough. This is also true for the character switching mechanic, which was implemented in the first 15 minutes or so and then never used again. Why? \n    [*] I feel the game sets you up to make some decisions during the game, but in the end have no influence on the actual ending. Like why? Why even give the player choice when there is nothing that makes the player's decisions influence the game. It feels as if the develoopers had some great ideas, but did not execute them or forgot about them. The only decision I liked was at the beginning (see next item in list) and that was it.\n    [*] Some elements of the story are truly immersion breaking. I think this may be the signature of the developers, but I was not a fan of it. For instance [spoiler] Going KameHameHA or suddenly spawning a certain suit of armor out of nowhwere. [/spoiler] Like, why? I did like some moments, like [spoiler] the guy kicking the girl's doll into the pool was funny and relatable.[/spoiler] but there were too few of them imo, especially near the end of the game.\n    [*] Overall, it was a beautiful story, but there are too many elements in them that I cannot relate to or do not understand still. For instance, (Ending spoiler!) [spoiler] the imaginary friend Faye part was so strange to me. And her first going haywire and then calming again, going haywire and eventually becoming a\"good\" character? What was that all about? [/spoiler]. Moreover, they did try to get the theme of death, regrets and carpe diem across, showing various scenes from the past, but never capitalised on this further. For instance,  [spoiler] He regrets throwing over a lemon juice/coffee or something. But there is no amending this regret of the sort? [/spoiler]. Maybe I expect too much from this game, but I feel they truly set you up to make some important decisions while this is not the case at all. Also, I am not a fan of the theme regrets and themes similar to this, but that is my personal opinion.\n[/list]\n\nIn short, I found the story a mess, the gameplay extremely clunky, the puzzles boring, parts of the story extremely immersion breaking and the false feeling of making impactful decisions, with a few techincal issues on the side.

If you haven't played To The Moon and it's two free DLC mini-episodes yet I'd suggest getting that first as while Finding Paradise is a good standalone story you will miss out on some context from the previous entry.", "timestamp_created": 1607314534, "timestamp_updated": 1607314534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81727662": {"recommendationid": "81727662", "author": {"steamid": "76561199069958136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1607264401}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as To The Moon but still a well written story.", "timestamp_created": 1607264596, "timestamp_updated": 1607264596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81660809": {"recommendationid": "81660809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049008396", "num_games_owned": 1372, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1607174178}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego incre\u00edble, secuela de To The Moon, que al igual que su predecesor es capaz de emocionarte.

There are no real puzzles or gameplay, and you can play the game entirely with your mouse only. The creators had a story and moral they wanted to present, and they did it well, but this genre of game is REALLY only for people who are okay with walking simulators.\n\nThere are very, very tiny portions in the very end that involve minigames, but these felt extremely out of place and were there for comedy, so I'll ignore them entirely in this. \n\nI picked this game up in a Humble Subscription, saw some of my steam friends played it and loved it, saw all the comments saying they cried and found the story deeply impacting..... I had high expectations going into this, and to be honest, I was incredibly underwhelmed throughout most of the game. \n\nThe concept of this world---being able to die and have scientists recreate your memories for you in your final moments, filling any wish you had---is amazing, I love that *concept*. But the overall protagonist here wasn't relatable at all to me, a wealthy boomer who traveled the world as a pilot, met his wife very early on, and was adored by the people in his retirement building..... A guy with a fulfilled life, who still complained that it could have been better, and who's wish was just that: Keep my memories the same but make them better. \n\nI found him unlikable for the majority of the story, and I found the pacing of the story to be very slow and tedious. In certain portions, the characters move very fast but these portions happen rarely. For the most part, you move at a snail's crawl, and the gameplay is the exact same in every \"memory\". You walk around, listen to the story progression, get memory orbs for listening, and move on to the next section. That's it for the entire game. I can also safely say that the \"plot twist\" was extremely predictable and something I had confirmed myself early on in the game. I couldn't even play this game in one sitting because the story dragged on for so long, and I didn't feel pulled in at any point, so these short hours were done over the course of three days. \n\nHowever, I know this review sounds like it should be a thumbs down, and perhaps if I never completed it I would have. But it's that damn plot twist---even though it was cliche, even though I saw it coming, even though I was completely annoyed and done with the game by then--- it still brought tears to my eyes. For what it's worth, the plot twist makes the game, and its presentation and dialogue for that section is outstanding. The patient becomes likable and very human in those moments, and I found myself--- someone who wasted my entire life daydreaming-- actually relating to him. \n\nI wish the entire game had been handled in the way those scenes were, but I understand the creator wanted it to hit hard and to pace the emotion of it. Because of those sections, and genuinely ONLY because of those sections, I can that yes, this game is worth getting. I can only recommend it in bundles or on sale though, 10$ for this type of game would be a ripoff.", "timestamp_created": 1606425660, "timestamp_updated": 1606425660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80349671": {"recommendationid": "80349671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129133996", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1583947640}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game and story <3", "timestamp_created": 1606405665, "timestamp_updated": 1606405665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80117416": {"recommendationid": "80117416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119684293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 113, "last_played": 1606365240}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buenardo", "timestamp_created": 1606365410, "timestamp_updated": 1606365410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80053188": {"recommendationid": "80053188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394724977", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 415, "last_played": 1576473912}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es de mis juegos favoritos, ya quiero que salga la tercera parte, lo recomiendo mucho :3", "timestamp_created": 1606352091, "timestamp_updated": 1606352091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79784255": {"recommendationid": "79784255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076479022", "num_games_owned": 1085, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1558342886}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous game.", "timestamp_created": 1606275001, "timestamp_updated": 1606275001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79783952": {"recommendationid": "79783952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129113524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1606273408}, "language": "english", "review": "Another gem from Freebird Games. Although A Bird Story is not as good a game as this, I strongly recommend you play that first before starting Finding Paradise, which follows on from it and makes the whole story that much more effective. If you've played To the Moon, this game is very similar to it mechanically - you still take control of two scientists entering a dying man's mind to fulfil his last wish, you still search each memory to find \"mementos\" that link his memories together, and there are still some little minigames you play which activate these objects. But the story is a completely new one and focuses on something a lot more grounded in reality I suppose than wanting to go to the Moon. Here your patient's last wish is something a lot of us can relate to, and the reasons for it tug at your emotions that much more as a result. Any of us who have had regrets in our lives and wished for just that small something to be different will understand. There's not much more to be said than this without spoiling it really.

The review score is at a very impressive 97%, with thousands of people giving their opinion. I figured it would be particularly poignant, either pulling at my heart strings or leaving me something to ponder for a while. As I got into FP though, it didn't really deliver for me. Since the story was a significant part of my issue with FP, I will emphasize that throughout the review there will be spoilers about the story.  \n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nThough FP is an RPG maker game, there's no RPG elements such as combat or leveling up. FP is essentially an interactive story, with the gameplay consisting of exploring areas, talking with other characters, and advancing the story. However, the story doesn't advance in a sequential or linear fashion, as you zip back and forth through the dying man's life. I'd contend the game works reasonably well in framing each area you play through and showing the main figures involved. It's almost always clear what you need to do in each section, and you can usually predict what items in the vicinity will have significance.  \n\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nI found FP's story to be strange, confusing, and pathetic. You play as a male and female duo working for a company that taps into terminal peoples' minds to fulfill their pre-death fantasies. In this case, you're trying to do this for an older gentleman who keeps stone-walling about what his wish is, saying he doesn't want any changes made to his life, which would defeat the entire point of getting them involved.   \n\nThe primary source of regret he has is when he said goodbye to his imaginary friend, spurred on by him getting married and not having time for that anymore. This is beyond bizarre, and hardly seems like a loss, compared to family and friends dying, trauma, etc. As you explore his mind, you see moments in his life he felt some remorse or disappointment in, yet they're so paltry I rolled my eyes at how charmed a life he led. The worst he ever seemed to have it is when he was a lonely kid, but there were no indications he was being bullied or had neglectful, unloving parents. If that's his life at its worst, I'll have what he's having. \n\nWhat makes no sense to me is that if he misses his imaginary friend so much, there's nothing prohibiting him from bringing her back. It's his imagination, it's all in his own mind! He's not feeble-minded and senile, so what's stopping him from playing pretend with himself like he used to? He's upsetting his wife with the implication he regrets how his life turned out, all for the sake of a pretend pal? She doesn't believe him when he says how much he loves his family, as his actions speak far louder than his words. \u201cHey, I love my family with all my heart, I have no regrets... but here's thousands of dollars, grant me one final wish before I die, when I could be spending this time with them instead. Here's the important part. Don't change a thing.\u201d The protagonists read between the lines, why wouldn't his family?\n\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nThe graphics in FP come from RPG Maker, but they do a serviceable job for a game of this nature, as they put effort into adjusting lighting and using different visual effects for punch. For instance, the developers make good use out of the premise that you're inside a person's memories, as things don't always have to follow the rules of physics or reality. In some situations I feel like they back out of this prematurely, like when you change the doctor's avatars.  \n\n\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1] \nThere's several tracks that play throughout FP, and I really enjoyed the different instrumental music that was composed for the game. The sound effects used were stock RPG maker noises, but again they served their purpose, so I had no problem with that. \n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\ud83c\udf1f The introductory clip shows the main characters avoiding a squirrel on the road, almost wrecking the car as they barely dodge vehicles carrying hazardous materials. Over the top moments like these show one part of the writing I liked, which was the comedy.  \n\ud83c\udf1f Not every character shines, but many of them had strong, interesting personalities. For instance, the two characters you control, as well as Roxanne.  \n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\u274c The inclusion of the \u201cmini-game\u201d battles against the antagonist didn't work well. They included more than one forced loss, which just wasted time. It wasn't funny, interesting, or engaging, just a distraction.  \n\u274c Throughout most of FP, the movement speed of the characters is slow, which doesn't really fit this mindset that they're on a tight time limit. It's only in the late game that you start jogging around.  \n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] \nAt a certain point, I stopped being interested in the story, and simply wanted to get it over with. I think it's because going through a dying man's memories should be significant and potentially painful. Even though he denied any significant regrets, for him to be going through with this, we'd encounter something momentous that occurred. Maybe he was wise enough that he didn't want to blotch out sorrowful moments he experienced, but we'd see them all the same. However, there were never any devastating losses or heart-rending events he went through. At worst, they were goofy or clumsy fumbles in what could have been moments where he looked more cool or eloquent (and in some ways, this may have given him an awkward charm or likability).  \n\nAs someone who's lived in the real world, I can't relate to a guy who's gotten everything one could want out of life (satisfying life-long career, good health, and a loving family), and this is the worst he's ever had it. When I started to realize there wasn't going to be a pay-off to this game, the entire story became a farce to me, and I had no empathy for this nut job who had an imaginary friend far beyond the point it made any sense for him to.    \n\nBased on the \u201cwoe is me nature\u201d of this story, trying to make waterworks out of a situation where I only shrug my shoulders apathetically, I don't want to play other games in this series to see where the underlying story goes. It's a shame too, because the sense of humor did mesh with my own, and I jived with the characters alright, but I want to engage with stories that have gravity to them. A game that handled this much better, with largely similar gameplay, was Rakuen, of which the music alone is enough to be emotionally stirring. This is because the game's story addresses legitimate loss and grief. I don't recommend FP, because I don't want to sniffle as someone plays the world's smallest violin over non-issues, and I don't see why others would want to either.  \n\n[url=https://saveorquit.com/][quote]Visit Save or Quit for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1604115360, "timestamp_updated": 1608656652, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680764853954315186", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78433168": {"recommendationid": "78433168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068581349", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 310, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1604105015}, "language": "english", "review": "The music and story are OUTSTANDING !!!

To The Moon was very explicit, even in the title, about the patient\u2019s final wish, but in Finding Paradise, Colin\u2019s final wish isn\u2019t immediately clear and creates this sense of mystery throughout the whole plot of the game as you try to unravel just what about his life he could want to change. It\u2019s fantastic.\n\nThe music. Kan is so fucking good. I think Kan\u2019s music is what makes Freebird\u2019s games so amazing. The writing is fantastic, but his music really makes his games feel like something truly special. The standout tracks for me were [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_TGTDcZe3s]Time is a Place (Piano Version)[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLkouR1Njgg&list=OLAK5uy_lqVvwS5_ct_n7HJfvxNl2_tDKf1fhCYgg&index=54]Faye\u2019s Theme (Piano Version)[/url].\n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to his next game, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1182620/Impostor_Factory/]Impostor Factory[/url]. Although, I do have to say, I wished something other than RPG Maker was used. I\u2019m not a developer, so I can\u2019t say how RPG Maker is compared to something like Unity, but I just hate the resolution being limited to a 4:3 640x480, and I hate that the Steam overlay doesn\u2019t work with RPG Maker games. Those are just minor peeves of mine. Regardless, Kan has definitely earned an \u201cinsta-buy\u201d from me for any future Freebird titles.

I HIGHLY recommend you play To The Moon (and maybe A Bird Story) first before you jump into Finding Paradise. In To The Moon, they explain a lot of background about how things generally work in this universe. I would argue that Finding Paradise is meant for those that have already played To The Moon because Finding Paradise makes a lot of blatant AND subtle references to the prequel. The characters jumped straight into the action a bit faster since it's built of the knowledge that the player probably already knows about how the world works. Highly recommend you play that 1st. (As for A Bird's Story, it's more of a short segment, and while there is a few references to that, I don't think it's as important as To The Moon. You could probably skip that if you really wanted to).\n\nAnyway, I do personally believe Finding Paradise is great in terms of keeping up with the lore from the previous title. It also improves on a few things! The artwork was phenomenal, and the animations were never boring to look at. The dialogue was still witty, and clever in certain areas. The music quality is still pretty good. \nNow, in all honesty, I believe To The Moon was a better game than Finding Paradise. The story in To The Moon was a lot more in-depth, and the music was perfect for every moment. In Finding Paradise, I believe it felt a bit short on the clever side. It was there, sure, but it wasn't nearly as in-depth as much as To The Moon. Most of the Notes you find in this game don't really add up to much. Meanwhile, in To The Moon, your Notes would constantly change as you discovered more and more. Here, they don't really do that... Another thing I want to talk about is the movements. In Finding Paradise, you are suuuuper slow in some segments where it really shouldn't be. At least when you were slow in To The Moon, the areas were a lot more confined and such. But in Finding Paradise, the areas tend to be bigger, and more open. It's a bit of a hassle sometimes. The music quality is still good like I mentioned above, but I still feel like the soundtrack for Finding Paradise doesn't amount to To The Moon. However, Finding Paradise is still a good sequel!\n\n2) On it's own Merit, Finding Paradise is excellent! There's some subtle hints and plot twists at unexpected segments. An entirely new concept arises, and is explored pretty thoughtfully. The main characters are perfect duos for the main player to play as, and the plot of the story is overall just...well thought-out. The game is still in the realm of \"book/visual novel that you manually make progress in\", so if that's not your thing, you probably won't like it. But still, it's definitely a pretty good in terms of story and cutscenes. It's still a thought-provoking experience and it's something I still believe everyone should try at least once in their lives.\n\n------\n\nOverall, I believe To The Moon was better than Finding Paradise, but Finding Paradise is still pretty darn good!

Gao]To the Moon was about seeking fantasy from reality, whereas Finding Paradise is about seeking reality from fantasy. Two sides of the same coin.[/quote]\n\n\nFinding Paradise is a very special and personal game for me. For about two years I have been putting it off for later. I regret this decision. Now I want to clear my memory to experience this magical game again. When I first saw the trailer of Finding Paradise I thought that they were gonna create a copy of To The Moon just to repeat it\u2019s success. I was wrong. I was completely wrong. Finding Paradise is a totally different story in the same setting. And it may not be clear at the first launch. \n\n\n[h2]TL;DR[/h2]\nIf you played and liked To The Moon, Finding Paradise is a good game for you. If it is your first game of the Freebirdgames series - it\u2019s OK. All their To The Moon games are a part of a big picture but they are completely standalone at the same time. \n\n[u]The text below may contain spoilers.[/u]\n\n\n\n[h2]To The Moon series template[/h2]\nFinding Paradise, as well as To The Moon, uses the same plot structure and methods.\n\nThere is the same 3 act structure: intro and first dive, some break out of the machine and secret disclosure, denouement and ending. It also shows you all main character life at the end through complication of his memories with Laura Shigihara song. There is a lot of self citing and self references. Also, some part of the soundtrack is just a cover or copy of the To The Moon soundtrack.\n\nYou may be confused for the first 30 minutes. Is this game just a washy copy of To The Moon? No. You are completely wrong. Some people were really confused because of this, and I am not exception. Also, the fact that the plot is slow-paced does not help at all. Sometimes you may need to be a little bit more patient with the game.\n\nAlthough the game uses the same template and cites a lot it\u2019s prequel doesn\u2019t mean unoriginality. Kan Gao repeats himself with the game structure but not with it\u2019s interior. Actually, the game is filled with a completely different mood and atmosphere than To The Moon.\n\n\n\n[h2]Spiral Plot[/h2]\nIn To The Moon you go through the story backwards but in Finding Paradise they follow spiral structure. You will jump from latest protagonist memory to earliest again and again, reaching some center, some important life changing moment.\n\nI found this idea very accurate for this story. You observe two parallel stories about the same man.  In To The Moon we were wondering, what are prerequisites of this time point, whilst in Finding Paradise we are trying to make a connecting between two time separated man conditions and guessing what is a crucial moment.\n\n\n\n[h2]Soundtrack and Atmosphere[/h2]\nI dare say that Kan Gao is a genius of video game music. He creates such heartbreaking songs even for common and trivial scenes that it makes you stop and listen for the end. Soundtrack is a core part of the To The Moon series and Finding Paradise is not an exception. It is still the strongest component of the game. It is a central part of the game atmosphere. Placing the right song in the right moment Kan Gao makes you immersed with the character's life. Do not be cheap and get OST with the game. It will make your life better.\n\n\n\n[h2]Ending and Message[/h2]\nAs the epigraph said, To The Moon was about hiding in illusions and fantasies. The protagonist was ready to rewrite his entire life. Finding paradise is vice versa. It raises an important topic of self acceptance. It is about overcoming the temptation and understanding of your true happiness. Finding Paradise demonstrates the importance of the ability to appreciate what you have and not trade it for anything. It is a very powerful message.\n\n\n\n[h2]P.S.:[/h2]\nI actually found there are a bunch of people that didn\u2019t get the ending. I was wondering could they not get it if it was noted in plain text in the game:\n[list]\n[*][spoiler]Colin explains it at one of the first meetings with him.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Faye explains it multiple times.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Niel explains it at the ending.[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Colin explains it again in the final balcony scene.[/spoiler]\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1599956118, "timestamp_updated": 1599956231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648014426231384277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75858102": {"recommendationid": "75858102", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992812937", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1599926877}, "language": "english", "review": "Fans of to the moon will also enjoy this", "timestamp_created": 1599926934, "timestamp_updated": 1599926934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75836408": {"recommendationid": "75836408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113634815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1599896832}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Decir \"emotivo\" es poco.

This time around the emotional story is equally balanced with ample easter eggs of countless references to popular games both past & present that you wonder where they all are coming from until the finale is unleashed concerning Sigmund's latest client, Colin, and his mysterious past with Faye. \n\n[i]Finding Paradise[/i] offers similar puzzles featured in [i]To the Moon[/i] where you manipulate rows & columns to 'match 3' to unlock the assigned memory item and, considering my playtime of [b]yikes[/b] 7-8 hours, you'd think the puzzles are challenging (well, they are as the game progresses hah!) but the reason my playtime is so high is due to a battle tribute to [u]Dr Watts[/u] obsession with games like [i]Dragon Ball Z[/i] so yeah... major fail!!!\n\nSooo...back to [i]Finding Paradise[/i] where, at the early stages of the game, I must admit to be being distraught at the direction it was taking with what appeared to be familiar territory of Dr Watts & Dr Rosalene journeying to a new client in order to fulfill their dying wishes; all good so far with keeping in tune to its predecessor yet I kept seeing emphasis on the humour and a slow build on the client, Colin and his journey.  I found the memories of Colin to be almost mirroring scenes from [i]To the Moon[/i] very early on but, to my relief, there were some unique sequences as the story transposes to Act II and it developed its own identity.\n\nOne scene that stood out for me was the aquarium setting because, considering Freebird Games make use of RPGMaker XP, they still attain highly detailed pixel graphics that make that event feel alive on your screen with its vibrant use of colours and animated sequences. I don't think I was the only one who enjoyed that particular part of the game.. a certain Dr seemed to appreciate its wonders too!!\nThere are ample animated scenes to portray the story giving it a cinematic vibe while also providing a brief respite between the puzzles and mysterious, slow-paced memory trail of Colin's past. This could frustrate some players who purely want to control the game at their pace yet patience is needed throughout the cut-scenes as they have a purpose to the story.\n\nThe controls are simple to adapt to even when Freebird Games provide on-screen reminders they are purely aesthetical as any player will be picking up the buttons with ease.  The menu is accessible anytime throughout the game allowing you to save at leisure in a header-tabbed screen that is manipulated with the arrow keys.  \nThe OST is perfectly set to elevate the tone of the story and the song finale sung by [i]Laura Shigihara[/i] entitled [b]wish my life away[/b] is very touching and emotional.  All subtle clues to Colin's back story with Faye.\n\nOverall, the journey throughout this game managed to deliver its feels alongside an intriguing twist all while ebbing us along with its superb humour & delicate emotional reveals.  The puzzles are a good mix of logic that aren't too difficult while the battles are all based upon timing and attack tactics.\nIf you previously played [b]To the Moon[/b] or [i]A Bird's Story[/i] and adored them you are guaranteed a memorable ride with [u]Finding Paradise[/u] too.\n\n~~~ Liked what you see?

This one was dangerously close [/h1]\n\nI\u2019ll say it before and I\u2019ll say it again: I love that I have decided to play all my Steam games in order. If I hadn\u2019t, I never would have played games like \u201cFinding Paradise\u201d. One look at this game is all it takes to make me roll my eyes given that it was made in RPG maker. I said it in one of my last reviews that whenever a game is made in RPG Maker, the best thing it can do to stand out is, ironically, not be an RPG. Not only is Finding Paradise not an RPG, but it\u2019s also [h3] one of the sweetest and most beautiful stories I have ever heard in a video game.[/h3] \n\n[h1] Making his last wish come true [/h1]\n\nThe game starts you off without a warning as Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene as they make their way to a retirement home. A man named Collin Reeds is at his deathbed and the two doctors are there to make his final wish come true. How do they do that? By jacking themselves into his memory using a machine and altering it so that he may experience things he had missed out on or forget his past mistakes that might haunt him. While it may sound strange, the company Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene work for has been around for a while and have served quite a few clients and this sort of request is nothing new to them. However, Collin is a special case. What makes him a special case is that Collin hasn\u2019t properly explained what his final wish was. He wished for the doctors to make him feel like he had lead a fulfilling life but without changing anything. What makes this thing even more interesting is the fact that Collin seems to have lead a very healthy and happy life. He used to be a pilot, money was never an issue, he married a wonderful woman, they were in love and they had a son, so what could Collin possible want to make his life more fulfilling? Well\u2026 if I told you that, I\u2019d be a real spoil-sport, wouldn\u2019t I? Let\u2019s just say\u2026 it\u2019s about a girl and NO, it's not what you are thinking.\n\n[h1] Collect memories, find mementos and figure things out [/h1]\n\nThe game is played as you switch between the two doctors who make their way through the memories of Collin. They usually walk around during his key memories and interact with things around him and listen through the dialogues he has with people from his past. These interactions create memories and upon collecting all of them, they need to bring them to a memento which they use to travel further. It\u2019s kind of like Assassin\u2019s Creed https://store.steampowered.com/app/15100/Assassins_Creed_Directors_Cut_Edition/ meets that movie \u201cThe Cell\u201d with Jennifer Lopez (anyone remember that one?).  \nUnder normal circumstances, the doctors should have been able to travel from Collin\u2019s most recent memory back to his less recent memories but, for some reason, they travel between Collin\u2019s oldest to newest memories. In one Memory they watch him being an old man while in another he is a child and what they really need is something that happened right in the middle of his life. \n\n[h1] A heart-warming story full of wonderful, relatable, tear-inducing and quirky moments [/h1]\n\nI\u2019ll just say it: Collin had an interesting life. You will get to experience things from his past like his most proud and his most embarrassing moments and they are all done really well. It\u2019s actually pretty amazing what the developer was able to do in just RPG maker. While normally, RPG maker characters are stiff and a bit lifeless, here characters have some unique animations and movements that make them seem more alive and real. It\u2019s still an RPG maker game, so don\u2019t expect to be blown away, but it\u2019s the liveliest one I\u2019ve ever seen. The two doctors that travel through Collin\u2019s memories are also a joy to play as. Dr. Rosalene is a very empathetic and loving person who likes to do things by the book and Dr. Watts is a nerdy scientist who tells terrible jokes and likes video games and anime a bit too much while also being a genius at his work. The two of them, while very different people, make a great team. They will often comment on the situation, making fun of the characters they meet, and just goof off sometimes. \n\n[h1] Not much gameplay but not too little either [/h1]\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that this is a very linear game. You do have some choices to make but they don't really make any differences. While most of the time you will only be walking and talking to characters and interacting with the environment, sometimes you will also get to play a few mini-games. In order to progress through each memory, you have to solve a very simple match 3(or more) puzzle game that usually lasts only a couple of seconds. A few times during the game, you will also get to play a simple mini game (a fighting game, space shooter and even an RPG) and again, these are over just as they begin. It\u2019s a nice change of pace when these occur and they never last long to distract you from the actual plot.\n\n[h1] Wait! There are more of these games? [/h1]\n\n I was actually blown away at the very end when I found out that this was actually the third game in the series because at no point did it seem like the game was a sequel. I\u2019m happy I\u2019ve got two previous games to look forward to. The first game seems to be To the Moon https://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/To_the_Moon/ and I am very much looking forward to playing this one sometime in the future.\n\n[h1] The music was amazing [/h1]\n\nThey really went the extra mile with the music in this game. The music, as well as all the little animations and effects, really made me feel all tingly inside. During key moments the game will just start playing lovely piano and cello melodies to really hammer in the emotions and they work wonders in enchanting the experience even more. There is even a full original song at the end.\n\n[h1] A nasty crash at the very end of the game [/h1]\n\nDuring the credits, just as I was waiting for the epilogue, the game, not only crashed, but exited Steam as well. At first, I thought it was one of those Undertale https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/ moments, where the game was toying with me but no, it was just a really nasty game crash. It only happened once so, it wasn\u2019t such a big deal. \n\n[h1] Who would have thought that I would love an RPG maker game so much [/h1]\n\nIt really goes to show how amazing video games can be. On one hand, you have these huge, graphically impressive games that, most of the time, make me yawn and then you\u2019ve got humble indie games like Finding Paradise that almost made me cry like a little child. Maybe I\u2019m just becoming a big ol\u2019 softy.\n\nEither way, while the price might be a little high for an RPG maker game and while the game is short enough for a single play session, I wholeheartedly recommend playing Paradise Lost. It was such a sweet story full of love and tenderness that I won\u2019t soon forget and I think you won\u2019t either if you give this wonderful game a chance.\n\nNext game:\nFluffy Horde\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/777880?snr=1_5_9__402\n\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group. I\u2019m trying to review every single game in my library.

It expands more on the characters that weren't really expanded in To The Moon pre-updates. I'm guessing Kan didn't add that much to the base TTM game because he probably didn't know if it would be that good, however, I am glad it was popular enough to start a series off of because it was a good game. This story is a lot more tear-jerking than the last one so be prepared for that because it hits you out of nowhere. The soundtrack is good but To The Moon had it better, I'm not saying Finding paradise's soundtrack was bad just that To the Moon' s is better. The reason I say Finding Paradise is better though is because it expands on the characters and Sigmund Corp. in general because the protagonists never really had any real lore behind them. They were just personalities with an end goal. In this game however, their stories are expanded, which I appreciate. The characters this time around are a lot more likeable  the characters in TTM weren't bad but some made decisions that you just couldn't agree with. My main gripe with this game though is the same as the last one, the plot points that were introduced in the TTM minisodes still aren't elaborated in this one. They are mentioned but you don't get any background on why it exists it's just....there. It's like waving a carrot in your face, you want answers but you don't know if you'll ever get any. Overall, if you don't really care much for the expanded universe in the game then it's still worth it.

I have played it for 5 hours non-stop and I have finished roughly at 2am in absolute tears. Combined with the music that compliments the scenes, it becomes very emotional. You should definitely get this game, but be prepared with a box of tissues. You will find yourself thinking back to your own decisions you have made in life, asking yourself 'what-ifs'. This game gives you some life lessons through a beautiful story. It has taught me so much, I truly think you'll enjoy it.\n\n[spoiler] Like some reviews that I have seen on here, I too, have been going through something. Playing this game, in a way,  gives me a bit of closure. The eloquent story writing this game has, moved me. This game may not have the realistic graphics like most games now a days, but do not let that put you off. \n\n For those that do not know, (I'll try my best to explain since I did find it confusing at first) you play as two doctors, Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene, who work at Sigmund Corporation, a company that helps to 'fulfil one's dying wishes' by altering their memories through a machine. Despite living a happy life, the dying wish of Colin is to have lived the best life he could (like most of us want to do). However he also mentions not to drastically alter his memories, which is quite contradicting, since how would you better your life without changing it much?\n\nAs the player/ reader, we can relate to Colin's situation. No matter how happy we are, we always think of the 'what-ifs' of decisions that could possibly making our lives better. We have our regrets when we think back to the actions we make and we really do ask ourselves 'did I make the right choice?' 'would it have been better if i did this?'.\n\n The game offers a solution to the 'is the grass greener?' thought.  In the end, one of the doctors realises that Colin really did live the most fulfilling life he ever could, however the only thing that was stopping him from feeling like he did, was the thought of a machine that could make it better. The answer was to remove the memory of him ever finding out about the Sigmund corporation and the machine, and therefore he would have lived his life happily without any doubts. Rather than the doctors doing this, they entrust this decision with Colin's imaginary friend Faye (Colin created her out of loneliness), who at first seems to be the antagonist, only because she felt threatened that she would be wiped from Colin's memories. \n\nThe specific interaction between Faye and Colin during the time she decides to leave him is will give you tears (there will be more though).  Like Colin we have to accept that as we get older, we have to let go of our imaginations and let reality kick in so we can be taken seriously and live life how it is (similarly Faye lets go of Colin which he accepts, because she explains that he will be laughed at if people found out he had an imaginary friend and also the fact that they had drifted apart since reality had made him busy). \n\nThe bittersweet farewell between Faye and Colin as an old man, where they face each other on the balcony, is probably the most touching scene. Colin acknowledges his many regrets, but is still happy with the life he has. One of Colin's major regrets though, is that he wished he could see Faye again. He finally got his wish, therefore he could die peacefully.   We may live our lives as happy as we can, however, regrets really can't be avoided. We should be grateful for what we have, and try not to linger on 'what-ifs'. Also just wanted to ask, did you guys reveal to Asher or Sofia about Faye when we thought she was his childhood sweetheart? I said no to give him privacy. [/spoiler]\n\nThis game has given me the answers I have needed. Hopefully it will help you too, whoever is reading this.

Regret being the topic, it surely touches everyone. The game is very much the same quality in crafting and meaningfulness as To the Moon was. If you loved To the Moon as I did, you\u2019ll surely like Finding Paradise. I\u2019ll admit a tear or two rolled down my cheek while playing, especially in the [spoiler]hospital scene\u2026[/spoiler] That is quite unique coming from a video game, and to be able to do that twice in a row is a statement of narrative expertise. I\u2019ll gladly buy any game these guys conjure up next.\n\nOn the downside, gameplay (and the \u201cinteractivity\u201d of the story) is very linear, almost nonexistent, although I could see that in adding the minigames, they tried. You\u2019ll feel you are taking a ride in a rollercoaster, instead of driving your own car. This results in not very active gameplay, and I can see this frustrating the active type of players. The story\u2019s format is still hugely better than visual novels, which are not my cup of tea. I did have some technical issues with the game as well, most importantly chat dialogs where choices could be made, did not always appear and I had to choose blindly. I\u2019ll also admit I\u2019m not a big fan of the graphics, but as the story progresses you completely forget them as the story becomes the pearl of the game.\n\nAs in To the Moon, the soundtrack of Finding Paradise is marvelous, although not quite as mesmerizing. I did not enjoy the theme song with sung lyrics, and I feel bad about it, but the song felt too childish.

I played To The Moon years ago and i can't remember if i gave it a good or bad review, but i do remember thinking at the time that it was a pretty unique gaming experience despite the tedious fetch quest mechanics and weirdly shoehorned console gaming jokes. The bad news is that in the years since, loads more excellent \"crying games\" have come out - RPG Maker games like this one, VNs, walking sims, narrative adventures... so a straight-up sequel isn't going to feel as unique.\n\nThe best thing about this game for me is it picks up a thread from A Bird Story, which is by far my favorite game from this developer and the only one that i would still recommend playing today. The unfortunate thing is that Finding Paradise takes A Bird Story and then undermines it by twisting the message into some kind of moralistic teaching on how people should live their adult lives. I am being deliberately vague so as not to spoil a key plot point, but I can say from about halfway through Act 1 it's clear what the Act 2 reveal is going to be, and pretty much all of Act 3 is the opposite of how i had hoped it would've been dealt with.\n\nOne ray of light comes in the after credits scene, which teases a move into a potentially more sinister story line. Normally i am not a fan of edgy spin-offs, but in this case it might be just the twist the series needs to make it feel fresh again. I dunno, perhaps my heart just got colder.

It is without question one of my favouite stories in videogames and even holds it's own when comparing it to my favorite films. Finding Paradise didn't quite make it to the levels of To the Moon for me, but honestly the bar is set so incredibly high that saying that doesn't mean much. While To The Moon has an overall tighter story and is in my opinion better on a literal level, Finding Paradise feels like it holds more of a meaningful message overall, and (I'm trying to keep it vague to avoid spoilers) is more impactful in some areas because of its relatability.\n\n That being said there was a bit of filler here, although I enjoyed the novelty of some of the minigames, I think I would have preferred a more straightforward experience, as especially on repeat playthroughs I can see myself growing tired of them. If you enjoyed the first game even just a little though, I still think Finding Paradise is more than worth the $10 asking price, and I'll continue to buy anything that Kan Gao and Freebird Games comes out with in the future.
