"language": "english", "review": "[h1]This game definitely belongs in this world![/h1]\nIt's very easy to pick up and play due to its very simple controls. You can only move; all attacks are automatic so you don't need to learn a bunch of button combinations to understand how they work. Yet there's a lot of depth behind the simplicity, which mainly comes down to which combination of weapons you use and how you build your character as you go. Each weapon has a different form of attack but you may not necessarily get to select the ones you want as the selections you get on level up are random so you can't just repeat the exact same build over and over.\n\nYou also get that adrenaline rush every time you play - there are satisfying visual effects every time you level up and open a chest that are very similar to what you'll find in casinos and paid loot boxes in other games. The main difference is that opening chests in this game is free and a reward for slaying more powerful monsters, not by paying-to-win. It's designed to be addictive, but without being predatory.\n\nAfter every run, you can use the gold you earn to purchase unlocked characters as well as powerups which are permanent and apply to all characters. This allows the game to have some form of progression structure despite having to rebuild your character from scratch every single time. Even if you're having a hard time early on, purchasing powerups should make future runs a little bit easier.\n\nFor this game's asking price, it's dirt cheap for what it has to offer. There are tons of unlockable characters and extra stages to play beyond the 5 main stages. All achievements actually unlock extra content so they serve much more of a purpose than just intrinsic value. The only extra paid content is the soundtrack which is also worth a listen to and two DLC packs which add even more extra maps, characters and weapons, both of which are also dirt cheap and well worth the asking price.", "timestamp_created": 1700782517, "timestamp_updated": 1700782517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151443077": {"recommendationid": "151443077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364583166", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 439, "playtime_at_review": 3566, "last_played": 1700789178}, "language": "english", "review": "mmm", "timestamp_created": 1700782457, "timestamp_updated": 1700782457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151442472": {"recommendationid": "151442472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127880235", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 297, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1700783713}, "language": "english", "review": "Good fun", "timestamp_created": 1700782148, "timestamp_updated": 1700782148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151441570": {"recommendationid": "151441570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027547845", "num_games_owned": 1089, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1534, "last_played": 1700782871}, "language": "spanish", "review": "This game is a freaking drug.

The dollar to hours enjoyment ratio for VS really can't be overstated. \n\nI was here from the very beginning of the games release and I can definitely tell you that while this game was awesome even at launch, it looks wildly different now compared to back then.  \n\nHats off to the OG. \n", "timestamp_created": 1700692612, "timestamp_updated": 1700692612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151181212": {"recommendationid": "151181212", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967151616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1288, "last_played": 1690942576}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to pass time.", "timestamp_created": 1700692404, "timestamp_updated": 1700692404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151180316": {"recommendationid": "151180316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041079844", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1104, "playtime_at_review": 1126, "last_played": 1700772410}, "language": "english", "review": "amazingly fun. could lose hours... have lost hours playing.", "timestamp_created": 1700692139, "timestamp_updated": 1700692139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151179933": {"recommendationid": "151179933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023747640", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 211, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1700691978}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1700692024, "timestamp_updated": 1700692024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151178947": {"recommendationid": "151178947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963426636", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 6749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1506, "playtime_at_review": 6476, "last_played": 1700770802}, "language": "english", "review": "There was a time when everyone was playing this game.\nMost of them would tell you it was like crack, and they just couldn't put the game down.\nWhile others high production costs games existed, somehow, this little game had hooked players worldwide, and they just couldn't put it down. I just looked at that phenomenon with some distance, not really caring about it. I had, at the time, others things to do.\n\nI saw the game run, it seemed funny, and the amount of absurd power a character could attain amused me enough to check the store page. Game was cheap, so I told myself, why not, right?\n\nJumping in, it was a constant pleasure. First steps are a bit rough, but it takes about 10 hours pretty much go from \"Oh god oh god I'm swarmed!\" to being an absolute monster. And then it only becomes more crazy. The game is quite easy to break on your knee, but it doesn't means it is exactly easy to achieve, or mindless either. And it many way, it's a good thing, as this game is a big power fantasy where you go from one character throwing a few projectile to some kind of pixeled abomination throwing so many effects on the screen it's almost impossible to get a good grasp of what's happening, but you assume things are dying everywhere.\n\nThe game doesn't take itself seriously at all, everything is humorous, from the items, to what they do, to the monsters and their bestiary descriptions. The soundtrack is full of great pieces that keep your blood pumping as you go around murdering enemies with a kinder surprise powered up by a spinach.\n\nTo make things even better, the game receive new content, both free and paying DLCs, making coming back to it a pleasure just to discover new content... And absolutely brutalise it in few hours flat, because you're an absolute brute piloting a caterpillar powered by an addiction for Faberge eggs.\n\nMake no mistake, if you wonder why this game has so many clones, it's because it is THE game that came out of nowhere, and was full of greatness the players almost universally loved. This is where it all began, and while it will be imitated, it will probably never be equalled. Many will try to jump on the bandwagon to try to get the Vampire Survivor money, but they will never be able to claim the merit to be original.\n\nCheap, with a lot of content and more added to it, funny, enjoyable and well designed.

You go into the game thinking it's going to be low effort, low reward, low entertainment... but it hooks you with the reward cycle. You feel low powered, but then you get a power up or figure out how to tackle your previous time and keep going. Or you get major hits of serotonin when you collect a ton of XP gems or get an \"epic\" chest of 5 items. It's all really simple sounding, but it hooks you in until you can't stop.\n\nOne thing that really impresses upon me is the humorous descriptors and lore behind the game. I don't know how long it's going to take, but surely one day I'll find that vampire!\n\nThere are more updates coming to the game constantly, and the most recent one added a new map, enemies, weapons, a character, and relic.

the bottom\n\nVampire Survivors is a rising indie game it seems and from recommendation from my brother, I decided to pick it up.\n\nVampire Survivors is addicting, blind dumb fun, and simple to play. I mean, it was a mobile game first so I'd be surprised if it was complex. It also boasts a variety of gameplay choices, branching upgrades, loadouts, character stats, and more. Most of this you can kinda ignore if you want, but those who want to gun for something specific or want to build the best or funnest build they can think of will truly find it fun.\n\nIt's kind've a roguelike-light. It's a great game for those who want to try rogue-likes but find the branching paths, hidden bosses, difficulty, and more of games like Hades, Enter the Gungeon, and of course The Biding of Isaac too daunting or intimidating. This game is also a rarity in this day and age. Especially for a mobile game, where you buy the game and enjoy it. No ads, no in-game purchases, just play the game. There is DLC if you want more content and to support the creator(s) more like me, but they're totally not necessary.\n\nThe gameplay is addicting and while can get tiring during the longer runs when you're completely unstoppable since all the attacking is auto and really you just control your walking and the menus, it still can be fun to watch the pixels do the thing and your brain chemicals go brrr. When you want to just unwind and watch literal tens of thousands of monsters die easily, this is a fun pick up and play game.\n\nIt's not a 10/10 since I don't come back to it regularly and already 10 hours in has already kind've exhausted most of its replay value for me. But those 5-7 hours before it started getting boring? Some good stuff. And hey, it's only $5. In the age of games costing 14x that price and giving almost none of the fun, why not pick it up?\n\nTL;DR Don't expect deep gameplay from Vampire Survivors. It's a good pickup and play game when you just want to see things die and feel powerful. Pay $5, get a dopamine vending machine with no price on the drinks.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1700354818, "timestamp_updated": 1700354818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150393788": {"recommendationid": "150393788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965907968", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3629, "last_played": 1693089859}, "language": "english", "review": "At first, i wasnt too sure of how i liked the game, however, little by little i understood it, i loved it, i craved it and spent a long time, playing it everyday to get all \"vanilla\" achivements, and because it is a fun experience!

The simplicity of the game and the awesome feeling the game feels by playing it are the main two contributing factors to this success, which is why this is an easy recommend to someone looking for an addicting game to dig their claws into.\n\nInstead of being able to attack enemies directly, your character will do automatic attacks with abilities and it's up to you to line some attacks up correctly while collecting gems from enemies in order to level up, unlocking new abilities and making current ones stronger. Each level is a half hour of gameplay but this absolutely flies by, as your builds can start to decimate enemies. Fully leveled up weapons can \"evolve\" in specific combinations making you reach godly levels by the end of just this 30 minute session. I've had fun doing all sorts of different builds to see which evolutions worked best together over time, and still just scratched the surface with all sorts of content and secrets this game is hiding.\n\nThe game has so many secrets, maps, and characters that promote different playstyles that approaching this from a casual viewpoint I had a lot of fun.

There are lots of this \"single stick bullet hell\" games coming out now, but the visual design (inspired from a slot machine) makes it feel incredibly satisfying and very timesink-y. You will want to play over and over and over again, win or lose!\n\nUnlike many other comments, I do have some really minor problems with the game, mostly that some characters and weapons are hilariously unbalanced and better than others. Not even talking about [spoiler] Queen Sigma [/spoiler] (who is kind of designed around that point), but even \"midgame\" characters like P[spoiler] ugnala [/spoiler], who have insane damage output both for the early and late game, and thus effectively will always have \"better runs\". Not really a \"devs nerf this\" thing, but it can be discouraging for those who want to focus primarily on one character if that character has to reset runs more frequently due to rougher starts.\n\nI also think that, while it's their mostly as an easier way to [spoiler] kill the reaper at the end of the run and unlock Red Death, the Infinite Scaling weapons (Infinite Corridor and Crimson Shroud) just kind of nullify some of the fun challenge the game has normally. Perfectly fine thing to have, I would just encourage everyone to try challenges and not use it once to see how you can handle the reaper.

However after watching some YT vids I found it interesting. I am really too sleepy for a full review but see that 16 hours of game play? Yeah that has been in one sitting after purchase. It is fun and addicting.\n\nSo I am new to these types of games. I think the genre is called Horde Survival or Reverse Bullet Hell (which I definitely do not like). So you acquire weapons and spells and such and have to fend off Tens of thousands of monsters that get progressively more difficult. There are flashes and effects on the screen constantly so if you are sensitive to these things be warned.\n\nNow one thing needs be mentioned. It is an AUTO-BATTLER. You need not worry about hotkeys for certain attacks etc. You are only need move around. Sounds boring right? Well it is not. It gives the feel of the old Arcade some of us used to spend hours in and rolls of quarters... \n\nStandard fare in a type of rouge-lite...bosses, chest, unlocks, further characters to unlock, buffs to purchase with in-game coin. NO MICRO TRANSACTIONS. (The bane of all modern day gaming, with POE being the exception)\n\nIt is just fun. Not too hard and is very fun to combine different spells and weapons and them to special status. Special status comes from combining, you know the drill.\n\n3 days of owning the game now 32 hours play time and not NEARLY through with all the content.\n\nIMO this game is really for everybody. Perhaps serious RPG players or competetive gamers will not like it much. But I think anyone would be pressed to say it is a bad game.\n\nAll that being said, this was my first game in the genre and have already bought Halls of Torment.

What i'm saying is the game's very cheesy and knows it, particularly in what lore it does have (like how no one's found a bloody vampire yet despite the title of the game) and the secrets, they are something alright.\n\nIn the context of games similar to it existing, it's got a rather significant advantage beyond grandfather perk, polish. Haven't played many other games like this one but apparently readability tends to be comically bad at times in regular play, that only happens here if you've done something and broke the game in half (likely yet again), on top of that it can handle a lot more before stressing out the pc than the others i have played.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Or maybe not, as it can be summarized with pure absolute spite. Like taking a bite out of a spicy meal that you hate the the feeling of, yet you keep eating it. The flavor is oddly soothing in the middle of the agonizing pain you feel throughout your body, but you keep eating it. You can't let it defeat you. You're better than that. You're the one who will survive, as no true vampire would ever admit defeat to a meal. Through pure spite and agony, you will emerge victorious... That's how this game feels.\n\nBecause admittedly, I don't truly like these \"walk around to look cool\" games or \"Bullet Heavens\" as they're often called. It's neat to be on the other side and be the one spitting bullets everywhere, but I feel like playing it is a bit pointless; all you're doing is walking around and watching stuff die around you. Occasionally clicking to pick a new power or a fancy hat, which is neat, but not very engaging. I hardly have to think about anything except walking and pain. Yet I kept coming back; it was just a thing to do a lot of the time.\n\nSo as you can expect, the gameplay itself is pretty simple. Characters have unique starting items, or weird effects, and you kill stuff to level up, getting a new item every level or upgrading an existing item to a pre-set max. The interesting part comes in having two, or more, items that compliment each other. Once a weapon is maxed and you have the affiliated attachment for it, you can find a box by punching a larger than usual monster, by walking around them of course, and then having a chance to get a super item from said box.\n\nTo keep with the food comparison, it's like ordering a steak and making sure to order the proper side-dish, most likely potato based, and in doing so the chef is impressed and upgrades your original steak to a steak that now shoots flavor right into your mouth. Like a machine gun. It's nice, far more effective, and you skip that slow eating phase. All thanks to ordering the proper potatoes.\n\nNow the downside of this system is that you better have the menu either memorized or stapled to the back of your hand, because there's a large variety of combos you can order in this game and some are just obscure. Like you can't order just one bird to snack on, you need /two/ birds at max quality or they won't fuse together to create the Apostle Chicken with butter sprinkled on top, y'know? And if you want to fuse your guns together, you have to read the book on how to properly cook them and re-alive yourself in order to get the guns to fuse together into /four guns/ that shoot /lasers/ - And no, I'm not exaggerating. \n\nBut I'm also getting away from the point of a review; the overall theme of the game is walking around, upgrading stuff, using unique items, and eventually exploring the land while shooting more stuff to find even more secret items. Most of which are listed on the front door of this game's secrets menu, but most I either had to look up, or stumbled upon myself. Some were neat, some were 'eh', and some unlocked ways to literally kill death itself. Which is neat the first time, but kind of a chore otherwise. At least you get cool golden eggs to add to your list of snacks.\n\nOverall, I find this game to actually be kinda boring to me, yet I'm still saying \"Yes, you should get this game.\" Why? Because I've gotten every achievement there is to get. I refused to give up on this spicy meal until it was totally finished. I worked to get every unlock, every achievement, I even maxed out every little bonus thing you could because why not? It was snack time; I was hungry for something to do, so I did something. And you know what these chef devs said to me? \"Neat. You're clearly still hungry, so here's more.\"\n\nThey added more achievements. They added another layer to the meal that I wasn't ready for... and they've done this three times now. So why do I keep coming back? Spite. Pure, unapologetic spite. I won't be defeated... and I don't think any of you should either. So snag this game and eat it. Survive. If I could do it, you can do it too.

Especially for someone like me who always feels like i need something to fiddle with or work towards while i'm listening to audio based content. The game is a very simple format which while you think would get boring and repetitive, it never manages to stop squeezing the dopamine from your brain as each run starts with you being able to do almost nothing to being a walking machine of sheer death and destruction.
