Lest you think I\u2019m just some casual hater, let me assure you that I [i]adored[/i] Two Point Hospital. The easy listening soundtrack, distinctive graphical style and awful dad jokes were a great combination. I spent hundreds of hours as the world\u2019s weirdest hospital administrator and I loved it.\n\nTwo Point Campus still brings these great qualities, but the change in theme absolutely [i]destroys[/i] the fun. A hospital is a fast-paced environment - people pay per treatment, and sometimes they die in the corridors, or you run out of money, or your nurses all quit. Healthcare is dramatic! A campus, by contrast, is sedate\u2026calm\u2026and dull.\n\nWhere TPH makes you react, TPC doesn\u2019t really care what you do. You can\u2019t mess up your economy, what with staff wages being so low and course fees being a yearly charge. High achieving students happen more or less automatically, and it\u2019s hard to design yourself into a corner. It\u2019s almost impossible to lose, which sucks the fun out of it. During a semester, the game plays itself. Yawn!\n\nEven if you're more of a builder and don\u2019t care so much about gameplay, you\u2019ll probably find the design of TPC a step backwards. TPH has strange exotic diseases like plagues that would pixelate or dancing fevers. TPC offers cooking courses where students dress like chefs, and robotics courses where students do \u2018the robot\u2019. It\u2019s less creative and less interesting. The same blandness shows up in the classrooms, the university clubs and the entertainment options.\n\nInteresting management systems were stripped away. The pacing was butchered. The personality and immersion factors were toned down significantly. It\u2019s sad, but Two Point Campus is a shallow imitation of its predecessor, a vessel to flog DLC rather than a fully-realized project.

Some items have color wheels but not all and the amount of items is horrendous as well- yes let me just put the same four posters in every bedroom while I try to up the level/prestige of the room. Also it would be better if the sheets on the beds just randomized because I'm not going to one-by-one change the sheets.\nI also wish you could mass select rooms and set them to what you want instead of having to manually change every room type as far male/female/all, student/staff/all, and then specific educations instead of default just being everything selected. \nIt is a shame, I really enjoy the game and how goofy it is but for a game about making your own campus there are not a lot of options or efficient methods.\nEven the modding community is not impressive.\n\nI do like the game overall, I just wish the options for customizing/building weren't so repetitive because I get bored after so many hours.

This game is definitely different from Hospital but it was just as enjoyable for me. I liked that it was possible to change the building layout and to construct our own buildings. It's been a constant annoyance in the Hospital game that you'd get an odd layout and have to fit very large rooms into it. I also liked that there weren't many \"busy tasks\" like the vaccination/outbreak in the Hospital games. I'm on the last level (without DLC) and so far there was only one similar event. I also enjoyed the radio and funny announcements, similar to Hospital game.\n\nOn a not so minus side, there is some missed potential. I'd like to have more interaction with the students and to see them use the items placed around the campus. Otherwise I'd create a very nice area outside but for unknown reason, it never gets used. It's also a bit annoying that the students want many different kiosks and each requires an assistant but for most part it just stands there and barely gets used. The rooms are also overall more expensive and larger than in the Hospital game. And you have to meet certain requirements just to progress to the next year. I had to take loans very frequently in this game.\n\nOverall I found this game fun and worth the discounted price I paid (MSRP is a bit too much IMHO for what you get).", "timestamp_created": 1693624390, "timestamp_updated": 1693624390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145483367": {"recommendationid": "145483367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094305334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8905, "last_played": 1697988726}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Demasido divertido, demasiadas horas de risas....", "timestamp_created": 1693608103, "timestamp_updated": 1693608103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145472500": {"recommendationid": "145472500", "author": {"steamid": "76561199224216018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1693736133}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever!!!", "timestamp_created": 1693594864, "timestamp_updated": 1693594864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145445339": {"recommendationid": "145445339", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014218108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1695031965}, "language": "english", "review": "cool BEANS", "timestamp_created": 1693571893, "timestamp_updated": 1693571893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145444196": {"recommendationid": "145444196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352982372", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1698758624}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game Im hooked on this and two point hospital I love the different dlcs and the way you can decorate outdoors too very fun", "timestamp_created": 1693570740, "timestamp_updated": 1693570740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145424051": {"recommendationid": "145424051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173109401", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4746, "last_played": 1695708506}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like this game.

Finish the base game, come back in a few years and buy a whole bunch of DLC for a few bucks and get basically as much new content as the base game had. Fine business model by me. Not too greedy and yet profitable for the developers. Win-Win. I prefer this approach to the constant early access titles that plague this genre, where you're playing unfinished games and getting essential and quality of life features drip-fed over months/years. Two Point Studios release fully featured very well polished games, which are only getting more content post-release.

I also bought it on sale as well, so that factors into my value for money / enjoyment. \n\nAs you can imagine, you are in charge of starting and building a school to produce quality students and also money for you, which you can then use to further improve the place either through staff training, better equipment for your classrooms or decorations to make the place look more pleasing to the eye.  I struggle and continue to struggle on getting the attractiveness of the place up, especially when it rains frogs or there's some other kind of natural disaster so it would be good to have the ability to turn this feature off, along with the temperature moderation which means you have to put radiators or A/C units all over the place, which is a bit of a chore.\n\nOne of the things I do like is that you're not pigeonholed into how you set up your school.  Yes, there are some campuses where you need to meet certain requirements in a specific subject, but that doesn't mean you have to solely focus on that subject.

First off, I appreciate that this game runs natively on a Mac, as I mostly game on console, but this is one genre I don't like to play on a game pad.\n\nI felt that the game did a great job of remaining engaging and having genuinely new challenges for each campus. The early game was always a lot of fun, trying to get your campus in working order, with so many things to think about and plan around. It's really like a game of The Sims where you have 100 sims at once. Each student and staff member operates entirely on their own agendas to meet their needs and act out on their unique traits, and you have to set things up to help them succeed, rather than micromanage.\n\nI'm especially impressed with how the game schedules classes and staff tasks for you, so you never have to worry about monotonous details, you just need to provide the facilities. It will simply let you know when you need to build another room to keep the proper schedule, but you never need to even understand WHY you need the rooms if you don't care to look deeper into it. Janitors will always find work to do without you needing to touch them. You can manually assign them to something, but you could easily complete the game without having to direct them. \n\nYou may be thinking that if the game is too automated, surely you won't have enough to do, but that's not true at all. I rarely got to stop providing rooms and items for my students. Arranging my rooms, expanding, tweaking positions of things, adding new things when students were having problems. There are so many avenues you could experience problems in with your campus just on a basic level that all of those finer automated details feel really good rather than taking anything away from the experience.\n\nI had read that the game wasn't challenging enough, but it can be if you want to engage with the challenge modes, or you get deeper into the campaign or DLCs. The final campus of the medical school DLC is extremely tough. Still, even as the game may be a little below average in difficulty, it always feels utterly engaging and satisfying to get your campus running smoothly.\n\nThere are some things that get excessively tedious if you wish to 3 star campuses. If it asks you to raise your attractiveness rating, prepare to place hundreds of posters, rugs, and endless other things to meet that requirement. I understand why this is a thing. They give you all those kinds of things to make your campus look nice, so you should use them, right? I just wish there were some way to automate some of that. I don't personally care about decorating my campus to the degree that it wants, so why not a button to just automatically slap posters and stuff on the walls of a room for me? Maybe it's something they can do in another version. Not a game breaking issue, and for this genre of game, it's really not worse than what the competition has you do at times.", "timestamp_created": 1692945759, "timestamp_updated": 1693002005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806630134582519531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144916141": {"recommendationid": "144916141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000921687", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 667, "last_played": 1676165442}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lo he podido probar y me ha encantado.

So, as expected, if I compare it with Two Point Hospital, the graphic is nice, the animation is great, and it is clearly that a lot of thing have been added. The new mechanic that I like it the ability to freely expand or create new building as you wish, including the ability to place thing outdoor.\n\nAlthough, there is a lot of variation of education type for you to choose, such as cooking, science, engineering, sports, etc. but most of them feel the same, the only different is the art style of room for each class. And one of the most annoying thing for me is student request. Why? let's say you are building a cool medieval theme school with a lot of wood and iron things for your chivalry and wizardly class. And then your student ask for a pink hearth shape bench, which break all the theme you try to create.\n\nAnd, I think this game is quiet easy, probably too easy. The fact that I finish every school with 3 stars under 100 hours, compare to Two Point Hospital which I spend almost 200 hours, prove that this game is a lot easy than the hospital one.\n\nStill, I like the game, and it does give me a happy time while playing, I guess that is all the matter to give this game a thumb up.", "timestamp_created": 1692546815, "timestamp_updated": 1692546815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144621290": {"recommendationid": "144621290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074286254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 776, "last_played": 1695423999}, "language": "english", "review": "required words", "timestamp_created": 1692515198, "timestamp_updated": 1692515198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144592592": {"recommendationid": "144592592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036906890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2847, "last_played": 1677701547}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun game that has interesting variations", "timestamp_created": 1692477935, "timestamp_updated": 1692477935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144576987": {"recommendationid": "144576987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275551989", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 68, "playtime_at_review": 1537, "last_played": 1699826024}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the kind of business simulator I've been searching for for years!

Often, many of the same rooms: like the doctor room (aka school nurse), or the \"pastoral room\" aka counselor room. \n\nOtherwise, you just spam posters and make sure the temp is right and you will get a good score. The hardest part is making sure to unlock the right objects, which is really kind of a false gate.

However! For the most part, you won't really be looking at the characters all that closely, and the gameplay absolutely makes up for the people models.\n\nThis game, so far as I've played, is extremely well-balanced, has a lot of variety to offer, and is really rewarding. There are plenty of ways to play imperfectly which leads to a bigger success the second time around when you really know what you're doing.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy and find really balanced is the reward system. You have to unlock new items with a special currency that's given as an achievement and goal reward. This helps really stagger out the new items and keep things interesting many hours into the game. Plus, the achievements and awards come fairly regularly with consistent play. I never feel like the game is truly stagnating until I've really overstayed my welcome on a particular map.\n\nThe game is very forgiving about money. You get the same price back when selling things, which makes decorating fun and stress free. The rooms can be picked up and moved around, meaning very low stress when a new game first begins and you need to throw down some stuff to get going but don't necessarily want it all to stay where you put it. Additionally, rooms can be copied. So, if you don't enjoy decorating rooms over and over again, this makes adding more rooms quick and painless.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game is that it has a lot of minor bugs and jankiness when editing rooms. However, I don't find the bugs are aggravating enough to outweigh the really cool quality of life features in the building functionality.\n\nThe bugs/jankiness are:\n\n- You can't set anything down where it would block other items, even if you're paused and in editing mode. This can be really annoying if you're working in a tight space and need to rearrange some things. You end up having to sell one or two items instead of just shuffling them around. However, since you sell them for the same price as you buy them, this isn't really a big deal - just annoying.\n\n- You can't remove a block of room space if the door is on it, even if you're in edit mode. However, you can add a block of space where a door is. When you add a block, it simply leaves the door where it is and says it's no longer a valid position for it. Then you move it to the wall of the new block. I really wish it did the same for removing a block, because this can end up having really, really obnoxious consequences.\n\n- When removing some blocks of space from a room's overall size, I regularly have the bug that all of my windows will become invalid for no reason. So when I save the room, it asks me if I want to sell all invalid items. There's no way around this but to let it sell them and then to replace them.\n\n- When building along the property border, you aren't able to put windows into the wall spaces attached to the corners. I think this has to do with the curve in the property line corners. It's annoying but not really that big of a deal in most cases.\n\n- Some items are not allowed in some rooms that they should really be allowed in. For example, the herb garden box is available for the hallway and bedrooms but not in the kitchen classrooms where they would be most functionally useful. You also can't put rugs in student union rooms, even though you can in student and teacher lounges, nor can you put couches in libraries. I find all of these to be a bit of a bummer in terms of interior design.\n\nAll of the bugs and jankiness are in this vein of severity.\n\nHowever, on the flip-side, you can also do things like hold control to place on a tighter grid, rotate items normally on cardinal directions into diagonal positions, and really customize a space. So, if you're like me and find building design to be a huge part of your playing experience, it can be extremely fun.

Add a variance of animations for the npc's and make the game more alive than it is. The biggest problem with the game is not the gameplay.

There are some QoL updates and reworks that add an interesting twist. Game also feels way more casual than a first one, once you get through initial hurdles of setting everything up it \"just works\" and requires almost no attention, which is not necessarily a bad thing, just something to keep in mind. \n\nCompared to TPH, it feels very incomplete and basic, which I hope will be resolved by future updates and DLCs, and considering the treatment TPH got, I have high hopes this will be resolved. Current price tag is kinda too steep for the amount and type of content that's currently in the game. \n\nSecond big issue is Denuvo malware, which was not removed even though the game is almost 1 year old. Considering lack of any features actually requiring online connection to play the game this is even more annoying, as the game currently cannot be played without internet connection. \n\nI hope these issues will be addressed and I hope I can buy the game and change the review to positive soon.", "timestamp_created": 1690878897, "timestamp_updated": 1690878897, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143186664": {"recommendationid": "143186664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847766590", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1690869505}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun sandbox game for those who like to balance resource management and keeping track of your staff.

Albeit being my favorite genre (playing it since 1990s: theme hospital, theme park, simcity, TT, TTD, etc) and generally I enjoyed this game, but it's lack of polish and sometimes makes me sooo frustrating - hence thumb down. I have a list of 20 bugs/complaints that I've discovered throughout my session, some - with screenshots (although steam doesn't let me upload them because game is not connected to my account anymore). Mostly they are about placing objects, constructing rooms and stuff like that, which is a crucial part of game. Some minor complaints are about irresponsive or just not friendly interface.\n\nLets' go:\n\n1. With opened visualization layer (for example - temperature) Esc button press should close that layout instead of showing menu. And only when there is no layers visible - Esc button press should show menu.\n2. Bugs with placing objects closely inside room (with ctrl button), and then moving room to some other place, and suddenly game shows that those objects cannot stand as they used to (\"Fix invalid items\" message appears, can provide screenshot).\n3. When editing room and adding new item. There is a behavior that prevents objects to get inside room - objects follow cursor, and cursor is in corridor, object is there, but when I place cursor over room, object still stays in corridor unless I move cursor further to the room. That sometimes frustrates me when I selected an object that I want to add to room from menu, then I'm pointing directly at place where I want to place an object, but I see that object is still outside the room. So I have to move mouse a little bit inside that room (make frustrating \"GET OVER HERE\" move), and only then I'd be able to place an object. Instead of this you should let objects easily get inside edited room (if room is edited = disable behavior \"sticky to places that are not that room\")\n4. Sometimes struggling with selecting objects that stands close to walls when editing room (dormitory and PC desk)\n5. Would like to disable drag with RMB but I see no such option.\n6. Prefer that RMB to cancel replace action instead of selling item (sold too much stuff instead of canceling replacing it)\n7. When adding new item to room or editing it - I don't know how to show grid of that room (as when building room from scratch). That grid would be useful sometimes\n8. I don't like behavior when middle mouse button is pressed and I'm making a horizontal move, and if I want a vertical move - I have to release middle button and press it again. I'd prefer to be able to change vertical pitch (vertical move) at the same time as camera rotation (horizontal move). I actually already able to do that with keys (Q/E)+(R/F), but not with mouse for some reason.\n9. Sometimes want to disable monthly income report (at least don't show that there is a new message in mail box). You already showing recipe anyway (right bottom corner) - it's enough for most cases. Although later I found out that I can RMB at the notification square, and its gone and number of inbox is not counted for that report, but report is still inside mail box if I need it later. But still I have to RMB once a month which is a little frustrating.\n[strike] 10. Button to skip current audio track would be useful [/strike](period)\n11. Unable to catch bookworm when building/editing room - is that suppose to be that way? So I should cancel construction and catch that devil? Or ignore it's existence, look at it as a missed opportunity? You're scratching my FOMO!\n12. Sometimes students are stuck in room where I replace (or placing new) items. Even if they have free spaces to go (i.e. items are deleted). Saving and loading helps.\n13. Sometimes not possible to place windows at walls that are touching corners\n14. Rooms numbering issue. I created and deleted some rooms of same type, renamed existing rooms with proper numbers like 1 and 2. But when I build next room of that type - it's number is not a next number but like 7 or 8 or something. I still have to figure out why I delete rooms so much, probably because it's not very convenient to handle rooms (I replace and resize them a lot, playing tetris with them, trying to fit them in building and then enlarge them when I need to place new (e.g. researched) stuff in them.\n15. When editing room I aim cursor at item in room (window or others) and it gets highlighted outline, but that doesn't happen for door! That's why it seems like I cannot select door (for example for moving it), but in reality I can click at the existing door even if it's not highlighted and then move it.\n16. Inconsistent behavior of the \"Knight Bench\" inside \"battle ground\" room - sometimes that bench hides fence of battle ground, dunno if that's how that suppose to be, can provide screenshots\n17. Sometimes when placing objects inside room (while aiming with dragged object to a particular place) game at first shows that it's possible to place an object here, but when I actually press LMB, I can see that I spent money on that object but at the same moment I got my money back, and now game tells me that it's not possible to place item here. Can provide screenshots\n18. When building new room which walls touches walls of other room, sometimes objects that hands on others room walls (on the opposite side of same wall basically) - they show red triangle as if they are not able to hang there anymore. But the problem is - I'm editing my new room and cannot replace objects inside old rooms, I can select them, but cannot place them at the wall of respected rooms, since I'm editing new room - I'm only able to place objects inside that new room (only that side of the wall is available for me). But I can replace those objects to different walls (that are not \"shared\" with my new room) of other rooms if there is enough space.  Screenshot is available\n19. At the summertime I repeatedly receive a message about teacher that is needed in the tuition room\n20. Impossible to connect two separate campus buildings\n21. At some point I've accumulated 3 requests to throw a parties, but it's less than one month left, so I cannot plan those which is a little frustrating, I have to manually come back to mail and plan those parties when new year (at August) will start.

Its looking quite flehed out for this kind of game, interface is ok, gfx nice. \nHowever like two point Hospital (which I own) could not catch up with the spirit of Theme Hospital - which is still recommend as reference, as it decently aged, but provides its unique charm, I miss a bit the unique humor in both of the 2-points althugh they tried. \nIt has nice \"jokes\"  like the desciptions and name sheme for the topics and a lot of objects to choose from, it still has a quite straightforward and linear gameplay which is repetitive rather quickly. Every level you have to build up everything from the scratch , even in another theme maybe - and this becomes boring fast. Aside from new topics and terms, the levels have little to offer. \n\nI didnt found any bugs or failures in execution, the game seems to work and does its job pretty fine. If you like building up and managment  on a not too challenging scale, this is a go. (very easy).\n\nIf you like those games and dont mind a bit aged graphics i can recomend Theme Hospital and still remind its very nice Intro video as well, its the \"mother\" of this genre in a humorous scene. More complex and more challanging kinds had been come up like a most recommended startopia. \nCompared to startopia , this lacks a lot of the possible evolution.

The game plays fluent and most bugs are resolved quickly (1-2 weeks) on Steam.\nAs per my opening line, the game is not as engaging as TP Hospital. Mainly because you tend to build during the Summer vacation period and when the break is over, you can more or less sit back, relax and watch everything in action. This is not bad, though you typically do not need to intervene when classes are going, apart from fulfilling wishes from students throughout the year (ie schedule a party or place a specific object somewhere). This can make a gameplay a bit boring from time to time, especially when you are after a specific star which requires you to go through multiple years.\nStill I recommend this game as it is packed with humor and looks, plays and feels great. Am sure we will get some more DLC in the next 1-2 years to keep the game fresh and entertaining.

Two Point Campus is a great sim with an engaging campaign, something I normally don't care about with these games. I'd also describe it as a good step up from Two Point Hospital. But, the game still gets a thumbs down do-not-recommend from me because as of this review, the game has an invisible, non-moddable hard-coded maximum attendance of 300.\n\nTo explain why this is a problem, first I need to explain the structure of the game. Two Point Campus is played in a series of campaign maps, each with three tiers of objectives (one, two, or three stars). Each tier completed earns rewards, and you need at least one star on each map to unlock the next maps in the campaign. So, the intended core gameplay loop is that you start a map, play until you get your first star, then leave and start the next map. Starting later maps earns you new unlocks and gameplay features, which you then take back with you into previous maps to earn the higher tier rewards.\n\nNow, early maps, you'll earn the first star in the first year or two of running the campus. By midgame, it takes four or five years in. I'd estimate each year represents 40 minutes or so of gameplay on average, to give an idea of how long that takes. And, in my experience, I was running into the population cap by the fourth year. This is because the game tallies up your current students, faculty, and even the next couple years' future student admittance, to proactively enforce the 300 pop limit.\n\nI reached a point in the campaign where I'm hitting the population limits with ease before I complete the first tier of objectives. I'm supposed to want to return to this map later, to complete the harder goals, but I know I can't expand or build more for the campus, so, what's the point? I've only bought a third of the land to build on and I'm already at the pop limit, so all that extra real estate on the map is a false promise; a waste of developer resources.\n\nThe amazing thing to me is, the 300 cap is the MAXIMUM the cap can be, and is based on your hardware. Meaning, on cheap laptops or low end machines like the switch version, the cap is low enough that I'd wonder how the game is even playable at all. Other competing games, from Parkitect and Planet Coaster to The Sims, have default limits that won't impact the game for dozens of real-world hours. Better, they include an option in settings to adjust the cap manually, and support mods which remove such shackles entirely, so that dedicated players who put hundreds of hours into a save can fully enjoy the game, and so they can future-proof it for new, better performing hardware. Two Point Studios has horribly failed on this front, as you can't even play one map more than a couple hours before being strangled by an unnecessary, arbitrary hard-coded gameplay limitation.\n\nI should add, all those resources supposedly taken up by AI processing, and it's not even good AI. Characters routinely get stuck or frozen without notifying the player, and since you can't pick up students, you can maybe fix it by building things where the character is, shunting them to a nearby space. I've had moments where that didn't work either and the only way to fix it is to reload the game. And because there's no notification for the AI breaking, you likely won't notice there's an issue until you start getting warnings that they're about to fail or be expelled, because they've been missing classes and all their needs are still decaying. I had no performance issues of any kind, and my hardware could handle more characters and more demanding AI, but the artificial throttling and/or bugs ruins the experience.\n\nWhat a tragedy.", "timestamp_created": 1690667380, "timestamp_updated": 1690667380, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780507028102874756", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143045000": {"recommendationid": "143045000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358175448", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 13053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2123, "last_played": 1693211245}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice addicting micro-management game with lots of funny animations!\n\nEdit: I formerly wrote a negative review, because I lost all progress due to corrupt savefiles.

And playing this game looks very appealing to me, but there are things that irritate me right out of the box. It's not thought through well enough, like UX and interactivity.\n1. Room editing. It feels much more clunky than in Two Point Hospital. Less features and worse UX. For example after adding part of the room there is no way to undo it (at least I was not able to find it). You can't remove part that you added. It's shown as requires construction process, but as in Hospital, it's instant. I have to finish constuction and start it once again to remove that part. Also parts removing and adding is always active, which is not very comfortable.\n2. Different assignments rely on Kudos too much. As much as I was able to understand, some assignments are self-fulfilling. At least this part is not that resticting. But there is a next problem related to that.\n3. Too few feedback from the game. Self-fulfilling assignments: I don't know what were they about, where did they come from and so on. Zero information.\nSame problem with \"Campus requirements\". Why do I need 5 more teacher and two more rooms at the start of the year? More students? Why then increasing of students require 3-4 new teachers and only one new room. Teachers have capacity? Why teacher capacity is less than a room?\nWhen I upgraded a course, it became red. Why? What does it mean? Just color indication of the level or I did something wrong? Why it still got upgraded then?\nNever use color inidication without at least having tooltip explainig it. There must be a way for user to get the information.\n4. Shared dormitory in the same area as classes. It just feels wierd, including the fact that they are sharing beds. You didn't bother to make zoning? Or there are really such universities? It's really hard to believe in.\n\nThat is basically it. I just don't want to buy a game that irritates me right from the start.

He jugado m\u00e1s de 160h e incluso comprado varios DLC y lo he disfrutado bastante. Two Point Campus, por el contrario, me parece m\u00e1s de lo mismo en cuanto a m\u00e9canicas de juego y estilo visual, pero quitando el toque gracioso y la sensaci\u00f3n de urgencia. Da igual que ofrezcas unas instalaciones mediocres y contrates a los profesores peor cualificados, porque tus alumnos aprobar\u00e1n igual. Si les das donde dormir, algo que comer, algo con que entretenerse y d\u00f3nde estudiar, sacar\u00e1s beneficio cada curso escolar sin esforzarte lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo. Si desatiendes alguna de sus necesidades (como el tema religioso) no pasa nada grave. Si no construyes un ba\u00f1o con duchas no pasa nada. Si les das 8 camas para 40 estudiantes no pasa nada. Si les pones solo un par de m\u00e1quinas de snacks para comer todo el a\u00f1o no pasa nada. Siempre que tengas un par de profesores, un asistente en la biblioteca y un ej\u00e9rcito de conserjes limpiando, el resto da igual y van a aprobar el curso. \n\nLa verdad es que me ha resultado mon\u00f3tono y aburrido. No me parece que realmente haya ninguna satisfacci\u00f3n en cumplir los retos, que son extremadamente f\u00e1ciles, y las constantes peticiones de los alumnos me parecen est\u00fapidas e in\u00fatiles (lo has adivinado: si las ignoras no pasa nada).\n\nEn resumen, no es que sea un mal juego sino que simplemente es aburrido, no supone ning\u00fan reto y en absoluto merece el precio que tiene normalmente.

There was always the option to achieve just a passing result in that game with little effort, but to do it with flying colors required something extra. While it pushed you to succeed, Theme Hospital also gave you excellent feedback about exactly everything you were doing wrong and how you needed to improve, from the positioning of different rooms relative to each other and to the entrance, even down to the layout of your hallways and the placement of the furniture and equipment in the hospital's various rooms.\n\nTwo Point Campus, just like Two Point Hospital before it, doesn't do any of those things. It has the recognizable shell of screwball duncery (a better word than dunceishness) from Theme Hospital, but it doesn't seem to know why it's doing any of the things it's doing. Everything in the game comes easily, (except Kudosh, which is proof that hell exists) your students get A+ grades and in general live exemplary, overjoyed lives with little to no input from you. The game more or less plays itself. Make a new room for a new course, start at a new campus, it doesn't really matter what you do, none of it changes anything that happens and it will all go off without a hitch.

Otherwise you'll be hiring extra staff and building extra classrooms for almost-empty classes.\n\nSimilarly, crank the tuition fees as high as you can while still being able to take 8/16/24 students to maximize revenue - the happiness penalty isn't very severe.\n\nStudents pay tuition, but they also pay rent, and the nicer the dorms, the higher the rent, so be sure to crank your dorms' prestige level as high as you can. It's easier and cheaper to have one big dorm than a bunch of small ones as a result.\n\nEvery course has classes in lecture halls, so improving the prestige of lecture halls and prioritizing their upgrades gets more total benefit than other classrooms.\n\nYou can add and remove tiles from your buildings now, which helps greatly with fitting the many differently-shaped rooms.\n\nEach type of student has a passive that can help around the campus. Swots help with other students' grades, while Rebels might perform some percussive maintenance to fix up broken objects. The more different courses, the more variety of students, the more you can benefit from these passive abilities.\n\nClubs:\n\nThe tutorial says you need an assistant manning a club recruitment stand; you actually don't, assistants just prioritize students joining that club.\n\nEach club provides a bonus to movement speed, energy, learning rate, cash, or entertainment. Depending on the map, some clubs might be more useful than others, but the Book Club improving your students' learning rate is useful on every map.\n\n\nENJOY THIS FUN GAME", "timestamp_created": 1688978979, "timestamp_updated": 1688978979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864384293556213379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141706457": {"recommendationid": "141706457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064452204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 8131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4319, "last_played": 1693270907}, "language": "english", "review": "This game feels unfinished it is full of annoying bugs mostly related to the building system that seem to get worse in later campuses as you progress through the game.\n\nSometimes when you click a student not all the options appear until you click off them and back again (blue boxes in profile window right).\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001781889\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001781854\n\nStudents will occasionally just stop moving and stand in one spot until they drop out because they wont fulfil any needs or go to pastoral care, even after dropping out they don't move until they randomly disappear.

I contacted supported and they asked for my save, on just a few days they were able to send me the files restored to the exact moment right before the CTD. It\u00b4s a very uncommon bug, but if it hapens to you, don\u00b4t do nothing with the game, just contant support. \n\nTwo Point Campus is the second installement in the Two Point series after Hospital, but it\u00b4s a completely different beast. You are now tied to a 12 month period, your students won\u00b4t leave (hopefully) for the whole year, and it\u00b4s your job to provide them with the items and rooms that will help them improve their notes for tose 12 months. While a lot of the difficulty on Hospital was releated to placement of rooms, in here that\u00b4s less relevant and it\u00b4s money the biggest learning curve, you have to build your campus slowly or you are gonna end up asking for tons of loans, which is a feature I never used on Hospital.\n\nThere\u00b4s also more improvements in the system, now buildings are not fixxed and you can modify them as you please, and outdoor enviorements take a huge role. I particularly like the staff training improvements, you will no longer pay for a classroom, now you will have machinery and staff will go automatically when they are free, and they can come out of the machine without loosing progress on their leveling up.\n\nIf you enjoyed TPH, I\u00b4m sure you will do the same for TPC, although it\u00b4s true it\u00b4s a little bit easier, some of the new mechanics are very interesting and it\u00b4s great to see the team being able to translate the gameplay into different micromanagement styles.

IMO that's kind of terrible. it's too short? too easy? too few things to do? you would think that being able to build all the campuses would make it better but it really doesn't, because the builds just keep end up being the same because all the items always get unlocked in the same order. so if you look at my builds, you can see exactly when x y z got unlocked. if that makes sense.\n\nit's no different than 2PH where you have a designated place to put the things you unlock, except now you have to build it yourself... just always at the same point in time. the only solution I've found is to bulldoze the entire map and rebuild from scratch, but can't do that til you've accumulated the funds to spend, and then by that point the map is almost completed so what is the point lol\n\nI don't know!!! :( I am SAD because this was the one game I was looking forward to and then I got it and finished it and was like... \"ok\"", "timestamp_created": 1687112143, "timestamp_updated": 1687301882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722624838352203369", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139853654": {"recommendationid": "139853654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422436021", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3074, "last_played": 1686991112}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was fun, if you are a fan of Two Point Hospital no doubt you will enjoy this.", "timestamp_created": 1686427258, "timestamp_updated": 1686427258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139756292": {"recommendationid": "139756292", "author": {"steamid": "76561199021456830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1688641011}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun game if you like Tycoon genre!", "timestamp_created": 1686262458, "timestamp_updated": 1686262458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139742376": {"recommendationid": "139742376", "author": {"steamid": "76561199272490783", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5963, "last_played": 1698286547}, "language": "english", "review": "A genuinely fun and well done management strategy game.

There are some bugs that are quite annoying- like randomly one student on campus will be stuck and not move at all, eventually failing or withdrawing unless you do a quick save and a quick load.

Everything flowed nicely and seemed to make more sense to me. The achievements were not easy to earn, but they were very doable. This game retains the same humor style that made Two Point Hospital great. There is also more customization available in this game than in the previous game, but it still felt lacking to me. A lot of the rooms still turn out kind of ugly. I feel like a lot of the available styles in this game just don\u2019t go well together.

Taking inspiration from isometric sim games of yore but this time adding a twist on it instead of mostly just reimplementing Theme Hospital, Two Point Campus is a fun romp that fixes a lot of the issues with TPH, while remaining bogged down by others.\n\nIn Two Point Campus, you take the role as a campus administrator, responsible for hiring and firing staff and faculty, building rooms and buildings, and accepting students. The game is broken up into years, each of which takes about 20 minutes of real time, during which students will go from class to class, increasing their grades while spending time between classes to take care of their needs. This is a big difference compared to Two Point Hospital - in TPH, every patient entering your hospital started a timer to cure them before their health meter hit zero and they kicked the bucket (or were otherwise distressed enough to leave, but most of the time death was the major clock). This had a counterintuitive effect on the game - the menus were filled to the brim with all sorts of cute and fun items to please your patients, few of which you actually wanted to use because patients getting distracted just meant the gentle embrace of death grew that much nearer. TPC, on the other hand, has you stuck with your students for multiple years, and you need to keep them happy enough that they don't drop out, and smart enough that they don't flunk out in order to keep that sweet, sweet tuition and dorm rent money flowing. So while it was okay to let your patients starve in TPH, in TPC that's a quick way to get a bunch of depressed teenagers dropping out. Additionally, students also have their own personal goals they want to see while at college - something like seeing a concert, or getting into a relationship, or just looking at a nice hedge shaped like a duck, so you'll be placing all sorts of fun flavor items around the campus to satisfy those whims. Overall, a good change and it really helps make your campus feel like a campus!\n\nAnother good change from its predecessor is the way TPC handles rooms. In TPH, you needed to build rooms to complete actions, usually either diagnosis or treatment. In place of those categories, TPC has courses which each use one or more different kinds of rooms. A student in the Money Wrangling program has classes in a Lecture Hall and a Computer Lab, but a student in the Musicality program has classes in a Lecture Hall, Computer Lab, and a Recording Studio. Each course has its own requirements, and savvy players may even provide courses whose rooms complement each other, helping avoid unnecessary extra construction. However, students don't just need a room - they also need that room to have certain objects within, usually requiring bigger and more expensive items in later courses. While your first-year Scientography students will be fine with just a Science Hub, your third-years will need the large and expensive Microscope or Thunder Balls in the classroom in order to keep their grades up. In TPH, you almost never wanted to make a room bigger than the absolute bare minimum size allowed, with only a few limited exceptions for rooms that could operate in parallel off a single room - things like a bathroom where more stalls means more throughput, or adding beds to a trauma ward. In TPC, while you might be able to get away with a min-size room for your first year or two, you'll all but need to make those rooms bigger to accommodate those extra required objects. Which is great! It helps to add a lot of variety to your campuses, since I found that I was often upgrading my existing rooms instead of making a one-size fits all template and plopping that down to replace the original. Upgrading rooms is helped a lot by the new addition of being able to build your own buildings and resize your existing ones, too - though I would argue that, although it's undeniably super convenient, it's also kind of overpowered, since it completely short-circuits one of the fun parts of TPH's room layouts, which was puzzling out how to lay out your rooms. In TPC, you never need to, since you can just knock down a wall to fit a new extra meters of classroom. TPC also brought back the Prestige system from TPH, where rooms gain levels based on how much stuff is in them. Arguably, it's even more important now - higher prestige rooms make students happier and learn better, which is why it's a shame that it's such a pain in the ass now. TPH had a degenerate strategy whereby you could just spam hundreds of a single small, high-prestige item to pump up your prestige rating. TPC addresses this by... adding severe diminishing returns on items you add multiples of. Which is smart, at first, but realistically that means to hit the high level requirements students often want, you'll be plastering the walls of your rooms with dozens of different posters, which is a complete thematic miss and is also a usability disaster, to boot.\n\nThere are plenty of other changes, too; some better, some worse. Training doesn't have you flying in experts, or having your staff teach a class of your colleagues anymore - they just sit in a training pod until they level up. Worse, each staff member has three skill slots, each of which have ten levels - AND skills no longer increase just from being used! In TPH, your doctors would improve as they worked; in TPC, your staff is just as good as they were the day you hired them if you don't train them. Classes are not super well balanced - I often found myself taking the same 2-3 courses in levels, since they had high tuition fees, relatively small rooms, and brought in students that had helpful passive abilities. And this is never told to you in-game, but some classes can actively cause problems for you in the form of campus invasions (TPC's equivalent of TPH's ghosts, whereby your janitors need a special skill in order to remove the ruffians before they cause too much chaos) or other maluses. The campaign has some good variety, and unlike TPH I felt like the 3 star requirements didn't really outstay their welcome, with the worst goals usually just being 'graduate so many students with this grade or better,' which isn't really too burdensome if you've been running a good campus. There are a few levels with gimmicks, sort of like Duckworth-upon-Bilge in TPH, and while most people didn't like DuB's gimmick, I really liked it, as I also do the gimmicks in TPC.\n\nThere's also some DLC, which I didn't play, just like how I didn't play the DLC for TPH. Maybe if it goes on sale, I'll pick it up.\n\nOverall, Two Point Campus is a great improvement to the formula that Two Point Hospital pioneered. It took me about fifty hours overall to 100% the base game, which is coincidentally almost exactly as long as it took me to 100% Two Point Hospital too. If you're looking for an excellently-made sim game, or an evolution on the fun-but-flawed TPH formula, Two Point Campus is a great choice.\n", "timestamp_created": 1684431657, "timestamp_updated": 1684431657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 114, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87561410665512085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138348909": {"recommendationid": "138348909", "author": {"steamid": "76561199116908762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2252, "last_played": 1693424950}, "language": "english", "review": "This game definitely requires strategy, however the objectives are attainable.

I can't get myself hooked onto it at all, and I do keep trying. I feel like I'm constantly blocked from doing what I want to do in Two Point Campus in several different ways and I keep being forced to build in ways I don't want to. The management style in Two Point Hospital felt like I was always steadily improving everything about the hospital - the efficiency, the staff training, the decoration, the research, etc. In Two Point Campus I feel like I get blocked. It really doesn't feel like the University gets steadily improved - I'm currently on the second level, spent nearly 6.5 hours in it trying to get the entertainment to 70% and keep it there consistently to get 1 star on the level. I've got over 200 arcade machines, over 50 boxing bags, don't get me started on how many boomboxes there are and how much more money I've pumped into Student parties. My percentage isn't going up higher and I have two student unions and lounges. The game seems bugged and HARD work. Feels like an endless grind.

Steam has become mired beneath a cadre of self-entitled kids that \"thumbs down\" any game that a) isn't free, b) isn't perfect (even if early access), and/or c) isn't the game they ~mistakenly~ thought it would be. For objective evaluation, read the positive reviews first; if you still have doubts, then check out the negative ones - just understand you can safely ignore most of them. I recommend this practice for all games here.\n\n* Caveat: My hours played is misleading. I often leave games running overnight. Probably total hours actually in-game is around 50 to 60, much of that spent \"letting time pass\" to complete objectives that basically require the passage of time...\n\n--------------------\n\nThe game is described above, and the screenshots and trailers show pretty well what is it. Not going to re-describe it. As for its comparison to Two Point Hospital: Same graphics, same general style, but without the sense of urgency (or challenge, if I'm honest) and with the bonus of being able to completely redesign (or remove) buildings. It has a much more casual feel, and while the graphics and animations are still comical, they're not as humourous as the hospital version.\n\nIt's ... a more scaled-back, mindless experience, but still a nice time-passing colony-building style sim to run in the background. I've enjoyed it enough to have purchased both DLCs, and the entertainment value by dollar-per-hour is just fine for me. Whether or not you played TPH, I recommend it - but with the cautionary note that you must have some patience to suffer through some issues (mainly UI related) and a couple of very annoying bugs that have been present since launch. I will address these below.\n\n--------------------\n\n* You cannot rotate the camera freely vertically and horizontally at the same time. It's just weird to get used to.\n\n* Like TPH, most of your actions are spamming posters, pictures, windows, decoration and entertainment items in rooms and hallways (and outside). This is much more tedious now with the ability to completely redesign buildings - even with saving room templates (which I've never found useful), the items on the outside walls are still lost when moving them. It's a serious chore, moreso than in TPH.\n\n* The UI is also still a clunky click-fest.\n\t+ Open message box, select a message that requires you to place an item for a student request; click to place it and... the message box is closed. You have to re-open it every time\n\t+ Placing items? Item window is open, scroll down to the item, place it but oops, wrong spot - to grab item to move it and... the item window is close. Re-open, scroll back down...\n\t+ Open staff window to see who's on break or available for training. Click staff member, select training and it swaps to the training list window. Which you then have to close, to re-open the staff window to get back to seeing who's next on break...\n\t+ Really need 'feeder' or 'top-level' UI/UX elements to stay open until you manually close them.\n\n* For staff training, they do not default to using the highest-upgraded training pods or even the closest. Often they'll head to training after a class, barely get started, then leave to run back to the next class. It can take ages, so you need to find staff on break (see above note) OR micro-managed the training stations and disable job assignments to ensure training takes priority. Very tedious.\n\n* More unnecessary clicking - a never-ending series of demands each academic year for parties, DJs, movie nights... It doesn't matter how happy or entertained the students are, a dozen times per year you will click on the student demand, click on schedule, click on 'create' and (then re-open the message window)... It feels like an artificial attempt to increase the sense of challenge or activity but results in just more mindlessly unnecessary clicking.\n\n* Staff hiring is an exercise in extreme patience. You get offered a new staff member about once a minute, up to a maximum \"on hold\" based on campus prestige. You will want to hire during summer break, when time isn't passing and you're free to let the game run for... hours, it can take, to get the staff members you need with just the right skills, the right traits, and no negative traits. There are no good reasons to hire any else than ~exacty~ what you want, so either the training labs need a way to 'wipe' skills and traits, or you'll want to use a trainer to instantly refill the staff queue.\n\n* Some rooms have giant machinery, and the 'hitbox' is so large that you can't redecorate the room (like move a picture to make room for a window) because the cursor only targets the machinery. If the is too small to move the machinery you must either sell it (which means re-upgrading a replacement) or forget the redecoration. This is also true with doors - try to resize a room but the door is blocked? Have to micro-the new size while moving the door bit by bit until you get what you want.\n\n* Students & staff occasional get 'stuck' with pathing issues - not moving at all. Students will stand there until their health, hunger, and all other stats are 0 and they've failed out of the courses. Staff will get stuck in weird travel loops, like walking around the outside edges of the map to get to a piece of litter in the middle, then back to outside edges to get back to the building. These patching/stuck issues have been present since launch.\n\n* No dedicated save slots, so you can't re-load to an earlier point on a campus if the staff get stuck after you've moved some rooms around, for instance. Another reason to wait until summer-break to do your remodeling...\n\n* Assign clothing style to staff type - like white coats for teachers - and \"apply to all staff of this type\". But it doesn't remember that once you've loaded an existing game. And keeping your staff (teachers, assistants, janitors) clothed in recognizable ways is pretty useful, if not necessary.\n\n* Unused but unlocked plots are treated as 'active' by the staff. Janitors need to go outside to pick weeks, clear falling frogs, all sorts of 'disasters' that require cleaning. Big problem is that if you unlock plots but aren't using them yet, janitors will travel all the way across the map to pick one weed... Ditto for 'looking for work' - staff will wander around aimlessly, and often end up all the way across the map, making them late for jobs that do suddenly require their attention. Unused plots should be 'excluded' from debris & 'wander' events. \n\n--------------------\n\nThese issues and bugs aside, nothing game-breaking, the game is playable and enjoyable. But it requires no small amount of patience to work through these issues/bugs and have fun with the 'meat' of the experience.

I definitely like it even better than Two Point Hospital.  I really like how I need to figure out the best way to do things without feeling like I'm on the edge of catastrophic failure the whole time. The large variety of interesting locations was such a treat and that includes the DLC in space which I also purchased. There is enough management to make it interesting but not so much micro management that I feel like i'm at work. I do sometimes like more complex management games but I don't think its necessary for every game to add more and more of those features. Sometimes it's just fun doing a little management and having fun design elements and cute characters to watch as they go about their lives. If you're looking for a micromanagement game with a lot of depth to the operation of the scenarios this game may not satisfy as well as some others, but if you like management games with a little challenge, a bit more relaxed without a timer, a bit of design, and lots of cute funny characters and hilarious two point radio announcers chatting in the background then i feel confident recommending this game. \n\nMy computer isn't the best but the game still runs pretty well. I have experienced some infrequent crashes but it's not often enough to be annoying to me.  I have very few critiques and they mainly are about the UI needing to be more organized and less clunky to get around, it is the one area of the game that does frustrate me to a small extent, it seems outdated and not as easy or intuitive as it should be. I find that i have to switch back and forth in the menu a lot when I'm looking at the skills of my employees and then choosing to send them to training. I want to be able to see the individual details about the staff and send them to training without the game then sending me to the training tab when I want to stay in the general employee info tab for instance. It's a lot of clicking back and forth at times when you're wanting to mass train staff. Additionally I don't think the janitors are without their issues. At one large university i had a dorm located at the top and the bottom of my campus and the bottom dorm always had dirty beds no matter how many janitors i hired and assigned to cleaning. i would then tag the beds for cleaning and they still didn't show up. So i had to resort to continually picking up janitors and dropping them on that task over and over. It would be really nice if you could assign janitors to specific buildings and areas. The teachers are really good at doing their assigned jobs so that doesn't need any changes and the students mostly do what they need to without too much supervision as long as they have the facilities required to keep them happy. \n\nOverall I do recommend this game because it is a lot of fun and low stress. The campuses are diverse looking and attractive, the different classes are so fun to unlock and incorporate and many of the campuses are large enough to allow you the opportunity to have a lot more going on if you want and also from a design aspect I really enjoyed having more area to make my campuses not just functional but also pretty.  I can't wait for more additional content, particularly a larger variety of things like basic wallpaper and flooring choices and decorative items and recolors, because that's one of my favorite aspects of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1677437604, "timestamp_updated": 1677437604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133658338": {"recommendationid": "133658338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094143231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4577, "last_played": 1695391944}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those tycoon games that you'll buy and binge uncontrollably for days/weeks. \nIf you love management/simulation/colony builder-esque games, this will be right up your alley. \n\nMy only complaints are that it's difficult to manage the student intake/courses/student schedules.

But beyond that, the game is amazing and I look forward to future DLC. \n\nNow we need:\n- Two Point Hotel\n- Two Point Zoo (or Aquarium)\n- Two Point Airport\n- Two Point Mall", "timestamp_created": 1677264401, "timestamp_updated": 1677264401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133428770": {"recommendationid": "133428770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006641212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2222, "last_played": 1687849053}, "language": "english", "review": "Good!", "timestamp_created": 1677175108, "timestamp_updated": 1677175108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133405282": {"recommendationid": "133405282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999544847", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3334, "last_played": 1692397132}, "language": "english", "review": "Two Point Campus is a breath of fresh air.

Everything in this game is just amazing and keeps you playing for long hours at a time. The best features of this game is the ever changing and growing campus and events as you try to achieve and finish all the goals to making your school prosperous and functional.

This game is too restrictive. Read below for details.\nFor Two Point Hospital fans, this feels like a reskin of TPH with new maps and assets. Get it if discounted. \n\nReview Details : \nThis game puts you in a role of a campus administrator. You start course(s) in your campus and applicants/students will come to study there. You hire teachers, staffs and janitors to manage your campus. You can collect tuitions from the students and dorm rents too if you build it for them. Of course you also have to prepare classrooms, laboratory, workshops etc for the students too.\n\nThere are 17 courses/majors/subjects in the base game. You can also upgrade each courses using course points so they can have more applicants each year. You can get course points when your campus level is upgraded which generally means having better teachers, more classrooms , more staffs etc. \n\nHere's the beginning of my disappointment with this game, Course points is very hard to get later on. To get course points you basically has to hire new staffs or teachers and level their skills. if you lay off your staffs, your campus level may go down. \n[b]Basically you have to keep expanding and hiring new workers to get course points. [/b]\n\nThat's fine and all, until you are stopped by an invisbile wall called campus capacity. Basically this game seems to have a student capacity limit for each map. When that limit is hit, [b]You will be forced to reduce the number of new students that you can accept every year[/b]. There doesn't seem to be any way to overcome this limit and this limit seems to be quite small. \nI tried by starting all 17 courses on a sandbox level with creative mode. Normally , you get around 10 applicants for each course for a total 170 new students each year. However the campus cap limit force me to accept just 6 students for eaach course for a total 102 students each year. Even if I upgrade the course, it's still limited to just 6 students per course even though 1 course is already maxed with 55 applicants each year but you can only accept 6 of them. \n\nSo you have to keep expanding and hiring new staff to get course points . However the campus cap limit force you to limit your students per year (and indirectly your income). You basically at a dead end at that point. You can't expand because you will not make enough money to pay staff so you can't get more course points. The game basically ends at that point. \nEven if you have plenty of lands to expands, there's no point at all. There's no students that will use your new buildings. It's GAME OVER alright. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677028155, "timestamp_updated": 1677028329, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481651365756988525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133263248": {"recommendationid": "133263248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301268089", "num_games_owned": 792, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 657, "last_played": 1677202980}, "language": "english", "review": "Made me late for work...

It isn't exactly like they re-skinned the former into this, but it's very much one of a very defined series with defined systems. Are the differences enough to warrant dropping $40 (or 30, in my case) on this game? Depends. It's fun. I like it. It definitely is not the most CHALLENGING management sim in the world, but it's certainly got enough hooks and niches to keep you invested (maxing the stars of each college, the challenges, the subtle increase in difficulty/mechanics with each school, etc). The pageantry of it all is also a delight; what it lacks in difficulty it makes up for in character. The Two Point series is very much made for people who loved Wallace and Gromit as children, or think it's funny to riff on rural England (very valid). \n\nSo...buy it? Yes. In my opinion it's fun moderate difficultly management sim that's more for relaxation than anything.

I remember the first 10-20 hours of TPH, where I was barely keeping the hospitals afloat, but this game is not challenging at all. The amount of money they give you at the start covers everything, and each level of the campus feels repetitive.\n\nOverall, I am disappointed with Two Point Campus. As a fan of Two Point Hospital, I was hoping for an experience that was just as challenging and engaging. While the game offers the opportunity to build and design, it lacks the depth and strategic gameplay that made its predecessor so enjoyable.

I liked it until I reached one of the later universities where you open your first Archeology classes. I ran into multiple problems that made me lose all interest in the game. \n\n- There is a hard cap for students you can have on the campus that the game won't tell you about. 300 students is the maximum capacity you can have in any campus during any year. Not only that, there appears to be a soft cap starting at 180 students already as I experienced that yesterday ingame. I just got to year 5 and bought the third plot of land until I noticed the game wouldn't let me add more students due to \"capacity issues\". What am I supposed to do with the other 4 land plots and upgrading my courses??? If your staff gets leveled up enough, you can't reach positive numbers anymore due to the hard cap on student numbers. That alone completely destroyed my drive to continue playing because there is no point to make a bigger and better campus. \n\n- You get spammed by pop ups eventually that you can't disable. Not at all, not certain kinds of them. \n\n- The Marketing Office is pointless because all it does is attract more applicants that you can't even accept anymore due to the students cap later in the game. You can't attract specific or higher educated staff which was great in Two Point Hospital. \n\n- Many aspects of the game aren't even mentioned ingame, I just figured things out from playing TPH before.\n\nI'll deinstall Two Point Campus today and get back to Two Point Hospital if I feel the itch again, overall a way better game.", "timestamp_created": 1676568351, "timestamp_updated": 1676568351, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132962839": {"recommendationid": "132962839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069493406", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 6472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1180, "last_played": 1680192156}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly addicting!

All of this is made worse by the bad UI, which is fiddly and annoying. It's really not up to the standards you would expect for a relatively simple management game these days. Also the internal game clock runs way too slow for the pace at which the game happens, so a large amount of my playtime was pretty passive or even spent in tabbed out waiting for a in-game year to run down.\n\nTo expand on these points: \n\nManagement:\nTwo Point Campus is fairly simple, very repetitive, and doesn't have much challenge. Each level involves constructing a set of core structures (lecture rooms, dormitories, toilets, etc) which gradually expands as the game progresses. There is some thought that goes into placing them (e.g. make sure every building has at least a few toilets, make sure dormitories are placed somewhere relatively central) but you figure these out quickly. So each level plays very much like the last. Spend the first year placing enough of the essential buildings to make the campus function, then spend subsequent years expanding whatever elements the game wants you to expand to meet the completion goals. Repetitive game loops aren't uncommon in management games, but usually when that's the case they make up for it by using a combination of varied level goals and distinct level design and modifiers. Two Point Campus doesn't do that. Most objectives are very similar to each other, and since every aspect reinforces every other aspect a level that asks you to meet a certain level of student happiness, or campus attractiveness, or average grade all involve basically the same thing. Level design and modifiers also fail to make the repetitive loop feel fresh. Since you can modify the buildings that the individual rooms go into level design is very rarely something you need to give much thought to - just extend the main building's wall until you can fit what you need, no problem (and even deliberately not doing this to challenge myself on the later levels the variety that the pre-made structures introduced was pretty minor). The level modifiers are also too minor to provide much variety, and some of them are just tedious to deal with. The game is also extremely easy. I had maybe a dozen students fail their courses out of thousands over the course of the game, and the only student who dropped out did so because their AI broke and they stood in a hallway not bathing or eating for six months.\n\nUniversity theme:\nI think that a good management game should have the theme incorporated into the mechanics, and doing this well can make up for a lot of other shortcomings. Two Point Campus doesn't do anything interesting with the university theme. For example the problem of balancing research and teaching is completely absent from the game, with research a pretty insignificant mechanic that unlocks upgrades instead of a key university activity. Other things that could have made for interesting mechanics like grants, alumni relations or student politics are also absent. I'm not saying they need to have the specific things I just mentioned, but some effort to make the mechanics match the theme would have gone a long way. \n\nRelaxed builder:\nThis is more subjective, but I don't think Two Point Hospital does a very good job scratching the itch for light management games that let you build attractive things. Most of the items are unlocked with a secondary currency called kudosh, mostly earned by completing objectives. This means that if you want to decorate a place nicely you need to spend kudosh or use a very limited set of options. But kudosh is also used to unlock key items, so focusing on decorative options will cripple your progression in the game. The other problem is the game encourages you to place the maximum number and variety of items. Each item contributes to room quality and items that haven't already been placed contribute more. So the optimal way to play is to do things like cover the walls in posters, most of which will have absolutely no relation to what gets taught there, or to cram all of your students into one giant dormitory so they get the biggest exposure to item effects. Students will also periodically demand that you buy things and place them on campus, and if you don't buy them you can expect to be spammed with the same request repeatedly until you give in. Don't think a giant pink car-themed seat is a good fit for your grounds? Well to bad, because they'll never stop asking for one. Why you have to use specific items rather than item categories (like in the sims, which lets sims dynamically ask for things without forcing the player to give up their creative freedom) is beyond me.", "timestamp_created": 1676355097, "timestamp_updated": 1676355326, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607884228229522705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132815044": {"recommendationid": "132815044", "author": {"steamid": "76561199235044072", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1676289801}, "language": "english", "review": "campus", "timestamp_created": 1676352712, "timestamp_updated": 1676352712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132814842": {"recommendationid": "132814842", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972304455", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1676299843}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as Two Point Hospital and has Denuvo.\nYuck.", "timestamp_created": 1676352287, "timestamp_updated": 1676352287, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525139689445495605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132814567": {"recommendationid": "132814567", "author": {"steamid": "76561199160807402", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1695179133}, "language": "english", "review": "so fun", "timestamp_created": 1676351788, "timestamp_updated": 1676351788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132814111": {"recommendationid": "132814111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099821029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1676273066}, "language": "english", "review": "I already own Two Point Hospital, so I was interested to see how Two Point Campus compares.

The game mechanics are exactly the same and even the announcements are the same. It doesn't make much of a difference that this is a university surrounding because the game mechanics have nothing unique. You build rooms, place items and wait. You wait a lot. I found it slower than Two Point Hospital. The little tasks are not very exciting. In the beginning one task is to build a library and then some assignment was to be completed there. I was hoping for some interesting task, but all that meant was to wait until enough people had been in the library for a sufficient time. Most of the tasks are exactly the same you get during Two Point Hospital - hire x amount of this profession, raise happiness in that area, built this room. I was disappointed. \n\nIn addition to not adding anything really new the controls are more clunky than they are in Two Point Hospital. I found gameplay a bit cumbersome and not very enjoyable. \n\nSo basically, you get Two Point Hospital with different rooms and clunkier controls. If you don't own Two Point Hospital, this might be a sufficiently entertaining game. But it you own Two Point Hospital, there is unfortunately no real reason to buy Two Point Campus.

Then, on a Saturday, I started Steam and it announced that there was a free weekend for TPC. \n\nThe thing with games like TPC is, you need a little more time than two hours (the refund play time) to understand gameplay fully and to actually get a feel for the game, or maybe realize that there isn't much of a feeling. In that case, after about seven hours, I can definitely say that there isn't for me.\n\nTwo Point Campus is nice enough. It's a fun little game, at least for a while. But it gets repetitive and boring very fast. \n\nAchievements (in-game, not the Steam ones) unlock very slowly, and the reward is small, which caused me to never have enough Kudosh, that in-game reward currency. Money, yeah, no problem, my ratings were good, as were grades, I had no quitters, people were happy. But employees were demanding schoolings, which I couldn't offer, because apparently I hadn't unlocked that function yet. After several years. I found out there was something like that when I checked out the Sandbox mode, btw. There was no pop-up message when I hovered over the training button that told me I need to unlock it. \n\nExplanations and mentioned messages are inconsistently placed. Sometimes you get an info, sometimes you don't. \n\nMany of these things give the game a rather EA feel. \n\nIn the end, it's all about building and expanding the college and hiring (or firing) staff, but without any way to actually *manage* anything. Like, who earns what, what do students have to pay. Why is the rent for a big sleeping quarter higher than for a two-bed one? Or is it my rent? Why can't I decide the rent myself? Or the tuition and what else there is? And why don't those employees (especially assistants) I put somewhere stay exactly there?\n\nAs someone who has played The Sims a lot, this feels in extremely many ways very similar to the University DLC (right down to character's quirks and moods, and the objects), though not in a good way. Because in TS3 I at least have the feeling that I can influence what happens, whereas here I'm beginning to feel quite useless after only a short time. I wait for someone to wish for or demand something, or build/expand the campus because there's literally nothing else to do.\n\nSo would I recommend this as a really good game everyone needs to try? No. Even less for that price. I recognize that game development costs money, but 40\u20ac? It's way overpriced. I will keep it in my list and if it should ever be on sale for some 10\u20ac, maybe I'll get it after all. As said, it's nice enough, and something to relax in between, but that's about it.\n\n\nEDIT:\nI read in another review that apparently there is a way to change student fees. So I went back into the game and checked everything, but except for a way to change teacher loans, I couldn't find anything. Maybe it's another thing that unlocks (MUCH) later.", "timestamp_created": 1676303804, "timestamp_updated": 1676304835, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522821545600891113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132780190": {"recommendationid": "132780190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039269969", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1676302033}, "language": "english", "review": "6 hours of Free Weekend Demo\n\nMy Experience:\n-It's Like the building mode of Sims 4 but replace a school also it's Management.\n-You build rooms to make students study, Keep them happy, and get some tuition xMoney Hands Gestutex\n-Earning Kudosh is hard.

If you tried Two Point Hospital, then this one will be easy to pick up, if not the same crazy contraptions, management, building and mayhem is included.\nGraphics: Good clean clear anime-trons and machines that give people chuckles, very easy balloon icons and direction.\nSounds: Again, some music, effects, cute voice overs.\nMicro Management: If you are a micro managing loon, then this is right up your alley.\nGreat for all ages: Little ones can get into the fun mishaps.\nPause: If you pal\nAlittle of Everything: Staffs, Rivals, Punks, Clowns, Bad Teachers, this has all the college covered.\nAesthetics: Fun creative items to place all over.\n\nWhat I feel needs to improve:\nThe Same: Not much is different than Two Point Hospital than just a different genre. This can be Two Point Police, Two Point Prison, or Two Point business and it will still be the same formula to the same result. \nCramped: Like its previous title, you truly feel cramped playing the game where it just can become a mess if you don't know how to utilize space, instead of pulling you into the game, it keeps you at a distance to micro manage things that you can't really enjoy what your doing. Remember Pause is your friend.\nBusiness not College: This feels more about managing money and a business than college escapades. \nNeeds to Grow: Why fix it if its not broke, well, sometimes you need to expand the boundaries of what you created. \nControls: It can get confusing, camera, create, blocks, monkeys, and as the game get super complex, you can find yourself in a lot of trouble. Kids will really struggle the deeper they go.\n\nMy Final Thoughts:\nUsing the free weekend. This is a game that if you loved Two Point Hospital you may not enjoy much of the same with College. Its like Sims Pets or Sims Islands, no real difference in the end. Do I give Campus a passing grade, sure, its good clean fun and enjoyable for all ages. Its a game that copies its predecessor with a few changes, but much of the same that you just may want to play Hospitals if you have it again and that is not what you strive for in a sequel. However if you did not get Hospital, then Campus maybe a nice first time buy. \nSee the video game play above discussion to see if the game is for you. I give it a good grade for the effort, but we have Two Point Hospital that we saw no reason to get Campus.

Recently finally tried out Two Point Hospital, loved it because it was essentially the new and improved, albeit buggy, Theme Hospital from my childhood. Made a status about it and an acquaintance recommended this, which I had already added to my wishlist quickly after playing TP Hospital. Got this 30% on sale. \n\nHere's the thing, I love this game because it's more Two Point feels with totally different systems and it's very engaging and fun. They added some really interesting ideas like being able to design building shapes. They made some really clever and intuitive upgrades from TPH gameplay into this.... However this is a double edge sword and imho a place where it stumbles. Due to some of the upgraded options to you as the manager, some of these upgrades I feel makes the UI streets behind where TPH was. The amount of times I haven't been able to place an object I really should be able to place and then having to pull and push the object around weirdly just to put it in the exact same position I was already in but this time allowed to place the thing. However, I have a tendency to really clutter my spaces and max out room levels while minimizing the space needed to do that, leaving very very tight spaces, in TPH this just made the pawns jumble while going about and kind of making traffic jams everywhere with folks animations going through each other... which I found entirely endearing. However with TPC, these jams seem to really obstruct some of the things, saw a couple of pawns get stuck in months long glitches of getting stuck in a table or something trying to get to a food place. It's way less endearing this time around with the UI wonkiness being compounded into all of it.

I've played sims like this since the early 1990's, but it didn't \"mesh\" with me.  Basically stopped at lower levels as I got bored as hell and it wasn't improving.  It's not like the many others over the years where you have to constantly react and \"build up\" to meet challenges.  You get a grace period between years to do most of your major work and basically sit on your tush after that.\n\nIf you played hospital, it's basically the same theme with some improvements.  Some of those improvements are for the better, some make you wonder what was going through the devs mind when they implemented it.  You can reach higher levels on both workers and \"class levels,\" but they raised it to the point that it basically doesn't make sense. All you're doing is cutting and pasting the same rooms over and over especially with their \"dimishing returns\" where the classes basically handles 50% less.  And that takes up a lot of room.  And unless they have major league sized maps on the end, you're just basically following the same theme for one type of class throughout your building or you're doing low levels trying to create a mix of classes to make the game more interesting...  It's as far away from hospital as you can get where you try to make enough money to max out personnel and equipment/rooms/treatment.  I actually fell asleep playing a couple times which is not regular for me  so about 3-4 hours you can deduct from gameplay time...  Personnel is basically the same way, you got far higher levels you can reach, but you'll quickly end up bankrupt if you try to push the max  as your income is limited to students tuition and \"bonus\"\n  (more on this later.)\n\nBuildings, you can actually build your own.  No real challenge in that anymore except the issue of class level and what you're trying to accomplish.  Pathing seems to have taken a hit in this game where you end up having students bouncing back and forth in front of classroom doors and you don't have the ability to pick them up to break the cycle.  So they'll keep bouncing until things get screwed up like missing class or they graduate.  It isn't common, but it isn't rare either.  I've had at least 2 incidents per game/replay and I end up just saving game and reloading last save.  Puts them back on track...  Harder to ignore is the janitors becoming stupider then before.  I tried to post on the Steam discussion forums, but it got deleted.  Not because it was a rant or used foul language, but because they want people to create an account and post it on their website.  Usually, I wouldn't have any issue with that, but I have too many games and I'm not going to create an account for every one of them where I have an issue.  You sold on Steam, it's a common site for both consumer and devs, then make use of it...  I posted to a drop box with video's showing the issues with the computer losing track of people and erroring as well as the DX error log, and it got deleted within 6 hours.  I contacted Steam with a copy of what I posted and they said there was nothing wrong to get deleted by them, and they said they have no log of deleting it themselves.  As the devs have access, they had to have done it (according to Steam so don't bite my head off as I'm going off of what I was told.)  One video was showing the ricochet rabbit action of one of the students, the other videos showed full energy/happiness janitors walking up to the room and turning around and going elsewhere allowing the room to become trashed and nothing getting fixed.  Had the error logs for the specific video as well.  Oh well, not going to worry about it as the game as it stands right now isn't going to be started much.\n\nYou supposedly get more \"students\" then you got \"patients\" in hospital.  It sounds good until you think it through.  In hospital, you had 200 patients cycling through when you push for that level of care/gameplay.  You get around 300 students one shot at the beginning of the year according to posts I've read making it seem like it can handle more when you build up to that level.  But, due to how the gameplay is, it feels like you're dealing with far less.  And with the dimishing return issue that I really can't see a point to (it may be somewhat realistic, but it's annoying as the game isn't a \"realism\" game,) it basically just eats up space with no real point having to create a bunch of unneeded classrooms that sit empty most of the time at the level I got bored with and exited out.    If they allow scheduling classrooms/classes at far higher levels, just disregard this section as I allowed my boredom to get the better of me before I reached a more challenging stage that allows you to maximize usage.\n\nHeating/cooling is basically the same as hospital meaning it can be more of an annoyance then a help at times.  They fixed the gold certificate spam on university (good!!!!!!) so you can't just spam one item to get your room ratings up.  I regularly took every room up to 14 except the bathroom and the shower room even without the ability to spam.  Trying to get to 15 looks like it would be a bear to reach, but I didn't finish the game so I don't know what other things \"pop up\" later in the game to add for decorations that may make it easier..\n\nIn order to offset the continual income made in hospital, they basically pay you the tuition to you monthly as well as a bonus from students improving or liking space they're in.  It levels up the university and can bring in funding as well.  I can see why they did it with the limitations as you only have the same \"customers\" for the entire year, but it can be an annoyance especially if you're not throwing parties or bringing in live bands for them to give them an extra \"boost\" and shake the purse some more.\n\nLike I said, I just can't get into it as my playstyle is for more \"interaction\" then this game has.  If I comment on a game, I usually have hundreds of hours into it before I comment on it.  But, maybe I'll jump into it at a later time and have a different opinion and give it another chance as I've still got about 8 games and DLC's for games I already own I purchased at the same time as this  that I haven't played yet.  I don't like to leave a game unfinished...  \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1675744801, "timestamp_updated": 1675744801, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576920211315155029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132298503": {"recommendationid": "132298503", "author": {"steamid": "76561199145487473", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12220, "last_played": 1699248224}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh...

And you\u2019ll need a counsellor to improve student happiness to prevent them from dropping out.\n\n\u2022\tEntertain students with arcade machines, various social clubs, film nights and live music gigs.\n\n\u2022\tTrain staff with new and improved skills, and research upgrades for equipment to improve student grades.\n\n\u2022\tRival schools will send their students to damage your equipment, so you\u2019ll need janitors trained in security to shoot them with water pistols (Campus\u2019 equivalent of Hospital\u2019s ghosts).\n\n\u2022\tCampus is easier and less stressful than Two Point Hospital. The main reason for this is because of how the game is divided into academic years. At the start of each year you\u2019ll select which courses to run, and the game will tell you exactly how many students you\u2019ll receive, and how many teachers and rooms you\u2019ll need. You won\u2019t get taken by surprise by a sudden increase in demand that you\u2019re not prepared to handle, which frequently happened in Hospital.\n\n\u2022\tWith the main infrastructure in place at the start of the academic year, during the year you\u2019ll mostly just have to deal with minor requests from students, such as buying equipment they need to complete assignments, setting up new entertainment options, or adding decorative items.\n\n\u2022\tFinances are quite easy to manage too. You\u2019ll probably need loans to buy everything when first starting each university, but the default tuition fees are so high that by year 3 I was usually making plenty of profit to pay back those loans and fund further expansion.\n\n\u2022\tThere are 12 maps which focus on a different main subject, and you can earn up to a 3 star rating on each by achieving specific objectives. Some objectives relate to students passing courses with high grades, others focus on student/staff happiness, entertainment, hunger, etc. The most tedious objectives will be familiar to Hospital players, relating to attractiveness rating, which forces you to literally cover the walls with paintings and posters, floors with rugs, and spam trees all over the outside area (which in my opinion actually makes the campus look ugly, but it gets the objective ticked off).\n\n\u2022\tYou\u2019ll only receive students for alternate subjects if you choose to add them, so you can make each university feel unique, which helps to reduce the game\u2019s repetitiveness. (This was my biggest complaint about Hospital \u2013 every map was basically the same, because over time you\u2019d gradually receive patients for every illness, so you\u2019d end up having to build every treatment room on every map).\n\n\u2022\tHowever, one thing that is extremely repetitive is Campus\u2019 radio DJ dialogue. Especially if you want to 3 star each map, you will hear the same stories and bad jokes over and over and over again.\n\n[h1]Technical[/h1]\n\n\u2022\tIt took me 68 hours to complete all maps with a 3 star rating.\n\n\u2022\tThe longer I played some maps, my framerate started to dip into the 40\u2019s and even occasionally the 30\u2019s. Changing graphics settings didn\u2019t have any impact at all (I even tried putting everything to minimum), it just seems that the more students and staff you\u2019ve got, the performance will eventually decline. Usually at that point I\u2019d already built most of what I needed and I\u2019d just be waiting for the more grindy 3 star requirements to complete.

But it still didn\u2019t feel good to look at.\n\n\u2022\tI didn\u2019t experience any crashes or major gameplay bugs, but I did see a few visual bugs.\n\n\u2022\tOn multiple occasions on different maps, the bands I\u2019d booked for student union gigs would get stuck at the side of the stage, no music would play, the students would all stand still instead of dancing, but they\u2019d all still get the happiness bonus for attending a live gig.\n\n\u2022\tI saw multiple cheeseball matches where all players stood still for the whole match, nobody took any shots, but at the end I\u2019d still receive a message telling me if I won or lost and the final score.\n\n\u2022\tI frequently saw doors to various rooms get stuck in a half open position with people clipping through, until eventually it would resume opening and closing properly.\n\n[h1]Recommendation[/h1]\n\nTwo Point Campus is a good game which fans of Two Point Hospital or other management games will probably enjoy.

Many gameplay elements and references from that game have made it into [i]Two Point Campus.[/i]\n\nThe game sets you in the position of a dean of a series of colleges and universities.  You will build buildings and rooms, agree to run various courses, hire staff, and see that students are taken care of, with an occasional minor crisis thrown in.\n\nThere's not much more micromanagement than that.  You don't have to schedule classes, staff, or students, as the game sorts that out for you.\n\n\nThe 3D room editor is much the same as it was in TPH.  You can freely copy and even move entire rooms as well as items, and create templates for rooms.  You can also customize the floors and walls.\n\nIn a welcome enhancement from TPH, the room editor is extended to the campus buildings themselves, allowing you to move beyond the building footprints they offer you.\n\nJust be sure to leave some outside land.  Some items are meant to be outside, and some classroom areas, such as a jousting arena or a sports field, must be placed outdoors.\n\n\nAs for courses, they and their packages of classes are all set up for you.  All you have to do is to choose which courses to run, upgrade them, and make sure you have enough classrooms for them.  The game warns you if you don't have enough rooms or teachers for a course.\n\nClassrooms include both a lecture hall and various labs for more practical experience.  Outside of class, students have homework and will need stations in the labs or a library to complete it.  The library has several specialized bookcases full of tomes appropriate to each course.\n\nSome lab rooms can be used for more than one course.  The culinary school needs kitchens, but also a Science Lab for food science work.\n\n\nStudents will need accommodations including a dorm, bathrooms, showers, and food and entertainment.  You will also have to see that medical and mental needs are attended to, and offer private tutoring.\n\nDespite Two Point Hospital having a cafe for both staff and patients, there's no cafeteria here on Two Point Campus.  Instead, you have vending machines and food kiosks as well as the student lounge and student union.\n\nYou can hold several events in various rooms, as well as book concerts for the student union stage.\n\nStudents also have goals of finding friendships or romances, or attending a concert.  Giving them the items and events that facilitate these goals adds to student happiness, which makes them more motivated to learn.\n\nTPC has social clubs that students can sign up for and level up in.  These give advantages to members or your campus.  The Book Club enhances learning.  The Nature Club enables its members to help you maintain the plants on campus.\n\n\nStudents fall into several types.  Some courses appeal to specific types, while others appeal to a range.  Each type bears a (usually beneficial) trait or two.  Class Clowns and Musicians entertain everyone.  Wizards (yes, the British devs were inspired by Hogwarts) use their powers for good or evil depending on their mood.\n\n\nYour staff, too, needs to be kept happy, albeit to a lesser extent as the hospital staff in TPH.  A staff room of their own and occasional training, as well as solving the same environmental issues that annoy students, goes a long way.\n\nStaff do multiple jobs.  Professors can teach class, do research, or tutor struggling students.  Assistants serve not just as food kiosk clerks and library assistants, but also nurses in the medical clinic and counselors in Pastoral care. Janitors clean up the place and maintain equipment and water plants, but also play security guard to bust intruders.  You can forbid staff from various aspects they are qualified for to keep them to their strengths, or train them up.\n\n\nAs students learn in their classes, they earn XP which, along with the value of the campus itself and the total value of the staff, earns Course Points.  These are applied at the beginning of a school year to upgrade or start new courses.\n\n\nYou'll have some VIP visitors, such as the education minister, a health inspector, pop star Jasmine Odessey, or actor Roderick Cushion.  Each has their own aspect that they are looking at, and will pay if they like what they see.  You also have prospective students visit and can gain a bonus student entering in the next year.\n\nCash can come from a couple other sources.  VIPs will give you a donation if you hit certain threshold goals that they propose.  Posh students will randomly give you a donation if they are happy enough.  And you get a bonus for the XP students earned that month.\n\nOr, you can take out a loan.  There are three levels of loans, each with a fixed payment over a term of a couple of years.  You can't pay extra to pay it down faster, but you can pay it off in a lump sum and use one loan to pay off another.\n\nYou can also earn Kudosh, which is used to unlock new decor items and new items to complete assignments.  Students will request something that they know they'll need.  Kudosh can also be spent on extra customization options for students, staff, and decor.\n\n\nResearch and Marketing rooms return.  This time, research usually requires a teacher in a related subject matter.  Research unlocks new items or upgrades to equipment to make it more efficient, or projects that produce cash or Kudosh.\n\nMarketing here can only attempt to attract new students.  There's no \"attract better staff talent\" campaign as in Two Point Hospital, but you can train the ones you have.\n\n\nThere are twelve levels to play in the base game.  All that's needed to \"win\" and unlock more campuses is to score a single star by reaching certain objectives.  The objectives are pretty straightforward and listed in a sidebar.  You can continue on a campus to reach three stars, or return later.\n\nLater levels have some interesting challenges, such as finding funding from sources other than tuition, but these are fairly easy to figure out.  There are no time limits, so you can wait and save up.\n\nAnd you WILL be waiting.  The rhythm of the school year is both a blessing and a curse.  On the plus side, the summer break makes a great time for construction, especially to move facilities around.\n\nOn the other hand, some objectives look for quality graduates or take multiple years to reach.  Fortunately, there's a double-time speed that helps.\n\n\nTwo Point Radio returns!  The soundtrack takes the form of a radio station, complete with amusing DJs and commercials in between the instrumentals of various flavors.  Sir Nigel, Harrison Wolff, and Ricky Hawthorne are now joined by a mostly-competent Campus Radio team.\n\nThere's also a dry, sarcastic PA announcer that drops hints as to what's going on.\n\n\nThe art style is the same as TPH, strongly resembling Aardman Animation of Wallace and Grommit fame.\n\nA metric ton(ne) of British humo(u)r abounds in the witty radio script writing, course descriptions, and class names.\n\n\nYou're also given a metric ton(ne) of info, sliced and diced in all sorts of ways, with info sheets, charts, heat maps, and student/staff lists.\n\nNew is a Maintenance view, a 2D top-down view, with people reduced to icons.  Unfortunately, unless the person has some sort of urgent need, icons are all white and blur together.  I wish the room editor had a 2D view like this, as it would make placing objects a bit easier.\n\n\nThere's already signs of the same sort of updates that [i]Two Point Hospital[/i] had, with freebie seasonal items and DLC.\n\n\nA college campus makes an easier institution to run than Two Point's hospitals.  For one thing, students won't die on you, either from medical maladies or suicidal despair.  They can and will drop out, though.  Or you can expel them.\n\nThis is a great second entry in the Two Point County series, a fun return to that silly world.

As the name implies, you build a school campus, but not a regular one. You build a campus to teach students all kinds of fun and punny subjects like internet history, knight school, and my favourite, wizardry. The game is filled with small details, fun animations, jokes, and puns.\n\nSince it\u2019s a management sim, you spend your time building buildings and rooms to host your staff and students and take care of their needs and wants. The game is pretty easy, but I don\u2019t think that is a bad thing. The game does a really good job of finding a balance between giving you things to do while not stressing you out with too many things that need your attentions. Something I really like is that this game does not have micromanaging. You hire staff and they seem to automatically go where needed.\n\nA really pleasant surprise to me was the campaign. Usually I do not like the campaigns in these sorts of games and spend most of my time in the sandbox mode. However, I\u2019ve yet to touch the sandbox mode here since I\u2019m really enjoying the campaign. This campaign is very sandboxy. Each level introduces you to a new type of course and a new location, often with a new mechanic or two thrown in. You are then given very generic goals like get your school to a certain level or make achieve a certain happiness level. You can pretty much do whatever you want to achieve those goals, including taking on additional courses.\n\nA minor complaint would be that the leaderboards seem broken. None of my friends show up in them. It\u2019s just me and a few names that look like generic hard coded names to give players without internet something to compare against.

The only thing stopping me from playing it on release was that I knew someone had already planned it for me as a Christmas gift. Now that the time has come, and I\u2019ve given it a try, I have to say\u2026 I am sorely disappointed. The game is not in itself bad, but it comes as a major step down from TPH\u2019s management systems and turns into a glorified idle game.\n\nThe Good\n+ The Animations. The graphics have that classic TPH charm, and the animations are numerous and enjoyable. It\u2019s obvious there was love put in the detail with even the smallest interactions, and it makes for an amusing way to pass the time as you wait for classes to finish.\n+ The Training System. While I didn\u2019t quite understand it at first, once I got the hang of it I realized the training system is much easier and more streamlined than TPH.\n+ The Humor and Radio. The radio is entertaining to listen to, albeit a bit repetitive once you\u2019ve heard all the \u2018shows.\u2019 The classes and item descriptions are unique and come with a humorous flair that adds a nice amount of flavor text to the game.\n+ The Building. Being able to build the campus buildings themselves is a nice addition to the game, and can add a bit more complexity. I especially like the option to buy plots with or without the buildings included, so those who prefer just interior (like myself) don\u2019t have to worry about the buildings, while giving the freedom of building to those who enjoy it.\n\nThe Meh\n- Relationships. The introduction of relationships, both platonic and romantic, is an interesting choice. It makes it a bit more entertaining to watch the students interact with each other, become friends, fall in love, but as your campus starts to grow beyond 20 or so students it becomes hard to keep track of them, much less care about any of them individually. Even if you do find some you grow attached to (I had a particularly funny gay clown couple often show up at the forefront of my game), they\u2019re gone forever in 3 in-game years that go by quite quickly, making it simply not worth the time or effort.\n- The Requests. I\u2019ll expand on the bad part of this in a minute, but the reason this starts in Meh is because they\u2019re pretty much completely optional, despite being an integral part of the \u2018gameplay.\u2019 You can give them what they want\u2026 or don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t really matter. A student wants a decorative poster, better buy one or they\u2019ll get upset\u2026 except they won\u2019t. A student needs an item for an assignment, better get it for them or they\u2019ll fail\u2026 except they won\u2019t. The difference fulfilling the goals makes is completely negligible.\n\nThe Bad\n- The UI. Ugly and cluttered, the many, many tabs and pages in TPC tell you the same information repackaged in different ways. There are graphs and charts now, and while that seems useful, the information tells you\u2026 what, exactly? Most of it is simply not helpful, and the sheer amount of it gets in the way of looking at anything that could be of use.\n- The Management. Dumbed down significantly since TPH, the idea of a management sim is completely lacking here. You pick the overall course that the students take, but\u2026 that\u2019s pretty much it. You can\u2019t pick the specific classes they take, you can\u2019t edit the schedule, you have no control over what the students take and when. Perhaps they intended for it to be a more laid-back game, but instead it goes too far and becomes boring instead of relaxing.\n- The Requests. Good God, the student requests. They\u2019re never-ending and absolutely relentless. You can dismiss one for whatever reason, lack of money, lack of Kudos, and it\u2019ll be back within two minutes, usually less. This is the meat of the gameplay, so if you choose to decline the requests, you\u2019ve got literally nothing to do. Each request (along with the monthly income statement) pauses the game and gives you a full-screen popup with a description of what they want.\n- The Gameplay. Tying back into the lessening of management responsibilities, the gameplay is simply lacking. You build the rooms it tells you to, hire the staff it tells you to, and click start. For the next in-game year, your students go to their classes, rest in the dorm, party hard in the student lounge\u2026 and absolutely inundate you with inane requests, as stated above. Buy a poster, buy a machine\u2026 rinse and repeat. That is essentially the game - let it run, buy what the students ask you to, and sit back and watch. The students will get assignments they\u2019ll fulfill on their own, and you get to watch a little bubble appear above their head and fill up to give you the illusion that something has happened. You can assign a specific student extra tutoring, if you wan\u2019t\u2026 or they\u2019ll go on their own without your intervention. There\u2019s simply not much for you to do beside building room after room with the same recipe, regardless of the class.\n\nAs harsh as my review may seem, I really wish there was a \u201cmeh\u201d option, rather than completely not recommending it. My expectations going in were clearly for a completely different game than the one they wanted to make, and once I could get used to the difference in the type of game I was playing, it\u2019s not really all that bad. I can play it for a while and enjoy it, though perhaps not as long as I could binge a session of TPH. For what it is, essentially a glorified idle game with no real challenge, definitely wait for a sale, and know what you\u2019re going into before buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1672106857, "timestamp_updated": 1672106857, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821253299713134766", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129316415": {"recommendationid": "129316415", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980428093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1299, "last_played": 1674521960}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes me time travel. \n\nAlso the way they shake their butts during the parties is on point.\n\nHighly recommend if you have something to do and absolutely don't intend on getting it done.\nRIP cleaning my bedroom.", "timestamp_created": 1672040788, "timestamp_updated": 1672040788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649820983409881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129302247": {"recommendationid": "129302247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206377513", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1680535556}, "language": "english", "review": "I have had no issue while playing the game, i find its a good game to pass the time and zone out to while playing, think its worth the price", "timestamp_created": 1672024497, "timestamp_updated": 1672024497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129282595": {"recommendationid": "129282595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027353904", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3276, "last_played": 1688501501}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun to play. very immersive.", "timestamp_created": 1672004334, "timestamp_updated": 1672004334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129250381": {"recommendationid": "129250381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041858010", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1676204194}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, awesome game", "timestamp_created": 1671975596, "timestamp_updated": 1671975596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129245968": {"recommendationid": "129245968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001399556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1360, "last_played": 1692558287}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved Two Point Hospital, as i played the heck out of Theme Hospital when i was younger.

There is a new choice to build your own campus from the ground up, not just placing rooms into pre-built structures. If you don't like the base structure the devs have included, you can demolish it and build a better shape, or size of base structure that you like. \n\nAs you play further through the 12 levels/campuses, you also have the option of including more or less courses that you have unlocked. This means that you can make unique universities each time you decide to replay any particular one. A Sandbox mode has been included too so there is a lot of replayability while you build your best campus ever. \n\nI've not had issues with stability, no crashing, but the pawns sometimes have a few pathing issues. They do tend to cluster up in doorways, and often walk into each other, getting stuck or pushing each other along. Once or twice, characters have just gotten stuck in a random place and just won't move again. It's not game breaking though, and a quick fix for this is to hit 'Quick Save' and then reload the game. The stuck student will then resume as normal.  \n\nSome of the radio broadcasts are just not funny, unfortunately. The 'student' broadcasts by Felicity Bellbottoms are a bit cringey, just not hitting the right note. But, Sir Nigel, Ricky and Harrison Wolff are on top form, as ever. \n\nIt's definitely worth a go, and you'll have plenty of fun with the constructing as well as the exterior decoration function. The themes are also well thought out and you won't lack for entertainment. One caveat I will mention is not to allow in too many students too early on, as it can get frenetic and cause problems with students not getting enough assistance in their learning, resulting in more fails or drop-outs. \nDespite the two minor pathing drawbacks I have mentioned, I am really enjoying it. :} \n", "timestamp_created": 1670315052, "timestamp_updated": 1672376405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703470408916473389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127898215": {"recommendationid": "127898215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242811188", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 613, "playtime_at_review": 3635, "last_played": 1700558196}, "language": "english", "review": "Big improvements overall from 2PH, in fact, going back to the game's hospital origins feels distinctly lacklustre in comparison.

fact that you get an indefinite summer break before each academic year is a nice change from\nTwo Point Hospital, where you would get a constant flow of patients right from the start.\n\nStaff training is also much better now in my opinion. Unlike Two Point Hospital, campus employees use a training machine (which eliminates the need to constantly hire/assign trainers) and they do it automatically in their own free time, so it doesn't disrupt your operations. Also, instead of having to wait for staff to be promoted to unlock another training slot, staff can now be trained anytime. All of this makes training much less frustrating than TPH's system.\n\nThe base game has 12 different levels/universities, which you gradually unlock. Each university usually\nintroduces a new game mechanic, except for the last level, which gives you a large plot of land to\ncreate your own university using knowledge from the previous levels. Although some levels were \nslightly annoying, the overall variety was quite nice and I personally found it fun to get 3 stars on every university. The game also has a sandbox mode, where you can choose any map you want and customise its rules to your liking.\n\nBuilding has also been improved. Instead of having to fit rooms into prebuilt layouts, you can now construct buildings in any shape you want. The exterior can also be decorated with paths, plants and outdoor furniture. You can also customize wallpapers and floors like in Two Point Hospital. However, newly built rooms always have the default wallpaper and floor, meaning you have to change it everytime you expand your campus. I got used to it, but it is a bit annoying.\n\nThe overall feel is similar to Two Point Hospital. The visuals are pretty much identical, and the in-game world is as humorous as before. Ricky Hawthorn, Harrison Wolff and Nigel B are back on the radio along with newcomers, who offer commentary on university life in Two Point County. The soundtrack is quite nice, but I personally find a bit inferior to Two Point Hospital's OST. It is still pleasant, but it feels less varied.\n\nIf you enjoyed building hospitals in the previous game, then you will probably have fun creating universities in Two Point Campus.

It's not like they change from year to year.\n\nI was seriously so excited for this game to release. Then I played it and didn't realize I had to sign up on the twopointcounty website just to get the golden toilet (was not this way for Two Point Hospital). And didn't know what I was doing wrong in my second campus where I'd fail no matter how much or how little money I spent.\n\nMaybe it'll be good one day, but it's not today.", "timestamp_created": 1669634624, "timestamp_updated": 1669634624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127359474": {"recommendationid": "127359474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028305638", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3392, "last_played": 1669626264}, "language": "english", "review": "quirky good fun, simple to play can have a challenge to master.", "timestamp_created": 1669626406, "timestamp_updated": 1669626406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127334816": {"recommendationid": "127334816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331667551", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1417, "last_played": 1669786944}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super fun!

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The man I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1669482759, "timestamp_updated": 1671790118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127035477": {"recommendationid": "127035477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121742277", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3200, "last_played": 1698144459}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like two point hospital you'll enjoy this :D i find this one quite a bit easier tho", "timestamp_created": 1669472873, "timestamp_updated": 1669472873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568449318408966064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127026562": {"recommendationid": "127026562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035875695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1590, "last_played": 1681108579}, "language": "english", "review": "Following on the heels of Two Point Hospital, Two Point Campus is a detailed and extremely funny simulation game.

Campus is enough like Hospital to feel at home, and different enough to be played instead.\n\nHowever, be aware that as of November '22 the otherwise joyful experience is marred by two highly annoying problems, pathfinding and bugs. \n\nPathfinding is hair-raising. Janitors pick a single target, regardless where on the campus it is. Starting with the third building this gets painfully counterproductive, whether it is trash or intruders. Students do not wait ten seconds to be next in line using anything whatsoever. They will walk one-and-a-half in-game months for some drink of water. This hurts worst with any staffed office (especially medical), since depending on priority interruptions the latter can be blocked for months. That makes \"strategic\" spread of services deadly.\n\nAs for bugs, there are no game-breaking ones, but the bad ones come close enough. Top of the Pops are hijacking and glitching. The first is, when students of the wrong course hijack a lecture theater, they are not even allowed to use. That creates 5 to 8 F's, which depending on your courses can mean having to restart the map. The second is both students and staff glitching through walls into building areas, which do not have an exit. If the glitched is a student, it may take half a school year before being able to rebuild the room one has to scrap (since new stragglers walk into the now open space). Why the program doesn't do a safety check for instance once a month is beyond me.

I absolutely adored Two Point Hospital, although I wasn't even that much into the entire theme of hospitals. When I saw that they were making a follow up game with a campus/uni type of theme to it, I immediately was into it, now after having played it, it leaves me with a vague feeling of sadness and honest to God confusion of what has happened and why I just don't care for this game.\n\nAlthough it seems similar to Two Point Hospital and it certainly is in some core concepts, such as staffing, building rooms etc., it really feels... off. Like something got lost in translation between the two games. In Two Point Hospital you had a tangeable feeling of your rooms and staffing making at least SOME kind of difference, of having an IMPACT on the current scenario you were playing, same goes with almost strategically choosing which items to unlock in oder to benefit you in the next scenario. This feels like... everything is operating BESIDES another, instead of forming an intermeshing whole. Everything feels vague and floaty. Grades go up and down on the basis of intangeable and invisible factors. You are forced into adapting your campus each year, \"just because you have to\", or at least I can't recall any explanation given to me. \n\nWhich leads to the next problem with the game, it feels so very OPAQUE, I mean I PLAYED Two Point Hospital, I KNOW these mechanics and they are not rocket scienece, but at the same time they feel unsufficiently explained. Why do I have to upgrade my campus each year? Is it better to have more different courses, or just to focus on the same specialty more and more? Does having multiple clubs cannibalize members, or do members join both simultaneously? Etc etc etc.\n\nTwo Point Hospital was great at introducing you to scenarios, at introducing new illnesses and how to cure them and gave you incentive to keep on playing to \"3-Star\" a current scenario. In Two Point Campus however, very little is explained (friendships? Love?) as stated before and scenarios become frustrating to beat especially at the beginning and when trying to go past 1 star, because you seemingly just get blasted with sudden criteria that is, at times, way outside what you had to do to get there in the first place. It feels like you are being forced to \"move on\" with a \"1 Star\" in each scenario until you can return at some later poin down the road to have a better chance and more tools to even try to tackle the 2/3 star objectives. Once again creating the exact OPPOSITE of what I really enjoyed with Two Point Hospital. \n\nAll in all - the game is not BAD by any means, it's just falling way short of being more than it's subsystems and also clearly falls short of what Two Point Hospital was and achieved.\n\nTLDR; Get Two Point Hospital, or get this on heavy discount and don't expect too much from it.", "timestamp_created": 1666923450, "timestamp_updated": 1666923450, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535808801651000977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124469467": {"recommendationid": "124469467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023665300", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3685, "last_played": 1692818168}, "language": "english", "review": "I will compare it to Two Point Hospital as essentially, it\u2019s a re-skin but don't take that as a negative.\nIf you had fun with the hospitals, you will definitely have fun here.\n\nComing from the previous game I felt like some things were stripped down as you had more options before (example: you can\u2019t choose the pricing for the drinks or food here) and some things like staff satisfaction or happiness didn\u2019t have any effect on my game while those had an effect in the hospital and some tasks or goals (looking at the hygiene mostly). It is a shorter game as most of the goals are a lot easier while the game is simpler to grasp and there is a sure way to \u201cwin\u201d every campus. Get the exact number of teachers game tells you to get, get 1-2 assistants for the first couple of years and 1-2 janitors. Build all the general buildings and increase the dormitory as high as you can as the years progress. Once the money starts rolling in that\u2019s it, you won, just need to wait while you train the people to either 2 skills to lvl 10 or 3 skills to around lvl 5 each. You will be getting more than enough money and passing grades to know what to do with.\nI had leftover lots and space to build things I didn\u2019t really need to finish up the level and you start to randomly build things to get the points to increase the educational level so you can get more students.\nAt the end I had to try to get people to drop out for that one achievement as nobody dropped out during my regular play.\n\nAll in all the game is not balanced correctly to pose a challenge but that\u2019s fine as it\u2019s the same fun as the previous one albeit with less and faster stages.\nKeep in mind that I finished it here and platinumed on a PS5 while still playing and gathering trophies on a PS4 version so yeah, fun.\n\nPerformance:\nOh man, crashes on both systems (PC and PS5 with the PS4 version crashing the most).\nI was hoping that coming from the Hospital they would figure out a way to offload more workload to other CPU threads but no, it\u2019s the same as there. As the campus gets bigger, the FPS gets lower. On a 3080 and 5800X with game on 1440p it dips to middle 20ties with GPU nod passing 70% and CPU hanging around 20-30%. This was the issue with the Hospital as well. The most FPS stable is the PS4 version running at a lower resolution (clearly visible) on a PS5 but there are those crushes I mentioned so, again, not great.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s a fun game but with the issues above.

Short answer - yes, would I recommend to a Two Point Hospital fan? Yes. Is it as good at TPH? No.\n\nWhen Two Point Campus was announced I was cautiously optimist, what's not to like about the developers behind the amazing Two Point Hospital trying something new? And for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. The game uses the same style as TPH but the mechanics behind the scenes are very different. I've seen some people calling this a \"reskin\" and I really think that is unfair, sure similar items exist (like vending machines, radiators, bins etc) but the way the campus operates is very different to a hospital,\n\nOne of the biggest changes from hospital is the ability to customise the shape/size/number of buildings and alter the outside of buildings. For me, this is a bit of a double edged sword,  the customisation addition is nice, I quite enjoyed designing around the buildings, but I do think the ability to change size/shape/number makes the game too easy. I always felt that hospital deliberately set buildings up like a jigsaw to make things more challenging, here you can just change everything to suit yourself (something I'm sure some fans prefer).\n\nThen we have the mechanics, personally I feel this is where Campus falls down. I'm not a fan of the yearly cycle, essentially the game plays out a year, then pauses for you to setup for the next. You can find yourself simply waiting for the year to play out, or wanting to customise lessons only to find you can only do this between sessions. It also forces you to spend money on additional rooms/staff that you might not necessarily want and subsequently needing a loan. I understand why this has been implemented but don't think it works as well as traditional sims that continue indefinitely. \n\nWhilst I'm talking about mechanics I'm still baffled as to how training and need meeting works. Unlike hospital when staff can simply stop what they're doing to train or take a break, staff (and students) seem to prioritise classes above anything else and can end up in bad shape. I've also found it nearly impossible to train teachers as they're always busy doing something else. For me, the obvious answer to this was to train/rest between years but it's almost as if everyone goes into standby and nothing much happens. Also, for some odd reason the developers have decided to change training for a  traditional room (like hospital), to a machine that can only train 1 person at a time. That's not to say things don't work, they do, just not as well as TPH - and I must add that staff skills are implemented much better than hospital (if you can get them trained)\n\nSo to sum it up, good sim with some unique mechanics  (but a little too easy) and outshined in my opinion by it's predecessor. It might not sound like it but I have enjoyed my time with the game and look forward to seeing what changes are implemented as time goes on.

Being able to freely modify the main buildings and having more choice over the courses you offer (and the students you'll attract as a result) is a nice improvement.\n\nStaff being reduced from 4 types to 3 feels like a real step back, and means teachers feel very easy to manage while assistants and janitors need tougher decisions for how you want to use them. It also seems that staff need to have jobs assigned one by one while in Hospital you could easily manage everyone's jobs on the same screen. Staff happiness also doesn't seem to make any real difference, and there's no threats to leave if you never give them a payrise.\n\nThe students are also, frankly, idiots. I can understand them prioritising classes over their personal needs, but too often they'll complain about all their needs being unfulfilled and wanting to leave while doing nothing to fix that. Wandering past snack machines, toilets, showers, entertainments, with seemingly no goal in their mind.\n\nMost of the challenges are fairly intuitive, though attractiveness goals again mostly involve spamming your campus with items that ruin any possible aesthetic you could have had and made me just want to finish that level and move on rather than stay and enjoy the university I'd built up.\n\nThere's also an odd feeling I got from this game of a lot of the courses feeling samey and uninteresting in a way I never felt with Two Point Hospital. While each course has its own room requirements that don't often overlap, they aren't as fun, varied, or as interesting to watch as treatment rooms in Hospital. With no real emergency situations to deal with it just feels a bit lacking in comparison.\n\nIt's really unfortunate to me that Two Point Campus came after Hospital. In many ways it feels like the game that should have come first as somehow the earlier game had a lot of improvements over this iteration of the formula.

And you just wait the whole year while everybody sticks around, getting prompts what students or employees want to build.

Here its just like choosing in the start of the year that this year i will be getting only psychiatry patients. Next year, i will choose if i want more of the same patients, or i will add some patients that need pharmacy.

The most annoying one is the fact that the training screen doesn't actually show who's requesting training.  It seems odd as it would have been super easy to mark, but isn't available as a visual or in the filters.  This leads to the best way to actually see who wants training being just watching the screen until a staff training bubble pops up.  More over, when you accept a training it closes down the training menu so you have to open and scroll all the way back to where you were for each training.  The fact that these bubbles only show up one at a time, means that you might well be staring at somebody who wants training, but you have to go through some random order for them to bubble.\n\nThis game is exactly what I was expecting, and I like it a lot, but this one example shows they didn't really ever thing about players QOL while building the game.  The character filters that do exist don't actual work, or filter out any useful information.  The information overlays do a worse job than they did in TPH. Many the upgrades don't actually have a visual identification so you will be constantly clicking on things to make sure they are upgraded (looking at you Cheese-ball fields)\n\nMy only other small complaint is the almost nonsensical non-ability to actually schedule your classes.  Placing another lecture hall so that one class can be done in the entire year, even though it would make more sense to just move that one class to another month when the lecture hall is free.  One of the best parts of a management sim is the actual management, but TPC seems more like a expanded idle game.  (Not that that's bad, it just could be more.)\n\nAll this being said, I just got two starts in each level, and I had a pretty good time doing it.  Once you figure out how to work a room for maximum effectiveness it does get kinda repetitive, but I really enjoyed how the last two levels let you do your own thing.  \n\nJust please, please fix the training issues.  It's ridiculous that as soon as a staff gets trained they typically want training again, but the only way to know who wants trained is to literally click through each employee one-by-one.  Moreover, in the stats windows, everybody who isn't currently being trained wants training but when you go through the staff you'll realize that's not true.

Different scenery but everything about the play-style feels like the same game with different pictures. \n\nSo I guess that means if you REALLY loved two point hospital, finished it, and are aching for another one, then this is the game for you.

Two Point Hospital: Version 2. \n\nThough I will say there are A LOT more item placement bugs in this game that I encountered in Two Point hospital. I have had nearly entire building be unusable because a random plant in one corner has somehow \"blocked\" placement of literally anything else. This is clearly a bug but when you have a room of 10 items you end up having to literally rearrange the room to figure out which item is causing the issue. I've now encountered this in multiple scenarios with multiple items and no clear rhyme or reason.

The individual levels were all about the right level of challenge - I got three stars on each without having to restart etc, and I was all done in about 48 hours of game play going at a leisurely pace. \n\nHowever, I cannot recommend the game. It is VERY buggy, still, a month after release. Examples of bugs are:  \n\n1. There are occasional crashes to desktop. These are mostly when copying over a room. My PC is massively over spec for this game, and I note others have had a similar issue. \n\n2. Pathing issues. Students get lost - I currently have one refusing to complete an assignment because the library is too far away. He is standing in a library, with the required item, an assistant present and every desk type available to him. \n\n3. Outside visitors have a particular issue. I first noticed this in one of the earlier levels, where an actor stood for years wondering how to get to a marketing campaign video shoot. But more annoyingly, bands who turn up to the student union quite randomly are unable to find their way to the union. At one stage I had a gaggle of 15 musicians waiting on the campus, none of whom would move (even when I put a fountain on top of them ;-)). Jasmine Odyssey turned up to one gig and just stood next to the stage, even though Shoegraze arrived immediately afterwards and played as usual. Just now, Jasmine stood actually on stage, shufflingabout and not singing. This is not what I paid her for! It is not merely cosmetic: student XP translates into earnings and they weren't getting it. \n\n4. The sandbox is a hot mess. I played in Challenge mode (where you have no unlocked and have to earn your special in-game currency for unlocked items, called kudosh). I got to the two star level after about 4 hours, logged off for the night, and when I logged on the next day it had lost all the items I had unlocked and all the kudosh I had squirrelled away was gone. Advice on the boards to save the game in a different slot was successful, but as the slot has to match your current career slot, you can only sandbox once. \n\n5. And that issue highlights what I suspect is the root of the trouble. This is a cross platform game. You have very limited save options (you will not be save scumming here) and the interface seems optimised for consoles. I paid for a PC game, and I expect it to work on a PC - and ideally to work like a PC game.\n\nIt is such a shame as I love this studio and there is a lot of lovely stuff in the game, But ultimately if bits don't work, it is a beta at best and I cannot recommend it.

Our email address is campus-support@twopointstudios.com \n\n2) Issues with visitors becoming stuck we believe is now fixed in our latest patch \n\n3) The issue with Sandbox not saving correctly is now fixed in our latest patch.

With Two Point Campus, I have been playing nonstop and have experienced a consistent stream of new and fun things to unlock. Your mileage will vary depending on what you thought of TPH and *how* you like to play this kind of game.\n\nI find the progression and challenge curves to be near perfect - Each University is unique and quirky in its own way, and the vastly different courses means a huge variety of room styles and items, letting you get really creative whilst balancing budget and efficiency. I have been able to design some really nice buildings and watch the students and staff live their charmingly expressive lives in them. Depending on my mood I switch between the campuses and work on the goals. The earlier years are more tricky because you're low on cash, and the later years are challenging due to the sheer scale and number of staff and students to accommodate and keep happy.\n\nIn my opinion, the team really ironed out some of the less satisfying elements of TPH and gave us a highly polished, fun, and zaney treat in TPC. \n\nIt's not completely perfect; I wish my students were a little more efficient at managing their needs (eg being very unhappy due to boredom but ignoring the entertainment around them to get a drink and then idle on a table), and I would like to micro-manage my staff a tiny bit more (eg Assistants with the highest medical training should always go to work in the Medical office), but there is nothing that is more than a very minor annoyance. And I am pretty picky.\n\nHonestly I adore the design and creativity of each University, and the unique challenges with each. This game truly scratches the creative itch as well as the micro-managing/strategy itch beautifully. It feels like the team took their time to make this right, and not just reuse stuff from TPH to quickly cash in.

I think it goes a bit quicker so I do not get bored with it as fast. Each location has a focus that is different enough that I don't feel like I'm doing the same thing over and over. Also, it is pretty easy to achieve the goals with some strategy and forethought. I'm not a big micromanager but I rarely have issues with money or getting to three stars. If I do get in the red, it doesn't take long to start building back up and once you do then you build up fast.

This has all the same pitfalls, issues, as the other school simulators and none of the benefits. \n\nIn all school simulators, the semester cycle is brutal late game, but for this game it's so much worse since you're supposed to do multiple campuses eventually, so the problem is in every campus. Usually in school simulators you focus on one school that you're nitpicking and upgrading constantly with a lot to manage, but in this there is a little less depth for the sake of how two point likes to do their levels. \n\nOn top of that, this has no charm and it seems a little unpolished and buggy. The UI struggles to explain the basics and is unintuitive. In TPH, there are shortcuts for selling and moving things, but there is also buttons and backup buttons so you always have some sort of option so you can get what you need to get done, done. This has none of that so I really struggled with 'ust selling items I already had? I think its like... backspace? ??? \n\nI think I even heard a voiceline from TPH?

The first type of class you open is...a cooking class. I'm like, okay? And why is that funny? It's not. All of the silly, funny aspects of TPH are essentially gone.\n\nTedious: the best way for me to explain this is that there is a lot more WAITING in TPC than in TPH. You basically just note a problem, put a few things down to hopefully take care of it, and wait. And wait. It might be 2-3 semesters before problems are cleared up. I never felt like I had to wait for much in TPH. Also, sometimes problems simply don't clear up for no reason. Like \"attractiveness\" will be down, and I'll put decorations EVERYWHERE, inside and out, and the number stays the same.

I like the way you can customize the campus and building, grow or shrink it at will, that templates and copy were an option from the getgo.

It is fun to play and has a unique humour. To get 36 stars I needed like 80 hours (could have been faster, but made some mistakes), which is worth the price.\n\nThere are still some flaws:\n- Students are often unhappy for no appearant reason. They have several urgent needs and the facilities are there to satisfy all of them, but they just refuse to do so. Makes sense: if I am hungary, thirsty and need to go to toilet, I am also standing between the toilets, water dispenser and snack shops and feel ... just unhappy.\n- At some point it becomes repetitive. The goals are often superficially different, but actually very similar. Sometimes you need to increase attractiveness, sometimes happyness, which can be done in a quite similar way.\n- The worst thing is that some goals and they way you can achieve it ... just. doesn't. make. sense. If you need to increase attractiveness to 80%, what will you do? Sure, distribute dozens of copies of the same item over the campus, put the same poster hundrets of times next to each other. Of course this makes the campus 'attractive'. Sometimes, you are even urged to make decisions that would cost every real manager the job just to fulfill a goal. For instance, if your campus is running well, but you need to achieve a higher level, you just build expenseive, but not necessary rooms to increase your 'prestive'. Or to achieve a certain monthly income and are a little bit shy of, you just fire some of your employees to reach the goal. Once you have reached it, it does not matter anymore if your decision caused serious harm to your business in the long term, because the criteria for earning the next star will usually not directly build on top of your previous achievments.\n\nI described the negative points in much more detail, but please don't misunderstand this as being unsatisfied with the game.

Besides, this game is significantly more focused on building than TPH (which was already the main aspect of that game), youre not trying to process patients as quickly as possible, but provide a good life for your students with a wide range of items.\n\nSecond, the downtime. Yeah i will admit Campus could be better on this, but lets not act like this wasnt also big in Hospital. Taking time to train your staff, decorate, and waiting for the money to build up so you can build that new area. Still, i do think Campus should have had you do the enrollment thing every semester instead of every year. Besides, Hospital was always a chill game first and foremost, actually thats a significant part of why some of its DLCs arent so favorably reveiwed on Steam (even if the larger community likes them).\n\nLastly, and the one i feel is the least valid, that its a reskin. Really, when you think about it almost every building management games are reskins, build up areas to make money to build up more areas. And i do think that Campus sets itself apart in a way that shakes it down to the core even if it is similar to TPH in many ways. Like i said earlier, the goal is to build a nice college so your students pass their exams, not process patients as fast as possible. As well as Campus giving you greater control over the environment instead of just challenging you to just jigsaw rooms together. Although i do think part of the less warm reception is that it IS a different game from hospital in key areas, and thus it wont be everybody's jam.\n\nAnyways, this is still all subjective, but yeah at least give it a shot, Steam is great about refunds anyways if you dont like it. Also not to mention its only been two weeks and youre seeing people who have 100+ hours, so yeah, speaks to the replayability of this game (which it is a lot more than TPH).", "timestamp_created": 1661375242, "timestamp_updated": 1661554259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820776402950286865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121182772": {"recommendationid": "121182772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075366511", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1536, "last_played": 1661548602}, "language": "english", "review": "As a non-Two Point Hospital player, I would say this game is pretty entertaining and I really enjoyed the campaign.

Pretty much this reeks of a re-skin for quicker development and for publishers to make money with little effort. There are some good quality of life improvements, less micromanaging (although I do wish they kept the assigning personnel, as sometimes I want workers to be SPECIFICALLY for certain buildings (see: Research Only Professors, Marketing Only Assistants, etc.)), and the ability to get a blank plot of land to create your building is a great addition. The funny campus types are also good and bring in some interesting game mechanics.\n\nBut the problem with this game actually revolves around the facts that it's a re-skin and the actual game loop. The game loop is this; you set up the course(s) (you have at max 16 total, although 2 should be the max (and 1 is more realistic for the game, I'll explain in a little bit)), you plop down buildings and rooms, hire your personnel, go through the school year (where it's pretty much on auto, not much else outside of training, research, marketing, and scheduling), you get the awards, and you go into Summer School mode. And this is where the re-skin, and the shortcomings of the prior game, collides with the game mechanics and creates issues.\n\nIn essence, after the 1st year you are in Summer School mode, and you have objectives that you MUST complete before the next school year. This requires you to; build more buildings/rooms, hire more personnel, and grow your campus. This is where the design issues of TPH smacks up against the wall of the developers not wanting to include VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT (I.E.- FLOORS). You, after a couple of turns in the game loop, will have an impossible issue. The game will demand that you grow out your campus, but you have NO room to do so. At that point, the game is pretty much over with. You can't grow out the campus, you can't grow UP the campus, and you have demands from the game that you can't complete. \n\nLike I stated before, 2 courses should be the max, but even that is impossible with this game. One course is really maxing the game out, and if you're trying to have anything as close to a real campus (multiple courses per campus), you're out of luck. This is also a shortcoming in comparison to TPH, which while having certain things that each area needs more of, doesn't pigeon hole you into only one avenue for your hospital. \n\nAgain, some good things, it's good for mindless fun.

Only the very start of some missions can be difficult if you spend too much money somehow, but overall it's very easy. The pace of the game is slow and I find it relaxing.\n\nThe first interesting thing about the game is the theme itself, I don't think I have ever played a game where I had to manage universities, students and courses. This is also done in a unique way. In this kind of management game the goal is usually to deal with the random influx of \"clients\" over time and the chaos inherent to it. However, in TPC it's quite different because you are the one deciding how many students come in your campus at the \"start\" of each year and their number doesn't change throughout the year. \n\nThere are different courses you can choose each year with varying level of difficulty, different students archetypes, different rooms/items requirements, etc... You can also make students join a club that can affect what they do during their free time.\n\n\nSomething I like is how some courses, students archetypes and clubs can directly affect the whole campus. For example during the Archaeology courses, artefacts can be excavated and you can place them as decorative elements anywhere in the university or just sell them to earn some cash. Regarding the students archetypes, the Poshos for example can randomly give you money from time to time. For the club, we have for example the nature club and a student joining it can sometimes sweep trash to keep the university clean, etc.\n\nAs usual an important aspect of the game is to manage the needs of both students and employees to keep them happy. Students happiness is ultimately one of the most important of the game since it increases their learning rate. Higher learning rate directly affects how much money can be earned.\n\nFor the employees, there is the usual training aspect to make them better at performing some tasks. Research is useful to unlock new equipment, upgrades or even to earn extra cash. Their needs are a bit more basic than students and easier to fulfill.\n\nCustomization in this game is excellent and being able to manage both indoor and outdoor elements is refreshing. Changing floors and walls, the quantity of items available, the possibility to add multiple doors to a room are all great things.\n\n\nFor the negative aspects, as stated before the game is a bit too easy. \nThere is also a class scheduler that automatically manages in which rooms, courses, teachers and students are assigned. While it usually does a good job at first, later it seems to \"bug\" and ask for more rooms and/or teachers than needed for some reason. It's a bit frustrating and maybe a missed opportunity to not make the schedule system part of the management system by allowing the player to change/optimize it.\n\nCompared to their previous game Two Point Hospital, devs added many quality of life elements. Unfortunately, some of the same issues are still present like characters getting stuck sometimes (even though it was quite rare for me). AI and the queue system could be improved with a different set of priorities. They should fulfill the \"critical\" needs first for example. The closest available student should enter the private tuition, medical office, pastoral support rooms first instead of being part of the queue and block others, etc. \n\nHowever, the biggest issue for me is the placement of items especially without the snapping which is still present in this game. After placing some items, the game sometimes suddenly tells me an item is \"blocking\" and prevents me from adding more. It can also suddenly happen when reloading a save even though everything was fine before, or when placing a copy/template of a room even though the original room didn't have any issue. It's very frustrating especially when the core gameplay is all about placing items. Fortunately, it rarely happens when snapping is enabled but I feel like it's limiting creativity and it's just so annoying when it happens...\n\nThere are 3 stars that can be earned during each mission. Maybe it's because I played TPH a lot in the past but many of the objectives felt uninteresting and repetitive (especially the ones asking to increase the campus level).\n\n\nNevertheless, these were not major issues for me and I loved playing this game.\nIt's excellent, fun and I can't wait to see what the next TPS game will be.", "timestamp_created": 1661161363, "timestamp_updated": 1661161895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121036862": {"recommendationid": "121036862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352732096", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1661890270}, "language": "english", "review": "lots off fun can play for hours", "timestamp_created": 1661148541, "timestamp_updated": 1661148541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121034509": {"recommendationid": "121034509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044731231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1045, "last_played": 1671464149}, "language": "english", "review": "Two Point Studios have completely outdone themselves by creating a game that's far inferior to TPH and despite having a delayed release has managed to offer many of the same bugs and issues TPH had when it first released.

Especially when it comes to traits that people have. In Two Point Hospital you had some really powerful things like Green Thumb, which really helped with gardening/watering,traits that entertain people they interact with, could be cheaper or more expensive, could learn faster or slower. \n\nTwo Point Campus on the other hand really only has Movement Speed, Littering, and Hygiene, which unfortunately tend to be more negative than positive, and the only one that really matters is littering. It's a real problem regardless of how many trash cans you have, which leads into the second thing. The A.I has some weird prioritizing, especially when you don't have access to address the issues yourself. People are Absolutely Bursting and Filthy, but don't use the Showers, Hand Sanitizers, or Toilets right next to them.\nThis makes it really hard to complete specific objectives that require a certain threshold to be met.\n\nThat being said, if these would be addressed the game would be near perfect. It has far more flexibility than Hospital, and allows for things like make specialty campuses, events allow the game to feel more dynamic. Student requests subtly guide you on what to improve on the most. Different courses require very large facilities instead of the old 3x3 or 5x5, and outdoors has way more going on, including being used for facilities, creating a more picturesque environment, and having a positive affect on people in it.\n\nBuildings are far more flexible, with plots being open to being built \"empty\" or with structures. Now you can build the buildings as you want, with entrances and exits where you want them. This really allows for a huge amount of player agency. It really adds a much needed dimension.\n\nThere is so much to like about this game, and once the A.I isn't so bad at taking care of themselves, it will be so much better.", "timestamp_created": 1661099702, "timestamp_updated": 1661099702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121004050": {"recommendationid": "121004050", "author": {"steamid": "76561199235837299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1671398338}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome", "timestamp_created": 1661098060, "timestamp_updated": 1661098060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121003432": {"recommendationid": "121003432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057241108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1690, "last_played": 1683673767}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.  I've played a lot of Two-Point Hospital, so pullover in how the game operates was quite easy due to my experience with their other game.  I can see if I was completely new to the series and how things operate, the instructions for this game in the opening aren't as clear as they could be.  There's a lot of complex concepts that I've picked up from threads and game-experience that aren't lined out in this game.  An example of this, which is new to Two-Point Campus, is the campus building features. I made it through 4 universities, all 3 stars, before figuring out there's a way to build paths.  \n\nBuild mode can be a little weird at times (sometimes I consistently click the rooms in an attempt to grab an object that was misplaced instead of actually grabbing the objects).  Overall though, the game is fantastic with just a few little tweaks I'd make to the building portion.  I'd also like a few more screens to be more easily accessible such as job lists -- it'd be nice to see an overall instead of having to go into individual staff screens to get to their job list.  I'd like room objects to function like they did in Two-Point Hospital such as marketing desks and training items.  Right now, you have to click the room to get to training instead of clicking the item. Same with Marketing -- clicking the desk shows you details about the desk, not the actual marketing options.\n\nOverall I'd give the game an 8/10, deducting just a few points off for some awkward building issues (they work, just awkward sometimes), and then issues outlined above. Some things could be explained a little more clearly.  And PLEASE add more entertainment options!

I bought Two Point Hospital on day one and loved it. I played every DLC and loved it. I Really *really* wanted to like this game, but I just.... don't... After beating the first two campuses I simply have no desire to start a third and my time with TPC is probably already at an end.\n\nThe style is very similar to TPH, with the same cute graphics, the same radio presenters and ( possibly unpopular opinion ) many of the same jokes forced into a slightly different context to sound more \"university'y\" Once I noticed this it bugged me more and more. \n\nFor some inexplicable reason they've also added a tonne of menu options and icons that add a never ending cascade of popups and panels for you to scroll through. The result was that I spent more time squinting at button tooltips than playing the game. Despite all the extra UI buttons I still can't find what I'm looking for most of the time (I'm looking at you events organiser screen)\n\nWhat really lets this game down though is the core gameplay loop. Its just dull. You set up some rooms, click the \"start year\" button and survive a barrage of whiny requests for \"a new bench\" or \"a guitar poster\" (once you've filtered out the incessant monthly profit/loss mails - what was wrong with the TPH style popup!? )  which you dutifully plonk down (literally anywhere) to push a happiness bar up. The academic year ends, some more bars fill up. your progress to \"X/10 students passing whatever\" goes up and you rinse and repeat until you get your next star. \n\nI was able to define a winning strategy for this game which was to start the year, leave it running in the background for 5 minutes whilst I did something else, return and fulfil all the requests, repeat the cycle until the end of the year and repeat. In my opinion, any game where you can spend  half of your time not playing the game and still win is doing something wrong\n\nYou also spend an inordinate amount of time designing rooms to be nice looking. For people who enjoy the sims, that's great, but I've never wanted or cared about attractive rooms. I'm much more interested in playing the game and beating its management challenges. Two Point Hospital was great in that it gave you the choice - want to deck all your GP's offices out with posters? go for it! Want to completely ignore it and occasionally crank out a prestige 5 room to stop a staff member leaving? That's cool too! Being forced into becoming an interior decorator was really not what I wanted to spend my time doing.\n\nAfter TPH's fast-paced, challenging and complex, but intuitive, overlapping game systems, TPC feels like a \"dumbed down for casual gamers\" clone that somehow manages to port across all of the individual parts of TPH whilst completely losing the heart of what made it great.

Definitely not worth 40 bucks. \n\nSome things are pretty annoying:\n1) Cannot build vertically. All rooms and buildings are single-floor only. When was the last time you saw a university with no multi-floor buildings?\n\n2) Every room needs pointless decorations and knick-knacks to increase attractiveness and campus level. I don't understand why staff with their own rooms cannot put up their own posters and other decorations in their rooms?\n\n3) The humorous take on classes seems funny at first but it quickly wears off. Would like to see some actual real-world courses, items, etc. in the game. Some aspects such as those of knight school and intruders are just annoying. \n\n4) Too much micromanagement in some aspects of the game. You sometimes need to manually assign a private tutor to students who are at risk of failing. Seems enough at first but when you have multiple courses each with 3-4 years of students, it quickly become tiresome to do these assignments manually. \n\n5) Too many pointless or annoying notifications about students needing love benches, specialty kiosks, parties or events that bury some of the important ones such as students needing items to complete assignments. \n\nOverall, I think I just find the whole game a bit juvenile and over-the-top for my liking. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1660951060, "timestamp_updated": 1660951060, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120907274": {"recommendationid": "120907274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018598516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 532, "last_played": 1661232201}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun is had by all!", "timestamp_created": 1660945842, "timestamp_updated": 1660945842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120906164": {"recommendationid": "120906164", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997420219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1662043982}, "language": "english", "review": "n.a", "timestamp_created": 1660944181, "timestamp_updated": 1660944181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120905549": {"recommendationid": "120905549", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992738030", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 2388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2365, "last_played": 1671007980}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks like they learned a bit from their previous attempt.

(Not, as some might think, One Point Campus.) I've already had a day's worth of playing and i'm at the musicality level whining about lack of money. this game is not without it's flaws. It has tons of flaws, really. There is a gamebreaking bug (especially noteable on the culinary map) that sometimes happens with room furniture, buying a new plot, and the game item y-level breaking, causing everything to be too low/under foundation and not be useable/placeable. Sometimes random rooms, more likely class-based ones with larger items, will have every item give a warning about not useable, until you pick up and put down one of the items again. Item collision frames and y leveling needs to be readjusted. Deleting a room will leave posters sometimes up and still useable, floating until you try to place or move something in that hallway. \n\nAnyway, other than the weird bugs that make it so i need to reload, this game was exactly as i expected humor-wise. Campus management is a lot harder than hospital management is right now, and there's no co-op (super-bug in hospital) right now. Hopefully with expansions and bug updates they will fix the collision issues and everything will be better.

I've played Two Point Hospital and, while a realize that the hospital campuses don't necessarily need multiple stories, Two Point Campus would actually do well with the mechanic. After all, you are managing a freakin' university. There has to be room for all the programs that the university offers (not to mention all the people), and more floors would be the ideal solution. If you run out of room for the different programs, how are you going to expand? Yes, the game is extensive, and you probably won't run into that problem very quickly, but it is still a viable problem, as the possibility of it happening is real. The only reason that I am saying this is because I am seven hours into the game, and there is no multi-story mechanic anywhere to be seen.\n\nIt would be nice to have a new mechanic to distinguish it from two-point hospital.\n\nOverall, everything else is good. The fact that you can build a school and allocate different rooms is nice. Also, hiring your own staff is a welcome touch, as it puts in charge of nearly every aspect.

I suppose it's over half, so thumbs tentatively up.\n\nThe longer story is, although this is essentially Two Point Hospital with a college instead, that is exactly the problem. The hospital one was a continuous affair, where at any moment the composition of the patients could start to change, or you'd just get more of them, so it was a continuous action and reaction. The college format splits it into school years and vacations, with the courses (and thus number of students) only changing between years, and thus no real reason to build more classes or hire more teachers other than between the years. The game also tells you exactly what rooms and what teachers you'll need over the next year, so again, it's not a dynamic do this and react to that affair like in TPH. Just meet those requirements and then sit and watch for a year.\n\nWorse yet, although the game doesn't force you to, it strongly rewards sitting on your butt during that vacation, dismissing employment candidates until a more qualified one shows up. I mean, you could hire the first teacher that pops up, and then spend a small fortune and two years training them to level 5 in whatever course they're teaching, or sit and wait until a level 5 on shows up. Which is very boring.\n\nThe gaining experience and levels from TPH is also gone, basically giving you one less thing to react to.\n\nAdd to that such tasks as \"make 5000$ a month profit\" to clear the last star of a level. Since one time stuff like research don't count, essentially you may find yourself just waiting for a month where the student experience bonus pushes you just over the threshold. Since xp is gained faster at low levels, AND you can only add more students for a new year, essentially that tends to be one of the very first months of a year. Then you'll twiddle your thumbs for the rest of the year, hoping you can do better the next one. Again, that's very boring, and I consider including such tasks to be simply bad game design.\n\nNow add some more niggling details, like that the AI seems a bit... lobotomized. I've repeatedly watched such stuff as a janitor just running back and forth because it can't seem to decide between two tasks, and ending up doing neither until something else to do appears.\n\nNow also add such... bizarre decisions as that you can't increase a lecture room's capacity by adding more chairs, nor does there seem to be any obvious way to increase the number of lecture rooms for a course and year. You can and will literally end up with stuff like 31 students for year 1 and the fixed 8 students capacity for the lecture room. I realize that they had to make other stuff like the private tuition and library and upgrading other rooms too useful SOMEHOW, but it seems bizarre that adding 8 more seats in the lecture room doesn't actually increase its capacity.\n\nEtc.\n\nOn the whole, it's not the worst game, especially during the summer draught of new games, and you can get some enjoyment out of it. Hence the tentative thumbs up.

I didn't feel any of this in Two Point Hospital, but it may not be a fair comparison to make since I went into TPH completely new and now with TPC I have some of the concepts already down pat and there aren't that many new ones.\n\nSo, it feels a bit tedious already.  The main issue is that the campus runs a year at a time, just like a school would.  During that year you might have some things you can do/handle/upgrade but many times you end up just fast forwarding through the entire year because the objective you need to accomplish isn't possible that year.  That's a big design flaw in my opinion.\n\nTPH had a lot more charm as well.  TPC feels like it wants to be different and is hanging out with the emo kids and playing guitar.  I actually love the music, but it's not charming.  The art style didn't get super updated, but it's not really charming anymore either.  Things got less rounded but without any added realism so it just feels a little bit identity-less.

There is more customisation options, more creativity, more interesting behaviours from your students.

You can destroy, build or edit any campus buildings, getting the perfect size and layout for your vision. No more struggling to squeeze in large rooms into a small building! Just make the building bigger!\n\n2) Outdoor space is useful:\nHospital was all about rooms and hallways, but Campus is really about the whole campus space. Put down gardens, create outdoor foodhalls, create romantic little nooks, put down club meeting spaces etc. Lay paths, put down mowed lawns, hedges, lighting, heating etc. No longer do u have to fill your corridors with benches, put those benches outside!\n\n\nIf you've played these sorts of games before, you won't be challenged. It's not a difficult game. But the added creativity is a real step up and will extend the lifespan.

The development team, famous for Two Point Hospital, created their game themed around a campus university setting. Their games are completely casual, fun and humorous. Also, unlike typical business simulations that are often made very exquisitely and seriously, it's easy for players to jump in and learn the game. Ready to play?\n\nBuild your campus, your way. The game has a stage mode and a sandbox mode, but once you start, you'll focus on clearing each stage level in the basic mode. Although it is a simulation game, the structure of the game is easy. First, you buy land and build a building on it. After filling in the infrastructure in this way, you will develop a course plan for the year. You can choose which courses to teach. However, It is impossible to delete a course once opened, but it is possible to develop a department or add a new department before the start of each year. In other words, the basic game concept is to continuously expand the facility after making a one-year course plan.\n\nIt may change depending on whether or not there is DLC in the future, but in the basic game stage, about 20 departments are prepared, and there are educational facilities that are necessary in advance to open each new department. Most departments in this game are closer to the realm of fantasy than their actual real life counterparts, if they have one. Therefore, it does not take long to master the game itself, and if you have some money management skills, you can easily complete the game. The scale or detail of the game is not deep. After completing each stage and experiencing sandbox mode a few times, there is nothing more to do at the current stage of the game. Future DLCs or MODs will determine the true value of this game.\n\nTwo Point Campus is a pretty interesting 'casual' management simulation game. From a casual standpoint, this game nails its basic mechanics well and still manages to entertain. Although it lacks a bit of depth, the game allows players to create their own university theme park. Basically, it's a game where you build a campus you like and watch the students play and study hard there. Above all, this game is well designed in that it shows that the campus's owner is also the student. If you like or are interested in these kinds of games, this is definitely a game worth trying.

I love that I can now build and landscape my own lot, something that I wish I could do with TPH. \n3. The theme is different: running a university instead of a hospital but the interface feels familiar and thus, easy to learn. There are lots of tabs and stats to monitor (which is a good thing). \n4. Most importantly, this game manages to make me care for my students (which TPH does not. I only care for my patients as means to improve my cure rate). I cheer inwardly when my students make friends/fall in love. I want them to have the time of their life. I  care whether or not they complete their assignments/ace their courses.\n\nSo yeah, love the game.

In that sense, your playstyle doesn't really change - you feel continual growth. In 2PCampus, you spend the \"school-season\" doing micro actions like taking care of student grades, fixing up some infrastructure, hosting events, and buying new things that your students need. After the school year, you spend the \"off-season\" making macro-decisions like larger campus changes, adding courses, building management, etc. \n\n  I think Two Point Campus hits the perfect balance of being familiar enough yet different; it uses all the same systems as Two point Hospital, but you're NOT building a hospital. And because of that, things are a little different. \n \n We don't get the sandbox/discovery aspect of finding a new disease and then trying to build systems to handle it. Instead, a lot of the focus is on a combination of infrastructure management (building design/placement) and micro-management (making sure certain students don't fail, ensuring proper staffing, hiring better teachers).\n\n  The music is ok, they pay homage to 2PHospital in some of the dialogue (which I find cute), and the UI is pretty clean. I love the addition of landscape customization, so you can choose your own building layout and outdoor pathways (I always had an issue with awkward 2PHospital layouts). Lastly, I love how students have more personality than 2PHospital patients; they have archetypes, they make social connections, join clubs, have dates, ... and if you're like me and decide to name a few, you'll feel a bit sad when they graduate and disappear into the nether. \n\n If you like the -concept- of university management, I think you'll love Two Point's take on this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1660426624, "timestamp_updated": 1660426624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120579386": {"recommendationid": "120579386", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086342408", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1685546447}, "language": "english", "review": "gud gam", "timestamp_created": 1660426244, "timestamp_updated": 1660426244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120577844": {"recommendationid": "120577844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002234475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 810, "last_played": 1691153517}, "language": "english", "review": "This is such an amazing version of the \"Tycoon genre\" by the Two Point Studios.

After fully beating the game, with a few two stars, and a few three stars in various places, I shall finally give this a review.\n\nFirst of all, the game is genuinely quite fun, if you are relying on the humor, and gimmick's that made Two Point Hospital great. Otherwise, if you are buying this, expecting a fully different game, don't. It is indeed, exactly like the first game, without very much difference, except that you are building a college, instead of a hospital, and that comes with a few new quirks.\n\nThe game is a solid 8-12 hours, to complete, depending on if ya rush, though I'm sure someone could do it a lot quicker. I didn't encounter many bugs during that time, aside from students and rarely, a staff member, just walking around, both needing to take the biggest dump of their lives, and also smelling astoundingly bad, but apparently not having enough time to do that inbetween the entire school year. It's able to be worked around, but it certainly needs to be looked at by the Dev Team.\n\nIt's very easy to cheese this game, and admittedly, I most certainly did for the Archeology mission (Thanks SpiffingBrit!) but for the most part, no cheese is needed. You really don't feel inclined to add other courses during a mission either, cause you don't really need to unless the game specifies that you to.

Its just got everything that I look for in a management sim with an added quirky and whacky elements that make the game fun.\n\nFirst off the game introduces you to the different game mechanics through its campaign that you can play (if you so choose) or if you want to skip all of that, you can go straight into sandbox style. I love that each and every instance where the campaign takes you, that each and every one of them have a different theme from the last. You can start off with the vanilla university campus as an intro then you can do a cooking school, then sports school and even a whacky wizard school (that is totally not a rip off :P).\n\nSecondly, the management part of the game where you have to maintain a flow of income while maintaining standards in the school, is to be frank, very intuitive. For example in the wizarding school, you are presented with a challenge where you start off with a debt and not a lot of funds at the beginning. So you have to strike a balance between not going too much into debt while also making sure your students have the resources to succeed in their courses. The game keeps you motivated by presenting challenges that add onto the overall goal of the game. I feel that managing the finances is much easier in this game than Two Point Hospital, but I think that's because monetary and financial rewards are coupled so well with how well the students are doing academically (as opposed to in Two Point hospital where it's a basic cash flow in/out). This means that the better the students are doing in your school, the better your school's finances will be. If the students are not learning well (because you didn't build any private tutors, for example), your school will suffer. I feel that the game mechanics integrate well into each other in this game.\n\nLastly, I like that Two Point Campus kept its quirky and whacky charms from its last iteration. There's just so many cool and funny things that I find myself excited to see what kind of whacky or quirky thing was I going to see next. \n\nI feel that the game is complete and does not lack in any features at all and I am excited to see what kind of DLCs we are going to get for this game.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game. This game is super chill but with enough funny elements that will keep you interested. It is an improvement from the previous game (Two Point Hospital) as I can clearly see that the devs learned from the feedback they received.

Plus you follow them all throughout to graduation to develop that attachment.\n\nI also personally find the course variety more interesting than the illness variety in Hospital, and the customization has seen a boost as well. I can only see this being further improved with time.\n\nThere are some flaws and poor choices, though. For one, Campus is every bit as slow to open up as Hospital. You unlock things star by star in the story campaign portion. There is a true sandbox mode you can indulge (and I appreciate it), but you still have to complete the most basic of tutorials to access it. I can tolerate this, but I can definitely see the drag dropping others. Further, and maybe this is just me, but I expected to see more nods to Hospital with medical students.

Love the look of each each campus and the classroom machines are so cute.\n2. I'm happy that they have allowed us to be able to change colors on the furniture - like the beds have several different bedspreads that you can choose from to better fit your room design.\n3. The Devs put a lot of effort in the design of the furniture and machine and it is really appreciated.\n4. I especially like how you can free-build your lots.  Love this option as I like making the shapes of my building to fit to my classrooms and not trying to fit my classroom in a predetermined building - really a wonderful idea.\n5. You can save you room as a blueprint so you do not have to recreate it.\n6. I do wish we had more \"items\" available in the game, but I sure more will come with the DLC - AND, I can't wait to see what the Devs come up with for those. \n~Edited - It seems that more items show up the more you advance in the game so I needed to update my review to say WOOHOO!\n7. Love how we can decorate the outside of the building by adding trees, flower plots, and benches.\n\nSome problems I found are...\n1. Students show needing to go to the bathroom even when they are standing right next to one, yet they move away and do a potty dance for a long time before finally making it to the bathroom - not sure if this is by design or an issue with the game. Same goes for showers.\n2. I noticed that the tutor teacher's hand disappear into the desk a lot.\n\nGreat game Devs!  I still have two more campuses to grow, but I can't wait to see what comes next.  \n\nEdited to add -  I just love all the thought that went into this game.

There's definitely a lot more to do here, but it's basically the same concept. Meet the goals, build up your property, don't go broke. I'm already ready for DLC lol.\n\nPROS\n-You can now edit outside of the building, and you can put buildings down in any configuration over blank areas you've purchased (or, if you'd prefer, you can have them build it for you).\n-They've added a lot more in terms of game play. You can schedule events in certain rooms, decorate outside (see previous point), choose and upgrade the programs your campus provides, and more.\n-The new friends and sweethearts feature is pretty cute. I think the Double Jump Bed is funny.\n-Clubs are super useful. I like that you can encourage certain skills based on your play style and student needs.\n-I have no idea why but the bookworms are satisfying to catch. You do get a small reward, but I just enjoy catching them. I would buy these as plushies, no hesitation.\n-Pride flag? Pride flag. I hope they add more in the future.\n-More radio DJs for variety. It isn't the same three over and over. They're here, but more have been added. P.S. the joke about Tarquin Foxbridge blowing his nose on official documents kills me, or any joke at his expense really, especially as an educator myself.\n\nCONS\n-The game sort of assumes you've played Two Point Hospital. There is a bit of tutorial, but if you haven't played the first game you might be a bit confused.\n-The UI is clunky. I've played for 15 hours and sometimes I still forget where to go to find what I need. I know TPH has a bit less in terms of things to do, but the UI was much smoother.\n-The AI on the Peeps can seem to be a little wonky. For example, I have bathrooms in the most accessable places in every building, but they'll still wait until bursting to go. They'll go to class while bursting or starving, which lowers my school rating or even triggers the drop-out warning.\n-Getting staff without segnificant 'bad' traits is a chore. Maybe I just got bad RNG, but it takes a long time to get staff without bad traits, or at least the bad traits I'm willing to tolerate. So many have Bin-Blindness and that's a no go for me, especially when you have objectives for attractiveness. There are already students with Bin-Blindness, so having staff with it as well makes a mess. I wonder if there's a way to add on to training that would help lessen the affects of their bad traits.\n-At the end of the academic year, if you upgrade courses you also need to upgrade your campus by buying new rooms or hiring staff. The problem is, you have to sort of anticipate how much money you'll need to fund this since you don't earn tuition money during this period. During the academic year there are lots of expenses and you often need to buy or research items for courses or the Peeps will get a bad grade, fail, or even drop out.

If you played Two Point Hospital and enjoyed it, but eventually lost interest because the monotony of the game play set in, then this game is 100% for you.\n\nThis reason I'm writing this is solely to highlight how Two Point has looked critically at Hospital and reworked things to fix a lot of the gameplay weaknesses in Campus. Some of the noteable ones:\n\n[list]\n[*] You are encouraged and rewarded for adding a [i]variety[/i] of items to rooms. Gone are the days of certificate spam.\n[*] Because you're encouraged to add lots of things, it also makes sense to make [i]rooms bigger than their minimum required size[/i].\n[*] The focus is shifted from getting things done quickly to [i]getting things done right[/i]. No more is the sole focus on processing people as quickly as possible, a much higher emphasis is on quality since, well, you're stuck with student for a whole year.\n[*] Everyone knows you can build buildings now. The side-effect of course is that now if you're just one square shy of building something you need in a building you can just... [i]make buildings bigger[/i].\n[*] Better customization... and combined with different student types, different classes, [i]customizing things is something you might actually bother with[/i]. Landscape paints and outdoor customization, 'nuf said.\n[*] Students are just [i]more interesting[/i] than patients. How many times did you really look at patient panes other than to check how long they have before they'd die? Since students are the focus, I find myself glancing at what clubs people are joining, how their friendships are going, and such. Also their grades I guess, minor detail that.\n[*] BONUS: I love that the announcements reference to Hospital. Nice touches like that are all over the place in this game.[/list]\n\nThat said, I only have a couple gripes:\n[list]\n[*] Staff management seems [i]worse[/i] than Hospital. There used to be a pane where you could quickly set up the roles for all staff. Either I'm an idiot and can't find it (very possible), or you're now stuck doing it for each individual staff member.\n[*] Add more music!\n[*] The class scheduler is... imperfect. I understand it's a complex problem to solve, but I've had at least one instance where I [i]knew[/i] the class schedule could be condensed to eliminate the need for an entire class room, and I had to twiddle with the allowed-courses settings to get it to find that solution.\n[*] Some of the class-specific items are just... too big, given the minimum class size. They fit, but take [i]the whole room[/i]. I know I said this game rewards you for larger rooms, but this is just an annoyance (sometime you just want a small room) and feels like it was done to artificially force players to build bigger rooms.[/list]\n\nDevelopers that actually take the time to learn and improve things deserve my money.

Two major ones for me. First being its insanely easy. I almost don't have to interact with a lot of the intricate management aspects because the game throws money at you without you really needing to try. Second issue is locking sandbox behind main campaign progress. Really silly decision for a game like this, sandbox is the meat and potatoes for a game like this and locking it behind minimum 4 hours of main campaign progress seems a bit silly.\n\nOverall though, because of the detail added to management and customization & the overall asthetic of the two point series, I would recommend it to people who like management.

Added it to the list of programs to ignore and turned it back on again and not running again. Well, I say not running, not strictly true. Steam thinks it's running and in the task manager it shows the process but using between 5 and 7 meg of memory that is not doing anything helpful. I have an HP Omen laptop that boosts games, it could be an interaction between that and McAfee I suppose.\n\nSo, the game itself. Now it works I can say that if, like me, you like Two Point Hospital, you will like this just as much as TPH. Possibly more when there is a bit more added to the game.

I find it easier to look around my campus with a controller, and then switch to the keyboard and mouse for any actual gameplay.\n\nI can live with this for the amount of fun that I am having.", "timestamp_created": 1660205158, "timestamp_updated": 1660205158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120431770": {"recommendationid": "120431770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008824972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1681140209}, "language": "english", "review": "YES YES YES. \n\nIf you loved Two Point Hospital or just love management games, you'll love TPC!!", "timestamp_created": 1660204527, "timestamp_updated": 1660204527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120431402": {"recommendationid": "120431402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144083295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 7292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1694584131}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game.

Much like hospital you're put in charge of maintaining a campus and developing its course load while hopefully staying afloat and not having your students fail out.\n\nGraphically its very much akin to Two Point Hospital, the cartoony characters are cute to watch running around and depict their styles very well from the tux wearing rich kids to the clowny class clowns, everything is visually represented well. If I have one complaint about the graphic style it would be that the individual course teachers could use better variation. Unlike the students, teachers all wear a similar style and while you can unlock color variations, it ultimately lacks the flare the students have.\n\nSound wise everything sounds nice, the parties however are a bit quiet. Any time I schedule a band event unless I zoom in on the band the music is almost completely drowned out by the rest of the ambiant sounds of the campus.\n\nGameplay... it's addictive. It's not overly challenging by any means but trying for the 3 star on each campus can be a great time sink. I'm 14 hours in and only two star on the third campus. If you're careful it's very unlikely you'll need to ever get a bank loan to fund your building as your first couple of years in any campus can be used freely to generate funds. If you stick to how the tutorial has you build it's near impossible to fail. Now challenge aside the missions are cute but ultimately aren't that notable. Unlike hospital where an influx of special patients see unique figures around... events in campus are very room based and easy to overlook the signature figures that arrive and the events tend to get requested/spammed so often you ultimately lose any care about seeing the characters.\n\nUltimately it's a fun game, good for anyone that enjoys doing this sort of Do X, get Y, evolve to Z missions.

I mean clearly, I've already sunk a lot of hours into it. If you liked Hospital, or any kind of non-realistic management sim, you'll probably enjoy this. Admittedly I was a little worried that it looked like I was near the end already at one point, but more things unlocked after that! One of the things I like about this game is you can take it seriously and hyper customise everything, but you just as easily cheese it a bit and you're not really punished for that (as in, it's a play how you most like to play type of game).\n\nThe one negative I do have is the management aspect has been stripped compared with Hospital. I know a lot of people will see less micromanagement as a positive, but it was really frustrating to not be able to alter certain things \n\nFor example, you have a job role 'assistants' who do a lot of wildly different things on campus. At one point in the game, you will fail if you don't have enough medical facilities, which are run by these assistants with special training. However, sometimes they abandon those rooms in favour of standing outside club stands... even though dozens of students are in line. You literally have to ban every single assistant one by one from working specific roles. In Hospital, this was easily managed on one screen for everyone and I really miss it here. I also really wish there was a way to swap around the queue priorities. Or, at least, sick students shouldn't be in class or something. This is the one major bottleneck I've come across in game. \n\nPlus, it seems a little weirdly restrictive that you can't customise your class schedules at all, even though there's a whole screen for it. Why must all classes be in fixed time slots? It seriously hurts my efficiency brain to have all my students doing nothing for a whole month as all classrooms stay empty. \n\nI'm hoping for a quality of life update at some point on these, especially the management UI. Other than that though, definitely worth your time. Obviously the price is a little steep, but you are seriously getting hours of content. I haven't even completed the campaign yet, and I feel like this will lend itself to sandbox mode more than Hospital did with all the extra decoration options.", "timestamp_created": 1660162827, "timestamp_updated": 1660163250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120409106": {"recommendationid": "120409106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280654142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1661793767}, "language": "english", "review": "I miss Campus", "timestamp_created": 1660162561, "timestamp_updated": 1660162561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120408946": {"recommendationid": "120408946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027823396", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 4343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1693038554}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1660162327, "timestamp_updated": 1660162327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120408722": {"recommendationid": "120408722", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962214587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 8331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1693407688}, "language": "english", "review": "It's exactly what you want if you're a Two Point fan.

In the 2nd stage, I am constantly having to juggle loans in order to meet the requirements of my upgraded courses: build this, build that, hire this -- that's $120k total and I don't have that on hand, so I need a loan. Loans have interest and installment payments that drag down profits. I'm still profitable many months, but not by much. I could probably have just skated by on the status quo for another school year to grind cash, but the game allows me to keep pushing if I want to.\n\nAnyway, a lot of love obviously went into this game. It's funny and weird, lots of cute stuff. Most of the stages are themed, so you'll get decent variety -- normal school, culinary school, Harry Potter school.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Two Point Hospital but this game is definitely a step up. YOU CAN JUST COPY ROOMS INSTEAD OF REBUILDING! In all honesty, I had no idea what to expect for a campus building game. Was the focus going to be on students? teachers? Is it a one year college? How do they deal with class regulation? Well you begin with having 1 course. This course has basic requirements, generally a lecture hall and a laboratory (just like real life university!). The year plays out and you try to keep your students happy, the happier they are, the better they'll do. This is important as failing students can fail out, drop out or refuse to pay tuition. Your money comes in by tuition, rent (for dormitories) and experience (student learning converted to money). At the end of the year your students can continue on with their studies (each course has a different amount of years required to graduate/tuition), graduate or fail/dropout. You also get an influx of new students. During the end of the year period, you have a period where you can revise courses and make building changes. You need to manually click on the \"start next year\" before the next calendar year can start. As far as I can tell, there is no time that really \"passes\" during this phase so no salaries get taken out. It's great to have this time to organize for your students needs next year as you get more students, 2nd years require different/upgraded classes, i.e. your gastro students (your cooks), require a sweets course now and their own lecture hall). It also tells you what you need, so no guess work, no having to wonder if you have enough lecture halls or teachers. Fantastic! You can start your next year and continue on.\nSo on top of regulating classes and getting tutors, there are different goals to fulfill. Some are personal goals (like someone wanting a food stand) and others are assignment goals. At first, the amount of kudosh (the currency to unlock things), was hard to get but by the fourth campus, you shouldn't have a problem meeting all these goals. \nThere's plenty more to do that I didn't touch on like hosting events, but I think some stuff should be left for you to discover.

I am not one of them. I'm also not a frequent management game player. But the humour and the university theme itched a nerve for me and after the first trailers and then reviews I had to get it. So take this into consideration.\n\n[h1] What to expect[/h1]\nYou're managing a University. But is it just one? No! The game has a story mode and a sandbox mode. To get to the sandbox mode you have to play through the first few levels though (I haven't unlocked it yet after finishing the first two levels, but I took my time and got three stars in both of them, you only need one per level, so you might unlock it a fair bit quicker). \nSo, about the \"story\" mode. You start with a small campus in England and have two establish two different courses. The game uses this to softly get you to learn the game's mechanics. For me - as a novice - this was very welcome. In each level you have to achieve certain goals to get a star. You do this over the course of a year, you have to build student facilities, class rooms, all these things. And you have to make sure, your students pass their classes. But that's not been to challenging so far. \nOnce you have the first star you can choose two tackle the next challenges to get up to three stars, or you move on to the next campus.\nThe different campuses (?) have varying themes. The second one is in an old Italian-like town for example and you focus on cooking courses with giant pizzas. Over the course of the game you can expect knights, wizards, sports, robots and all kind of stuff. \nAs I am still early on in the game I can't judge all of it, but to me it seems to be very diverse and fun! The game doesn't take itself to serious. On that note, there's also an in game radio with Bri'ish comments that are quiet funny.\n\nApart from managing and building rooms you also have to take care of your staff.\n\nWhat you probably shouldn't expect is a hard game. It is very beginner friendly. In the second university I had to look a little more on the money at first, but that passed rather quickly. For me as a novice in this field this is nice and feels right.\n\n[h1] Bugs? [/h1]\nIn the Italian town, which might actually be French as well, now that I'm thinking about it, the rain contains frogs. Apart from that the only books I've met so far are book worms.\n\nOn a serious note:\n- apparently the A button can't be mapped differently to move left. I didn't note this, as I use my mouse to move.\n- One time I wanted to move a room and a bunch of other objects in other rooms would show they can't be placed like that anymore, which would have required quiet a bit of work. In the end I just didn't move the room and in other instances I didn't have the problem. But there might be some challenges to the placing system.\n\n[h1] Other frustrations [/h1]\nAs I use my mouse to move and move the camera, I would prefer to be able to move the camera both up and down and turn left and right at the same time (like in The Sims for example). Like this I have to stop one movement and start the next. You get used to it and it might be very specific to me, but I would like it differently.\n\nAnd when you place all the objects, some of them require to be accessible for the janitors to be serviced. This mechanic isn't bad. But getting it just rights can be a bit tricky. You can user Ctrl. To fine tune it, but it still is a bit icky.\n\nIn general the UI is very nice and works well. But you can toggle specific actions per person, like sending them to 1 on 1 tutoring and I couldn't really tell what was on and what was off, as for this there was no fly over as there is for other things, telling you what something does/is.\n\n[h1] General Flow of The Game [/h1]\nI think the game has a very nice flow. When you build new rooms it immediately shows you all the fitting and suitable furniture for example. Also it has a good pace for me so far. One year doesn't take to long. I'd say it's about an hour in real life. Then you have the summer break to prepare your campus for the next year, build new rooms for new or upgraded course. Here you can take as long as you like, before you start back into the school year. And then you still have the option to actually pause your game.\nSo far this all works very well for me with a good feeling of progression.\n\n[h1] Would I recommend it? [/h1]\nYes, absolutely. I've had lots of fun so far and unlike other (micro)managing games this has an entrance that hooked me instead of spooking me. It's fool of humour and crazy ideas. Not your everyday university life. \nIt's not a hardcore game. This is for a relaxed evening and watching your fantastic university and all the life it contains. It's also fun to just watch that.\nSo give it a go!\n\nI might update this further down the line, but for now that's it folks!\n\n[h1] Further Information [/h1]\nIf you want to learn more, you might check the coverage by Rock Paper Shotgun, which I found to be very good:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3jV1vmdFw4 \n\n[url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-point-campus-review-a-relaxed-management-sim-bursting-with-silliness-and-seminars] Written Review [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1660082943, "timestamp_updated": 1660083114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593094944953918457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120358647": {"recommendationid": "120358647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067121679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1662642631}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfectly Two Point!", "timestamp_created": 1660082182, "timestamp_updated": 1660082182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120358548": {"recommendationid": "120358548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082303299", "num_games_owned": 3213, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1660152496}, "language": "english", "review": "Forced to play uninteresting campaign that I don't care to be able to unlock Sandbox.\nIt's bad design.\n", "timestamp_created": 1660082063, "timestamp_updated": 1660082063, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430293351411819458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120358371": {"recommendationid": "120358371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072804385", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1660146433}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!\nI love it!\n\nHaving full control over your own university is amazing! <3", "timestamp_created": 1660081816, "timestamp_updated": 1660081816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120358205": {"recommendationid": "120358205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256000459", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1668819562}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an improvement on Two Point Hospital in many ways.

And even though I've put a lot of hours into \"Two Point Hospital\" (55 hours on steam, at least 15-20 hours on the Xbox for PC app) - I was a bit leery about \"Two Point Campus\". I figured it'd be sort of a re-skin of TPH, with some updated assets and an added building system. But with the short amount of time I've spent with the game, along with the multiple deep dive videos I've watched leading up to it's release - I had nothing to worry about (and neither do you). \n\n\"Two Point Campus\" feels like an entirely new game, while still feeling extremely comfortable to those who played \"Two Point Hospital\", and definitely seems like it will be more welcoming to new players than it's predecessor. I got the hang of TPH after a while, but the difficulty curve out of the gate can be a bit intimidating for some players (in terms of the price management, staff pay management, and treatment management systems). But it seems like quality of life was a BIG concern when Two Point Studios developed this game, because it's really easy to pick up and play. \n\nIf you liked / loved \"Two Point Hospital\", this is a must-buy. If you've enjoyed the various university packs in \"The Sims\" titles, and wanted to manage the school yourself - this is also a must buy.

I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I'm just saying temper your expectations. If what you want is \"more Two-Point\" this is a fun and interesting expansion of the concept. If what you are looking for is a revolution with all new mechanics and a whole new paradigm, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment. There's some small quality of life changes, like being able to alter the building shapes a little, you can decorate outside not just inside and it's even more laid back than TPH with a fairly fixed schedule of classes instead of the \"emergency\" pacing that Hospital attempted, but you're basically comparing two kinds of apple, not an entirely new kind of fruit.\n\nIf you're new to the series, get whichever theme suits your mood first. If you're a veteran you'll slip right back into your room building habits. Be aware however that at launch your decorations are fairly limited, just like Hospital was. If you haven't exhausted Hospital, you might want to stick with it for a bit longer; the expansions and updates have added far more room decorations than what campus currently has at launch.\n\nRegardless, this is just as fun as Two-Point Hospital was but with an all new spin on humorous classes for your students to take instead of patients to save. The radio DJ and announcers all return with the same style and a few new jokes. The music is a few new tracks, and the only knock is that currently you can't add your own custom music, but it might be something they add later like TPH has.\n\nYou can expect the next year or two to include numerous DLC releases with more decorations; so if you would rather wait and buy them in a bundle I wouldn't hold it against you, the game will only continue to improve as they have a history of supporting their games post launch with updates. I personally didn't buy into Two-Point Hospital until it was discounted and it was a much better value to wait: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/535930?snr=1_5_9__402]Two-Point Hospital Review[/url]\n\nBut then again I enjoyed it enough to buy into Campus at launch with no regrets, I'm only an hour into this and I expect I'll get a couple hundred hours out of it.\n\nEDIT: (12 hours later) Launch day bugs have been minimal for me and nothing game breaking. What few bugs I've seen posted from other people (that didn't effect me) are getting active responses from developers, so overall a fairly reasonable launch IMO.\n---\n\nBottom line: Two-Point (as a franchise) is a very casual management sim with a humorous spin and a laid back style.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1660061612, "timestamp_updated": 1660112006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 695, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.941241621971130371", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120341870": {"recommendationid": "120341870", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015330613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1678044849}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's make a Hogwarts University, where you can't see a Hogwarts", "timestamp_created": 1660061533, "timestamp_updated": 1660061533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486979156732559204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120341838": {"recommendationid": "120341838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331489019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1694365332}, "language": "english", "review": "Just what I was expecting!", "timestamp_created": 1660061489, "timestamp_updated": 1660061489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486979156732559204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120341276": {"recommendationid": "120341276", "author": {"steamid": "76561199382804357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1660060281}, "language": "english", "review": "I dropped out of medical school to play this game professionally.", "timestamp_created": 1660060795, "timestamp_updated": 1660060795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 118, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653157532215118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120340660": {"recommendationid": "120340660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021951855", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1660118929}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a lot more chill than TPH but that may change later.
