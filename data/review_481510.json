For context, I saw a few reviews saying \"It gets really dark\". That, paired with the videos and the \"horror\" tag made me think it would be a horror game with a cutesy look, which seemed like an awesome concept. But it's really not, it's more of a dialogue simulator and the story does get vaguely dark at some point, but it never stops being somewhat lighthearted and charming. \n\nThe game play is not very enjoyable, it's basically press F on various NPCs until you get a sprinkle of lore and a dash of actual progress in the story. Part 2 was especially slow. The controls are a bit annoying. If you were wondering, you have to hold the space bar to make bigger jumps. I only figured that out at the end of the game. \n\nI don't want to be too critical, so here is some praise:\n-Graphics are really cute and pretty\n-Some serious themes are featured, although never in too much depth\n-The characters are all very endearing and memorable\n\nSo basically if you like interactive novel games with cute graphics and mini-games you will enjoy this. If you expected a puzzle-based side scrolling horror game like I did, you will be disappointed. \n\nFinally, I didn't personally relate to the story and setting, but I can see how if you grew up in a small town knowing everyone's name, you might enjoy this.", "timestamp_created": 1700684566, "timestamp_updated": 1700684566, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442857116460800171", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151147954": {"recommendationid": "151147954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243582538", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1680577113}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game (i am a convicted felon)", "timestamp_created": 1700684073, "timestamp_updated": 1700684073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151048504": {"recommendationid": "151048504", "author": {"steamid": "76561199281514774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 169, "playtime_at_review": 763, "last_played": 1700677252}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely cool ambience.

The environments are beautifully crafted with vibrant colors and leave a lot of room for exploration with such a small area to move around in. Once you start learning more about your friends, people in town, your family, and even yourself, the world grows and helps you connect more with it. Being from a small Midwest town like Possum Springs, and having gone through some similar stuff that some of the characters have, it hits very close to home for me and a lot of other fans. The music is perfect for the setting, the middle of fall to early winter, and when things get more serious in the story and with your friendships, the soundtrack helps reflect that. This is THE game to play during fall, best played around Halloween, as a lot of the story takes place in the days around Halloween and shortly after.

It has the potential to be good, a slice of life story with some creepy unexplainable goings ons, but it misses the target at almost every turn. You can definitely still have about 5-8 hours of middling enjoyment though, but there are still issues. \n\nPros\n-It's a side scrolling social story game, like Oxenfree. The main chast is limited and focused with a few supporting characters. This is kept simple and works ok.\n\n-The actual mystery is interesting, but it took over half the game before that set in. \n\n-The art style works well enough and is kind of relaxing. \n\nCons\nThere is zero voice acting and characters tend to rble on about nothing, like they're attempting to use the typical self deprecating humble bragging gen Z humor popular with kids these days. It would be ok if it was just a few characters, but it's all of them, except for Mae's (the main character) parents. \n\n-You play the whole game as Mae and she is supremely unlikable. The game wants you to believe she has \"trauma\" and is suffering from mental illness but what you get is the most surface level exploration of that. Really, it just feels like Mae never grew up and refuses to learn anything because she already has it all figured out. She makes everyone upset, hurts everyone, and insults authority figures regularly. It's all the very cringy, fight the power stuff we have seen a million times. \n\n-The story. I know that was a pro, but it took legitimately over half of the game before it picks up, and then it's over. The pacing was just off, and I found myself playing in ten minute increments over the course of a month or more. It just wasn't engrossing to me, and that will depend on you. \n\n-There is quite a lot of social messaging. It is clear which side of the political aisle the developers are on and they make it very clear to you. If you don't mind having standard left wing politics in your games than you will be ok. \n\nOverall I like aspects of the late game, hate the early game, and somewhat dislike everything else.

The colorful town of \"Possum Springs\" offers a depressing and cheerful atmosphere simultaneously, while the plot jumps between reality and dreams. Characters have vivid personalities, rich backstories and it's really interesting to watch the complex, evolving relationships between them. Yet, the gameplay has some issues. Too much walking at the same screens can get boring, while sometimes you feel like hanging around aimlessly hoping that plot will unfold by itself. Also, mini games look like random fillers that don't offer much things. Despite its flaws, it's a unique, poetic experience that offers plenty food for though.\n\n\nManometer: 7/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- Nice, minimalistic visuals with geometrical 2d graphics and vivid colors.\n- The town of \"Possum Springs\" is well designed offering both a depressing and cheerful atmosphere at the same time. The town changes slightly with the season or the weather and is populated with characters, animals and animated things that make it look alive.\n- An emotional story of human relationships as the protagonist, Mae discovers adultness and grown ups life through a series of unexpected events. Storytelling is nice full of surreal, dreamy scenes and moments that look insignificant but have many things to tell.\n- Well built main characters with vivid personalities and rich backstories. It's great to watch the relationship between them changing and evolving by the time.\n- Although some of the dialogues are too cute, almost childish, they're well written, interesting and at some points really poetic.\n- Good, calm music that accompanies Mae through her adventures. During dreams music is even better creating a mysterious atmosphere.\n- It has some moments with pretty good, inspiring sense of humor.\n- Simplistic, yet smooth, cute animations.\n- Most mini games are boring but few of them, like playing the bass, have fun. The little hack and slash game on your laptop is great too.\n- It opens up some serious social and political issues like daily problems of the working class, struggling of people to survive in a small community, those who face psychological problems, the anxiety of youth as growing, generations' gap, importance of friendship.\n\nThe bad\n- Too much walking left and right at the same few screens. You go to almost to the same places every day expecting for something new to pop up. Some procedures tend to get monotonous like talking to your mom every morning and to your dad every night. Sometimes you feel like no having a specific purpose, instead you just hang around doing staff with your friends and hoping that the plot will unfold by itself.\n- Boring, almost childish mini games that look like shallow fillers. It's like the developers didn't know how to extent the playtime and put random stuff in there.\n- Commenting on serious topics like growing in a world of adults is accomplished via cheap solutions like transforming Mae, the protagonist, into an innocent, too naive character for her age, usually with no awareness of the consequences of what she does or says.\n- Black loading screens of four to six seconds duration between most of the screens are annoying and almost ruin the vibe you're into.", "timestamp_created": 1697162942, "timestamp_updated": 1697162942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148075729": {"recommendationid": "148075729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187853219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1554, "last_played": 1697117904}, "language": "english", "review": "I just recently re-played this game and I forgot how much it means to me.

It cares a great deal less about the dark goings-on in the town than it does Mae's internal reality, her relationships and her understanding of herself. Night in the Woods is about Mae building and rebuilding the relationships that have been damaged by her mental illness, with her friends, with her mother and father, and with her town itself. \n\nNight in the Woods is a more intensely political game than any I've played. The easiest point of comparison for me is Disco Elysium. Possum Springs, the setting of the game, is a dying rust belt town, and we see over and over again throughout the game the way it's crumbling away. As Mae explores the town each day she gains knowledge about not only her friends' personal lives, but about the history of Possum Springs itself. Characters who speak to Mae frequently lament the loss of unions, and observe that the bosses at the few businesses left in town would fire anyone who even tried to organize their workers.  A character tells Mae about her grandfather trashing the car of a visiting mining executive.  That same mine has a familiar history, made up of lethal accidents caused by the bosses' cost-cutting and indifference, strikes violently broken by the military, and a brief period of prosperity after the unions got their way. The loss of that prosperity is illustrated again and again by each character. Poverty is woven into each character's their lives and story, from Mae's parents' anxiety about the second mortgage they took out to pay for her college, to Bea's desperate envy of Mae's educational opportunity and anger at her for squandering them. It's shown through small moments, and dialogue--Bea laments that austerity and budget cuts mean that basic infrastructure repairs, including to the washed-out bridges out of town, aren't being carried out.  A local WPA-style mural depicting heroic miners is defaced, and when Mae confronts the culprit they struggle to articulate their anger over a promise that has been betrayed.  The new pastor at the church tries to get permission to let a homeless drifter sleep in the basement, but the chamber of commerce, desperate to project an image of progress that might lure in new jobs, turns her down.  Mae's acquaintance Selmers writes \"short, cute\" poems about benign topics, but when she appears at a poetry reading she delivers an enraged diatribe about the poverty she's living in. \n\nMae's reckoning with mental illness, dissociation, and especially psychosis resonated deeply with me as a player with schizophrenia. I really liked the moment when she angrily tells a friend's grandmother that \"I'm not just a f*cking shell for my problems to walk around in.\" The game shows that the personal is also the political, refusing to let Mae's mental illness stand apart from the political reality of her town. There's a genuinely sickening reveal late in the game that the doctor everyone has referenced, who's been treating Mae's illness by advising her to journal, isn't a psychiatrist at all, but a GP-and-dentist. Mae's continued struggles aren't just about her being unable or unwilling to engage in treatment, they're about a complete lack of treatment options available to her in Possum Springs. \n\nWhen Mae finally confronts the monster at the end of the game she finds that it both is and isn't a supernatural creature, is and isn't a response to the impending death of Possum Springs as a town. There's an Eldritch creature, but there are also people who've allowed themselves to become something inhuman in response to what's happening in Possum Springs. Mae has a vision of her house swept away, abandoned, Possum Springs consisting only of empty fields. It's a common enough image from cosmic horror, human efforts rendered nonexistent, but it's also reflective of the more mundane fears the characters have, of Possum Springs being unable to survive without the mines, becoming a ghost town. When Mae confronts the creature, all the things she's been struggling with, from the Eldritch horror to her mental illness to her bleak future prospects, combine into one image, a tiny creature facing an immense, powerful being that doesn't care about it.  There's no choice you can make here, but it's here that the choices you've made throughout the game to let Mae meander, learn about the town and about herself and her friends, imbue the scene with added meaning and significance. \n\nNight in the Woods has so much meaning, so much to say about politics and the realities of dying towns. Exploring the game is perfect in the autumn. I expect I'll come back to it every year.

I do not like saying this because I don\u2019t enjoy tearing games down and I was genuinely looking forward to playing this, but outside of the art direction, music and Demontower minigame, Night in the Woods did not appeal to me in the way I was hoping it would.\n\nThe story, for what little there is, is generally unfocused and lacking in any real urgency, drama or stakes for roughly 85% of the story. I understand that this is a slice-of-life, slowburn type of deal and I was not expecting the story to hook me immediately. The vibes for the first hour or so were pretty good, but as the game progressed I was hoping the story would naturally develop into something more interesting and I was left wanting until the last quarter of the game. I can only speak for myself of course, but eventually your story needs a hook and this story barely has even that for most of its runtime.\n\nIf the characters of Night in the Woods were more interesting and fascinating this glacial pacing could\u2019ve been acceptable to me, unfortunately the characters do not fare much better either. I enjoyed talking to Gregg, Bea and Candy. The rest of the main and supporting cast were not very interesting or developed. I found Mae, the main character of the game to be a conflicting presence in the story. She is deeply troubled, lacking any real focus in her life, depressed and her general dissociation from the real world was initially compelling and I did see parts of myself in her character when I was younger. Sadly, as the game progressed her responses to her friends' issues rubbed me the wrong way and I found her to be increasingly less relatable as the game pushed forward. I didn\u2019t dislike her presence in the story, but by the end of the game I was very indifferent to her overall.\n\nThe story touches on topics like paranormal activity, the cruel indifference of capitalism, mental illness, cults and the expectations of being an adult in a world that does not care for you.\n\nSomehow, this game did not click for me despite it seeming tailor made for me based on these topics and yet I felt underwhelmed after completing it. Why is that? It\u2019s hard to fully pin down in an easily digestible sentence, but I think the writing wasn\u2019t interested in exploring these concepts in a way that was interesting.\n\nAt the very least, the game did not resonate with me in the same way it did for most other players. I initially assumed the slow start would eventually pay off. It did not. The ending was also fairly abrupt and I did not feel satisfied with its conclusion.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, most people who play this do genuinely see something special about it even if I personally did not. I do not even fully regret playing it, but I think I could\u2019ve stopped playing it around the 3 or 4 hour mark and achieved the same level of satisfaction from it that I did after completing it. If you want an adventure game that is cute, has quirky dialogue and is running entirely on vibes, you will probably find NITW to be a good time. If you expect the game to be anything more than that, you might be a little disappointed with the overall experience.\n\nRest in peace, Alec Holowka", "timestamp_created": 1696633250, "timestamp_updated": 1696633250, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491877883672714233", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147763689": {"recommendationid": "147763689", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007185949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1130, "last_played": 1678174239}, "language": "english", "review": "One of those games that leaves you staring at your wall for 10 minutes after you've finished it.

I originally bought the game for the nostalgic feeling i got for Jacksepticeye's playthrough from years ago (i hadn't watched all of it) and the artstyle the game offers. The thing is, this game is incredibly, like really SLOW. I'm not just referring to the chapters' slow progression but also the inabilty the game mechanics show of getting around fast or at the very least more dynamicly. And the jump mechanic, my god, it made me tear off my hair at certain points in the game because getting the jump to work you want it to can be the hardest thing this game expects of you in certain places. You moved too fast? Whoops you have fallen off the ledge. You missed one pixel on the platform you want to land on? Whoops you have fallen at the bottom of the map do that all again. People with 'Getting Over It' trauma are guaranteed to have moments of their PTSD flairing up just because of this terrible jump control. As for the story being slow, its extremely tiring running around for hours with nothing interesting happening in the story. Running around isn't relaxing either since the game's main focus is the story behind what's happening around the town. We are given a literal arm from the start to spike up the mystery and what happens for a long while after? You do errands for HOURS to pick the ending. Yes, this game has its unique charm that will appeal to people of a certain niche, but the game is not an extremely good game with flaws: It's an alright game with flaws.

month, although i originally found the game when it launched, so i've obviously known about it, and known the story for YEARS, but it's been so incredibly amazing to replay this game over and over, and finding every single detail i can in the game. trying to get every achievment, and find out as much as i possibly can about the story, the ingame folklore, the characters backgrounds, the existential dread and meaning of this game. It's gotten me through a very disorienting period of near-psychosis levels of mania and depression, and made me feel seen in a way i haven't felt in any game before. I relate so intensely with nearly every character in this game, especially Mae herself. I also love the blatant but not stereotyped queerness of the main characters, and how everything just feels so real and natural, and like home, even though it's nothing like where i'm from, but i still somehow feel so connected to everything that happens there. The game is beautifully written, illustrated, and the music is perfect for it. Everything about this game just perfecctly encapsulates the feeling of that coming of age existential dread so many of us feel. And that feeling of emptiness and impending doom, of how everything is going to shit and none of us can do anything about. Wanting nothing more than for our existence to hurt to prove that it's real and it mattered. the hopelessness of leaving home, only to have a complete breakdown and ending up right back where you started. Stuck. And yet, realizing that you don't need to have a reason to live in order to do it. You can just exist, and thats ok. There are really awful things happening right under our noses all the time, and the only way we'd find out is by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and thats enough for everything we ever knew about our surroundings so just falter into this meaningless void that we suddenly know nothing about. everything is just shapes and things lose meaning, until everything eventually goes back to normal again and you forget there was anything wrong in the first place. at least thats how it feels to replay this game over and over, because it's exactly like waking up everyday as if yesterday never happened.", "timestamp_created": 1695073464, "timestamp_updated": 1695073464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146550055": {"recommendationid": "146550055", "author": {"steamid": "76561199434335173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 777, "last_played": 1698780693}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME", "timestamp_created": 1695063448, "timestamp_updated": 1695063448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146544997": {"recommendationid": "146544997", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241850380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1695057400}, "language": "english", "review": "Made me cry with the epilogue", "timestamp_created": 1695057552, "timestamp_updated": 1695057552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146518257": {"recommendationid": "146518257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198429936820", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1699005935}, "language": "english", "review": "Steam Cloud isn't configured to sync between Windows and Linux, so I have to take extra steps to get it working. Far as I can tell, this is because the game syncs seperate Linux, Windows and Mac save data, but doesn't save between the OSs. Fixing this is not hard and the devs could do it in 5 minutes.\n\n\"But you're not a game dev! How do you know that??\"\n\nBecause I read 2 paragraphs of documentation. This, my dear developers, is how you fix this issue:\n1. Go to your Steamworks App Admin panel, and go to \"Steam Cloud Settings\"\n2. Go to \"Root Overrides\"\n3. Add a new override\n4. Set the override to \"WinAppDataLocalLow\", OS to \"Linux + SteamOS\", and new root to \"LinuxHome\"\n5. Set Add/Replace Path to \".config/unity3d/Infinite Fall/Night in the Woods\" and check the box labelled \"Replace Path\"\n6. Repeat this process for the other paths\n7. Repeat this for the applicable Mac paths as well, if you wish to get this working for Mac users too\n\nIdeally, at this point, under the root override should be a little blurb reading\n[b]Preview:[/b] %USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow/Infinite Fall/Night in the Woods [b]maps to[/b] ~/.config/unity3d/Infinite Fall/Night in the Woods\nor whatever the equivalent is for the path you're setting up at that time. It should be pretty self-explanitory.\n\n8. Remove the corresponding Linux and/or Mac saves from the \"Root Paths\" area; [b]ROOT PATHS DO NOT SAVE BETWEEN PLATFORMS, ROOT OVERRIDES DO.[/b]\n\nIf these instructions were followed (don't forget to make it developer-only while testing!), ideally saves should save between Windows and Linux, removing the need to run the Windows version on Linux in order for cloud saves to work properly.

I don't remember the reasons that led to its appearance, but I guess it was accompanied by the death of Alec Holowka. Which was and still is a effed up event, I should say. Since then I decided to taste that game someday because it looked pretty, had good music and something promised a great experience, which is a thing I've always loved about games as a form of art. Buuut back then I was interested in other things, playing Undertale and reading \"The catcher in the rye\" and living my teenage life. There was nothing that encouraged me to start NITW, until recently.\n\nSo this autumn, as I was going back to university and having experienced one shitty novel game in my life the day before, I found myself here. The game that prompted me to run this one was about high school almost-graduating dinosaurs who played in a band and had inner crises while an asteroid flew at them, and the way it was all presented in the story really upset me. I was in rage, 'cause characters acted unmatured in a bad way and noone of their speech about life, losing the goal and getting lost in a world of capitalism made me believe them. And at that very moment the phrase \"I'd rather play Night in the Woods\" popped into my head, and then the decision was made to finally familiarise myself with it.\n\nFor me, someone who is as old as May and has tried many complex stories, the plot of this game was phenomenal. It really feels like re-reading a novel by Salinger, as if Caulfield had graduated from high school and happened to live in our time. You really can taste that upseting feeling even when characters are goofing around - it's their way of dealing with adulthood. And none of this has to do with cartoonish style: cute cats and animals who says only \"boop\" and \"whoopa\" talks about serious shit [spoiler] (like Mae's \"Everything is just shapes\", Bea's lack of normal life, parent issues for Angus, and the general dying of Possum Springs) [/spoiler] that it makes you drop your jaw. I'm drawing a parallel between these two stories because I have the same feelings about them: I understand the main character, I'm invested in their world and topics that the author has put, but I am not able to read them; the story seems like a regular slice of life, but it touches on so many controversial themes of our life that I don't know where to begin to grasp it. And because of that, I feel really lost as I don't know how to talk about this piece of art even in this 'review'.\n\nI really want to understand NITW, but I'm feeling like I can't do it yet. But, as the old Janitor said:\n[spoiler] \"In my experience big things don't teach you anything. But they make you something. And sometimes you gotta wait a while and see what come off it.\" [/spoiler] \n\nAnd so I will. What about the rest, I really think people should go through this adventure themselves, 'cause the experience like after reading a good novel are all that remains after The End of Everything.", "timestamp_created": 1694412667, "timestamp_updated": 1694412667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146088775": {"recommendationid": "146088775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308360773", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 265, "playtime_at_review": 1471, "last_played": 1700210680}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm at a loss for words here.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this game is for everyone and if you think you won't enjoy it, at least give it a try because you won't regret it.\n\nEdit: I forgot how insane the soundtrack is, I literally bought the soundtrack after completing the game just because it was so good.", "timestamp_created": 1692944691, "timestamp_updated": 1692944771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144963089": {"recommendationid": "144963089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116833615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 570, "last_played": 1692938197}, "language": "english", "review": "spooky.  gorgeous art.  made me cry.  10/10", "timestamp_created": 1692938457, "timestamp_updated": 1692938457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144960903": {"recommendationid": "144960903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138133697", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2242, "last_played": 1692933890}, "language": "english", "review": "wow, how have I not reviewed this yet.\nthis shit changed me on a fundamental level.\nbuy it.", "timestamp_created": 1692935199, "timestamp_updated": 1692935199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144956507": {"recommendationid": "144956507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371077415", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 557, "last_played": 1696823996}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my favorite game.

There are very few games that genuinely make me happy to see a new character which I've not talked to yet. That's not even taking into account the main cast which is just in a whole another level.\n\nThere's a good chunk of side content, secrets, and some platforming. You won't be coming across that much pure gameplay sections which is fine I'd say. The core of this game is it's story\n\nThe art-style is simply great. It will never strain your eyes, is always pleasant to look at, and expresses the tones for a scene perfectly\n\nThe soundtrack is top tier. It's been in every iteration of my main playlist ever since I first listened to it. If you're unsure about whether you should play the game or not just listen to a few pieces from the OST. Astral Alley, Dusk Stars, and Rainy Day are my personal favorites. \n\nWhile on the topic of music there's something I want to mention, mostly for the returning fans. There are some who don't want to pay money for the game because of what happened with Alec Holowka. I don't blame anyone for having that opinion nor it's opposite.

But, with all the dialogue the devs shoved into this game, it's still pretty entertaining. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1692498223, "timestamp_updated": 1692498223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144603619": {"recommendationid": "144603619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832836682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1692670304}, "language": "english", "review": "i went into playing this game thinking it was just a cute, real game with funny dialogue. apparently not! i fully recommend this, i relate to the characters a lot and its a rad game in general. props to finji!", "timestamp_created": 1692491318, "timestamp_updated": 1692491318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144602080": {"recommendationid": "144602080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073875538", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 490, "last_played": 1518503051}, "language": "english", "review": "Gregg Rulz OK", "timestamp_created": 1692489359, "timestamp_updated": 1692489359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144596922": {"recommendationid": "144596922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855223845", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1692482657}, "language": "spanish", "review": "depression arc", "timestamp_created": 1692482735, "timestamp_updated": 1692482735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144590040": {"recommendationid": "144590040", "author": {"steamid": "76561199323280367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1692478230}, "language": "english", "review": "What the fuck", "timestamp_created": 1692475357, "timestamp_updated": 1692475357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144567845": {"recommendationid": "144567845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168983748", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1692454546}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not write reviews for video games, but this one is quite special.

There is not much \u201cgameplay\u201d to speak of aside from some light platforming and a short rhythm section. What it does have though is one of the better stories I have come across in recent memory. It\u2019s characters go through very relatable issues and aside from a couple plot twists is grounded in more reality than most games dare to dream of. The game puts you in the shoes of Mae who has just dropped out of college and moved back in with her parents and is trying to reconnect with friends while trying to navigate strange events happening in town.\n\n\tI didn\u2019t enjoy the main character at times as she is pretty much a screw up who doesn\u2019t realize how childish she is being and is pretty selfish at times. That being said I see it as an authentic character as many people are like this and there is nothing saying  I have to like a main character to enjoy a game. The supporting cast of her parents and her home town friends are all interesting in their own ways and I liked  learning more about them as the story moved forward. The game consists of exploring around town talking to your friends, townsfolk and your parents. Depending on which friends you talk with will decide whose story you see the most of. Talking with certain townsfolk will shed more light on them as well. When you go to bed each night there is a dream section that is based around platforming sections to find the exit to the dream. The platforming sections are well done aside from the odd time I found them hard to navigate. They have a creepy quality about them and a great soundtrack. In between dealing with friends you can take part in voluntary mini games such as a 2D action game on Mae\u2019s laptop and taking part in band practice with friends. Luckily the band practice can be skipped without consequence because it is like playing Rock Band which I despise. The game\u2019s art direction was well done. It\u2019s got a unique style to it that isn\u2019t quite cell shaded or realistic, somewhere in between the two. There is no voice acting but I didn\u2019t find this to be a bad thing. I will say that, while the overall story was fantastic, the last 15 minutes of the game felt rushed and left certain plot lines unfinished in my eyes. There are a lot of dialogue choices you get to make when talking to people, how much they affect the story I\u2019m unsure of. I also wish there was some more choice in the dialogue sections as I would have liked to do things differently than any way I was given, especially near the end.\n\n\tI played Night in the Woods on Linux. It never crashed on me once.  Alt-Tab didn\u2019t work for me. There were no graphics options to speak of to adjust aside from choosing resolution and choosing between full-screen and windowed mode. I get that spectacular graphics were not a high priority for the developers, they weren\u2019t shooting to make the next Crysis, but being able to crank up AA, AF, etc is kind of a standard feature on PC games.  Even though there was no v-sync setting the game respected my refresh rate. There were no manual saves allowed. It says that you can \u201csave and quit\u201d at any time but \u201csaving\u201d means dumping you at the last checkpoint and the game doesn\u2019t do a good job of letting you know when those are happening so often I had to repeat little bits. The game never lagged on me at all and was smooth as butter. I was able to use my Logitech F310 without issue aside from the button prompts still being for a keyboard.\n\nGame Engine: Unity\nGraphics API: OpenGL\nDisk Space Used: 6.2 GB\nGame Version Played: Build 406\n\nGPU Usage: 0-100 %\nVRAM Usage: 2087-2621 MB\nCPU Usage: 5-12 %\nRAM Usage: 3.7-4.7 GB\nFrame Rate: 92-165 FPS\n\n\n\tOverall Night in the Woods was a great experience. It had a wonderful story full of great characters, was very stable, had great art and soundtrack. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it. Those who enjoy games like Oxenfree, Life is Strange, Gone Home and other games that focus on Story will probably love Night in the Woods. It took me six hours and fifty five minutes to finish the game. There are no difficulty settings. I paid $19.99 USD for it and I found it was well worth the price.\n\nMy Score: 8.5/10\n\nMy system:\n\nIntel i5-12600K | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | XFX RX 590 8GB Fat Boy | Mesa 23.1.6 | Western Digital Black SN850 500GB | Garuda | Mate 1.26.0 | Kernel 6.4.11-zen1-1-zen | MSI G2730QPF 2560*1440 @ 165hz", "timestamp_created": 1692421631, "timestamp_updated": 1692421631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739945292472839355", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144526308": {"recommendationid": "144526308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267906455", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2030, "last_played": 1692403668}, "language": "english", "review": "great characters, great story\nit became one of my favorite game", "timestamp_created": 1692405322, "timestamp_updated": 1692405322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144466047": {"recommendationid": "144466047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392383951", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 591, "last_played": 1691297355}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a shame the creator of this game is dead :(\n\nR.I.P.

There's a lot hanging out, wondering around, and a quite a bit of dialogue - some of which seems a bit unnecessary. Some of it is character building, but during my second playthrough some of the text felt like a slog to get through. \n\nIt ends sorta unexpectedly. I can't help but to feel the ending maybe wasn't planned or they could've ran out of time. Not to mention, quite a few plot points go unanswered - but maybe that was intentional - maybe not?\n\nNitpicks aside, I loved Night in the Woods. It's one of my favorite games I've played in the past few years.  Would definitely recommend. Also, knowing what happened to the creator the game, it added an extra dark layer when experiencing Mae's mental breakdown.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691598853, "timestamp_updated": 1691598853,

bat, I'll say this game probably isn't going to be special for everyone, but for the people it IS for, it's worth your time. \nThis is a narrative game at its core and you will need to be into that sort of thing to enjoy it. The gameplay consists of fairly simple exploration/platforming, with some 'novelty' mechanics here and there - but these things are all in service to the story being told. \n\nI played this game back in 2017 as a lonely gay dude in my very early 20s, and enjoyed the game as much as I was able to at the time. I was extremely depressed though, couldn't really think and feel properly and didn't really engage with it properly. \nI replayed this game in 2023 as a trans woman, and this time the experience was powerfully resonant for many, many reasons. I'm glad I came back to it.\n\nI think this is a game gives voice to feelings and experiences that are difficult to describe and put into words. \n \nIt's a game where the ghosts of a better past haunt lives that are irrevocably changed by things they have no power over, and how they respond to those changes.\nIt's a game about the struggles of identity: mental health; marginalisation and queerness; the difficult place between 'child' and 'adult', and the expectations involved in that.\nIt's a game that doesn't pull its punches when talking about the struggles to live a downtrodden life, but it also explores what's worth fighting for and how people figure out to persevere and pursue something better.\n\nPlenty of this stuff is subtext, or conveyed in low-key or nuanced ways, so there will definitely be people who will miss the things I'm talking about. But for the people who do pick those things up, it can be bittersweet and hit very hard.

I'm a HUGE lover of story-heavy, chill adventure games, and I became interested in the idea of a depressed college dropout experiencing \"strange things are happening as the light fades. And there's something in the woods\". I expected a slice-of-life mystery with (maybe) underlying themes about the uncomfortable transition to adulthood and accepting that things (and people) change. This is not what NITW delivers. \n\nWhat this game excels at is its overall art direction. The character designs, overall style and colour palette are WONDERFUL, and they really succeeded at making Possum Springs seem like a lived-in small town. I love the focus on Autumn, I love that each little NPC is clearly thought out and given unique dialogue. I love how the colour palette switches with the weather and I adore the soundtrack. I love the initial few days of gameplay. I love that the game is mostly wandering/exploring with little mini-games and interactive bits. It all has a chill, nostalgic feeling that I think suits the setting perfectly. \n\nWhere it falls short is in the actual story, and more specifically in the PACING. For a roughly 10 hour storyline, I am 5 hours in and I STILL have absolutely no idea what NITW is trying to say to me. The game introduces you to an idea (with the severed arm in Chapter one) and then just.... Never revisits it. I've only JUST encountered another piece of the 'mystery'. Almost 4 whole hours later. Instead of building on the intrigue of 'strange things are happening' (like the game description literally says), I've spent days and days hanging out with characters who also have pretty much nothing to say to me (story-wise). I have so much love for these kind of games that are silly with deeper themes (like Omori, Undertale, etc) but NITW has shown me the silly with not much else. I stole food, broke lightbulbs, helped carry stuff up a staircase, shot a target with a few arrows....... I don't know, it just feels so random and I haven't accomplished or discovered literally anything in this world. It took days and days of this sort of random stuff for a character to FINALLY open up enough to tell me that they have low self-worth (and then the topic is immediately dropped again). It's this sort of treatment that make it's very hard for this game to hold on to my attention, and is why I've decided to stop playing at this point. I fully acknowledge that I haven't finished the game, but I'm just not interested in doing regular boring stuff for 8 hours and then solving an entire mystery in the last 2 hours. \n\nAs a late 20s girl who's attending college for the second time now, I have so much in common with the main character and yet I can barely relate to her at all. Maybe I'm not the target demographic that the writers were going for with this story, because every single main character is so juvenile and teenage that it's kind of infuriating to me lol. I'm halfway through the main story and the main character hasn't done literally anything, and even just the way most of the characters speak makes me see them as teenagers. Maybe this game is made for people much younger than me, which is honestly fair. But it just felt weird playing as a character my age who speaks like and has the emotional intelligence of a 13 year old tumblr version of myself haha. \n\nHowever, I can tell that there's MANY people here who say this game means the world to them, and I won't discredit that.

I liked the presentation: Great art, animation and soundtrack, but all in all I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would. The story made me feel as if I was being constantly whacked over the head with not very subtle societal critique. It was like having this one person sitting next to you, incessantly poking you asking: \"You get it? You.Get.It?!\" I don't like people doing this in real life and having this done to me in videogames is even more annoying. Another very fatal flaw for me were the characters. While I liked them when they were initially introduced, the complete lack of character development made me fall out of love fast. \n\nMae - despite her constant reassurances that she was sorry and wanted to do better - most of the time ended up looking for excuses instead of actually owning up to her mistakes which made her quite the unlikable protagonist to play as. I didn't get why any of her friends actually enjoyed hanging out with her...well, aside from her constant \"quirkiness\" that made for a very shallow depiction of friendship. You as a player usually couldn't try to steer her away from disaster as your conversational choices simply seemed to change the \"flavor\", but not the actual outcome. There was no catharsis for me at the end, no \"Oh, so that's what I've been working towards\"-moment. \n\nMaybe that was the writers' intention, because yes, mental health is messy, there's often no clean \"solution\" and complete healing, life is hard and the world we live in is messed up, but quite honestly, despite me agreeing with a lot of messages in the game itself, it did little to actually make me resonate with it emotionally, as it all felt very superficial and the gameplay loop was veeeery tedious. Especially the dream sequences made me wish for a \"skip button\" that simply didn't exist. \n\nI am not someone who keeps away from games just because they are not \"fun\" in the conventional way. I've played tons of games that made me feel exhausted and they were that way by design, but at least they managed to grip me, so that I wanted to advance nonetheless. NitW didn't achieve that as nothing felt interesting enough to go further. There was no real surprise, no \"Oooooh!\" moment that made me want to explore more just for the heck of it. I could have played a fraction of my playtime and be done with it without feeling as if I missed something important or essential. \n\nThis game means a lot to a lot of people and I think I can see how it might be appealing to others, but it just didn't manage to enchant me the way it apparently did with others - which is perfectly ok. I am glad this game exists and I am happy that others have enjoyed it this much. It's just not for me and therefore I personally would not recommend it - especially not for full-price.

The amount of hours and achievements I have on steam are not at all indicative of my full experience of this game, as I have bought and 100%ed nitw on multiple platforms, multiple times. \n\tIt is impossible for me to give an unbiased review of night in the woods. This game has without a doubt made me into who I am today. This game has honed my personality and humor, making me into a better person in some ways, and worse in some. This game has been there for me since the day it came out on my shitty little Nintendo switch. Nitw has been there for me during the most significant parts of my life, and has helped me through so much, I would not be here today if not for nitw. The game somehow manages to hit right in the soul about whatever you're going through, no matter what it could be. Whenever im going through something, i know it will be there no matter what. I could go on about how much night in the woods means to me for hours, and I still feel like I'm leaving so so so much out just to make this review readable without being a pain in the ass. \n\tThe gameplay is exactly what it should be, night in the woods does not need any action or any in depth gameplay, it's all about the people and world around you, and how it goes on with or without you. Leaving you feel empty and small in how little change you can make as the metronome of time chimes on. You can break a log, but it only matters if someone walks that path of the woods. The story if you go straight from point A to B is fine, but that's not what it's about. It's about building connections, seeing the world go on around you, becoming the mother to some rats. It's about the journey. This goes hand in hand with the music, the music isn't ever over the top stupid upbeat and it inst melancholic for the point of being melancholic. But nonetheless it will never fail to make you feel something. There are countless times where i will boot up the game for the pure point of having the menu music on in the background as i do stuff.\n\tI don't know how to end this and I know that I'm missing shit but man. I fucking love night in the woods.

I first bought the game at new years, as some form of new years gift, but I got stuck in one of the dreams, because I'm not good at jumping and timing (That was fully my bad). I finally got that jumping part right, and so I got to proceed. And proceed it def did. \n\nWhen I tell you that this game made me feel so many damn emotions, to the point where I was thinking about not only the game, but also the emotions I felt with it as some form of nostalgia I suppose, during the day when I was doing other non-stuff not related to this game at all. It was a great trip. A great, sad, and heartwarming trip that felt so real. \n\nI absolutely love and adore the art style. The colours, the design was, to me, beautiful, and it all really just helped the store. I loved the little details that was scattered around. Like, for example the rats after a bit being literally everywhere. I also loved that we got to just hang out with them. \n\nAnd then for the fucking story?? Like- I don't even know how the creators did it, but I read and remembered every damned line. Which probably doesn't seem to be too unusual, considering how it's mainly a story game. But please do believe me when I write that I don't usually read the lore, story game or not. I love how realistic the conversations were. How strong some of the bonds Mae had with her friends and family were. and the fact that you could even notice as these bonds grew stronger and more healthy. I swear- the writing was like something out of this realm.\n\nAnd then, lastly: The music. My gosh. How much I loved the music. I personally really fell in love with \"Dusk Stars\" after watching a play through on youtube about 2 years ago. This has still not changed, and I listen to the song regularly. Now though, after finishing the game on my own, I've figured that there are most certainly many other bangers that I need to add to my playlist, as I didn't have anyone talk over the background music. The music is so good, I'll actually play through it again, just to experience the music all over again. \n\nAnd with how good the game is overall, I don't really think I'll struggle to enjoy it all a second time.\n(Plus- this time I get to build a monstrosity with Gregg, and not get depressed. (Not in the same way at least I reckon)) \n\nBut yeah, overall- \nAwesome game, have already recommended to friends, but that does not mean I'll stop.\nEels/10, will play again.", "timestamp_created": 1690065983, "timestamp_updated": 1690065983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142598924": {"recommendationid": "142598924", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036229797", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 936, "last_played": 1697688032}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy smokes mate, this game has a terrific story.", "timestamp_created": 1690051063, "timestamp_updated": 1690051063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142597356": {"recommendationid": "142597356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024808260", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2185, "last_played": 1690049047}, "language": "english", "review": "shes just like me fr", "timestamp_created": 1690049065, "timestamp_updated": 1690049065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142586219": {"recommendationid": "142586219", "author": {"steamid": "76561199256207631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1690058363}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is absolutely amazing, and if you haven't played it yet, you really should. it literally saved me after an incident of mine, and it holds a special place in my heart. the story, the soundtrack, the characters, EVERYTHING about this game is absolutely amazing. i have played it multiple times on my xbox, and i still can't get enough of it.\n\noverall a masterpiece of a game :)", "timestamp_created": 1690035755, "timestamp_updated": 1690035755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142585840": {"recommendationid": "142585840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161413371", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1690061707}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]I payed money for this...[/h1]\nIn \"Night in the Woods\" you walk.

You then go home and maybe have a dream. \nThis cycle becomes jarring after 3 times, since there is very little to explore in the minimal day-to-day changes the city goes through. Also, since it\u2019s a 2d sidescroller with minimal input required, exploration is nonexistent. \n\nBy mistake, I skipped encounters with half of the main cast on multiple occasions, and it did not once seem to have any effect on the story or dialogue.

Apenas puedes jugar a nada eso si incluimos que te pegas el 90% del juego leyendo dialogos inacabables, el resto es correteando sin hacer nada para que en 1% puedas jugar a dos tres mismos juegos repetidos....Lo dicho como historia puede salvarse pero como juego es que no hay  por donde cogerlo.", "timestamp_created": 1689599138, "timestamp_updated": 1689599138, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142255445": {"recommendationid": "142255445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995038059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 921, "last_played": 1689584435}, "language": "english", "review": "very cool artstyle tremendously delicious. wish there was an option to skip to the hangout scenes & experience both :(", "timestamp_created": 1689584459, "timestamp_updated": 1696522885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142255314": {"recommendationid": "142255314", "author": {"steamid": "76561199166022667", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1529, "last_played": 1694309945}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me lo acabo de terminar al 100% con todos los logros.\nSi quieren sanidad mental no lo hagan porfavor", "timestamp_created": 1689584236, "timestamp_updated": 1689584236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142246509": {"recommendationid": "142246509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213390900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1058, "last_played": 1691811649}, "language": "english", "review": "Good, makes me feel not like just a bunch of shapes.", "timestamp_created": 1689568808, "timestamp_updated": 1689568808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142243274": {"recommendationid": "142243274", "author": {"steamid": "76561199262831851", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 593, "last_played": 1689563148}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has everything, a edgy teen, shoplifting, gay people and so much more.

And learning to cope with the terrifying  weight of responsibility and consequence. It spoke to me on so many levels and I think it's a fascinating masterpiece.\nThe only con I can think of is that going for completion would be a whole lot easier with a manual save and load function, as there are certain optional events that are possible to miss or fail, causing you to lose the achievement.\nBut come here for the story, trust me.\nPlay it!", "timestamp_created": 1689562474, "timestamp_updated": 1689562474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458177268505096436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142236251": {"recommendationid": "142236251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198750703371", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 6076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 107, "playtime_at_review": 2252, "last_played": 1699955518}, "language": "english", "review": "Night in the Woods.

Immediately obvious with the game from photos is it's distinct and original art style with animal characters, an aged small rural town, and the colors of fall on the trees. This experience of comfort is even more enhanced by the game's phenomenal soundtrack which plays in the foreground as you explore the town and talk to characters.\n\nAll of the characters are strange and unique from each other with their own charming or humorous dialogue. The characters in this game are the heart of the game and really encourage the player to listen to everything every person has to say because each one is different and uniquely entertaining.\n\nYou will need to play this game at least 2 times to fully complete it and experience everything. There will also need to be 2 extra partial playthroughs if you seek to 100% the trophies in the game according to guides on the game. I have only played the game two times now.\n\nThe only issue I really have with the game is keeping track of the days. If you don't explore everything within a day or accidentally hang out with Greg or Bea too soon you will skip out on seeing everything that day has to over. ALSO, on some day if you go out west of the town past the supermarket and see Germ, fully explore the town before talking to him. He will ask if you're willing to hang out and if you reject his offer you can't accept it later. \n\nThis game is brimming with content and even extra content like concept art and early test projects on Night in the Woods.

You'd think with 6 years to think about it I'd be able to properly articulate my thoughts but when it comes to this game, I don't know I guess it hurts too much. So I'll just have to try, I have to write something about a game this impactful on my life.\n\nWhen Night in the Woods came out in February of 2017 I truly had no idea, it wasn't something that was really on my radar at the time and I didn't actually pick it up until about June of that same year, most likely on sale and definitely because I was drawn in by the art and music on the store page. So no, this wasn't a game I had been following and hyped for, this wasn't a game I thought I wanted, but it turned out to be exactly what I needed at the time. \n\nWhen I picked this game up I was just a sophomore in college going through an existential crisis about what I really wanted to do with my life and my studies, I was a mechanical engineering student and, to say the least, I was struggling. I had chosen that academic path only for a few reasons, I was decent enough at Physics, Math and Chemistry in high school, I was led to believe by my parents, my teachers, and some of my peers that it was a good career choice that would make me financially secure, and finally, like most kids, I wanted to be an Astronaut. That wasn't really working out, and half way through that year I realized it was never what I wanted to do and I was really thinking about calling it quits, throwing in the towel and simply giving up on it all, I thought I was failure. The only thing keeping me going were my friends, my partner, and my very slow realization that I wanted to be a photographer and an artist. But I couldn't decide between simply giving up, or taking the risk of changing academic paths and throwing away two whole already paid for years of school and adding an additional two to the future, I was scared and unsure.\n\nWhen I started playing Night in the Woods it was another means of escaping reality and the choices I was facing, just another game with a cutesy art style and some soothing music that I could use to distract myself. So, I was surprised when the story began to play out and it was revealed that the main character, Mae, was a 20 something year old who just dropped out of college after only 3 semesters because the pressure of it all was weighing down on their shoulders and their own emotional issues were causing turmoil in their academic life. When I met Mae I didn't just see another character in a video game, I saw a reflection of myself. Not 1:1 of course, but they were just close enough to allow myself to be placed in their shoes, in their head, and in their story.\n\nI could go on and on about it, but nobody needs my entire life story on a steam review and all it really comes down to is this; I connected with a character in a video game so much that at the end of it all I decided to make what turned out to be one of the best decisions of my entire life, and I couldn't be more grateful. \n\nThe game play, the artwork, the music, the characters, and the writing, all of it is amazing, even if the story loses a bit of focus at the end. It's a game that I would recommend to everyone and anyone, but those aren't the reasons I love Night in the Woods, and \"just anyone\" isn't who I want to recommend this game to in this review. If, like me back in 2017, you're in your late teens/early twenties, you're struggling in life, whether it be your higher academics, emotional issues, or something else entirely, you're looking for an escape that might actually help you, you're looking for a character you can latch onto and a story you can relate to, even learn from, then I highly recommend you play Night in the Woods. It might not have the same effect on you that it did on me, but at the end of the day you'll have played through an incredible experience that I hope you'll love either way.\n\nThis wasn't just a game for me, this was a life preserver that was tossed my way at a time when I was drowning. It might be dramatic to say but this game helped to save me from that, and I will always hold it near and dear to me. Please give it a shot and I promise that at the very least you'll take something away from it.", "timestamp_created": 1689006863, "timestamp_updated": 1689017413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844724416732788086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141769127": {"recommendationid": "141769127", "author": {"steamid": "76561199181533201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1693766720}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi.

At first, I was eager for the narrative to dive into the big, earth-shattering moments I anticipated, but the game had other plans. Instead, it took its time, allowing me to immerse myself in the quiet moments shared between friends in the sleepy mining town of Possum Springs.\n\nThe game's strength lies in its beautifully written scenes, where friends navigate the complexities of their relationships, hurt each other, reconcile, and strive to move forward. The dialogue, though occasionally veering into cutesy territory, captures the essence of a group of individuals straddling the precarious gap between adulthood and childhood.\n\nSpeaking of characters, Night in the Woods boasts a cast that is both damaged and endearing. Each anthropomorphized animal possesses a depth and decency rarely seen in game characters. Their struggles and flaws feel relatable and human, making them incredibly compelling.\n\nInterestingly, the game centers around an unlikable protagonist, Mae, whose selfishness, cruelty, and self-absorption can be hard to swallow at times. It's a bold choice that allows the supporting characters to shine even brighter, showcasing their virtues and their unwavering loyalty to Mae, despite her flaws. It's a testament to the game's writing that it made me wonder if the developers were aware of the challenging nature of their main character.\n\nFrom a mechanical perspective, Night in the Woods leans towards being a platformer, with plenty of rooftop leaping and the occasional minigame. While these aspects are serviceable, they don't stand out as the game's strongest features. However, the interactive nature of the game shines through in the ability to choose which characters to interact with and how frequently. This personal touch adds depth to the connections you build and makes the experience feel more tailored to your choices.\n\nBut Night in the Woods is more than just a game\u2014it delves into profound themes of choice and obligation. It raises questions about what we are forced into versus what we can choose for ourselves, without providing easy answers. The journey is a mixture of beauty and sorrow, evoking genuine emotional responses that left me in tears on multiple occasions.\n\nIn the end, Night in the Woods is a remarkable game that goes beyond its mechanical aspects. It invites you to explore the human condition, challenging your perception of characters and relationships. It's an experience that lingers long after you've put down the controller, leaving a lasting impact and reminding us of the power of storytelling in video games.\n\nFollow My Curator Page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44271151/", "timestamp_created": 1688931583, "timestamp_updated": 1688954036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141674558": {"recommendationid": "141674558", "author": {"steamid": "76561199152174602", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1699299954}, "language": "english", "review": "A very very beautiful game and immersive game.

As a very rough overview, you, as Mae, are returning to your hometown, which is presumably in the Rust-Belt USA. With this, you get the full small-town experience with found family, mystery, intrigue, and many whispered secrets.  Without going in to spoilers, just know that your choices do matter, so treasure and explore them to the fullest.", "timestamp_created": 1688698145, "timestamp_updated": 1688698145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141490232": {"recommendationid": "141490232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319694692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1328, "last_played": 1688699468}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute cat game with a good sense of dark humor, story is really good and sound track is amazing.

I have a difficult time crying, and now I'll get to my point: \n\nthis game is therapeutic. I needed to play this and I think anyone that's come unto a rough period in their life needs to as well. If you need to cry, then play this. I feel so much shame and guilt for being how and who I am, and it's so... comforting to see this written into a character. It makes me yearn for days I've never had.\n\nPlus, the soundtrack is gorgeous. It's angelic. It's soothing. It's melancholic. It makes you close your eyes and be at peace. \n\nI don't want to give this game a \"so and so out of 10\" rating because it doesn't deserve that.

And I suppose I did enjoy his part in this game's development. The music was charming, as were the artwork and the general overall aesthetic.\n\nThat's where the enjoyment stops for me, however. If I had to tell a friend about this game, I would describe it as a constant depressive existential crisis, about a group of constant depressive existential crises. That is to say, that is the identity of the game, its story, and every character in it. And even speaking as a person who's had plenty of depressive existential experiences, I found it to be too much so to be relatable. Every single character (of all ages) in this game has a distinct juvenile overly-edgy randomness, well past the point of cringe; the sort you typically see only among preteens. The story and progression itself is a directionless slog through pointless activities and empty conversations, the likes of which you'd see as filler in an RPG. I kept waiting for the plot to go somewhere, or for the characters to arc in any meaningful way, but both developments were horribly disappointing and lackluster, right up to the drawn-out, anticlimactic ending.\n\nNow, even on cursory research about the game's achievements, it seems that it's only possible to get them all via multiple playthroughs. That's a tough sell, because in order for the game to have replay value, it would need to have play value in the first place. But even your decisions in the game seem to make so little difference to anything, that by the end you've basically seen everything, or at the very least you've seen enough. Because of my own neurosis, I'm likely to try to get the rest of the achievements some day, at which point I'll be reminded why I didn't enjoy it the first time.", "timestamp_created": 1687583137, "timestamp_updated": 1687583137, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490491777658462524", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140587975": {"recommendationid": "140587975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014807154", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1687565989}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an extremely good game tbh; it's a very character focused cosmic horror story. A lot of the game is jumping around, talking to people, play bass, grab things with paws, dream, and continually question if the protagonist is crazy or not. The entire game is based around a small town, so there are a lot of small towns things people might relate to. A lot of the problems with the protagonist and characters can feel all too relatable; there is a lot going on in their heads that slowly gets revealed with conversation. The art style and music blend together really well, and invoke a feeling of optimistic melancholy. \n\nOne of the themes in the game is \"open endedness\"; you don't get the full picture of things. There are no conclusions in this story; everything is left to assumptions and theories. Characters open up and explain things about themselves, or how they feel about others, but that's just the characters. The story is just, \"I don't know\"- and that is one of the true horrors of the world; you just don't ever know what's next or what's going on.\n\nIt's a really interesting game- and it is worth playing. Also, it's important to note that you jump like you can fly. If you are ever in a lucid dream, you can fly by skipping into a jump three times, and on the third jump you can go as high as you want.

With that out of the way here is my review of this game:\n\nPROS: Story telling of the game was awesome. The events that took place during the game, was always something you wouldn't expect. Dialogue with every character had it's moments of happiness, frustration, sadness & even some funny or weird WTF moments. Soundtrack was really good and the art style was charming. There is also a roguelike / metroidvenia style game inside of this game that you can play on the computer in your bedroom, that is a joy play. Also playing the bass minigames was really fun to do.\n\nCONS: Some moments left me with a foul taste in my mouth because of social justice activism and a liberal migraine. All achievements are hidden, so if you wan't to complete the game you have to find the right guides on the Steam community page. The controls would be much better if I actually played it on a gamepad instead of a keyboard. Also the game just ends out of nowhere!? A cliffhanger and no news of a sequel is just a rip-off at this point.\n\nCONCLUSION: Night in the Woods is proof that a crowd funded project can be great. I just like many others, had this game in my backlog for way too long, and I'm glad that I actually took the time to finally sit down and beat this cool indie game.

"language": "english", "review": "Night in the Woods is a game I have never thought I would love. At first I did not want to play it as it seemed like another ordinary story-driven game. I saw YouTubers play it, forums talking about the game, and the like. However it is much more than that. It is evident that the developers made this game with so much love. From the art and music, to the characters, and the whole story itself. The game had so much impact on me not only as a gamer, but as a person.\n\nThe art style is really warm and comfy because of the immense autumn vibes this game exudes.  The character and background design is so well done. From the buildings to the trees to the characters and NPCs walking around. This game strikes a cozy feeling while also, in some areas, catching a sense of fear or dread.\n\nMae Borowski, the main character, possesses so much personality and background that you cannot help but feel happiness, sorrow, anger, and sympathy with her. Essentially, every character in the game is written so well that it all makes sense and is not confusing. Mae, Bea, Gregg, and Angus aren't the only ones to receive attention from the developers. Characters like Selma get excellent writing too with regards to her history. The characters in this game make you feel like they are actually real people, with homey dialogue and friendly banter. You will not grow bored with the conversations.\n\nWith a story written so well and so good, this game impacted me significantly. These include the histories of these characters, constellations, the economic disarray of Possum Springs, the dark secrets hiding in the forest (or should I say, the woods), and much more. The philosophical discussions the characters get in to are thought provoking.  These topics include psychology and mental health, friendship, mortality, religion, and a little bit of politics (although not overtly) and have made me question my own ideals and beliefs. Every little bit of detail is utilized so perfectly and coherently that it forms into a decisive story.\n\nOverall, Night in the Woods is an amazing story-driven game that I highly recommend playing. The developers did great with the amazing art and music, well thought out characters, and the well-written story. I cannot help but thank the developers for making this work of art. If you want a game that hits the senses and the feels, this is a must have. \n", "timestamp_created": 1686385045, "timestamp_updated": 1689074349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723353147506713867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139821188": {"recommendationid": "139821188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198843704249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1640724638}, "language": "english", "review": "This might be the best written game I've ever played, everything ties together to it's central themes so fucking well.

good rating. i really do. as night in the woods is extremely popular on xbox and PS4 already this is more of a mere critique of one of the game's features as die-hard fans of this game have already noticed the small details of the story lines bits (this is a game with multiple endings) and other miscellaneous details i might miss. \n\nokay, so, first off, the character design cannot be topped. this game came out years ago and seeing fanarts of it online and heavily inspired games after it such as 'the fall of porcupine' which i've seen on my steam queue quite a bit now; i think it's upped purposefully for night in the woods game owners. the animation is flawless, crisp, just overall really smooth. the colour pallets and use of colour theory is immaculate and unique- rustic orange telling you a warm, loving setting apart from turquoise-blue murmuring an \"evil\" alleyway or underground system to you. before post-covid multimedia transferable animations this style of animation was like the *it* of it's decade. it is reminiscent of the calarts effect because of the proportions on these anthropomorphic animals though, lol.\n\nokay, so onto the mess that is my critique. my main problem with this game. it is demon tower. i have played night in the woods and i've had so many short-lived sessions with this game for literal [b]YEARS[/b] because of the micro-minigame demon tower. you spawn as a cat into random RNG dungeons and have to wiggle your way out of foes with shitty mechanics and terrible hit boxes. by google searching [i]\"how to beat level 7, uggghh\",[/i] SO many people on reddit and other internet forums have had their go at demon tower and very rarely do they succeed within an hour or even a few hours. it is a generally terrible experience because it insists on being so classic like arcade games were in their time; standard procedure you lose an available heart each level you go up.\n\nlevel 5-7 took me about 2 hours per level each. i am on level 8 now. the boss is just... terrible? i have a poor attention span... but boy, just no reaction time can top some of these bosses truly. since games update based on profit incentive and not passion i don't ever expect an update for demon tower's mechanics or RNG even when people like me will literally have their enjoyment overridden by this game because of how shitty demon tower is.",

You're guaranteed to meet some personalities you can't help but grow attached to (Greg rulez!OK?).\n\nAs a plot driven game, the pacing serves perfectly. You truly get a sense of the days dragging on and yet seamlessly merging together, fittingly capturing that feeling of being stuck at home as an adult, not really sure where you're going. As for the story itself; it's a great vessel to learn more about the characters, really leaving you rooting for everyone! However, some of Mae's mental health struggles, on which the story pivots are incredibly specific and, I would hazard, alienating to many people. Moreover, the final third of the game is a bit rushed and arrives at an unsatisfying conclusion. That criticism aside there's still much there to be enjoyed.\n\nThe game is packaged beautifully, with consistent visual tones for all of it's scenes, accompanied by a sweet and memorable soundtrack and straightforward game-play which facilitates the steady flow of the narrative. As an animator myself, I really appreciated \"Night in the Woods\"' simple but adorable artstyle!\n\nNight int the Woods is definitely worth playing. If you've ever felt stuck in life, I think you'll like it. Although the story is rushed near the ending, it's unforgettable characters, beautiful style and sountrack more than make up for it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1684351080, "timestamp_updated": 1684351080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556564927101135254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138417808": {"recommendationid": "138417808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198892718962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1334, "last_played": 1688086760}, "language": "english", "review": " infinite fall owes me royalties for basing mae on me", "timestamp_created": 1684292419, "timestamp_updated": 1684292419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138416367": {"recommendationid": "138416367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347184620", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 538, "last_played": 1696636337}, "language": "english", "review": "that cat is soo silly i like the crocodile thing too", "timestamp_created": 1684289118, "timestamp_updated": 1684289118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138415493": {"recommendationid": "138415493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330192463", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1684059134}, "language": "english", "review": "i love the characters gregg is LITERAL LY ME good :thumbs_up:", "timestamp_created": 1684287181, "timestamp_updated": 1684287181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60658496618270874", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138412081": {"recommendationid": "138412081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202215090", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3449, "last_played": 1690609834}, "language": "english", "review": "Such an amazing game, i feel like everytime i feel bad I come back to this game and play it, it means so much to me", "timestamp_created": 1684279726, "timestamp_updated": 1684279726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138398596": {"recommendationid": "138398596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175900371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1685721339}, "language": "spanish", "review": "A great experience", "timestamp_created": 1684271994, "timestamp_updated": 1684271994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138393479": {"recommendationid": "138393479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286812244", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 761, "last_played": 1670168809}, "language": "english", "review": "You can eat pizza crust and play a roguelike 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1684263870, "timestamp_updated": 1684263870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138368198": {"recommendationid": "138368198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348555774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1300, "last_played": 1592897205}, "language": "english", "review": "Reviewing this before and after my lobotomy at Claires!

Night in the Woods is a special game.\nIf you see this game on sale and are considering getting it - do it. (I bought it full price and have zero regrets!).\nThe game has roughly a 9 hour story arc which features a decent amount of exploration & character development (from an achievement perspective, I unlocked 25% with 10 hours game time - so perhaps a re-play through in the future is in order!).\nFor those who have played the game...

I do not like saying this because I don\u2019t enjoy tearing games down and I was genuinely looking forward to playing this, but outside of the art direction, music and Demontower minigame, Night in the Woods did not appeal to me in the way I was hoping it would.\n\nThe story, for what little there is, is generally unfocused and lacking in any real urgency, drama or stakes for roughly 85% of the story. I understand that this is a slice-of-life, slowburn type of deal and I was not expecting the story to hook me immediately. The vibes for the first hour or so were pretty good, but as the game progressed I was hoping the story would naturally develop into something more interesting and I was left wanting until the last quarter of the game. I can only speak for myself of course, but eventually your story needs a hook and this story barely has even that for most of its runtime.\n\nIf the characters of Night in the Woods were more interesting and fascinating this glacial pacing could\u2019ve been acceptable to me, unfortunately the characters do not fare much better either. I enjoyed talking to Gregg, Bea and Candy. The rest of the main and supporting cast were not very interesting or developed. I found Mae, the main character of the game to be a conflicting presence in the story. She is deeply troubled, lacking any real focus in her life, depressed and her general dissociation from the real world was initially compelling and I did see parts of myself in her character when I was younger. Sadly, as the game progressed her responses to her friends' issues rubbed me the wrong way and I found her to be increasingly less relatable as the game pushed forward. I didn\u2019t dislike her presence in the story, but by the end of the game I was very indifferent to her overall.\n\nThe story touches on topics like paranormal activity, the cruel indifference of capitalism, mental illness, cults and the expectations of being an adult in a world that does not care for you.\n\nSomehow, this game did not click for me despite it seeming tailor made for me based on these topics and yet I felt underwhelmed after completing it. Why is that? It\u2019s hard to fully pin down in an easily digestible sentence, but I think the writing wasn\u2019t interested in exploring these concepts in a way that was interesting.\n\nAt the very least, the game did not resonate with me in the same way it did for most other players. I initially assumed the slow start would eventually pay off. It did not. The ending was also fairly abrupt and I did not feel satisfied with its conclusion.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, most people who play this do genuinely see something special about it even if I personally did not. I do not even fully regret playing it, but I think I could\u2019ve stopped playing it around the 3 or 4 hour mark and achieved the same level of satisfaction from it that I did after completing it. If you want an adventure game that is cute, has quirky dialogue and is running entirely on vibes, you will probably find NITW to be a good time. If you expect the game to be anything more than that, you might be a little disappointed with the overall experience.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1683878172, "timestamp_updated": 1683878172, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568149864673614502", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138134637": {"recommendationid": "138134637", "author": {"steamid": "76561199393225525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1699194301}, "language": "english", "review": "this game changed my view on gaming", "timestamp_created": 1683807999, "timestamp_updated": 1683807999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138118587": {"recommendationid": "138118587", "author": {"steamid": "76561199438779207", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 689, "last_played": 1684281373}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS ALL I ACTUALLY SPEND TIME ON", "timestamp_created": 1683767489, "timestamp_updated": 1683767489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138080780": {"recommendationid": "138080780", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208408808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1696023330}, "language": "english", "review": "engaging story line, beautiful art style, excellent soundtrack and sound effects, and fun characters!\n\nnot a fan of the guitar playing mechanic but that's not a big issue. i just lack rhythm.", "timestamp_created": 1683701188, "timestamp_updated": 1683701188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138076604": {"recommendationid": "138076604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334606548", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 736, "last_played": 1687066208}, "language": "english", "review": "Night in the Woods", "timestamp_created": 1683690244, "timestamp_updated": 1683690244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138057928": {"recommendationid": "138057928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030978836", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 1071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 985, "last_played": 1683774489}, "language": "english", "review": "Night in the Woods charmed me, spooked me, and got me thinking about lots of nihilistic feelings I've been having for a while.

I generally love walking sims, but I could see how some people would get tired of all the redundant exploration. At least the art is a joy to look at.\n\nWhat also helps is the enjoyable dialogue. The characters and interactions are very cozy, friendly, and goofy. It evokes the same sort of feelings I got when I first finished Persona 4--feeling a strange, but warming, sort of connection to these unreal, digital people, and a sort of emptiness when it's all over.

The well rounded soundtrack and sound work/ambient sounds (the bounce/step sounds are stellar!!!) immediately drag you into the setting. Platforming feels smooth and fun, and combined with the unique art-style it makes \"just walking around to go talk to your neighbours and friends\" really entertaining. The cozy style adds a nice contrast to the (gloomy at points) story, and the writing and developement of the characters make you forget that you are, in fact, talking to a 2-D animal drawing. Speaking of 2-D; the characters are anything but. Everything feels so alive, I do not know how else to describe it.\n\nIn short: a really interesting, emotional, delightful game.

Did I miss something or am I simply not getting it? For a game that scored this high I had equally high expectations, but with each hour spent in the game I gradually became more and more bored, the game is a walking simulator most of the time and that is one of the weakest parts of the game, each day you have to walk through the same location with the same slow walking speed. I get that the highlight of the game supposed to be the story, which also falls flat. From the start game throws at you a couple mysteries that are supposed to keep you engaged and try to figure out what's going on as the story progresses. The problem is that is the game fails to deliver any answers to your questions and just throws more plot points or give you like a half baked answer. \n[Spoilers ahead] We play as Mea, a 20 years old cat lady who's a collage dropout and has no idea what to do in her life, which I guess was ment to be relatable to people in a simular situation, but the relatability end's here. Seriously, how does people find her appealing? Her demeanor is of a child, who has no self awareness and plays the know-it-all at times, moreover she has like no character development, she never learns from her behavior and stays the same through the plot, besides maybe getting more spiritual/depressed or whatever those dreams ment to be. Halfway through the game some hooded mofo appears, who kiddnaps some guy and runs of, later you learn there's a whole cult of them in the old cave and they're on a mission to change the world by killing people by pushing them in the hole or some sheet (I might have made some of that up) and then they disappear never to be seen again and game ends... What is the point, what is the message of the game, because that's what is important here, nothing made sense at the end, no message to take from the game.

If I had to summarize, what it does good, it does pretty good. But in order to get to the good, there's a lot of tedium to go through, and the boredom of that tedium rubs off on the good of the game.\n\nWhat I liked about this game is everything about the game except the game. Music and visuals and what have you are cute, but the soul of this game is its character writing and themes. Most of what works about Night in the Woods can be summarized by focusing on Mae. Mae is a fascinating character. She succeeds where Alex YIIK fails - she is a frustrating, immature asshole who I should hate, and yet I can\u2019t, because I see too much of myself in her.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to verbalize what makes her a great character, but it\u2019s probably because she\u2019s uncomfortably relatable. She wants to get better, but she doesn\u2019t know how. The person she lies to the most is herself. She can\u2019t bring herself to open up with those around her. She\u2019s someone who, scared of growing up, chose to cope instead of moving on, despite everyone else moving beyond that point. And I know too well what all of that feels like.\n\nMae isn\u2019t a good person, but it isn\u2019t entirely her fault, either. What brought Mae to this point is a combination of her own mistakes and things out of her control, and the game\u2019s exploration of what shaped her is where a lot of the themes come in. This game touches on many, many concepts - coming of age, mental illness, capitalism - and Mae has been shaped by these concepts in some way or another. Mae grapples with understanding these concepts herself, and the game takes a magnifying glass to her and the way she\u2019s tangled in a complex web of themes in order to examine them with an insightful understanding of why they so deeply affect Mae and the world she lives in - and how Mae and the world respond to these themes in return. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like about this game was the game. In a single word, it's slow. Slow can be good. I'm not a stranger to slow games. One of my favourite games of all time is a visual novel. But Night in the Woods is S. L. O. W. Slow. The bulk of the gameplay is slowly travelling across town, slowly enough and often enough that what starts off quaint becomes frustratingly tedious quickly. The little snippets of other gameplay during story beats are a change of pace, but ultimately too shallow to be particularly interesting. And those story beats sound with a strange narrative rhythm.\n\nNight in the Woods spends a lot of its time as a slice of life with day to day interactions. And while I love slice of life and will argue that \u201ca narrative doesn\u2019t always need a story, just good characters\u201d, Night in the Woods puts that argument to the test. Even though I adore the characters and the slices of their lives we see, with the sluggish gameplay filling the gaps between those interactions, what could have been a nice and sweet experience instead feels like a chore that drags on for too long, especially without a particularly sharp narrative hook for most of the game.\n\nAnd when the game decides to attach its hook, it\u2019s a strange, strange hook. It\u2019s a hook that, despite feeding into the numerous themes and being hinted at throughout the game, still comes in out of left field. It\u2019s an entertaining and thrilling hook, but a strange hook nonetheless. And once it hooks, the game immediately reels in at that instant, ending almost immediately after hooking, ending on an anti-climatic climax without resolve. Was this the intent? I think so. Is it unsatisfying regardless? I also think so.\n\nIn the end, I'm torn. While I liked my time with the game, the parts that I didn\u2019t enjoy are what stuck with me. My overall feelings are mixed, and yet I still can\u2019t tell if I liked this game or not. I would give this game a negative review, but Steam's review system is based on recommending or not recommending a game. And I do recommend this game.\n\nI played this game at a very fitting time in my life, being in the exact same situation as the main character - a 20 year old college dropout struggling to find out what to do with their life, wanting to become a better person without knowing how. Playing this game was like staring at a mirror. Maybe it's for this reason I expected more from this game. As silly as it is, I wanted this game to give me answers. And to its credit, it did give answers. But I don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t take those answers. Maybe they\u2019re answers I\u2019ve already known, maybe they\u2019re answers I didn\u2019t know how to take, maybe they\u2019re answers I refused to take, maybe I flat out missed an answer, maybe I didn\u2019t understand those answers, maybe I just wasn\u2019t ready for those answers. I don\u2019t know.\n\nThis game is exactly the game I needed, one that was practically designed to resonate with me, and yet, it didn\u2019t. Night in the Woods may not have fully resonated with me, but there's people out there that it will. And I hope this game reaches them.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I like this game.

I have no problems with the amount of \u201cfiller\u201d though, because I don\u2019t hate messing around the town. \n\nLove the inclusion of small mini-games, adds more stuff to mess around with. The game lets you see multiple perspectives in life. Makes you realize how life is quite short, how much others have sacrificed their time for you. How it feels like to be the hardworking one, or how it feels like to be a slouch-er. Seems like in real life it\u2019s best to be in between, work hard but don\u2019t let it ruin your fun (easier said than done though). My opinions and thoughts obtained from the game, at least.

I watch and read a lot of reviews for games to find out what to play. This game not only scores really well, but I often see it as a successful comparison for pulling off what another game tried to do. After hearing all of that, I still don\u2019t get the praise. A lot of that could be linked back to the narrative not personally clicking with me, but even then there\u2019s a bunch of little things that I\u2019m not a fan of.\n\nNight in the Woods is a walking simulator and I\u2019ve made my opinions on those pretty clear in the past. Besides just walking around, you can choose who you hang out with while the main story progresses. There\u2019s no real effect on the actual plot when you only hang out with different people. All it dictates is what scenes you\u2019ll see. Unlike most walking sims though, this one has a little arcade game called Demontower and I\u2019m really glad it exists. It\u2019s a teensy little roguelike that I didn\u2019t experiment with too much, but I like that the game actually has some gameplay in it past what dialogue you get dumped with. I overall think my enjoyment with NitW would be much higher if it was an animated short or film because of its minimal gameplay. It\u2019s a very frequent trend where games that focus entirely on their story just give up when it comes to actually being a video game. It\u2019s not like good writing and good gameplay are mutually exclusive; So why do we have to stop the interactivity at who you hang out with?\n\nSo that makes the story the major selling point. I play games with really bad writing all the time and while NitW isn\u2019t anywhere near the level of some of the worst I\u2019ve seen, that doesn\u2019t make it really good. It\u2019s mainly the characters and ending for me, but I\u2019ll personally admit that I didn\u2019t really relate to the main character and that seemed to be the main goal the story was trying to achieve. Mae as a whole is a really irritating character for me. She\u2019s rude, brash, reckless, violent, and just kind of a dick. Some of her endeavors include mindless destruction and a game of stabbing each other with her friend. I know she\u2019s meant to be a childish college dropout that doesn\u2019t know what to do with her life, but I think most people in that situation at least try not to throw a temper tantrum over every little thing. Some of the side characters are just as guilty as this, with Bea being the only notable exception. I honestly don\u2019t believe that Bea and Mae are friends at all though. As for the ending; It just sort of throws the entire plot at you and then just ends? Like a whole cult shows up responsible for most of the background plot and they just sorta disappear as quickly as they appeared. There are also the dream sequences which felt like they were put in to give the impression that the game is deep, but I\u2019m willing to potentially chalk that up to me just not getting it. The story as a whole can be divided into parts that greatly irritated me, bored me, or confused me.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2042208284\nThe only thing I really like about the game is the art style. It\u2019s got a very simplistic hand-drawn 2D look to it. I\u2019ve never seen another game that looks like it. The best way I can compare it to is the generic corporate style you see in advertising but with a spray of actual humanity and identity applied to it. Probably not the best comparison, but I kind of like it overall. I\u2019ve also heard a lot of really good things about the OST but again it\u2019s just something that didn\u2019t click with me. I\u2019ve linked the most popular song below though.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038550713\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_yyu-kqfBs\nOverall, I don\u2019t really like Night in the Woods. [b]Maybe it\u2019s just not for me or maybe I just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m personally giving it a 4/10 but I think I would\u2019ve enjoyed it way more if it wasn\u2019t a game.[/b] If it was an animated short, show, or film I think I would\u2019ve actually liked it way more. Might\u2019ve prevented me from seeing some of the bits that really aggravated me in the first place as well. I know it\u2019s very common to see tons of games that only care about developing their story, but I feel like too many of them don\u2019t even come close to gripping with said story.

The game starts in a bus station with Mae Borowski returning to Possum Springs, her hometown, after dropping out of college. \n\nAdmittedly, I was not a fan of Mae and preferred Bea, her childhood best friend, more as a character. I found Mae to be aimless, too negative, constantly making excuses, lacking self-awareness, and making sarcastic remarks during the first hours I played the game. Despite these issues, I have 27.3 hours of playtime recorded on Steam because of how much I immersed myself in the first playthrough.\n\nThe art, soundtrack, characters, atmosphere, and aesthetic of the game easily won me over, but what made me love it was how relatable and existential it got later on. I originally thought that it was going to be a cutesy-styled game that would be a coming-of-age story, but instead, it reminded me of themes from EEAAO. From ideas of this monstrous existence, choice, and freedom; the purpose of life; regret, pain, and missing out on experiences and opportunities; to the eventual existential crisis, I started to find Mae and other characters relatable. \n\nNITW constantly had me guessing what the meaning of it was since it combined the elements of a small nostalgic town with creepy cultists and a philosophical cosmic horror\u2026 sky cat? I enjoyed the minigames they had in them, especially Mae\u2019s journal with doodles. \n\nOthers may not like this game because it's a walking simulator or an interactive movie, but I think that video games shouldn\u2019t be limited to FPS or horror. I think that if you are interested in philosophy or the arts, you should be willing to try it out in different mediums, like video games. Games like What Remains of Edith Finch, Scorn, Outerwilds, and even Disco Elysium (which I all love, btw) are great examples of video games with fantastic storytelling and dialogue. I was not kidding when I said that Annapurna Interactive is the equivalent of A24 Studios in gaming. Either way, I highly recommend this game to anyone into \u201cinteractive movies.\u201d\n\nTake note that this is a very surface-level review of the game annnnd that I bought it while on sale (around PHP 100)", "timestamp_created": 1678233092, "timestamp_updated": 1678233092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134266615": {"recommendationid": "134266615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130120067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1574, "last_played": 1678233379}, "language": "english", "review": "Entirely pleasant, uneventful and very relaxing gaming experience.\n\nLook at the funny animals walking around haha I'm sure everyone is doing great and feeling happy and fulfilled haha.", "timestamp_created": 1678230408, "timestamp_updated": 1678230408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134257715": {"recommendationid": "134257715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125213195", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1430, "last_played": 1677257500}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\nI'm now emotionally attached to these fictional characters. \n\nAt the end of everything, hold on to anything.", "timestamp_created": 1678218140, "timestamp_updated": 1678218140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134254917": {"recommendationid": "134254917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330096870", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 743, "last_played": 1688508451}, "language": "english", "review": "Gregg rulz ok", "timestamp_created": 1678214825, "timestamp_updated": 1678214825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134245596": {"recommendationid": "134245596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108626043", "num_games_owned": 355, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 701, "last_played": 1675666745}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a story game through and through. I was dragging my feet on playing it for a long time, and now that I have, I'm a little annoyed it took me this long. But in further explanation of my first sentence there, I don't want people to think this game is more than what it is, because otherwise, you might feel disappointed.\n\nThe story itself is really nice. [b] Although it features a rather small cast of characters, each have such vibrant personalities that you will remember them for months after the fact. [/b] I gripe that the story starts real slow and then speeds up, but it's generally made that way so you have time to bond with the characters, especially because you don't really know any part of the picture on this story going into it, not even Mae, the main character. Talking to characters always feels fresh and interesting, the dialogue is so witty and charming in a dry kind-of way, and I never felt bored at any point when people were talking.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay gets stale pretty fast outside of the minigames embedded in the story. Walking around a world that doesn't change for 5, 6, 7 hours doesn't feel great, and really hurts what should be decent replayability. You'll be jumping around a map for a couple minutes searching for some dialogue that you may or may not find. [b] Exploration, while it's there, isn't necessarily it's greatest strength. [/b] It's just not rewarding enough for players outside a couple achievements and a small laugh. Now the minigames, there's some good content. The music segments are amazing, the shoplifting minigames are great, the dumb one-off minigames you never see again feel so well-implemented you'd wonder why they didn't get their money's worth.\n\nI think I've based the gameplay enough to be able to gush about the music and art of this game. [b] It oozes early 2000s aesthetic in its world, done in this really nice and creative almost construction paper craft-like art style that makes any screenshot of this game [i] instantly [/i] recognizable. [/b] The indie rock in this game will make you unable to focus on the fact that you have to play the music minigame to hear it. That's a good thing, I think (maybe?). It's good. Real good. So much so I might be finally breaking to buy the soundtrack, which I usually never do.\n\nI liked the game. I have friends that LOVED the game. I don't think I was one of those people, but I DO suggest giving it a try. If nothing else, it's a game about learning that everything gets better with supportive friends. And that stealing is cool.

It's an experience that I haven't seen been done as well as it has here in the format of a video game.*)\n\nThis game has changed my life and is such a big part of me. I originally played NITW back in 2017 when it was released. I had been mourning the loss of a loved one who was my caregiver for most of my childhood which was very difficult for me. My family isn't so mindful of mental health so I was left alone to find ways to cope. I found this game on YouTube and played it myself, which soon after in one of my lowest moments, helped me. Made me laugh, cry and realize things that helped me move on from this low point. \n\nIts colorful and cozy atmosphere in a small quiet town littered with the orange leaves from the passing of fall was so pretty and the small moving community is so endearing. But the thing that resigned me the most would be the characters and the themes that this game has to offer. While this game looks cheerful and whimsical, which it is for the most part, it's still very down to earth. Characters have their day-to-day problems as well as their own baggage from past troubles that are very real, and they show it at times with moments of self-doubt, anxiety, anger, and just sadness of all forms. When I first played this game back then, characters such as Bea and Angus stood out to me for their views on life and the meaning of the universe, and their place in it, which I still believe in and follow today. A quote that I found to be very comforting in my time of grieving: [spoiler]\"When my friends leave, when I have to let go, when this entire town is wiped off the map, I want it to hurt. Bad. I want to lose. I want to get beaten up. I want to hold on until I'm thrown off and everything ends.\"[/spoiler]\n\nAs of this writing, I am 19, turning 20 in July. A Lot has happened since the first time that I played this game. Now I'm transitioning into adulthood and done with school. I recently bought and played this game again on steam and like Mae coming back to her hometown I felt the same sense of nostalgia for this game. And even if it's been almost 6 years since I first experienced the story, I picked up on things that I now understand and find more relatable. Being considered an adult by the people around you but still feeling no different than you were not too long ago is the biggest one as well as the dread of working a 9 to 5, worrying about money, letting go of friends, and moving out into the world. \n\nThis game reminds me that feeling scared about becoming an adult is okay. It's a big change for any person, but it's going to be alright in the end, which I needed to hear when I replayed this. I've taken almost everything this game has to offer to heart and have been living by it since my first time. From the shoe-gaze/dream pop band and indie coming-to-age aesthetic the game has to quite literally model myself as Angus. I have to thank NITW for changing my life, I've met many cool people because of it which include my best friends (love you guys). I still don't know exactly what I want to do with my life, but I'm alright with it. Because as long as I don't lose myself and keep what I find important close, I'll be alright.\n\nSo, to sum it up. Buy and play this game, it's worth it. The story is amazing, the characters/dialogue are funny, the gameplay is fun, and touches on dark/difficult subject matters. Who knows. Might be just what you need to have in your life just like how I needed it.

I especially hold this game close to my heart for the way it approaches Mae's depression and disassociation. I myself struggle with depersonalization and depression, along with a multitude of other issues, so to see depersonalization, something I haven't seen portrayed since I began struggling with it, described and shown in such a visually stunning way while still being aware and sensitive...it reached deep into my soul and touched me in a way not much else has. I am getting a Night in the Woods tattoo soon to immortalize how immensely important this game is to me, and I couldn't be happier. Seriously, you will not regret buying this game. Sure, it's a very story-heavy game with not as much gameplay mechanics that you would get in other games, but that just adds to the charm of it. I love this game more than I have loved any other game; I would not recommend any game above this.", "timestamp_created": 1673935653, "timestamp_updated": 1673935653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32,

This game has the best writing of any game I've ever played and I've played a lot. It has some of the best characters with Mae being my favourite protagonist of any game ever and Gregg and Mae both currently joint top spot for favourite characters in fiction all together. The story is great too. Everything is superb. For a game with a gorgeous stylised storybook aesthetic with anthropomorphised (let's hope i spelt that right) animals it is the most gut wrenchingly real game I've ever encountered. The dialogue. The friendships. The setting. Just one note for if you do get the game (which i could not recommend enough). You get what you put in. If you go around town talking to everyone you can each day; are willing to play through a couple times and are willing to let yourself get invested in these phenomenal characters. Then you will have possibly the best experience you can have with a game. Without putting that time in while the game would still be great you are missing out on my current favourite gaming experience of all time. If you can play it i would 100% recommend you do.

You are Mae the 20 year old anthropomorphised cat who dropped out of college for... reasons, and moved back home to her dying Rust Belt town to hang with her old friends, who have moved on with their lives while she's been away.\n\nThe game does a great job on characterisation: not just Mae, her parents and her friends, but even the NPCs and the town itself.  The closure of the mines and the factories has brought it to its knees, and every adult has seen their living standards decline, and their children have no hope.\n\nThe game's also not afraid to make you live through Mae being an insensitive and selfish idiot, hurting the people around her. She has a lot of growing up to do.\n\nThe game carefully segues between whimsical exploration and heavy emotional hits. This is also when you notice how well the music has been setting your mood, and you notice when it goes quiet and leaves you with nature sounds.\n\nThe main criticism I'd have is that the game spends so much time being a young-adult simulator, it forgets it has a plot, and it rushes it through in the second half of the game, which makes it feel more forced than it  actually is. There are a lot of lead-ins to the main plot scattered throughout the game, but you can miss them if you rush. And even then - gang of young adults solving mysteries?

I mean the sheer depth of the characters alone is astounding, much less the complexity they meet the world with. I\u2019m still thinking about some of the poetry they wrote, Selmers especially. It\u2019s so rare to see an honest interpretation of the world, and this game is only honest. Even its lies are telling, not an obfuscation so much as a familiarly unavoidable reduction. The author has things to say; they cannot wait for perfection. My playthrough reflects this: I missed things, countless endearing and funny moments. Perhaps I was distracted by my phone and missed a pun, maybe I just zoned out at the wrong time. I mean, the path you choose on a given day decides who you\u2019ll interact with and what you\u2019ll learn about Possum Springs (more like AWESO-). Not coincidentally, this means that there are threads loose. I didn\u2019t feed the rats enough, didn\u2019t learn about Mae\u2019s grandfather enough, didn\u2019t go to the Falls with Angus (enough, I guess? The literary device got away from me). Somehow, despite being a lifelong anxious completionist and avid critic of \u201c\u201dambiguous endings\u201d\u201d, the indistinction feels right to me this time. The themes, carpe diem and excelsior and whatnot, create an ideal space to walk away with melancholic satisfaction. I have always loved autumn, especially that it dies.

Generally its nice exploring through the town and doing little events, it's also nice spending time with your old buddies but then you may realize that you character is a loser about a quarter or halfway through the game. Your character literally drops college because \"it wasnt for them\" even after their \"neglectful\" parents put a lot of time and effort into getting your character to be successful and be at college. Spoiler warning, the game ends with you and your buddies finding a cult and then trapping them underground to then have a talk where the last sentence spoke by your character is \"wait what were we talking about?\" like wtf is the moral of this story? you're a loser that decides to f around, mooch of your parents and then turns into a stupid detective story of finding a cult like the story started off to give the impression that this is an artistic approach on life but then turns into a really stupid, generic story like damn they really real you in for more than 2 hours and then make the game shit so you can't get a refund.

The visuals are gorgeous too, and really tie everything together with a simplistic yet beautiful art style.\n\nMUSIC\n---------------\nHoo boy, the music in this game is something else.\nAlec Holowka did an amazing job with it, and every single track captures the theme perfectly.\nThe music is so good in fact, that I usually have it playing in the background while I play other games.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n-----------------\nThe basic gameplay loop consists of you exploring the town of Possum Springs, and hanging out with your old friends.\nThe town itself is rather small, but every day there are new things to see, so it rarely gets old.\nThere are also some slight platforming elements, and all sorts of simple-yet-fun minigames.\n\nCHARACTERS\n------------------\nOne of this game's biggest strongsuits are it's characters.\nEach and every character is filled with so much personality that they practically feel like real people.\nThe  dialogue is also hilarious and I got so, so many good laughs out of it.\n\nP.S: Gregg and Angus are precious and I would give the world for them. \n\nWORLD\n-------------------\nDespite having a (relatively) small map, the game world is shockingly lush and vibrant, with lots of things to explore and discover. Each day brings something new to the table and exploring the town is never a tedious task because of this, with the astounding atmosphere and music being a huge bonus.\n\n\n\nRECCOMEND?\n-------------------\nHell yes. This game is amazing and I would absolutely reccomend it.\nI am proud to call Night in the Woods my favorite game of all time, and it's one of the few that I wish i could forget everything about just so that I could play through it again blind.\n\n\nAlec Holowka\n----------------------------\nThe review might be over, but im not done talking yet.\n\nIf you are unaware, Alec Holowka (Creator and composer of every soundtrack in this game) committed suicide a few years ago, following certain allegations from a known liar. He had everything taken away from him in an instant, all for a bit of online drama. (fuck you, Zoey Quinn)\n\nIts not a fun thought by any means, but don't let it deter you from buying this masterpiece of his creation. Its an astounding game that will stick with me for the rest of my life.\n\nRest in peace, Alec, and thank you for creating this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1670628822, "timestamp_updated": 1670628822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.719670414924621582", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128252131": {"recommendationid": "128252131", "author": {"steamid": "76561199405418547", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1176, "last_played": 1671321406}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my all time favorite story driven games.

The game was on my radar for a while, so I bought it when it was on sale. However, the first few hours have been extremely unenjoyable. The game seems to just drag on during dream sequences. The waking sequences are not much better: character movement feels less sluggish, sure, but the player is forced to traverse the same landscapes every day to get to the edge of town. The character interactions, or at least those that I had with Bea, felt too insubstantial to compensate for that, when I really thought about it.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with characters being unlikable per se, but Mae felt frustrating to play as a player. I understand that she is dealing with some serious mental health issues. (I am guessing that there is more revelation of that later in the game, from what I've heard, but it is already apparent from her departure from college, her daily routine, and the allusion to an incident in middle school.) But it is one thing to have to contend with that, and another to be roped into making incredibly terrible choices: tampering with evidence at a crime scene, shoplifting, being cruel and unempathetic to Bea. There are certainly ways to have characters act contrary to the wishes of the player, but this feels different.\n\nI understand why people love Night in the Woods.

The game throws you into Mae's life and you aren't really given much background on....well anything until the end. I guess it's supposed to give you a reason to keep playing but a lot of the time i felt the plot had no direction because of just HOW streched out it was. I didn't really understand what was happening a lot of time and only near the end did i catch onto the themes the game was presenting. I think it would have been easier for me if the game had visual objectives. For example, Mae's notebook could of had a \"things to do\" list suggesting things that you could do because i was unaware of what i was supposed to be doing and missed out on loaaads of character building as i didn't realise i could do certain things and ended up skipping days and also made like NO connection with Bea becuase i was unaware you could hang out with her. Overall it had a beautiful art style with some touching themes about coming of age and letting things go but i wish the game had a stronger direction and was spread out more evenly rather than the slow paced normal days that quickly ramped up into madness. I was hoping to enjoy this game more, i think i might with a second replay where i can dig a bit more and spend more time with the characters but yeah i found all the reveals like what Mae did at the football game and the cult underwhelming.

This was one of the few games I actually went through and did everything in though, so that's neat. Getting 100% in this game basically just requires that you play through it multiple times and make different story choices, a lot of the story elements are the same but I was genuinely surprised at how many different dialogue variations there were based on things you said or stuff you decided to do or not do.

"review": "Night in the Woods o NITW es un juego con un estilo muy particular el cual siempre habia estado cierta manera presente o almenos lo tuve en la vista de la orilla de mi ojo desde 2017 cuando fue lanzado mas sin embargo verdaderamente nunca lo considere, principalmente por su estilo visual y un poco debido a los aires pretenciosos que sentia alrededor de esta obra y aquellos los cuales lo habian jugado ya que varios aseguraban que era una obra maestra oculta que los habia hecho sentir algo especial, cosa que verdaderamente se puede deber a muchos factores y variables en las vidas de quien lo ha jugado, algunas personas dicen que algunos personajes tenian personalidades tan parecidas a conocidos que era imposible no relacionarlos con su propia vida... y hasta cierto punto puedo entenderlo yo mismo he podido relacionar varias cosas de este juego con mi propia vida desde la relacion la protagonista con su madre hasta las mismas dudas que la protagonista pasa durante el juego mas sin embargo, es en esta ultima en la que muchos pueden relacionarse de una manera general, yo incluido.\n\nMuchos jovenes hemos pasado por todas estas dudas la cuales no podemos contestarnos por nuestra experiencia y esto hace que nos confundamos y deambulemos no solo por nuestra mente sino nuestra vida, pero ya me estoy saliendo de el tema (una disculpa, pero cuando un juego me interesa bastante me gusta expandir un poco mi punto de vista, una disculpa si la redaccion talbes no es la mejor pero muchas gracias darle una oportunidad a mi rese\u00f1a)\n\nEl juego toca temas bastante comunes para jovenes los cuales aun no hemos siquiera terminado de analizar completamente nuestro entorno pues se siente como si uno hubiera crecido en tan solo unas semanas una vez se es adulto o bueno almenos asi veo que es como se intenta representar al inicio (ojo que luego mencionare todo lo que se revela en el ultimo cuarto de la historia), la historia llega a presentarnos a pu\u00f1ado de personajes (\"principales\" por decirlo de alguna manera) a los cuales nos van mostrando cada vez mas su personalidad, actitudes, inquietudes y su relacion la protagonista, estas ultimas 2 en especial son las que se van tocando cada vez mas poco interactuemos con los personajes sin embargo, hay un gran problema con este ultimo y no es precisamente por el como se tocan los temas e inquietudes de estos, sino que verdaderamente jamas se termina de resolver alguna o no almenos no sin marginar algun personaje durante la historia lo cual simplemente termina dejandolo como si te dijeran \"o mira pobre personaje a sufrido bastante es imposible que no te agrade\" cosa que no era para nada necesaria, los personajes de por si podrian tener una historia no tan cruel y agradar de cualquier manera; (esperen un momento aqui las cosas que estoy diciendo se pueden malentender) pero esto es un problema que no causa verdaderamente ni las historias de los personajes, ni el guion, no... para nada, lo que verdaderamente causa para mi este problema es...\n\n****Spoiler****\n\nLa corta duracion de la historia y su ultimo cuarto:\nEnserio esto me dejo mucho que desear, en la ultima parte aceleran de la nada la trama vista en el final del 2do capitulo el cual estaba teniendo una buena progresion durante una buena parte del 3er capitulo mas sin embargo se empieza a notar que comienza a opacar la trama principalmente, hasta se sintiera que el juego cambia de genero a horror psicologico por algunas partes, cosa que no me termino de dejar un buen sabor de boca, estaba bastante interesado por como continuaba la historia del fantasma pero lo aceleran demasiado y toda la parte del culto siento que viniera de la nada lo cual me dejo pensando un momento, Que esta pasando?. otra cosa que viene algo de la nada tambien es el como la protagonista viene a contar algo de la nada este trauma que tuvo y que le hizo reaccionar de esa manera durante un partido de beibol, y todavia en cierta manera intentan relacionarlo con todo esto del culto espiritista ario que sale de la nada en el ultimo acto... todo muy extra\u00f1o ciertamente.\n\n***Fin de Spoiler***\n\nYa me he dejado llevar bastante y sinceramente quisiera contar mas pero creo que he dicho lo suficiente, incluso aunque casi todo lo que he hecho es criticar al juego yo digo que el criticismo es mas que necesario para cualquier cosa y a veces ver las cosas de manera objetiva es necesario para poder apreciar lo que verdaderamente un producto puede ofrecernos.\n\nPero sin embargo aun asi, Recomiendo este juego porque aunque tenga sus propios problemas aprecio mucho lo que cuenta o almenos intenta contar, una simple historia de unos amigos que se tienen unos a los otros en un mundo tan cruel y solitario el cual no importa cuantas veces te hiera, siempre habra aquellos los cuales estaran contigo no importa si estas bajo la lluvia o teniendo el peor momento de tu vida. \n\nPD: El soundtrack es 10/10 \nPD2: si verdaderamente leiste esto hasta el final en verdad muchas gracias de corazon, los comentarios estan abiertos para cualquier cosa que se me haya pasado o

There's also a lot of metaphors and themes that correlate to our real world around us which really make the gameplay close to home, quite literally.\n\nYou play as Mae, the main character who abruptly now has no future as a college dropout and returns to her hometown of Possum Springs, coming to find that even the past has oddly changed as well. Her home resembles that of a typical Rust Belt small town\u2014economically-stagnating, people scraping by for any kind of work to make a living, a lot of reliable, good paying jobs from long before having left, and many shops and places of gathering having closed particularly when Mae was gone attending college. The setting captures a town \u2018lost in time\u2019 during autumn, forgotten for what glory it once had, and really induces a sort of nostalgic and contemplative mindset onto the player, which I find is best played when alone.\n\nProgressively through the game you\u2019ll discover that the story becomes more revealing and complex, slowly finding out the grim reasons behind why Mae left college along with learning more about her friends and family who were really well-written and have unique, memorable personalities. Depending on your choices, you can come to spend time with some more than others and see how their fates are much like Mae\u2019s: uncertain, lost, not guaranteed, and their own pasts being dragged behind them in their own unique ways. There\u2019s a great degree of emotional and conversational range with these characters when these existential, everyday subjects are brought up or encountered, which I really loved for feeling quite real. Regarding these things, the game does bring forth the challenges and importance of mental health and reaches into the player in a pretty powerful way: causing them to sympathetically reflect upon the conditions of the characters\u2019 lives while also allowing the player to reflect thoughtfully of their own. Other challenges include financial problems, stress, arguing, relationship problems, crime, drinking, fanaticism, and the consequences of risk-taking, which again capture the real world setting with situations you\u2019d find with actual people.\n\nI also commend the soundtrack for being incredibly well-made and enjoyable for an indie game which was crowdfunded and laboriously crafted. \n\nIf you like a nice slice of life story that can be both cozy and intense, then please give this game a try. You\u2019ll really like it and appreciate the ambiance, music, diverse characters, and authentic plot.", "timestamp_created": 1669176555, "timestamp_updated": 1669268142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691510498523712158", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126133693": {"recommendationid": "126133693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198876411540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2400, "last_played": 1697684143}, "language": "english", "review": "epic", "timestamp_created": 1669167169, "timestamp_updated": 1669167169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126082072": {"recommendationid": "126082072", "author": {"steamid": "76561199212316691", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1675967918}, "language": "english", "review": "2022 and this game is still a favorite of mine alongside \"Stray\".

LOVE. THIS. GAME.\nNight in the Woods (NITW) is absolutely perfect in every way. I never expected to be brought on such an emotional journey when I first picked it up. This game has affected me emotionally in such a way that I can't adequately describe it & do it justice, but I shall try. NITW has some great humour & an extremely lovable cast of characters (Bea is the best character by the way, I shall die on that hill), with a gorgeous artstyle & a bloody fantastic soundtrack to boot. This game throws you straight into the deep end of emotion & mental issues, with every character having issues that many can relate to & sympathise with. From Mae's psychotic episodes & paranoia to Gregg's ADHD, Bea's depression & Angus' childhood abandonment issues, every one of the main cast has suffered through something horrendous. While trying to pick up the peaces of Mae's crumbling life, you discover even more horrors awaiting, which is when the game goes from old friends trying to rekindle past bonds straight into existential dread of a cosmic horror, occultism & murder in a small town. I've played Bea's storyline many times now, and I just love it to death. You discover much about her life & while she seems extremely standoffish at first, you quickly begin to see that she has to deal with a lot more than she lets on (the same can be said about Gregg, Angus & Mae as well). Where this game broke me was actually in a side story, wherein a saddened, scared & anxious Mae falls asleep on a couch after following a trail of metaphorical breadcrumbs about her dead Grandfather. While she sleeps there, his ghost appears & starts to gently stroke her hair, as if comforting her, all the while a gorgeous soft song plays in the background. Having lost my Grandpa when I was 7, I felt all that emotion I felt then once more, and I bawled my eyes out for a long time. This game is beautiful & will stay with me forever, this I can say with complete honesty. Do yourself a favour & play this game, it's one of the few games I've played in my 20 years of life I can genuinely call a masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1666410989, "timestamp_updated": 1666410989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124161344": {"recommendationid": "124161344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349554533", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2926, "last_played": 1666358629}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best written stories i've ever played through, including probably the best character dynamics i've seen in a game and a banger ass soundtrack, 10/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1666362119, "timestamp_updated": 1666362119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124139635": {"recommendationid": "124139635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265318916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1672353285}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fdjhsakghfdkajnglkad.

Thank you for being a part of this amazing experience.\n\nThe first time I played Night in the Woods was autumn of 2019. I was in a very similar situation as the protagonist Mae: I have just returned to my hometown and my parents' house after living abroad for half a year while getting through really difficult times. This made me instantly relate to Mae.\n\nMae was actually my biggest inspiration for picking up the bass. I have always wanted to play it but seeing a character that was so like me (her existentialism, mostly) being bad at something but still doing it, not letting her mental issues stop her, was very inspirational to me.\n\nI replayed the game in autumn of 2022, because I had vaguely remembered the game as being autumn-themed and cozy, and I'm so glad that I did, because apparently I missed many things and misremembered others. NitW is definitely much more than what I initially remembered it as.\nGetting deep into the story again reminded me why I loved it so much the first time.\n\nNot only Mae but each character is great. They all have their own issues, hardships, things they won't talk about, things they struggle with, fears, and complex lives. Even the ones you only get to have a short conversation with. This made the world of NitW feel so real ([spoiler]I tried really hard not to break the illusion my own mind created of NitW's world, as Mae was talking about how her reality collapsed into shapes while playing a game[/spoiler]).\n\nI will also add that Mae explains REALLY well what existentialism is, in a way that I was never able to articulate to others without seeming crazy.\n\nI will always save a cozy spot in my heart for this game and its characters, and I might return to it in the future again as this is a comfort game for me.", "timestamp_created": 1665698605, "timestamp_updated": 1665698959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67230755090713501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123748839": {"recommendationid": "123748839", "author": {"steamid": "76561199236655385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1666487314}, "language": "english", "review": "it's super fun with a captivating story, I love all the characters.

Interesting story about reconnecting with her old friends. Change however is omnipresent and emerging and she has to tackle her insecurities and fears, while also trying to hold on her youthful, really fucked up and also criminal past. Main game 7.5 / 10.\n\nBesides that, there is a mini game called Demontower, which is short but pretty good 9/10. \nHowever as long as you do not play on a trackpad you should finishi it in about 3 hours. It is rather easy especially the second to last forest ring-ghost boss, which you should be able to first try. (Imagine taking 500 hours just to beat this boss. LOL)\n\nAlso the game is really easy for achievement hunting, as long as you watch through the credits and get the last Bea entry and don't skip because you had to much coffee and not enough sleep. Imagine missing that and delaying your last achievement for 4 days or so and loosing a bet, even though you played the game 480h before the other one even started.\n\nJokes and Memes aside, i played this game with someone, who had a really rough couple of weeks lately. The game is typically not my genre,  but it was really fun trying it out and maybe I will come back to this types of games. I hope we could relieve at least some stress and maybe just maybe forget about the world for a little bit to get some rest. The game was really good and I want to thank the one who suggested it.\n\nTo sum up: I got to stab my best friend in the game -> 7.5/10\n\nPS.

I know it's a popular game, but never have I really played a 2D side scrolling, story driven game. I played a lot of story games where actions/dialogues have concequences, but nothing like this. Nothing that just has text and without actual voice actors, etc. \nI expected to play it for about 25 minutes and be done with it.....\n\nI was very, very wrong. Good god...What a journey this was.\n\nI know you shouldn't judge anything before playing, but I just thought this wouldn't be something for me. But man...I fell in love with the characters so much. Even if it's all looking rather simplistic 2D, there's so much depth to everything... the choices you make, the things you do. The people you speak to. And everytime you wonder like \"Where does this lead up to?\" You keep on playing to find out the answers that haunt you. And everytime you think you've seen it all, you keep finding new pieces to the puzzle or...finding out stuff you hadn't done before. And the music...dude, the music is so good too. It really does justice to the atmospheres and situations.\n\nAnd don't be fooled by the simplistic, whimiscal 'childish' aspect at first glance....It's all a facade. There are deeper, darker meanings behind all of it. I got very emotional at times, stuff hits like a truck. Or sat on the edge of my seat because it was so scary/exciting... but also laughed my ass off at some of the hilarious dialogue. It's sort of slice of life....but with a big mystery to it. Even if you think you understand everything, you'll still fall short of answers. There's always this cryptic emptiness, and I guess I'll really understand it all if I keep replaying. It's really worth it to play it over, try other dialogues, approach things differently and hang out with different friends. You really aren't done with one playthrough...\n\nAll n' all, I'm so happy I finally gave this game a chance. 25 minutes turned out to be playing this game every evening after work, to relax and escape into this world. Somehow an all too familiar world, but I enjoyed every bit about it.", "timestamp_created": 1662587459, "timestamp_updated": 1662587710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

One that you can bike across in 30 minutes flat. There's not a lot to do here, and everybody seems to be aiming to leave this place. I'm not yet out of high-school, but I am on the cusp of my Senior year. After it's done and gone, I'll be going off to college, presuming that I graduate on time. It feels like I'm standing on the edge of something big and great, yet uncertainty grips me. I'm unsure, I suppose.\n\nI relate to Mae a lot in that regard. Mental health is a big factor for me, and I'm afraid I won't manage to make it through college without homesickness gripping me in the coming years. There will always be someone waiting for me at home, but everyone I'll have known from now and the past few years here will be gone. People from my childhood will move on with their lives. People already are. \n\nAnd I guess that's apart of it, isn't it? Life moves on, time waits for no-one. People who we think have it all together are one disaster away from splitting themselves apart, and we're all just trying to figure out what to do with ourselves. I haven't figured out what to do with myself yet, but... Strangely, I think that's alright.\n\nThis game makes me nostalgic. From it's music, to the small town gossip, and the way I can relate to it all. Mae doesn't know what to do, at 20 years of age, and neither do I, at newly 17. It's dialogue feels real, especially since I too would go and do stupid things with my friends after school, given that we had nothing better to do. We'd do things that were technically illegal and loiter and mess around. The music creates an atmosphere I can't explain, but it's a good one. \n\nAll in all, this game has given me bigger perspective into things than I previously had. And it's brought me a lot of joy in replaying it, over and over again. It's nostalgic, and it's more important to me than I think I could explain.

Rarely the game offers even 2 choices in a dialog, but when it does the difference is miniscule.\nDialogs are set in short chunks. Click again and again to get the next bit of pointless information push.\nAlong with static postures and non-diverse visuals of the npcs this creates a feeling that I'm pushing a button on a plushie toy with 2 or 3 cycling phrases.\nThere is no gameplay per se, NitW is about running around and searching for that npc whos dialog would move the game forward. It offers exploration options and \"hidden\" places that reward you with nothing but same empty comments of the protagonist about places or characters that you don't care about.

It's unique art style is charming and colourful, although the animation is incredibly basic the small world generally feels like a nice place to be. \n\nGameplay & Controls\nThere is a platforming element to the game but its very simplistic and there's nothing particularly challenging about moving around. The three jumps in a row thing which makes your last jump a big one was largely superseded by the run and running big jump decades ago, so it's kinda strange to see that make a return.\n\nThe controls are fine but really odd. They use 'C' as the action button instead of the industry standard 'e' for absolutely no obvious reason and the game does not use the mouse at all. The last time I came across this type of control setup I was using a Commodore 64..\n\nThe controls and core mechanics are incredibly basic, with the sole focus on the story. The story is essentially an animated text adventure, where you walk to people and work your way through the speech bubble dialogues \n\nStory\nThis is pretty much the whole game here. You play an entitled 20 year old 'child' who has never had to work for anything in their life. The child in question is one of those kids who has always had everything they need but steals for fun anyway, and spends their spare time doing petty crimes. 'Crimes'. Yeh.. Shut up you little should really focus on the review. The game shows you this pretty early on and honestly, it made the main character incredibly un-likeable for me. \n\nPlaying through the story you're aware that something bad happened and the main character basically left college for some reason, the story is incredibly slow to extract the reasoning behind this and doesn't ever really fully explain the back story to it. There are hints of possible mental illness in there but in all honesty it just comes across as a spoilt rich kid desperately unprepared for life who resorted to violence as their spoilt entitled life started to fall in on them. Yeah i get that there were some issues there but it all seemed like it was most likely due to a total lack of any real parenting than anything else.\n\nAnyway **Spoiler alert**\n\nThe game then goes off on this wierd death cult tangent which is absolutely riddled with plot holes and is never fully explained. 39 missing people in a small town and only the local bobby is working on it? It just makes no sense, there is just no way they would have every got away with that. It would have made more sense if they'd just started it and only killed a couple of people. \n\nI really wanted there to be a really clever plot twist where the game concludes that the whole thing was an expression of MAE's insanity, and replaying it you actually see that it's all in Mae's head, but nope, deathcult.\n\nThe only way it would have made sense would have been if the whole plot, characters and world only existed in Mae's head.\n\nI did enjoy it, but it felt fairly lazily written and I thought it could have been a lot better.", "timestamp_created": 1661076446, "timestamp_updated": 1661076446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504716992378234863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120982603": {"recommendationid": "120982603", "author": {"steamid": "76561199344524364", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1656355485}, "language": "english", "review": "We won\u2018t forget.", "timestamp_created": 1661067435, "timestamp_updated": 1661067435, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482725709676742554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120981653": {"recommendationid": "120981653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989037943", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1661065567}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING!!!! didnt expect any of that.", "timestamp_created": 1661065616, "timestamp_updated": 1661065616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120950711": {"recommendationid": "120950711", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001759838", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1301, "last_played": 1661304893}, "language": "english", "review": "Has multiple paths so the game can be played through multiple times, and the story and characters are really good.", "timestamp_created": 1661016273, "timestamp_updated": 1661016273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120923110": {"recommendationid": "120923110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981120253", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1662356639}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not joking this time.

just WOW, the character felt so realistic, and interesting (more on that later)\n\nThe OST was really catchy, mostly relaxing, which is fitting, this game is kinda of a slow burner, so its ideal for those wanting a game you can play at your own pace.\n\nThe artstyle is beautiful, almost like something you would see in a children's picture book, its colorful, lively and also well animated. \n\nLike i mentioned earlier, this is a slow burner, most of the time you basically expend the game hanging around with other characters, speaking of, the game allows you to take choices at several points, mainly what to say, which can affect how the conversation will go, but theres also on which character you decide to hang around with, those being Bea (A gloomy and cold crocodile) and Greeg (An hyperactive delinquent fox) , allowing you to learn their story and relationship with the protagonist Mea (A dropout from collage, a cat), its possible to hang around other characters as well, but those are optional.\n\nSo now talking about the themes and characters, the game explores several psychological themes such has depression, wanting to fit in, wondering about your future, social anxiety, among others, and it does it SO WELL, this is what really sold me on this game, alongside its characters which explore these themes.\n\nMea the protagonist, is quite an interesting one, at first you might... not like her, but the game over time explores her relationship with others, as well as to who she is and what she has/had to go trough in her life, she is a deeply flawed character, and one i could really relate to, i cant say much more since that would get into spoiler territory, but she will grown on you. \n\nThe game does have a couple of Minigames spread out, mainly two in particular, one being the \"Music Practice\" which plays kinda like Guitar Hero, where you gotta click on the notes on the correct timing, dont worry, this is mostly just messing around and you dont need to be good at it, mind you, the character will comment on your performance :P\n\nThe other being \"Demontower\", which is optional, this one plays like your usual dungeon crawler, but it can be quite hard.\n\nThe game does offer a quite a bit of replayability, like mentioned earlier, you take decisions at several points in the game, which affect how the story plays out, so you can do multiple runs to learn all the choices and learn about all the characters. \n\n\nAnyway, Night in the Woods is special, is one of those games that really gets you thinking and one everyone should give a try, specially those interested in psychology, who knows, it might even change your life. \n\n10/10. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1660753124, "timestamp_updated": 1675316324, "voted_up": true,
