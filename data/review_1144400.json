to root for, you don't feel their character growth isn't a given like a Mary-sue or atypical Shounen (for more relevant context), and they aren't magically close and in a Harem with the MC.

am no stranger to the name [i]Yuzusoft[/i], and certainly, this is not my first review of a game by said company either. However, among all the titles I have previously played, Senren\uff0aBanka is the only romance visual novel that manages to catch the attention of the mainstream.\n\nQuestion: What makes this game the gateway for many foreign fans to the [i]Yuzusoft[/i] brand? This is a question I aim to answer in this review.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]Info[/h2]\nSenren\uff0aBanka is the 9th title developed by [i]Yuzusoft[/i] in 2016 and was later brought to Steam by [i]NekoNyan[/i] and [i]HIKARI FIELD[/i] in 2020. \n\n[table][tr][th]Category[/th][th]Description[/th][/tr][tr][td]Language[/td][td]English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese[/td][/tr][tr][td]R18 content[/td][td]None, R18 patch is required for access[/td][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[h2]Production Value[/h2]\n[i]Yuzusoft[/i] never disappoints when it comes to presentation. This is especially the case for Senren\uff0aBanka, thanks to its Japanese mythology roots. Hoori is a fictional town that is brimming with cultural integrities. \"Historical\" is the norm: from old architecture to the traditional garments, shamisen strumming in the background. It has a clear distinct identity that stands out from the rest.\n\nOh my, to my surprise, the music takes a step even further in nailing the theme of the game close to perfection. Words alone simply cannot describe the beauty of Hoori without mentioning the soundtrack. To further illustrate, it is a modern take on traditional Japanese music, and I highly recommend listening to it in lossless format. Of course, voice acting is superb too (if you are wondering).\n\n[table][tr][th]Category[/th][th]Result[/th][th]Verdict[/th][/tr][tr][td]Resolution[/td][td]1080p[/td][td]\ud83d\udfe9[/td][/tr][tr][td]Refresh Rate[/td][td]Native[/td][td]\ud83d\udfe9[/td][/tr][tr][td]Framerate[/td][td]Unlocked[/td][td]\ud83d\udfe9[/td][/tr][tr][td]Bugs / Issues[/td][td]None[/td][td]\ud83d\udfe9[/td][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\nTwo words: poor pacing. Senren\uff0aBanka is a game that is slow to pick up its momentum whenever necessary, fast to end its highlights for no good reason. More often than not, it severely breaks the flow of the storytelling.\n\nFor a game about Japanese folklore, the contents on display are often stretched thin to make room for more slice-of-life and comedy elements, resulting in the story lacking any conciseness in its narrative. To be clear, I do not dislike such elements being included in a visual novel (in fact, I am a big fan of it), as it helps to establish the characters, giving readers a reason to care for them. However, there exists a delicate balance in deciding when and how to incorporate these elements into the narrative. Unfortunately, Senren\uff0aBanka struggles to find that middle ground.\n\nOn the flip side, you do get a cast of likeable characters that are, of course, carefully written to represent a certain archetype to distinguish themselves. Comedy, for the most part, is entertaining (albeit clich\u00e9) and the heroines are even more so lovable. At the very least, it hits all the right checkmarks (as a romance visual novel) with their target audience.\n\nTo summarise, if story is the least of your concerns, by all means, just go for it. Otherwise, the issues I mentioned above are carried over to the heroine routes as well. It can, at times, feel like fillers after fillers, with the story moving at a snail's pace.\n\n\n[u][b]Yoshino:[/b][/u]\nI don\u2019t hate it, but I expected more. Especially, after revolving the entire plot around her in the Common route. It is a bit unfortunate that the route ultimately did not provide much closure to the main story itself.\n\nPrecisely because the Common route had already reached its conclusion, there isn't much left on the table for content. Still, I would not consider this as a bad route. Underwhelming? Maybe, but not bad. For the most part, the theme of personal growth is the centrepiece of the storytelling. It demands Yoshino to come out of her shell and face her own set of obstacles along the way.\n\nRomance is great. I do enjoy the chemistry between Yoshino and Masaomi. It can be silly at times, due to how socially awkward Yoshino is in expressing herself. It helps to establish that romantic relationship between the two.\n\nOf course, you do get a series of climaxes near the end, in which (finally) the main storyline has once again shown its relevance, tying in with the theme of the route.\n\n\n[u][b]Murasame:[/b][/u]\nOne of the things I liked about this route was its heavy involvement with the other cast members. It recaptures the essence of the Common route, as an extension to the main story itself. Displaying the aftermath of the Common route in full.\n\nSimultaneously, it also taps into Murasame's own mental fortitude as the only non-human heroine. A being who has outlived others for many generations is bound to have a backstory to tell and a fair amount of regrets to share.\n\nIf I haven't made my point clear by now, protect that smile at all cost! Especially the ending, making it all the more worthwhile. Also yes, Murasame is the best girl.\n\n\n[u][b]Mako:[/b][/u]\nI will say this upfront, it is a mess. Honestly, I lost count of the amount of times I wanted to give up on reading this. \"Why\" you may ask. Same deal as the criticism I mentioned before, but amplified.\n\nMako's route suffers the most (when compared) in terms of its pacing. Everything just feels unbearably slow, with seemingly nothing in between. Plotwise, it is also barebones at best, with zero urgency throughout.\n\nThere were some funny and heartwarming moments, but \"is it justified enough to bear with the cons\" is a question I am constantly asking myself. Just to be clear, Mako is not a bad heroine. But, the way how the game handles her character arc is just outright insulting.\n\n\n[u][b]Lena:[/b][/u]\nFirst and foremost, the game falls short in introducing Lena to the readers during the Common route. She is consistently neglected as a heroine, maintaining very little presence throughout.\n\nPredictably, based on Steam achievements, not many have cleared her route. I wasn\u2019t even sure what to expect either. However, as I delved deeper, it became evident that this was the spark the story desperately needed.\n\nIt offers a whole new dimension of questions to the main plot itself. Creating fresh and new story content that was not possible before. Dare I say, the final missing chapter to conclude the story. Super underrated, in my opinion. Not to mention, it also avoids over-centralising the focus to only Lena, giving others the opportunity to shine as well.\n\nRomance, on the other hand... Masaomi, what happened to you? No matter how assertive Lena is with her approach, my guy is not able to read between the lines. For whatever reason, he became denser than a rock, and I blame the writers for that. It can, at times, feel irritating, to say the least.\n\n\n[u][b]Koharu & Roka:[/b][/u]\nAs a side route (dateable supporting characters), the story is self-contained without overstaying its welcome. A short and enjoyable experience. Featuring both Koharu and Roka as heroines also allows for twice the romantic interaction with our main protagonist, as a contest of love.\n\nAs expected, the route ends with a choice between the two. Maybe they could, you know, make a third alternate ending... [i]wink[/i]\n\n\n[h2]Verdict [u](7.5/10)[/u][/h2]\nThe reasons behind the numerous praises that Senren\uff0aBanka has garnered are evident, thanks to its distinctive setting and remarkably high production value. It is a well-made product that anyone can at least appreciate. Especially when you factor in its low price and frequent discounts. Without a doubt, an easy thumbs up for my recommendation.\n\n[code]Follow my Curator Page:\nstore.steampowered.com/curator/43765877\n[/code]", "timestamp_created": 1693245198, "timestamp_updated": 1693247956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702246665954589844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144967475": {"recommendationid": "144967475", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086004619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1868, "last_played": 1693845717}, "language": "english", "review": "please add a teacher route im begging you :3", "timestamp_created": 1692945184, "timestamp_updated": 1692945184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144456232": {"recommendationid": "144456232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985708013", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3353, "last_played": 1672363667}, "language": "english", "review": "fun fact: you can get the \"bros for life\" secret ending if you fail to end in a route", "timestamp_created": 1692325915, "timestamp_updated": 1692325915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558632612228393555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144025449": {"recommendationid": "144025449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382485371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 5134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5134, "last_played": 1687385084}, "language": "english", "review": "In attempting to beat all Overwhelmingly Positive games on steam I gave this:\n\nGame-play: \u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 (Minimal)\nAesthetics: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (Great)\nStory: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (Decent)\nDifficulty: \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 (None)\nLength: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (Long)\nOverall: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 (Neutral)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 Overview \u2605\u2605\u2605\nSenren Banka is an interactive visual novel set in the fictional town of Hoori, Japan. You play as Masaomi, a late teen boy who visits the town to help his grandfather run a busy inn, and ends up getting mixed up in a local folk legend involving a magical katana, cursed spirits, and the Yoshino family's legacy of attempting to dispel the grudge that has haunted the town for hundreds of years. Through the process of dealing with the legend, the main character ends up falling in love with one of 6 different girls. \n\nThe game is essentially broken up into two sections, the common route (chapters 1-3), and then the individual routes (chapters 4-8). The common route mostly deals with the cursed spirits harassing the town and resolving the curse. In each of the individual routes, the feel of the game changes quite a lot from an action-mystery setting, to more of a slice of life dating sim. \n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 Rating explanations and personal thoughts \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\u2605 Game-play: Being a visual novel there isn't really much to talk about game-play wise. Some decisions you make can affect the ending you receive, so there is at least some minor engagement, but there wasn't any particular time I felt like I recognized myself having fun. \n\u2605 Aesthetics: The aesthetics were quite good, the art was exceptional, the voice acting was anime quality, and the sound and ambiance were appropriate. There was even a few anime-quality cut-scenes that were fully animated. \n\u2605 Story: The story was pretty \"meh\" overall. Interesting during the common route, but each girls' individual routes were completely hit or miss. There was nothing revolutionary about the story, but it held my attention long enough to want to complete all possible routes. I hated Lena during the common route, but her individual route ended up being my favorite overall. I liked Mako and Murasame in the common route, and then disliked them more in their individual routes. It was somewhat jarring to have my opinion changed on basically every character throughout the full context of the story. \n\u2605 Difficulty: It's a visual novel, there is no difficulty.\n\u2605 Length: It took 10 hours to finish the common route, and 10 hours to finish my first ending (Mako), so 20 hours to get to the credits once, it took 70 hours total to finish all endings. \n\n\u2605 Overall: I think this is probably one of the better visual novels out there. It does everything well, but nothing in particular was mind blowing. Probably a must play for people who enjoy games like this in general, but not something I would just recommend to anyone. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691867455, "timestamp_updated": 1691867455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601131439208984375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143783606": {"recommendationid": "143783606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041597753", "num_games_owned": 492, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1971, "last_played": 1691086569}, "language": "english", "review": "Senren * Banka is an interesting case in the visual novel space for how to do things well, yet also how to do things badly. The experience within is well worth the price of admission if you're looking for a good storyline in an interesting setting accented by a beautiful aesthetic, but you're going to be sorely disappointed if you come for the characters or the romance.\n\nThe common route of this piece is a full arc in its own right. It follows Arichi Masaomi as he assists the shrine maiden of Hoori, Tomotake Yoshino, and her ninja companion, Hitachi Mako, in solving the mystery of the curse casted upon Hoori and attempting to resolve it. It's a neat storyline that progresses at a good pace, then ends in a good spot before branching off into the various character routes. This part of the story is, for the most part, well done. The setting and the conflict fit together well and it's entirely believable that the solution that is used to resolve it isn't discovered before the time of the main story.\n\nThe strength of the story carries on through to the routes. Discounting the sub-routes of Roka and Koharu, the other four routes each carry a significant piece of the puzzle regarding how the curse came about and its full nature. I'm a big fan of this type of storytelling in Visual Novels since it grounds the entire story together to be a compelling whole rather than a jumbled set of individual arcs. My one complaint, which is generally a consistent one across this style, is that there is a near required order to the routes that will lessen the impact of the individual routes if you do not follow it. The generally accepted route order that I usually see is Yoshino -> Mako -> Murasame -> Lena, but I strongly believe that doing Murasame's route last is much better for the overall arc of the story, even if it doesn't have the best climax at the end. It's ultimately whichever you prefer for whichever route order you would enjoy more.\n\nThe art and music are definitely above average. The characters and set pieces are vibrant and do a great job of setting the right atmosphere for the entirety of the piece. Murasame in particular has a design that directly shows how much effort went into setting the right atmosphere for the story. The voice acting is consistently high quality as well, even among the side characters. Lena and Genjuurou are the two performances that I was particularly impressed by, since their characters felt like the most difficult to properly pull off for how well the performances were nailed. The music isn't top notch by any means, but it was clear that care went into the composition. These two together would comprise around a 7/10 in my eyes; definitely good enough to be worthy of praise, but not so good as to be memorable for months afterwards.\n\nFinally, let's get to the worse parts of Senren * Banka.\n\nWhile the setting and the story are quite good, the characters are the most glaring weak link. The main character is a jumbled mess, having a very lackluster backstory that doesn't match his personality or actions throughout the story. Each of the heroines have very generic personalities throughout the common route that range from minimal to decent characterization in their routes. Murasame's route features the most characterization of every route, while the other three primary heroines get essentially generic or minimal changes. The characters simply do not make the routes work the way you would hope in a romance story. As a plus, however, the side characters are quite well characterized, which is bizarre since it's rare for them to have a depth of personality when it doesn't feel like the primary characters do.\n\nSpeaking of romance, it's very lackluster. This is likely because the characters involved are so weak, but the romance in every single route (including the sub routes) are essentially retreads of the same thing. You're getting the same flowery generic romance story six different times with the differences coming down to the individual way the overall story affects that particular arc. It feels very forced and that they didn't even want to create a romance story in the first place, or that the developers fleshed out the overall storyline of this piece and just shoved romance in to appeal to the masses on release. \n\nIn conclusion, Senren * Banka joins the extensive list of Visual Novels that had a lot of potential out of the gate, but simply fall short in an important way. I don't regret buying and playing through this game, and its clear that there was a lot of effort put into it, but this is an experience of driving through a beautiful landscape on a terribly maintained road. Enjoy the aesthetic and the story, but keep in mind that there is a price to pay to experience it.\n\n---\n\nI play Visual Novels for its characterization and storytelling potential.

If by that you are intrigued then you should see it for yourself. In this review I'll talk about the setting, cast and specially the gameplay, but I won't actually spoil any story details. If you don't want to know how many options you actually have in the game, stop reading right now.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]The actual review[/h1]\n\nSenren * Banka is a simplistic visual novel, with a simplistic storyline, simplistic characters and simplistic decisions. This does not make the game bad but it doesn't make it that special either. Actually, calling this game a visual novel could be misleading, because you really don't have that many options. Yes, you have different endings and routes, but it's not like other heavy visual novel titles in which you need to make a lot of decisions and explore different scenarios until you reach the end.\n\nThis could be almost cataloged as a kinetic novel. The choices are straightforward and you can get into the route of the girl you most want without any issues. For me, this is a turnoff. Altought I really hate when novels make stupid requirements for reaching X or Y ending, I also hate when it's so basic that it makes you wonder why they added them in the first place.\n\nThis VN has some good ideas like a Flowchart, saving dialogue lines & so on while also not really using them to the fullest potential. Like, why would I need a Flowchart for my decisions if they don't actually matter in the big scheme of things?\n\nYes, it's hard to make a branching storyline for a game this long but that does not mean you need to bait me like that. I was expecting much more when I saw just how many options you had at your disposal. However this decision makes sense when you see what the team behind Senren * Banka tried to make.\n\n[h1]Story & Characters[/h1]\n\n[u]Might spoil some minor details about the story.[/u]\n\nThis game is an eroge. The 'heroines' are basically models with explendid bodies and their personalities are just too pure for this world. [spoiler]All of them are virings who want to experience love, real love, and you are the one to give them that.[/spoiler] You also have your all-time favorite cliches like your childhood friend which you haven't seen for a while, your big sister, your 500 year old loli, the princess that is kind but really cold, the servant of that princess that's wife material but doesn't realize it, and your airheaded friend that just too nice to everyone.\n\nSenren * Banka is not reinventing the wheel. Althought the story is fairly original the characters are not and you have seen someone similar somewhere else, specially if you played a lot of VNs & you consumed a lot of manga/anime. Again, this does not make the story or characters bad, but rather expected. It's not boring but you get what you see. They will fall for you the same way you expect.\n\nDon't forget this is an eroge. The MC will sometimes have the luck of Rito from To LOVE-Ru. All the tropes from that series are going to happen in some way or another. This does not make the game less wholesome tho. Even if characters have sexual desires they are kept in check while somewhat still being wholesome. They tend to find their own sexuality and desires in such a pure way that it seems wrong seeing them do it tbh.\n\n[spoiler]This game has no drama at all, no love-triangles, no actual fights between characters. I was expecting some kind of drama but I did not find it here.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Gameplay & Settings[/h1]\n\nAs stated before, this game is far closer to a kinetic novel than an actual visual novel with branching stories. You have decision making but its more like \"hey you want to end with girl A or girl B?\". Moreover, I think you have a bigger number of decisions in the H! scenes than the others. Those scenes are kinda pointless and if you don't have the R18 patch I think you can't see them. Yes, the game has a patch but to be completely honest I ended up skipping all those H! scenes because I felt bad watching them. For context, I played \"Monster Girl Club Bifrost\" patched without any issue. The problem for me here is that is like I was watching two lovers have sex, like it's something I shouldn't be seeing.\n\nThe game has some nice features. You have a \"panic button\" that changes whatever you are seeing in game for a photo of your liking, for the folks that don't have any privacy. You also have a lot of options in the configuration menu. I'm a fan of configuration options. I like games to be as configurable as possible. Sometimes is hard for developers to implement these kind of features, but that's mainly because of desing and not because they are actually hard to implement.\n\nYou can set the voice of all characters, you can hide some UI elements, you can even change the text size, font and color. The only thing really lacking is the auto-mode because it works like ass, maybe because no one uses it (apart from me T . T). The auto-mode will NOT take into consideration long texts so you will eventually need to pause the game and go back.\n\nThere aren't that many effects in the game. Other VNs will play a lot more with the text box. Senren * Banka text box in comparison is too simplistic. This is a minor nit-pick but, for VNs, using the text box in creative ways is a plus and it always amazes me when some developer is creative with it. Just think of Doki Doki Literature Club!. Heck, this VN cant even make pauses between the same text box dialogue so you kinda get spoiled on what the character is going to say next.\n\n[h1]Music & Voice Acting[/h1]\n\nSenren * Banka has actual voice acting for all characters except the MC. That's really cool. Sometimes I find myself waiting for the voice line to finish before pressing space, because I actually want to hear the VA say something silly.\n\nAnd the music is alright. I have the main theme stuck in my head but that's about it. I'll certainly forget it after a few weeks.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nThis is a nice, wholesome game, at least for Japanese media standards. Yes, there is ecchi and xxx scenes, but it's still between two loving and consenting adults. This is not a porn game or some fap material, it's just a wholesome story. Yes, it has a lot of cliches and thropes, and yes the characters are unrealistic and just too pure, kinda shallow, but that's actually what they were trying to achieve with this.\n\nSometimes reading a VN like this is just fine. Ofc I would be bored if all VNs were like this, so maybe I won't play anything from this game-studio ever again, but that does not mean this is a bad game.\n\nJust check it out. If you are still bored after the common route is completed (from 4-8 hours) then it's probably not for you.\n\n[spoiler]btw Mako is best grill[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1690857773,

This game crashed so many times on me, it was always when a video was going to start and i would literally have to spam save all the up to before the video and then just keep reloading the game until it decided to play and not crash, I am talking 5-10 attempts. Multiply this with 6 stories and it was frustrating and took the impact out of the end of the stories when it would fade to credit and then crash to desktop. Nothing in the forums about it so maybe it was just my PC.\n\n As for the story. It's hit and miss. The common route sets up a excellent story which Murasame's route wraps up great, and just rating the story based off what I considered to be cannon and the story is a solid 9 and should be read for her route alone. \n\nBut the issue is I knew Murasame was the cannon story so I did her route last (As should you.) The other stories I can't be super nice with. Senren Banka is a painfully slow read and when 3 routes are pretty much the same from a different perspective, one route is unique but splits into the worst route, the slow read really shows it's head.  This story just takes it sweet time getting anywhere, so when you're reading a scene that is similar, but different to another route, it's easy to start glazing over. \n\nI don't want to ruin anything so I am going to just rate each route in the order that I did them.\n\nMako (7.5) - Started strong with a good personal conflict but it was easily and quickly gotten over and turned into probably the most sexual story? But at the same it's actually pretty funny what goes on in it. The story gives you a follow up to the history. It worked for me as a first route, but it would had been better as a second route since the lore was more about \"motivation,\" while Lena's was about the straight scoop. But Mako was the girl I wanted to date first. Who doesn't want a pervy hot Ninja that reads manga?\n\nLena (8) - Probably the best route next to Murasame, I liked Lena, she was funny and this route is a huge context dump, it explains the entire history. (I recommend this as the first route) and honestly I felt this had the 2nd best ending behind Murasame.\n\nRoka/Koharu - This is where the slow pacing starts to take it's toll, neither of these girls have shit to do with the main story and were not in the common route very often so this route turns everything into a completely new story. These stories are 100% slice of life and ditches the supernatural element.\n\nRoka (8) - I really enjoyed the change of pace and her story was excellent. Nothing was recycled and it was a nice read. \n\nKoharu (1) - Why? Why the hell was this a option? Was this a crowdfunding milestone or something? Not only does this route choice happen in the MIDDLE of Roka's story and it ditches it all together. it is the most eye rolling, boring ass story. I almost wrote a negative review after wrapping this route up.  [spoiler] She is the MC cousin, they are having sex and want to date, will the MC's family and friends approve of this? [/spoiler] <--- Yes that one black mark is the entire story, that's how dumb it is. The only saving grace is it's short, because of course it is. Koharu is literally for people who want a loli H-scene.\n\nYoshino (7.5) Ok we are back to the main story. I was expecting a little more from Yoshino, but since Mako and Lena gives the context dump there isn't much new addition to the lore. But Yoshino is so damn cute so i didn't mind. Her personal story and conflicts felt the most fleshed out, right behind Murasame.\n\nMurasame (9) The cannon story as I mentioned. Also the longest. I won't say anything else.\n\nThe music and acting is really good, the backgrounds are nice and the models are a little basic but good enough.\n\nOK, let's talk H-scenes. I actually don't really like H-scenes in these kind of stories, I do add the patch and the entire time a H-scene plays I sit there debating if I should just uninstall it as I put on headphones and try to speed up the conversation while making sure not to miss any important character development. Overall I feel they just threw them in last minute, because it becomes predictable when one was about to happen.  But don't listen to me on H-scenes since I am biased, I feel they cheapen a good romance and it's hard to hear the MC talk all lovey dubby after giving a girl a facial after she performed oral sex in a public space. Don't ask me why I always install the patches, I just do. \n\nThis was story definitely not on the same level a Kinkoi: Golden Loveriche which just had more interesting story routes and much better character art (Subjective) but this story is worth it for Murasame's route alone\n\nI recommend this. But unless you want all the achievements, skip Koharu and expect a super slow read, take breaks.

I've been trying to expose myself to these titles for quite some time now to understand the appeal behind them since I enjoy exploring various gaming categories. As of the time of this review, I've come to understand a lot more so it's only fitting I place my impression in this review. \n\nFirst and foremost, Yuzusoft is amazing and they deserve all the love that they get with their games. I've tried penetrating the VN genre with surface recommendations from web searches and a lot of them are plagued with bad hardware support and modern features that games from other genres have been using for years. \nI'm really impressed at the progress the studio have made with the development of their game engine. The interface is clean, software has zero performance hiccups, key binds are convenient, and accessibility features are there. You can also see them constantly improving the experience with their newer titles. \n\nOn top of that, all of the dialogues are fully voiced and the art is phenomenal in seemingly all of their games. With all that said, the only thing left to discuss is the narrative. \n\nAt first, I thought that the narrative for Senren Banka is a little lackluster. It's not bad but it's also nothing noteworthy. I mostly found the long aimless slice-of-life sections in the game to be boring. I thought it was out of place and wasted a lot of my time. \nHowever, later I realized that it's a deliberate decision by the writer. The appeal of these games, and why they work, is the parasocial relationship that they provide. They need to prioritize the experience you have with the character you chose in your route. That way, the NSFW sections are more compelling. I used to generalize the VNs in one category but it seems like their lewd/dating iterations should be judged entirely different.\n\nWith that in mind, I would say Senren Banka has a very good narrative. I found the legends behind Hoori to be intriguing and I enjoyed all of the little plot points they have made in conjunction to it. While I would've enjoyed it if they had a stronger narrative to surround the world building they have, balancing it alongside the slice-of-life sections would result into a longer game which would not really be ideal.\n\nI highly recommend this game for people getting into the eroges.", "timestamp_created": 1680091192, "timestamp_updated": 1680091192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563599586486816406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135144968": {"recommendationid": "135144968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807018515", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 18457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1696257565}, "language": "english", "review": "SHOULD PLAY", "timestamp_created": 1679468118, "timestamp_updated": 1679468118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478131800889968872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135128318": {"recommendationid": "135128318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000004658", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 989, "last_played": 1686517278}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has a really broken skip system and forces you inside specific routes without choices.", "timestamp_created": 1679438824, "timestamp_updated": 1679438824, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438138604164123535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134745047": {"recommendationid": "134745047", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001439825", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1679516879}, "language": "english", "review": "MMMMMMMMMMMM", "timestamp_created": 1678958148, "timestamp_updated": 1678958148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450441300868988037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134530941": {"recommendationid": "134530941", "author": {"steamid": "76561199191621177", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1686888688}, "language": "english", "review": "Rich Story, Cute Character, Nice Plot and Romance just like the other yuzusoft games!

There's no option for in-between.[/i][/quote]\n\nSenren Banka is an amazing VN, after playing Sanobawitch a few years ago I instantly bought this on its launch day. And yes, the story is amazing, although at the time I writing this review (2023-03-03) I have only play 3 out of 4 main route (Mako, Murasame & Lena), and side stories haven't been touched.\nYou know I'm glad the title is translated by NekoNyan instead of SP. But I have set my expectation way too high, while the translation is not as fully cringe as SP, I can't help but feel a little disappointed. I drop this a few times, and then back playing it again, over and over again. I'm not sure if I want to continue the rest of the story because of the translation. It's that kind of feeling where I'm still curious about story and I want to see it more and play it again and then when I see the translation, ugh, I can't, I wish I could forget what I see. Yes I am that kind of guy who picky about translation. There was times when I use Textractor and machine-translate it myself directly from Japanese text, but it's not really convenient and it crash or failed sometimes.\n\nSo what make me hate the translation?\n[list][*]The first one is, SP style when joke/wordplay \"converted\" (not translated) into western joke. VN are niche game, hardly any normies play this, no need to change Japanese joke or meme into what they think as a western equivalent of the joke, pretty sure majority of the player already understand and familiar with Japanese joke & meme anyway. For example \"Chotto matta!\" translated to \"Stop right there criminal scum!\". That's cringe. Also everyone already know who it is, no one force you to translate \"Roboneko\" as \"Doraemon\". And there are more stuff like that.\n[*]And the second one is inconsistency, a lot of it. For example \u7af9\u5200 doesn't even have consistent translation as sometimes translated as \"bamboo sword\", \"wooden sword\", and sometimes simply as \"shinai\". And the second one is much more important because it's a character name: \u767d\u72db, where in name section it's translated as \"White Komainu\", but in dialogue it's \"Shirokoma\". If you have good memory, actually listen to dialogue and read the text, you will notice more things like this.[/list]\n\nBut other than that, there are also good things that I like from NN translation:\n[list][*]Original Japanese name order, they are still \"FamilyName GivenName\".\n[*]Original honorific included, they still write -chan, -san, etc. at almost all of them.\n[*]Using original measurement, they didn't convert it into feet when the dialogue mention it in meter, and also still translating floor originally but with added explanation instead of straight convert it into meter/feet.[/list]\nAlthough I have mixed feeling about their choice to leave the princess title not translated.\n\n\nSo what's my opinion about this game?\nGame & story: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (only 3 out 4 routes finished so far)\nTranslation: \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\nI'm not really sure if I should give positive or negative review.

It all just looks and feels good. The free and easy to add extra content patch is also nice. At first everything about this VN looks really good.\n\nBut there are a few flaws that are worth mentioning. For example, the story. It all seems promising at first. The town of Hoori feels alive and it's traditions play a big part in the story. And up to individual girl paths there isn't a lot to nitpick. However it's only a small part of the story and only makes up like 20% at most and everything after that slowly goes downhill. The first individual route might seem nice, they have a decent plot to them, but every route shares a lot in common. Some events (like canceling an important engagement) definitely happens in at least 4 of the routes, but is only really described in detail in a single one. Not really a bad thing but it is an example of big similarities in the different routes. After some time you start to make connections and after some more time you can kinda guess when major plot twits are gonna happen. And some routes are clearly better. For example Hitachi's route had her own special scenes in the main route and an unexpected story, a big existential struggle, a hobby (something that other girls lacked), an interesting personality, the best h-scenes, and the most interesting story. And it's not a biased opinion, it's fact. Instead like how it is in other story rich VNs, here every ending felt weaker that the previous one. And there wasn't a true ending! I understand that it might be hard to to connect the 7 (or 8) different routes, but not having a final ending just leaves an unpleasant aftertaste you get from the last remaining bad and boring endings. Finishing the last route didn't even give a sense of accomplishment or anything. Oh and the After stories that take place some time after the main story finished. Like 2 or 3 of them really feel needed and in reality all of em are just additional h-scenes. And I gotta say those scenes are kinda lame. Lame as in too vanilla.

Although when it is talked about, that's when I get very invested in the story, with a unique premise and with it even having its own history felt very [b]Japanese Mythology[/b] like. [b]Senran Banka[/b] is spread apart into two sections for its story, the first one is where you are dealing with and exploring the mythological aspect that it has. The other part is the character development for the route you have chosen to do.\n\nThere are a total of five different routes for you to experience, with seven different endings and scenarios. I chose the [b]Mako[/b] route as [b]Mako[/b] was a ninja and ninjas are cool~. I enjoyed her personality the most out of all the characters. She helps the [b]Tomotake[/b] family out with the housework and the hunting of demons on certain nights. The other character that I liked was [b]Roka Maniwa[/b], she runs a sweet shop and I actually think she is the best-designed character besides [b]Mako[/b]. If it were not for [b]Mako[/b], I probably would have chosen [b]Roka's[/b] route, although I do wish she had more screen time as a whole and maybe played a larger role in the story.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2905036817\nJust a note, there is also an option for you to date your cousin, but you can easily avoid that route if this sort of thing bothers you.\n\nNow, with all that positivity, comes a few issues that [b]Senran Banka[/b] suffers from, and while it does not hold it back, they are still worth noting. [b]Masaomi[/b] plays out like a typically unlikeable main character with no personality. I do not like him, period, he is bland, boring, and just unlikeable. Since this is a dialog-heavy visual novel, this is a huge problem, as you want to make the main character at least likable as a whole.\n\nThe next issue I have is a combination of two issues. The fan service on occasion can be a little unnecessary in the story, even though I understand the use in some situations to better showcase certain aspects of specific characters. Now, this is fine on certain occasions, however, there are ways for you to make a character likable without a fan service scene. I did not like [b]Mako[/b] because of the fan service stuff, I liked [b]Mako[/b] because she was a Ninja and had the most interesting personality out of the bunch.\n\nSince there is a little too much fanservice at times, this also slows the pacing down as well and it can be a bit of a slog to get through. I also hate the stereotype trope of every female character thinking that the MC is a pervert when he is really not. While [b]Senran Banka[/b] does not have all the typical anime tropes that are out there, it does have a few of them, that being, the worst ones imaginable.\n\n[h1]Artstyle/Music[/h1]\nThe art style used in [b]Senran Banka[/b] is honesty really beautiful and very colorful in its areas shown. Each area is full of life and is very detailed, the character sprites are also very well done and definitely fit the art style that the visual novel was going for. I even like the designs that the demons had as well, they felt very mysterious while having a threatening charm to them that I liked.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2905036875\nI'll take a moment to talk a bit about the music, as it\u2019s definitely well done and deserving of its praise. The voice acting has to be another thing worth mentioning as I liked all the voices that the visual novel had to offer, there was never a voice I hated.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nI tested this VN on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. I experienced no issues while I was playing, and it should be able to run on any computer.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nAll in All, [b]Senran Banka[/b] is a visual novel worth your time and attention if you enjoy the slice-of-life type of stuff. It has a total of 50+ hours in terms of content, so if you are someone who likes to explore all possible situations, then I recommend this visual novel at full price. Although if you only plan to play this visual novel once, then you are better off getting it on sale, as 39.99 is definitely a steep price to pay for a 12-hour experience.\n\n[quote] Although Hoori's biggest attraction is [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/5297658/]Life Needs a Little Sin [/url] as they have good quality reviews[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1671732229, "timestamp_updated": 1671932832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611031532287597656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128831471": {"recommendationid": "128831471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807610004", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 2744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2744, "last_played": 1671419144}, "language": "english", "review": "This VN will be one of the last \"slice of life (with a bit of action)\" that I will ever play. \n\nIt suffers from what they all do. Several routes that are all extremely similar, except when it comes to quality. One route clearly shines above all the others and a couple felt very rushed. They should've just stuck to the one well written character route and invested more into it and made that the entire VN. The routes are all full of cliches and tropes. \n\nThe WORST part is how incredibly vanilla the H scenes are. No animations, all oral and standard penetration, and only 2 additions of flavor (golden nectar and an employed foot) in ONE of the character routes. These VNs are written to have mass appeal I guess, but I got bored so I skipped all but a few scenes. Surely anyone could skip something they don't like.\n\nNow why do I recommend it despite my shade? Well the issue is mostly fatigue from several titles. There are many VNs (some without any adult stuff at all) that are truly well written, interesting, funny, niche/fetish, and/or explore something fascinating (STEINS:GATE, Doki Doki Lit. Club, Fata Morgana, Atri, Iwaihime, and even Nekopara, etc.).Senren Banka is not quite their pace or niche, it is mostly normal people doing normal things (with a supernatural twist to give them something to do other than eat pudding).\n\nIf this was my first slice of life/action/romcom VN, the tropes/cliches would be more endearing, the vanilla H would be hotter, and the samey routes would feel fresher and more distinct. There is certainly enough humor, quality writing, and art to warrant enjoying. \n\nI had a lot of fun overall, but the last 10-15 play hours I was mostly just wanting it to change pace or end.", "timestamp_created": 1671420744, "timestamp_updated": 1676145391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696141839027404785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128712070": {"recommendationid": "128712070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138244880", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1671265110}, "language": "english", "review": "The main character is an aggressive incel.

Idk if you should do her route first or last but her arc will definitely touch your feelings a little.\n\nDEFINITELY a must buy!

I will update my review once I have finished all the other routes. I played whilst listening to most voiced lines.\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n\nThe game starts with a main common route. Once it ends, you can choose to finish the game on the route of one of the four main girls, or Roka/Koharu's common route (locked on first playthrough). If you choose to go down Roka/Koharu's common route, once this ends, you can choose once again to go down Roka or Koharu's specific routes. The length of the main common route is around 10 hours, with each route of the main girl taking another 10 hours. Roka and Koharu's common route takes around 6 hours, and their specific route each take around 3 hours.\n\n[u][h1] General review [/h1][/u]\n[h1] Story and script-writing [/h1]\n\nThe visual novel intertwines advancing the main storyline whilst promoting the relationship between the MC and the girl. Excellent pacing and content keeps you gripped on the main storyline whilst also keeping your heart throbbing for the interactions between the characters. The script-writing fully captures the charms of the character, and makes each scene feel vibrant and cohesive. It does an especially good job of capturing one of Yuzusoft's best qualities in their VNs: making the girls feel clingy. What I mean by this is that you can really see and feel how the girl falls more and more in love with the MC, with exceptional scenes and scripts along each step of their developing feelings.\n\n[h1]Voice acting[/h1]\n\nThe game is fully voice acted save for the MC and narration. I believe this is the best combo as it helps immensely in the world-building whilst also not breaking any immersion. Each character is brought to life by VAs that capture the essence of their character, where emotions are conveyed wholly and impactfully.\n\n[h1]H Content[/h1]\n\nAs with most VNs, the quality of the script drops substantially as soon as H content start. Superior to most VNs, despite this fact, it mostly remains a decent quality, with some pleasant surprises with good quality scripting. However, I did find myself fast reading some of the H content. H content is not included on Steam, you can download the patch on Yuzusoft's official website.\n\n[h1]Sprite quality[/h1]\n\nA very high number of poses and facial expressions are used on detailed sprites, which frequently changes during a conversation to keep the characters life-like and natural. Attention to detail is paid in order to get the perfect timing and sprite selection to achievement the aforementioned point, which makes it feel even more fluid than an animation.\n\n[h1]CG quality (non H standpoint)[/h1]\n\nThere is a high number of CGs that are vibrant and dynamic. Overall quality is excellent, but it is emphasised by the outstanding timings the CGs are introduced. They serve to enhance the story and moments dramatically, and add to the fact that some details (e.g. facial expressions) can change whilst showing the CG, it serves as a powerful cornerstone for the VN to shine upon.\n\n[h1]CG quality (H standpoint)[/h1]\n\nDue to the nature of a H scene, it may sometimes feel repetitive because ultimately, it is still just one image. The H aspect is mostly decent, but sometimes it fails to successfully capture the balance between the H quality of the girl and the charm of the girl. That said, it still fully inherits all the good points discussed in the non-H standpoint, with the overall quality being better than most other VNs.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nYou occasionally make choices that impact what route you end up going into (H-Scene choices have no impact).\n\n[h1]Translation[/h1]\n\nI played the game mostly in English and sometimes with Chinese sub-text. I can't speak for the faithfulness to the original (since I haven't seen the original), but both languages flow naturally and don't detract from the game's charm. There is no element of annoying over-localisation present, allowing you to fully enjoy the story.\n\n[h1]Settings and misc[/h1]\n\nThe game excels in this aspect. Settings that are crucial for a VN, settings you may want in a VN, settings you didn't even think you will need in a VN, this has it all. Despite the high customizability, the settings are straight forward to navigate and comprehend, with the default being perfect acceptable as well. A small detail I really appreciate is that almost every navigation or options is accompanied by the voice of one of the girls. The game also features the ability to bookmark favourite voice lines, which is quite wonderful (I don't play a lot of VNs, so I'm not sure if this is a common feature). \n\n[h1]MC[/h1]\n\nThe game's MC does a good job of filling the role of a character in the world, whilst also not making it feel like you are watching a story from the sidelines. There is no eccentric qualities about him, which thankfully also means there are no annoying qualities about him. He is also not an emotionless insert; he is able to express various emotions appropriate for the scenario, so you won't find yourself cringing or raging over the MC's actions.\n\n[u][h1]Routes[/h1][/u]\n[u] Disclaimer: [/u] I may discuss what some may consider minor spoilers, but I promise there won't be any details pertaining to what happens. \n\n[h1]Common[/h1]\n\nThe common route is where you are introduced to the main storyline of the curse and the characters, whilst also building up the world of Hoori. The common route intertwines advancing the storyline of solving the curse whilst simultaneously showing off the personality of the characters and the charm of the girls. The former is achieved somewhat dully, with the majority coming from dialogue that feels dragging, but the latter is achieved phenomenally, from enticing dialogue sparkled with colourful CG, to well planned events that serve as a powerful backbone for the script to shine.\n\nThe proportion of the main story and dating aspect leans slightly towards the former, so I can't help but think that being a bit more skewed towards the latter, or at least being balanced, would making the common route more enjoyable. However, I'm no scriptwriter and I'm sure the currently balance has been tested and was deemed optimal. This is also more than made up by the fact that during a specific route, the dating aspect (even without considering H), is more pronounced than the main story (or in the case of Roka/Koharu, the main story completely ends).\n\nWorld-building of Hoori is relatively simple, but that doesn't mean it feels one-dimensional. Details are sprinkled into the story to make the world believable and cohesive, and the balance between subtleness and explicitness leaves no room for confusion, whilst also not overwhelming you with details like a lorebook.\n\nThe actual story quality of the main plot (at least in the common route) is detailed, but unexciting. You can clearly see that whilst a detailed storyline is present, the heart of the VN is not here. Whilst you won't be bored or uninterested, you may start feeling indifferent about the events that happen in the main storyline.\n\nThe story quality of the dating aspect is where the positives of this VN shine through. You get a taste of each of the girls' charms, with enough details to understand their traits, and sufficient encouragement to select any of their routes. Each scene is carefully crafted to achieve this, with all elements of the VN working in harmony.\n\n(Due to the character limit, I will be discussing each specific routes in the comments.)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWhilst not the first VN I finished, as a relatively new VN player, this showed me the charms and potentials of VN. This VN was a brilliant introduction to the genre for me, and I can easily say its the best out of the limited number of ones I have played. For the current price, it is more than worth it, as the sheer quantity of quality content will easily be proven by the number of willing hours one would inevitably be putting in.", "timestamp_created": 1660801089, "timestamp_updated": 1660806128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458027690649032593", "comment_count": 36, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120665808": {"recommendationid": "120665808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024719849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 5006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1735, "last_played": 1690155664}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Where do I start?[/h1] \n\n\n\n\nFirst of all: General information:\n\n[list] \n[*] I bought this game on sale for 18 Euro\n[*] the art gallery appears after finishing the first route.\n[*] there are 6 different routes to read\n[*] you can save spoken sentences, what i absolutly love\n[*] there are alot of shortcuts you can use with your mouse (such as lmb and turn mouse to left and I get directly to the saves)\n[*] Patch?

But you can actually read her whenever you want. Atleast I didn't was spoiled much. The routes i felt was close to each other was Mako and Lena. That was a bit disturbing to read and Lenas route also includes information about Murasames-route. \n\n\nPersonaly, If you want my recommendation, in which order to read the Visual Novel, I would definitly see Murasames-route as last.\nKoharu and Roka are both not part of the story or the curse, so you can read them in between. \nMako and Yoshino have no overlap. \nIn the end just follow the routes, you want them to read. \nI'm happy with mine.\n\n\n[b][i] So thanks alot, Yuzusoft for the game and Good Job!\nThe whole cast and staff did a great job with the Characters, Story and Music!\nthe synchronisation was well done and the translation was very good!\nAs a non-native-english speaker I could understand all and follow the story.\nThank you for the localisation in english and the publiziation in the western world[/i][/b]\n\n\nMfG Kota", "timestamp_created": 1660559405, "timestamp_updated": 1674167134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120624014": {"recommendationid": "120624014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047066768", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3143, "last_played": 1660498571}, "language": "english", "review": "thank you VNdegens for playing this game on stream", "timestamp_created": 1660494341, "timestamp_updated": 1660494341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120618637": {"recommendationid": "120618637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835522925", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 4302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4302, "last_played": 1660488113}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice", "timestamp_created": 1660488142, "timestamp_updated": 1660488142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120367246": {"recommendationid": "120367246", "author": {"steamid": "76561199213743706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 11220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10046, "last_played": 1683694349}, "language": "spanish", "review": "A romance VN with a dash of Inuyasha? Sign me in!\n\n[b] Note: [/b] due to recent findings, most of them being plot-related, I felt the need to re-review this game. The first time, I was more lenient towards this game. Not so much now.\n\n[h1] Introduction [/h1]\n\nSenren *Banka is a romance VN developed by Yuzusoft. It has a heavy emphasis on the mystical elements of ancient Japan, and explores legends and stories from half a millenium ago. While in my original review didn't give the plot much thought, now I had, and, unfortunately, I found some glaring issues with it, and one of them is significant. On the upside, my character assesment will be largely unchanged.\n\n[h1] Worldbuilding [/h1]\n\nThe game is set in current Japan, more specifically, in rural Japan, in the fictional town of Hoori. There are several mystical elements to take into account, like curses, guardian gods, legendary blades, spirits and so on. So, there is a lot of elements, so the rules governing them must be consistent with each other. Fortunately, the writers did their job properly, and I didn't found contradictive rules, or rules that don't make sense in the context they are introduced. Like I said earlier, most of the issues I found are related to the plot, and the worldbuilding elements were consistent, and they were good sources of conflict, tension and drama. So, nothing to complain about, on this regard at least.\n\n[h1] The plot [/h1]\n\nOh, boy. The plot is about a group of teenagers fighting against a 500-year old curse. Like i said earlier, some of the elements of the plot reminded me of Inuyasha (in both the characters need to collect the shards of a relic). The main problem I have with this plot is the time passed since the curse was cast. I find it hard to swallow that no one, in 500 years, figured out a way to break the curse. Since the curse has dire ramifications for Hoori and its denizens, the fact that no one in half a millenium found any clue on how to break the curse, makes absolutely no sense. At the very least, I'd make the characters of the game figured things out using the clues found by other people before them. That way, this huge contrivance is turned into cause and effect. There also conveniences and inconveniences, and tone-deaf scenes that ruin serious character development moments. That said, the plot issues were more focused in the common route. The only issue I found in any of the heroines' routes was in Mako's, that could potentially change some elements of her plotline, but it's not too damaging.\n\n[h1] The characters [/h1]\n\nThis is another strength of the game. This could probably the only romance VN where I liked all the heroines, with no exceptions. All of them has distinct personalities, quirks, flaws, desires, goals and motivations, some better than the other, but at least they are present. I think the strongest characters of this game, in terms of writing, are Yoshino and Murasame. The main character is decent, but he doesn't change much and his character development is barebones, the minimum necessary to be an actual character and not a tool for the writers to advance to plot. If only the writers had the same amount of effort writing the plot of this game, this could have been an absolute banger of a romance VN.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nAs any branching VN, this game features choices that decides which heroine's route the player will end up. The difference with other games from the same developer, is the fact that it's possible to not raise any flags at all, which makes way more sense than how the other games function. I haven't tested raising the same amount of flags for each girl, so I can't say what'd happen. This game, unlike other romance VNs from other developers, features a flowchart, where the player can see the plot progression and the choices they made. It's a convenient way to track progress and to navigate through large portions of the plot without using functions like skip or backskip, or make another choice. The game also gives the option of recoloring read text, and it even lets the player customize the color to their liking. That's something I have never seen on other VNs, and I wish more developers do the same.\n\n[h1] Artistic and technical elements [/h1]\n\nThis is the aspect in which Yuzusoft shines the brightest. Art direction, sound effects, voice acting, localization, all of that is top notch. The background and event CGs are superb, rich in detail, and shows the care of the illustrators for their craft. The voice acting is awesome, has emotional weight and shows the quality of Japanese voice acting. That said, I found some issues with dialogue, specifically in some Mako's lines, where the dialogue is out of order. This could be a localization issue or a voice direction issue, but it's a minor hiccup. The music is also on point, and it matches the tone and situation perfectly. The only real issue here is the performance in some instances. If you are using an iGPU or a budget graphics card to run this game, you could experience severe frame drops when two or more effects overlap each other. Even with my 3060 Ti I experienced some frame drops, so optimization is an issue here.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n-Solid worldbuilding.\n-Well written characters.\n-Good gameplay choices, with nice additions for good measure.\n-Outstanding art direction, voice acting and other artistic elements.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n-Nonsensical and awfully contrived main plot.\n-Some optimization issues in key instances.\n\nThough my view of this game is more critical than the first time, this game is still a good recommendation for people who like romance VNs. Less than before, but a recommendation nonetheless. Like I said in other review, I'm willing to overlook glaring plot issues if the characters are good. And this game delivers on that regard on spades.", "timestamp_created": 1660096538, "timestamp_updated": 1683749844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120337975": {"recommendationid": "120337975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063133451", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1633, "last_played": 1660124619}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR the VN is decent, if somewhat generic. Be sure that you're the target audience (teenaged weebs) when playing. The trial mode is very representative of what you'll get and a great thing.\n\nI haven't really played a lot of VNs before if JRPG segments don't count, but I thought I'd give it a try and this was the highest rated one around. I'm not really that into the anime tropes anymore and they're pretty ubiquitous here so that kind of hampered my enjoyment a bit but not to the point where I dropped it early. I'm writing this review after having played every route but Lena's.\n\n[h1]Technical aspects[/h1]\nThe thing that made me buy this to try it out as opposed to simply pirating it was the options menu, funnily enough. The amount of complex customization you can do, from adjusting voice volume of specific characters to binding specific mouse gestures to customizing the color of already seen text, was honestly crazy to me.\n\nOther than that, the game performed totally fine and I didn't notice any problems when playing outside of one somewhat problematic feature.\n\nThe auto mode. This feature is somewhat buggy, if you have the text speed at 100% you'll regularly find some unvoiced lines be skipped after voiced lines because of how this feature works. If you're on an unvoiced line of text when a voiced line stops, the unvoiced text is advanced in auto mode, this means that if the text is on the screen too quickly when the voice is less than a second from being done, that text will be skipped. Annoying. This can be fixed by setting text speed to 95%, it's still fast enough to be near indistinguishable.\nThe issue described above is a general flaw though, if you skip ahead in text and a voice line ends you'll sometimes skip unvoiced lines accidentally, although maybe I should've just stopped using auto mode at that point.\n\n[h1]Production value[/h1]\nThis was somewhat saddening to me, after the options menu gave me such a good impression. The character images and backgrounds, as well as the music are all good, great even! But there's so little of it, the majority of the time you'll see the same character image with 2 outfits, about 7 different expressions and around 5 custom CGs (including sex scenes) per route. I had expected a few more custom images and was a little disappointed to find out that this is where they mainly saved on costs. Maybe I'm expecting too much of a 30$ game but then again, VNs don't have to care about gameplay at all, so I expect the funds to be put into things that are basically the \"gameplay\" of VNs.\n\nOn the other hand, the voice acting is top-notch and everything but the inner monologue and speech of the protagonist is voiced. No complaints here at all.\n\n[h1]Plot and characters[/h1]\nI'll write a bit about the character-specific routes without spoilers below my abstract thoughts on them, which come next.\n\nThe plot itself is alright, I was not particularly invested in it, but it didn't bore me to tears and was satisfactorily resolved in the basic route. It's definitely more of a vehicle for character interactions than anything else, outside of the character-specific routes.\n\nThe characters are pretty good actually, most of them are decently fleshed out by the time you've played all routes and have multiple motivations for their actions. They're not especially complex or deep, but they have enough going for them that you can emphasize and, in some cases, relate. \nMost of the character development of a character is locked behind a character-specific route though, during the basic route they remain rather static, which is fine because that's where you get to know them in the first place. Although, the relationships between the characters could've been expanded upon, it sometimes feels like characters cease to exist if the protagonist doesn't interact with them.\n\nTwo final things to note, despite what the game may say, these characters are not 18+ and certainly don't act anywhere near that age. The main character is a very vexing person in the basic route, and only really seems to grow out of his macho phase once you start the character-specific routes. Outside those moments, he's a very passive and \"nice\" person, probably for ideal self-insertion. Although, he's made dense to the point of self-delusion in some routes.\nFurthermore, basically every heroine turns into a blushing innocent lily the moment they're romanced, I suppose this may be a more cultural thing about the Japanese female ideal, but it's noticeable where one second they're confident in themselves and the next they're a blushing stuttering wreck that has never dated anybody. I suppose they didn't want to give an impression of \"used goods\" which in of itself is a pretty toxic view. In one of the routes a heroine mentions that she's happy the protagonist has never dated somebody either because she didn't want to feel like she'd be compared to a prior experience, which is understandable if a rather immature view.\n\nTime for a spoiler free overview of the character-specific routes, I'll mainly split it up between the romance/relationship and the plot of the route. The number next to their name is the age based on maturity I'd assign the heroine and protagonist in this route. The order is the way I played them in.\n\nMurasame(19): The first route I played, with the most involved plot. That kind of was its downfall though, a lot of focus and words was spent on resolving the plot and the payoff/solution was good, but the way to it was a bit of a slog. It definitely dragged in the middle, and I would recommend using the skip button during some scenes. It gave me true-ending vibes with its resolution though.\nThe relationship with Murasame was expanded upon in this route, and she gets a satisfying character arc and pay-off, although you don't notice that she's supposed to be 500 years old. They didn't really do anything with the concept and she feels more like a somewhat more mature girl in a young body, not an adult though. They could've definitely done a bit more with the well-spring of experiences Murasame has seen over her time, and her relationships with characters she has ostensibly been watching over for their entire lives.\n\nA decent route but the middle part of the plot really dragged it down, I'd say this was thoroughly mediocre. I probably did Murasame a disservice by comparing her to Sothis from Fire Emblem 3 Houses which does a much better job of working with the 1000 year old loli archetype.\n\nMako(17): This route had a pretty good plot that kept me interested and was the best one in typing together plot and character development for the heroine. Also has one of the most amusing plot lines, sleepless in Hoori had me chuckling.\nThis route actually let the characters breathe and get to know each other before falling in love and felt a lot more plausible than some of the others. The characters also do a [b]great[/b] job communicating here, something that I was very surprised in an anime-inspired piece of media. Feelings were communicated and explored in a rather mature way. Ended with a very satisfying character-development based pay-off.\n\nMy favorite route overall.\n\nRoka(20): Not much to write here, this and Koharu are bother side-character routes and basically just there, so you can romance other notable characters without making them actually plot-relevant. The ending was decent though, the plot while nothing to write home about was well-handled.\nThe relationship was alright, Roka could've been made a little more mature, but that would've gone against the innocent lily portrayal of all heroines, oh well. \n\nKoharu(14): Ah, the incest route. I played with the 18+ patch, this was the only route that was actually made worse by it, I feel. Very lame resolution overall and all in all not a great time for me.\n\nCharacter limit reached, oops. \n\nYoshino(16): This route had the best plot, I'd argue. The relationship was also well-explored.

Who says Visual Novel, says multiple possible choices after the common story. In this game, 6 different routes bring us a lot of perceptives on the course of the adventure of our hero. Of course, it is possible to do the routes in the order, it will not change the way you perceive the game, the choice will be made according to your attraction on each heroine of the game. But you have to keep in mind that some roads will seem less interesting than others, despite that, I still advise you to do them all, you will have a global vision of the game! \n\nA little advice to unlock all the routes, if you are like me who has the laziness to look for them all, a small Google search and hop, it's settled! :)\n\n\n[b]Audio (OST...)[/b]\n\n\u2611 Excellent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Unpleasant\n\nI was really won over by the opening music, it was this music that drove me to play this Visual Novel. Overall, I thought the OSTs reflected the environment of the story very well. \n\n\n[b]Translation[/b]\n\n\u2610 Not translated *not yet*\n\u2610 Disappointing\n\u2610 Quite a few mistakes\n\u2611 Nickel\n\u2610 Translated into all languages\n\nFor French speakers looking for a Visual Novel in French, it's not going to be that easy... On the other hand if you have an intermediate level of English, you can enjoy this game to the fullest, it offers English that is not too difficult to understand! If you know Chinese or Japanese, it's even better! \n\n\n[b]Price[/b]\n\n\u2610 Free\n\u2610 Well worth it\n\u2611 Normal \"quality\"/price ratio\n\u2611 To buy on sale\n\u2610 Way too expensive for what it is\n\nIts normal price is 29,99\u20ac, I bought it at 19,19\u20ac, about 10\u20ac less. I think the normal price is a bit high, that's why I waited for a promotion before enjoying Senren Banka. At the moment, all Yuzusoft's VNs are about this price, it's understandable, since the company buys the license and takes care of the translation and development of the system to implement their translation. \n\n\n[b]Lifetime[/b]\n\n\u2610 Very long (+100h)\n\u2611 Long (40-100h)\n\u2610 Medium (25-40h)\n\u2610 Short (8-25h)\n\u2610 Very short (0-8h)\n\nOn my end, I was able to unlock all the routes and achievements in the game for a total of 50h of play. This seems pretty long to me for a Visual Novel, it will depend on how fast you read. \n\n\n[b]Audience[/b]\n\n\u2610 Children\n\u2611 Teenagers\n\u2611 Adults\n\nThis game is basically an Eroge, the developers decided to remove the erotic scenes to target a wider audience on Steam, however the +18 version is available for free on the NekoNyan website for those who want the original version of the game.\n\n\n[b]Config required[/b]\n\n\u2610 Very low config\n\u2611 Low-end / entry-level mid-range PC\n\u2610 Mid-range PC / high-end entry\n\u2610 High end PC\n\u2610 NASA PC\n\nAlmost all Visual Novels do not require a graphics card to run the game, a processor is more than enough, however let's not exaggerate, 2000s PCs are not going to run the game...\n\n\n[h1][u]Conclusion[/u][/h1]\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the structure of the story, we feel that it is not a simple romance story, there is a whole work behind made by the author.

I found myself getting sad towards the end of my last romance route because I didn't want the story and world to end. Each character path provides a unique experience either into the character relationships or the lore of the country town Hoori that you're in. I felt the game was really well polished, though the only thing I would change was maybe get rid of Koharu's romance. I know there is a disclaimer that everyone is 18 or older, but it is really unsettling that everyone is still in high-school and she is obviously the youngest, and your cousin. I did play this game with the patch installed, so I'm not sure how this plays without it. But given including the patch, there is SO much content to explore. At times I skipped bits, especially when the main character was talking since he didn't have a voice and I read it faster than it would have been said. I'm sure if I let this auto-play, I'd probably have upwards of 40 hours or more on the game.

Senren\uff0aBanka is no exception and is just another good entry in their catalog. Senren\uff0aBanka compared to the other available Yuzusoft titles on steam leans more into traditional Japanese culture with the protagonist moving to a small village in a rural part of Japan reminiscent of P4 with Inaba if you've played that. Overall I enjoyed all the routes, and each heroine had an interesting enough character arc beyond the common route to read to the end. I think Mako's was my favorite to read, the writers got her gap moe tuned just right especially with her playful personality. I loved the gimmick with the Murasame sword, and the curse of the village this time around. If you have never played a Yuzusoft title they play out somewhat similarly, but they differentiate themselves with varying designs and character traits for the heroines. And then there's always a specific motif, setting, or theme they go with. It's just really all in the small nuanced details that allow individual Yuzusoft titles to stand on their own. \n\nThe artwork is great as always with a signature style that when you see it you know you're reading a Yuzusoft VN. The OST is appropriate for the setting with some fun upbeat tracks thrown in the mix as well. Pacing is also decent, not perfect, but wasn't to the point I felt like things were moving way too slowly or too quickly with not enough narrative development. Also as always vocal performances were great, everyone from main cast to side characters made Hoori feel lively. \n\nI mean what else can you say, you get quality when you get a Yuzusoft VN, at worst they're alright, and at their best they're comfy and entertaining.

My \"hours played\" stat is a little inflated from leaving it on overnight a few times, but I still spent quite a bit of time with it.\n\nI'm no VN expert, as I've only ever really delved into the original Fate Stay Night and Katawa Shoujo. That being said, Senren Banka was a pretty decent Visual Novel, with high production value. A few routes are very good, and I found that my favorite was Murasame's route. All of the main routes (Yoshino, Lena, Murasame, Mako) are well fleshed out- some more than others. Roka/Koharu routes are the least involved, and feels like a side story more than anything. \n\nThe H-Scenes- there's plenty of them. I played with the optional uncensored patch. Each route consists of several H-Scenes after the relationships blossom. Personally, I could have done with more character development / character moments than so many H-Scenes, but that's just me! When I say I want more PLOT, I don't mean it ironically. \n\nThe main character is dense as hell, and sometimes annoying. The routes are very lengthy, often without real substance. However, despite the flaws, I found that many of the character moments were well executed. The banter between the characters can be very funny, and many of the more dire moments hit with appropriate impact, with many sad emotional moments. Sometimes the feels are there, and that's a good thing. It means I ended up liking the characters, but as a result, I feel a little underwhelmed they weren't developed further. \n\nWhile I may have many negative things to say about Senren Banka, I wouldn't have 100% it if I didn't enjoy it! It was a good time, and I do recommend giving it a look if you like VNs. Murasame's route had lots of laughs and feels, and I loved it. Playing Senren Banka was worth it for that route alone, as it hit on some interesting subject matter which I found particularly interesting and not often explored. Is Senren Banka worth it? Sure!

Why?\n\nYes, it is a classical tropey tale about a Japanese dude who breaks the town\u2019s Excalibur\u2026 er, katana in the stone, and now has to live at the shrine where it was kept and marry the shrine maiden. Of course, there are other girls involved in the mix, such as the loyal ninja girl whose family has served the shrine maiden for generations, the scaredy sword spirit of the katana, a gorgeous foreigner exchange student, the mandatory childhood friend and cousin, a curse hanging over the town they have to deal with\u2026 you know, the works.\nBut in true Yuzusoft manner, they quickly make use of the charming personalities and quirks of each girl, to the point that all grow on you by the end of the common route and you are wondering which heroine\u2019s route to start first.\n\nThis is because of how skillfully they weave the tale of Hoori\u2019s curse and how it affects our characters, and how each character represents one part of the solution (my recommended order: Yoshino > Roka and Koharu > Mako > Lena > Murasame) to the whole mystery. And it really is one hell of a tale, delightfully intricate and full to the brim with colorful Japanese folklore. Plus the characters themselves are just as fun to watch in Yuzusoft\u2019s classic \u201cAnother View\u201d, a feature I love and wish to see appear more often in VNs, where you get to see the perspective of other characters aside from the MC.\n\nThat way, you get to see Yoshino\u2019s seriousness as a shrine maiden and funny innocence as a girl (her achievements are SO. DAMN. HILARIOUS.), Mako\u2019s fierce loyalty and girlish femininity, Lena\u2019s charming naivete and unique cultural mishaps (kudos for the translators for succeeding in properly translating her linguistic blunders, that\u2019s no mean feat), Murasame\u2019s regality and childishness, and Roka and Koharu as the ones to show you the less \u201carcane\u201d side of Hoori, love the cultural bits they provide.\nPlus Masaomi himself, as a good Yuzusoft MC, has real charm, and does not feel constrained by his tropes. He really grows during the story, and has some great dynamics with all the characters, making you cheer for him.\n\nAll of this, to the beat of some nice, relaxing music, neatly dressed up with some proper classic Japanese musical instruments that truly give of the vibe a town with its haunted mountain should have.\n\nI seriously wish this game got an anime adaptation. Its tale is easier to bring to anime than Sabbat of the Witch\u2019s (less\u2026 risqu\u00e9 scenes to worry about). It has all the right pieces, even if they adapt the story to only follow the \u201ctrue path\u201d. But if they go the Yosuga no Sora route and adapt all the heroine routes in true Vn fashion\u2026 THAT would be interesting.\nSo yeah, I highly recommend it. Does not matter if you are a fan of VNs or not. Good tale. Accessible for everyone.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? The +18 patch content? Yeah, get it if you want from Nekonyan.

As of writing this, I have only done the common route and some of Mako's route.\n\nThe character designs and the art style of the game is gorgeous. There is only one character design that I do not like but that's only because of my preference to anime characters and is irrelevant in this review but I really hate how they make Lena that one big tiddy foreign girl who doesn't know what's going on until it's needed. Other than that, every character, even the men in the game, have good character design. I especially love Roka's design and if I had to choose the best male character in the game, the MC's grandpa is the first one that comes to mind. He reminds me of that cool and badass grandpa in shonen anime and I love those type of characters like the Third Hokage from Naruto, or Whitebeard from One Piece. I love Roka's design because she literally has all the qualities of a good house wife. I do hate the fact that I need to finish one of the main routes first before going to her route because I was looking forward to her route the moment I first saw her. \n\nThe story is pretty decent. It's about a shrine maiden who was cursed and the MC has to save the day that's all I can say without spoiling it.\n\nThe ecchi scenes on this game is AMAZING (in my standards and my standards are down bad... I mean down low). I don't know if there are moving scenes in this game as I have not completed a main route yet but the way The voice actors get into character when the scenes are in the heat of the moment is really good, dare I say its even better than some actual hentai out there.\n\nI don't really know what else to write in a review but all in all, I'll give this an 9/10. It's pretty good but I don't know if I would want to do all of the routes as it feels like you already know what will happen after doing one route (beside the 2 extra routes of course).\n\nI'll add one of those check list in the future if I finish the game properly (meaning when I get to finish Roka's route).", "timestamp_created": 1644917260, "timestamp_updated": 1644917260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109902679": {"recommendationid": "109902679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062665965", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5064, "last_played": 1694161418}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best romance VNs I've ever read.

Guess I'm just playing the devil's advocate.\n\ntldr - It's not a bad game by any means. But despite the game's beautiful setting and music, I personally don't think Senren Banka meets my expectations enough to recommend it due to its poor character and story immersion.\n\nYuzusoft usually does great at making cute romantic stories. Senren Banka is no exception to this. However, it's exactly that and not much more despite its amazing potential. In comparison to other Yuzusoft titles, Senren Banka has the most interesting premise in its lore and story, but probably the worse execution in telling it which greatly impacts its ability to immerse its audience.\n\nInstead of using the setting and allowing us to immerse more into its characters and world, the main story feels more like a simple blockade of boring fight scenes and out-of-place fan service that we have to forcibly read through in order to enter each heroine route. Many of the individual routes themselves also come off as questionable. This is because they basically consist of awkward romantic developments in the form of unnaturally horny and cheesy character interactions that further pulls us away from any sort of seriousness in the narrative that was established. Considering how long and slow the main story line is before we even get to the individual character routes, the main story tricks us into thinking there will be some kind of deeper lore to help develop our character relationships, which unfortunately there really isn't. By the time I even finished the common route, I couldn't help but think about how bland and shallow everything was and many times I felt like dropping it. It ultimately lead to me having little to no urge to pursue some individual heroine routes because I didn't find them interesting enough. I suppose this could just be me expecting too much. After all, this is a Yuzusoft game; They aren't particularly well known for creating deep stories.\n\nSenren Banka also suffers from a much poorer cast dynamic in comparison to its other Yuzusoft titles. In terms of the cast, its difficult to pin-point what I felt went wrong. While all heroines and side characters feel great in representing their individual personalities, there seems to be an issue when you put them together. Unlike other Yuzusoft titles, Senren Banka lacks any sort of solid relationship between the heroines and other characters outside of the MC in order to establish a strong and compelling group dynamic. It feels harsh to say, but some characters are just completely irrelevant and meaningless to the overall story due to their relationship and poor screen time with other characters. There's not enough development or meaningful interactions from some characters to justify them being there in the first place and it wouldn't be an oversight to say that some characters, if removed from the story, would have no impact on the main cast or story narrative at all. \n\nTo explain how I feel: Imagine watching your typical anime or show that takes place in a setting with multiple people in the background. You see the main characters having an important discussion, and suddenly one of the background characters walk up and starts talking to the main characters mid-conversation, while contributing nothing to said conversation. You scratch your head confused, wondering why they're even there in the first place and later on you kind of forget they even existed. That's the usual gist of some conversations and it's basically wasted time.\n\nYou can argue that this could just be due to the story's setting, as all of our characters aren't naturally forced together; like in a school or a club room. But nevertheless, its kind of a shame, as I feel Yuzusoft games usually excel at character to character dynamics and having them all play a part in the story.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I'd say Senren Banka is on the lower end of Yuzusoft visual novels. I would still recommend this for people who simply want to turn their brain off and enjoy a cute romantic comedy with a rural Japanese setting. For people looking for more or expecting quality similar to other Yuzusoft titles, I personally don't think Senren Banka matches up to them due to the reasons stated above. So, I find it hard to recommend this if you've already read the others.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nEDIT (2/12/2022): So, I convinced myself to finish all the routes despite losing interest and dropping the game for a bit. For reference, I had only finished Mako's, Yoshino's, and Murasame's routes when I initially decided to drop and review the game. I have to say, I enjoyed Lena's route quite a bit, as the narrative in her route is far more enjoyable in terms of the story and romantic development. Her route explores and expands much deeper into the plot and also allows us to have the entire cast coming together more often, much to my pleasure, as opposed to the other heroine routes having most of the cast seemingly disappear for the majority of the story.\n\nHowever, my previous negative points still stand so I won't be changing my mind on keeping this a thumbs down. Roka's and Koharu's routes didn't present anything special to me either, as expected from side characters who rarely had screen time in the common route.

That being said from the very get go i was engrossed, from the masterfully executed music and the smart witty banter that had me cracking up multiple times throughout, there was never a dull moment. The in game menu provides a helpful flow chart that lets you see the choices you chose and the part of the story you are at, which lets you jump to any point in the story giving easy access to parts you might want to revisit. The characters in Senren Banka are crafted in a way that really emphasises the big moments in the story, sharing dialogue that feels meaningful only helped by being performed by some amazing voice actors that only enhances your immersion. In total the route i played took around 19 hours to finish which as a new comer was a manageable length never stretching interactions out longer than they need to be while at the same time never rushing important and memorable moments. As this was my first experience into Visual novels I was cautious of starting one as from the outside looking in they can seem intimidating to get into, however after finishing what i have of the story i am only ready to dive into the other routes and start the whole experience all over again.

At first I played the free version, but I liked it so much that I decided to purchase it. I have no regrets at all, in fact I highly recommend it.\n\nI can't give a very in-deep opinion given my lack of experience and others VNs to compare it with. But overall (completed 3 of the routes so far), I feel all the characters are likeable, the pacing of the story is good (doesn't feel too slow nor rushed), the BGMs are good and the artworks are stunning.\n\nThe plot in itself isn't particularly original, it's basically \"average dude moves from city to a small country village, becomes sort of a chosen hero and gets surrounded by cute girls in the process\". The game does a good job at establishing an interesting setting and cast of characters though.\n\nIf you are looking for a cool VN to read and relax after a tiresome day, I recommend Senren Banka. I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed this VN, it made me put off other games, anime and books because I just wanted so much to go on with the story.\n\nIn the future I am looking forward reading other Yuzusoft games, particularly Sabbat of the Witch.", "timestamp_created": 1630888472, "timestamp_updated": 1650220399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610752344131469727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98824157": {"recommendationid": "98824157", "author": {"steamid": "76561199179200233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2047, "last_played": 1631290506}, "language": "english", "review": "Mako best girl", "timestamp_created": 1630841289, "timestamp_updated": 1630841486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460526347160339355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98021417": {"recommendationid": "98021417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048130638", "num_games_owned": 785, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 6572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5407, "last_played": 1630077122}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the better romance comedy VN, with a dash of plot.

Among these, one in particular, the small town near the mountains called Hoori, where our young protagonist, the student Masaomi will live in the inn managed by his grandfather, after his mother's \"gentle\" suggestion of spending time with his grandparents. When the protagonist arrives in the city, he is received by his cousin, the small and calm pink-haired Kurama, in addition to his childhood friends, the womanizer Rentarou and the young Maniwa, who are always ready to help and offer to show the city to the protagonist ^ ^\n\nThe first stop for the group is at the city's sanctuary, where the legend says the legendary katana Murasame waits embedded in a stone for someone worthy to wield it again. Innocently, the group decides to try to draw the sword, everyone fails until Masaomi's turn, who, concentrating and using all his strength, ends up breaking the katana into two parts. While waiting for his punishment to be decided, Masaomi is visited by a small girl with green hair who goes by the same name as the broken sword, Murasame. She claims to be the guardian of the sword, repairs it with magic, and tells Masaomi he was chosen. After the adults know that he is the chosen one, the young man's life completely changes, because as he is the bearer of the katana, now he has to marry the daughter of the priest, the beautiful and slightly sulky Yoshino, while trying to not make her angry, because her maid Mako, while a good cook and full of \"pure\" insinuations, is a trained ninja too! And so begins the protagonist's first crazy day in this small town. ^^\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\nAfter the madness of the first day, we are gradually introduced to each of the 6 girls in this small village. Tomotake Yoshino is the first to stand out because of her arranged wedding to the bearer of Murasame. She is friendly, with long white hair, and despite refusing the protagonist and having opposite tastes to him at first, with the passage of time she starts to open up. Still in the same residence, we have Hitachi Mako, the kind housekeeper responsible for cooking and cleaning, but also a ninja trained in all kinds of techniques with a sharp tongue more dangerous than any weapon. Her only weakness? Being afraid of heights. Lena Liechtenauer, a foreigner who loves everything related to the culture of Japan, always wants to learn more including improving her Japanese pronunciation, but be careful not to leave anything \"pure\" near her, because if she sees it, her face will be redder than a tomato! Maniwa Roka, childhood friend of the protagonist and great connoisseur of the city and its sights, along with little Kurama Koharu, cousin of the protagonist who is always willing to help. Completing the group we have the literally ever-present Murasame, the spirit of the sword that follows the protagonist everywhere, who curiously fears ghosts despite being a spirit herself. With six different girls, it remains to be seen which route the story will continue. ^^ \n\n[h1]Art & sound[/h1]\nWith beautiful art made by the Yuzusoft studio, the same one that made Sabbat of the Witch, throughout the story we are given beautiful art for both the characters and the scenarios, full of details, including some very funny expressions of the characters you can see again in the gallery after completing the first route. Along with art, we have the pleasant and relaxing soundtrack that never fails to make me relax, including Japanese voices for all characters with the exception of the protagonist, including in the \"pure\" moments. ^^\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nProduced by Yuzusoft Studio and translated by NekoNyan Ltd. Studio, Senren * Banka, a funny and hilarious story of our young protagonist, who in less than 24 hours after arriving in the city of Hoori sees his life totally change thanks to a katana, making him now one of the protectors of the city, at the same time that he has to keep going to school and try to survive his new life together with the heiress of the sanctuary, in an adventure full of fun and exciting moments whose ending, and the girl with whom he will end up, depends entirely on the player's choices ^^", "timestamp_created": 1627874423, "timestamp_updated": 1677549927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648556768894195557", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96714067": {"recommendationid": "96714067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2378, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1627830726}, "language": "english", "review": "Visual novel.

The action/fantasy element was better integrated than RJ but SW used theirs better.\n\nSetup for Linux Users: https://www.protondb.com/app/1144400#g9XIyrD4fn . For some reason it's the roughest to setup of all the Yuzusoft titles on Steam and Steam Overlay doesn't work half the time for me. YMMV ofc based on your system.\n\nLike the RJ and SW, it has a \"What we want,\" theme to the story and a sub-theme for a specific subject. If RJ was focused on the subject of \"Secrets,\" and SW was focused on \"Communication,\" then SB is \"Family and that is what routes revolve on.\n\nRoute order wise, I recommend going Mako > Yoshino > Murasame > Lena. Weirdly Yoshino's route isn't the most wider-plot relevant or even the longest like how Ayase's route has the most plot points in it and Nene's route is worth two routes. I like the treatment of the mini routes here, Koharu and Roka sharing a \"common\" route that diverges based on who you choose so unlike the other Yuzusoft mini routes, it has more meat to it. You can play them as a snack in between the main routes.\n\nYoshino was OK IMO. Out of the 3 Yuzusoft games I've played, she's the least interesting main heroine. She's the typical Yuzusoft main heroine; most popular girl, has a bit of a chip on her shoulder, has some secrets, and under some stressful circumstances related to the main plot. Her plot has the closest relation to \"family\" - it's okay, not great, not bad.\n\nMako is the resident lewd girl of the game - she has 6 lewd scenes (though 2 of those are mini ones), two more than the others. Her route is kinda a rehash of Yoshino's and a sneak peak to Lena's route. Pretty much the reason I like her route is because once she became independent and accepted herself, she gets pretty lewd and I like lewd girls.\n\nA version of Murasame's route is implied to happen after all the other routes. Her route is the one with the most feels as it concerns the weight of being a 500 years old ghost that couldn't be touched. I like that she's very proactive about her romantic interest. Outside of that, her non-romantic subplot concerns the future of the village, and I'd assume a version of it always happens in the other routes.\n\nBefore I get to Lena, I wanna talk about the other stuff first.\n\nRoka and Koharu was okay. Koharu has a really cute design and mannerism but honestly that's the only thing she had going for her - I'm startig to see a pattern in the type of character that gets the Yuzusoft mini route treatment. Roka though? She makes me want more older ladies heroines - she has a job, she has her own dreams and goals, she has some good conversations and her own insecurities, it's all done pretty well despite how short it was that I wish we could just slash Koharu for more Roka.\n\nEngine is always the industry gold standard - we now have flowchart system and only a few UX thing left to be ironed out. I wish this is the industry standard as this polish is part of why I got so into Yuzusoft stuff recently - it's just the most friction free VN reading I ever had.\n\nMusic was okay. I wish they leaned more on the traditional Japan aspect as the most unique BGMs are the ones that leaned more into it. The leitmotif was good thougha and the OP was pretty much the best too - though it's a shame that the 18+ patch doesn't decensor the Steam version's OP.\n\nArt was good and memorable, though the character design was just okay for me. The uniform design was cool though - mustn't have been easy because it was a mix of multi-layer colorful traditional Japanese clothing and what passes as a 'uniform' but I'm glad they leaned into it because it does contributed the aesthetic it has.\n\nThe lewds was meh. It was a disappointment coming from SB's which has better interaction that I can get really into it. I think it was still better than most of RJ's lewds and at least it doesn't feel tacked on or get in the way of the plot, but after the first one it does felt like it's just to fill quota.\n\n\n\nI think that's all to speak aside for Lena. So, anyway, I think Lena is best girl and my favorite Yuzusoft heroine. And I'm going to explain why in the spoilers.\n\nThey really managed to nail the mix of foreign values and her adjusting to the environment she's in, to make a pretty unique character. Yes, there is some foreigner stereotypes put into it as well, but it's fine as it doesn't feel they're going beyond anything that is in good fun.\n\nOh nevermind that she's not some American or English foreigner - she's a Scandinavian (Finland I think) who went to Japan alone and for a job and exchange program in boonies because of her love for the culture. Her problem with Japanese phrases is understandable in the Japanese version as it was usually just one syllable off from what she meant to say, like \"okotta\" and \"nokotta\", an understandable confusion. At the same time, it doesn't prevent her from expressing herself and she's actually pretty fluent in the language too aside for those understandable contextual issues.\n\nShe's pretty much the most expressive character in the entire game - even the main character remarking that watching her watch movies is like watching four people's worth of expressions. At the same time, she's no simple emotional girl - if anything, she has the most sense and sensitivity of the heroines.\n\n[spoiler]Her route is the only one where you didn't win by just fighting. No, she's so sensitive that she could sense the pain behind the cursed spirit's existence, and it allowed her to empathize with it without being swallowed by its taint.\n\nIn fact, it's amazing that without even knowing anything about the myths of dreams and food in underworld, she could feel that something was off from the dream she was trapped in. When pointed out as to the danger she could be in, she readily risks herself for her friends, and  when the MC stated that he will take responsibility for her, she remarked that she doesn't like the idea of the MC \"taking responsibility for her\" because it removes her agency to make a choice and bear its results and as they are in a relationship, it should be that they both take responsibility for each others.\n\nShe then proceeds to remove the MC's worry by showing him that no matter what happens they are connected under one sky and demonstrate it by having a video call with her family, showing that even if they can feel lonely at times, they will always be connected. It was enough that the MC then take the initiative of talking to his own family.\n\nShe managed to solve most of the issues, including the problem with tourism and what the village can do going forward, and IIRC only in her epilogue that it's mentioned that Murasama had her thing happen as well - which implied a lot - and even returned the cursed spirit into a guardian deity that is honored by the family and the village as they find out about the entire history of the curse.\n\nEven the cursed spirit was taken by her as he makes her play the role of its sister, a goddess, as it shows the entire history of the curse which was only teased in Mako's route. Even the antagonist puts her on goddess tier! And she deserves it, not just for her character.[/spoiler]\n\nI'm not usually into big breasts character but that is no mere big breasts - nay, those are embodiment of dreams and hopes on its own. The way it accentuate her plain work clothes, the way it stretches the cute \"Oh, Fujiyama\" print on her casual shirt, how it gets the strap of her bag stuck in the middle in her first appearance, even when it was more covered by the underclothes in her casual kimono the covered side-boobs still attracted attention, the way she had to admit that the cardigan wouldn't fit her breasts, and how it displayed her uniform tie which is stuck in the middle to mounds of hopes and dreams and just catches your attention.\n\n\nSo!

At least the other characters are kind of good, exploring their routes was kind of fun, except when the game pulls you out of their side stories and forces you to read the main story. The romance on the other hand had no impact on me, mostly because I found it very lacking.\n\nMost of the story is spent trying to solve the mystery as to why the town is cursed, which boiled down to the protagonist and his friends fighting the evil spirits (multiple times in the same locatiton) and collecting their shards since it served as a key to uncover it, what sucks is that it constantly shows the protagonist having multiple very boring training arcs where he slowly becomes stronger and once they actually beat the spirits they show them going to the towns doctor so she can inspect the pieces, every single time.\n\nThe choices are just there so you can get laid by one of the girls (including the protagonist cousin), there's no risk of anything bad happening to you or the characters.\n\nThe reason for the main villain to curse the town was just out of some generic vengeance.\n\nMusic was mostly not my thing, since most of the music is centralized around the traditional Japanese music genre.\n\nI would only kind of recommend to buy the game on sale for the characters if you are interested in them and not for the main story since I personally found it boring, even though I forced myself to finish the main story and Lena's route (which her route offers the most important parts of the main story). There are way better mystery visual novels out there like Steins Gate and Danganronpa series, and if you want a good romance visual novel then just get Clannad.

Wonderful story with a great set of main and supporting characters. The characters are well done and consistent. The translations are pretty good. The navigation in the game makes it so much fast to replay or jump to a specific scene or choice. If you love a great story or this style of game this is a must own game. \n\n- -------\nStory - Great story and the backstory for the MC does a great job of creating a strong dynamic for the story to keep moving forward while allowing for some pretty funny moments to happen. The characters are consistent throughout and gel well together it really feels like you are joining this community. They did a great job working to get you to care for all the characters. The one thing that I really enjoyed much more than some other games they have done most of the characters routes have a big enough and unique story that make them feel like its not just a side route that means nothing the main plot of the \"cannon\" romance. \nArt - NekoNyan delivers on this area strongly as usual. Great design for the characters and their costumes. A nice blend of japanese traditional and other outfits that fit the story for the characters. The animations in the game do help to further enhance the art and they really do a great job. \nOverall - The quality of the game makes this an easy one to recommend if you have ever played and enjoyed any of their other titles its a must buy game. You will enjoy this one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1621473352, "timestamp_updated": 1621473352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91918746": {"recommendationid": "91918746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051434153", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5016, "last_played": 1671286091}, "language": "english", "review": "Yuzusoft game huh *instant buy*\n\nBTW i complete every route now (not count extra one) so ...\nroute i like the most is \nLena = Murasame > Yoshino > Mako \nit was a good read", "timestamp_created": 1620899440, "timestamp_updated": 1620899440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91744811": {"recommendationid": "91744811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107803034", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1644479224}, "language": "english", "review": "I just come for Murasame's route (\u5c0f\u96e8\u4e16\u4e00)\n", "timestamp_created": 1620615263, "timestamp_updated": 1620615263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612903177738189697", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91660976": {"recommendationid": "91660976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312357741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1621191905}, "language": "english", "review": "Likey Likey", "timestamp_created": 1620497467, "timestamp_updated": 1620497467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91511146": {"recommendationid": "91511146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133155257", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5553, "last_played": 1680826092}, "language": "english", "review": "Aya and Yoshino are precious\nAya and Yoshino life", "timestamp_created": 1620268813, "timestamp_updated": 1620271826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91471033": {"recommendationid": "91471033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182754150", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2451, "last_played": 1618405442}, "language": "english", "review": "Murasame best girl", "timestamp_created": 1620211910, "timestamp_updated": 1620211910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91351096": {"recommendationid": "91351096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158834479", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1037, "last_played": 1620067154}, "language": "english", "review": "Yoshino best girl", "timestamp_created": 1620045439, "timestamp_updated": 1620045439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91320893": {"recommendationid": "91320893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404663787", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 3506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2291, "last_played": 1649929237}, "language": "english", "review": "Another good game from Yuzusoft with great characters that feels like they are each an individual, though not very in depth.

There is a small menu in the bottom with some useful features such as quick save,quick load, skip backwards, skip forwards, go back to your last choice, settings, a backlog and more which are very useful in case you mess up and overclick a dialogue text. I only finished 1 route and i'm in the middle of another and it's very entertaining. My favorite character so far is Yoshino. This VN is very charming I find myself laughing at some of the interactions between the characters or their thoughts to themselves. Give it a try if this sounds promising to you!\n\nEdit: I can't stop humming the music from this at work every once in a while it's so catchy....

Since every route reveals different aspects of the backstory within this VN you'll actually feel a lot more motivated to go through all of the routes to learn everything you can. \nAs for the length of this VN... It's not really that different in terms of length when compared to Sabbat Of The Witch, however the hours you spend reading this are a lot more evenly distributed across different routes.\n\nThe UI has seen a substantial improvement when compared to Sabbat Of The Witch, with it feeling generally a lot more fluid and I actually found myself using gesture controls in this one. Flowchart makes it easier for you to change your choices made during the common route, allowing you to remold the decision path for a different route without the need to start the story from the beginning.\n\nSoundtrack is great and fits the atmosphere really well. Having classic Japanese music with a modern twist to it was certainly a unique experience and just makes me crave for an option to buy the entire soundtrack so much more. \n\nAs for the visuals? Stunning. The art style is the same as before but with another level of detail and deeper, more stunning colours. Also it's all in Full HD and I was comfortable reading this fullscreen on my 27\" 2K monitor without any issues. \n\nOverall an excellent VN, probably the best one I've read so far.

Sorta. That aside, I gave the previous title, Sabbat of the Witch, a barely passing grade. Thus my surprise when this game turned out to be absolutely amazing. The story is great, a touch Higurashi-ish, but I'm not complaining. While the previous was an obvious shallow dating sim that happened to have other elements, this game has a strong focus that also happens to have the dating aspect. The music is solid - very well done, and has a distinct eastern feel to it. The little details such as UI, options, etc., are well polished, and it has a convenient flowchart system. It's also supported in multiple languages and doesn't seem too difficult a read, so I look forward to practicing my chinese and japanese by rereading this.\n\nMy only real complaint is that there's no 'true route'. Through the various routes you learn a lot of unique aspects about the main focus of the story, but you never get a chance to put them all together and really solve the issue. \n\nOverall: great game.

Each heroine is unique, however, in their backgrounds and personalities, and their way of dealing with said curse. \n\nEach main heroine route reveals a different side of the curse, and so by reading all three you can get a better picture of the true nature of the curse and its history. As such, the heroines have different ways to deal with the curse, which matches their own personalities.\n\nThe three others deal with a different problem, as they have little to no connection to the curse (except for one, but it doesn't really count as it doesn't really deal with the curse). Because of this, their routes are considerably lighter than the three main ones, with a more slice of life feeling. \n\nEven so, each route is fun to read, The scenes are heartwarming and the comedy is great.\n\n[spoiler]Lena is the best route[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]Murasame is NOT a main heroine[/spoiler]\nIt's from nekonyansoft, so [spoiler]get the patch from nekonyansoft website[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1607084831, "timestamp_updated": 1607084831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81543427": {"recommendationid": "81543427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242420760", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 575, "last_played": 1655256857}, "language": "english", "review": "Pat pat pat :3", "timestamp_created": 1607023113, "timestamp_updated": 1607023113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81335391": {"recommendationid": "81335391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074903364", "num_games_owned": 2065, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4468, "last_played": 1687911803}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never written a review, nor did I care to until now.

I fell in love in the first couple of minutes\n\n- I have a 1080p monitor, and usually for VN's, if I play in fullscreen, the CG's start getting blurry, and I have to play it windowed in a lower resolution (which I hate). \n On the other hand, for this VN, you can easily play fullscreen without losing the CG quality.\n\n-The designs are gorgeous and every character is really charming, it's the first time I can say wholeheartedly \"I like every single character\" in a VN. And the best thing about it, is that you have none of that sh*tty rom-com troupe of the girls fighting over the MC.\n\n-It is one of those VN in which the more routes you play, the more you understand about the game, which normally, is kinda of bothersome (if you just play the routes for the girls you like), but on this one, I really enjoyed learning more about the world, and also, there weren't incongruencies you usualy see in VN's build this way\n\n-And if you are interested in the +18 aspect, I will say, the scenes are really good, as for the amount of H scenes with each girl, for the main 4 girls, is 3(with the exception of Mako who has 1 more CG in which she is playing with herself). For the other 2, it's 2. You then have the after story which  adds one more scene to every girl.\n If you are wandering how  long it takes to get to the H scenes, I will say it takes quite some time\n", "timestamp_created": 1604894330, "timestamp_updated": 1604894330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684326767921447754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78902722": {"recommendationid": "78902722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403982407", "num_games_owned": 1020, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 2166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1608403826}, "language": "english", "review": "While i dont like many visual novels this one was enjoyable to the end", "timestamp_created": 1604781356, "timestamp_updated": 1698373745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78741562": {"recommendationid": "78741562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157149577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7057, "last_played": 1604562156}, "language": "english", "review": "Yuzusoft never disappoints", "timestamp_created": 1604545225, "timestamp_updated": 1604545225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78622463": {"recommendationid": "78622463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020171012", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 2647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2647, "last_played": 1604361748}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good VN and since it's from Yuzusoft, it's fully voiced in Japanese and has both English and Japanese subs which allows me to use this as a studying Japanese tool. ^^\n\nThat said, Sabbat of the Witch is much better imho in every possible way.

I can't speak for the cut version as I have only played the uncut one.[/i]\n\nI'm going to keep this fairly short instead of doing a thorough review, but I've added some thoughts on various aspects of the game below if you want to dive deeper.\n\nI've enjoyed Senren*Banka and highly recommend checking this one out. The overall focus of the game is the curse of the town Hori, with the protagonist being an outsider thrown in and the four main heroines being related to or influenced by the curse in one way or another. \nWhile romance is a big focus in each of the four main heroine routes, all of them come with actual plot to explore (and extra \"plot\" if you have the patch installed). There are two additional routes (namely Koharu and Roka), but these are just an extra that do not tackle the core plot in any way.\n\nAll main heroines are very likable, some especially moreso once you enter their routes. Murasame is best girl tho.\n\nI've clocked in about 50 hours at the time of writing, but considering AFK time, occasional skipping, etc I would guess the actual read time to be at around 40-45ish hours.\n\nWithout further ado here are some notes about the game:\n\n[h1]Story, Routes and Recommended Play Order[/h1]\n\n[b]Minor (marked) spoilers in this section![/b]\n\nWhile the overall route order is not enforced and up for the player to decide, in my opinion some routes are better played before others as you can see below. \nEach route will have its main heroine as a romance focus but also some sort of sub-plot to deal with. Here are some notes about each route:\n\nYoshino's route explores the curse theme [spoiler]and the situation of the Tomotake family further. [/spoiler] This one feels like a natural continuation of the common route, and should be played first.\n\nMako's route tackles the curse theme from a different perspective, with more details on it following in Lena's route (Although you shouldn't play Lena's route first, see Lena's section). \nThe focus of the route is Mako herself and [spoiler] the problem of falling in and experiencing love. Since the theme doesn't go far beyond romance (which the other routes also have), it's the weakest route in my personal opinion. [/spoiler] \nIf you aren't playing Yoshino first, this one works as a first route too.\n\nLena's route answers a lot of questions that come up in both Mako's and Yoshino's route, [spoiler] while also resolving the curse problem in a manner that feels like a \"true\" ending to the curse itself. [/spoiler] Whether this one or Murasame's is the actual \"true\" route is up for debate.\nSince Yoshino, Mako and Lena routes focus heavily on the curse you should do this route after reading the other two.\n\nMurasame's route shifts the focus from cleansing the curse to its aftermath instead, [spoiler]with Murasame herself now being simply a ghost without any duties and the town facing the economical impact of losing one of the main attrations for tourists.[/spoiler]\nSimilar to Mako's route the focus here is on Murasame herself, with the main difference being Murasame's special circumstances (her being a spiritual being and the caretaker of Murasamemaru and all). This one can be played at any time, although playing it later will probably be more satisfying. \nAs I said before either this one or Lena's route can be considered the \"true\" route of the game.\n\nKoharu/Roka duo-route is a bonus route that splits into two mini routes for each sub-heroine towards the end. Both routes are fairly unrelated to the initial common route plot and focus entirely on [spoiler]the cafe and the related girls.[/spoiler]\nYou can play this route at any point (although you need to clear any main route first in order to unlock it), but if you aren't interested in either of them you can safely skip them.\n\nAs such my recommended play order would be Yoshino > Mako > Lena > Murasame, with Koharu and Roka tossed in anywhere inbetween.\n\n[h1] Art and Sound Impressions [/h1]\nThe game features roughly 10 beautiful event CG with an additional 4 H-Scenes for each heroine. The count is a little on the low side, however there's lots of cute chibi SD art to make up for it.\nThe liberal use of character sprites during regular scenes also helps to alleviate this issue. It's impressive how lively a character can turn out if you let them change sprites even multiple times during the same voice line, even if there aren't all that many pose and face variants.\n\nThe soundtrack is great too, with a theme befitting the village Hori. Each heroine also has their own theme in both a normal and more intimate variation, as well as their own ED song. The regular songs while playing shine the most though.\n\nOverall voice acting is great too with all non-protagonist voice lines fully voiced. \nSome heroines like to get loud as they become flustered though, so an option to limit the discepancy between whispering and shouting would have been nice (to be fair, there is an integrated quick-access sound slider in the chat box to mitigate this). This is only a little gripe though.\n\n[h1] Technical Stuff [/h1]\n\nAs mentioned before this version is a porn-free release, with a free patch available from their official website. Installing the patch doesn't break anything on the steam-side of things, so big thumbs up here. \nThere are some scenes that will be foggy or censored in other ways to hide naked bodies, but it doesn't affect the overall experience of the core story. Whether you should use the patch or not is entirely up to personal preference.\n\nThe game runs in a native 1080p window, but scales just fine up to 1440p when applying fullscreen. The window can be freely resized (while still maintaining aspect ratio), but there is no easy way to reset it to its native 1080p resolution once you do so. Swapping between window mode and fullscreen can be done smoothly on the fly, and thanks to the \"panic button\" minimize feature you can easily mute and pop the game into the background while multitasking. (Even if the feature isn't quite intended that way) \n\nThe \"Flowchart\" feature, combined with a powerful backlog that allows jumping between scenes, voice-lines and even previewing backgrounds while browsing makes it especially easy to navigate to your next route or favourite scene. This is also very handy for completionists. It would be great if this became a standard for visual novels going forward.\nThere's also a voice-line bookmark feature. This is a niche feature but I found myself using it for funny moments, so I'm glad it was included, but I can't see many players using it.\n\nThere's also a lot of customizability in the game's settings menu that I would like to see in many visual novels going forward. Things like your typical text size, speed as well as background and read-text colors, but also other things like auto-skipping, BGM balance split for voice lines and mouse gestures. \nFull customization of the chatbox bar and mouse gestures, as well as a touch-UI option for streaming to a phone makes for a very enjoyable reading experience.\n\nIn the game's \"Extra\" section (namely the Gallery) you'll find unlocked CG and music, as well as a Scene select for H-Scenes and a Sprite Mode. The Sprite Mode allows you to put characters in your preffered poses on the background of your choice. Nice feature to have, although I've personally only used it to review character outfits.", "timestamp_created": 1599151143, "timestamp_updated": 1606331667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812604427337646484", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75212017": {"recommendationid": "75212017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152308686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 4772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4772, "last_played": 1598542138}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Playtime 60-70 hours (Completed All Routes + All Sub routes + All Achievements + CG 100%).\n+ 4 Heroines + 2 Sub Heroines routes to play (Murasame is the best).\n+ Good story, lovely characters, beautiful CG backgrounds and soundtracks.\n+ I love how they used Shamisen playing in the OP song.

It either got resolved during the common route or it expanded on certain character routes, this is a huge plus. Speaking of which, each of the main 4 routes (Yoshino, Mako, Murasame, Lena) were super good. All had something different to offer, all of them had some very memorable moments and genuine surprises. Not to say I didn't enjoy the side routes which felt like a seperate common route, splitting into two choices at the end (Roka and Koharu).\n\nAnother big thing is, that while the story was set up in a way that Yoshino is definitely the main choice, the game never forced me to actually pick her (like how in Sanoba Witch it kinda didn't really make a lot of sense to pick anyone else than Nene). Every girl had a fairly even chance, I never felt like the game truly ever showed heavy favoritism towards Yoshino. Truly intimate moments with the girls (which actually had any meaning) only show up on their respective routes. I don't know if character favoritism is a thing in previous Yuzusoft games, but even if it isn't, I feel like this is at least somewhat important.\n\nI really liked the character development, especially with Yoshino and Murasame. It was such a heartwarming experience to see them change throughout the story, becoming much more free and open people. It was well written and well acted.\n\nThe MC is very likeable and relatable. Sure he's a bit exaggerated, but I think it was the healthiest thing to do in this game's case.\n\nThe music was also great, I liked most of the tracks in the game.\n\nNow for the routes:\n\n[b]Yoshino[/b]: When I completed this route, I felt super emotional with my teary eyes and felt like it was one of the most fulfilling story I've ever read. You know the writing is good when all the feels suddenly hit you, and hit you hard. While I felt like some important pieces were missing, the story still felt complete to me.\n\n[b]Mako[/b]: While I think her's was the weakest of the 4 routes, I'd stay it was still \"good\" if not anything else. It was nice to see Mako's viewpoint, her cute quirks and weaknesses and just generally getting to know her better. I think it just simply lacked some of the impact Yoshino's route had if I had to pick on something.\n\n[b]Murasame[/b]: For whatever reason, I didn't have a lot of expectations regarding her route, but I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought I would. Since in her case almost everything was resolved during the common route, it lacked some tension... or at least I first thought. While the outcome became fairly obvious soon and lost that impact quickly, I liked it for what it was. Oh BOY Masaomi was an absolute BADASS in this route. I could feel my beard growing from all that testosterone and manliness.\n\n[b]Lena[/b]: Seriously, was this the canon route or what? We got to know a LOT more... and I mean A LOT more information about the main story (curse, the past, etc.) in this route than in Yoshino's, which hid a lot of the finer details. As far as the routes themselves goes, there is no competition, this one's the best. It involves the other characters a lot more as well, not like in other routes where most of the other characters become more or less side characters. Here, everyone gets together while Lena still remains in the focus, as she should. Someone mentioned here that Lena might be secretly the main girl and I kinda agree.\n\nAs for the characters themselves:\n\n[b]Yoshino[/b]: I absolutely loved Yoshino. She goes through the most changes in a positive way, while her charming quirks still remain. Her change felt super genuine and not forced. She was also cute as heck.\n\n[b]Mako[/b]: I didn't feel particularly attached to Mako, but she's a more than fine character nonetheless. Her story was interesting and she showed that she's a lot more vulnerable than she lets on.\n\n[b]Murasame[/b]: I usually don't like the loli archetype, mostly because I find their personalities and voices annoying, not in her case. She was an absolute sweetheart and her VA did an amazing job so that she'd feel genuine instead of being annoying. Very fun personality.\n\n[b]Lena[/b]: Did you say positivity? Again, did I hear you saying POSITIVITY? Sure that's not all there's to it, but I absolutely adored Lena and felt like that she might as well be the main heroine. Of course she wasn't perfect or invulnerable, but she was definitely the most honest and genuine girl out of all of them right from the getgo. She was also the funniest girl, no contest there. I'm pretty sure if you outright hate Lena you're a bad person.\n\n[b]Roka[/b]: Like, holy hell she looks hotter than the hottest sun in the universe. I usually don't talk about how characters look, but damn that's DEFINITELY an attractive 2D character. I don't especially like the \"Onee-san\" archetype, but in this case, it was never overplayed or was overused. Her personality felt unique and very fun, I wish she was one of the main heroines. At least you can romance her so I can't complain too much.\n\n[b]Koharu[/b]: With Mako, I didn't feel very attached to Koharu, but at the same time I had no issues with her. She was really cute, but that's all there's to it in my case.\n\nI had an absolute blast playing this.

difficult one. Did I regret reading this? No. But I had my own reasons for sticking with it, like practising my Japanese, and an academic interest in Japan in general, and visual novels as a form of Japanese popular culture in particular. Did I like it? On balance, yes, but the same caveat applies, with the addition that some of what I liked probably did not survive the translation. Did I buy the soundtrack? Another yes. But the question is, would I recommend this, and I honestly don't know to whom I would.\n\nIf you're new to visual novels, surely there are better and more beginner-friendly options.\nIf you have a few under your belt, chances are you'll find it mediocre, and who has time for that?\nIf you're a veteran you've no need of my recommendation, one way or the other.\n\nFWIW, a lot of what I liked -- the soundtrack, art, setting, and world-building -- can be fully experienced in the free trial.

The main story was engaging enough, and each character's route diverged quite a bit rather than \"same event but different person.\"  The artwork was cute, colorful, and attractive, and although the girls tended toward large chests it wasn't as pronounced as for example Wagamama High Spec.\n\nThe voice acting was a delight.  The voices were well-done and expressive.  Each of the characters had unique speech patterns and affectations, from Mako's \"choppiri\" and Murasame's \"wagahai\" to Lena's \"tatami-gami.\"  The completely adorable voice failures were superbly bookmark-able as well.\n\nThe writing was mostly good.  While there were parts I wish they'd done differently such as the infrequent occasions where main character Masaomi was a jerk, overall it didn't leave much room to gripe.\n\nThat leaves the ever-looming elephant in the room, Localization.  The localization was solidly mediocre: I've seen better, I've seen worse, and most of the time it got the job done, but it was also inconsistent, ranging from a faithful re-telling to creative fan-fiction.  The localization lacked the feeling of overall consistency and direction characteristic of a top-tier localization, with the same phrases used in the same contexts localized differently at different times.  Lena's route provides perhaps the best and worst examples of this, where some of her catastrophic Japanese failures are explained clearly while other renderings are completely head-scratching.  In other places the translator didn't even try, for example turning \"It's my first time enveloped in such soft fluffiness\" into \"I'm getting a lap pillow.\"\n\nFortunately, the game engine provides bilingual subs, so when I was dissatisfied I could read the original myself [spoiler]especially in the R-18 scenes unlocked by the publisher patch, which tended into the head-scratching realm[/spoiler].\n\nSenren * Banka is not the deepest or most emotionally moving or twisted or surprising or beautiful or captivating but the content is good and there is a lot of it.  The pacing worked perfectly for shorter reading sessions when I'm home from work or between doing other things.  I see no reason to discourage buying it, and if you have any questions the free demo should let you know if you'd like it or not.\n\nI was looking forward to completing the game so I could move on to others, but the feeling of completion is bitter-sweet: \n It's been a long time since I wasn't playing Senren * Banka, and I'm going to miss hearing everyone's voices now that I'm all done.", "timestamp_created": 1592154789, "timestamp_updated": 1592154789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563876688480377197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70743808": {"recommendationid": "70743808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353451140", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6471, "last_played": 1672534993}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this.

A leisure read that does not weight down too much on your conscience, but also does not leave that big of a memorable souvenir in your mind either. It could be judged as something 'too average' and 'too cliche', but we all know that sometimes we just want to blast through a feel-good read and enjoy a heartwarming average story. [Senren\uff0aBanka] scratches that of itch pretty well.\n\n[b] Design: 8/10 [/b]\n\nThe strongest part. Nothing much to critique about this, as everything is almost how it should be as Yuzusoft's game. There are some problem with proportion on some of the CGs, but to my non-artistic untrained eyes, I do not see that much of errors. The cast are designed very attractively, as well as the sprites and SD sprites, which constitute the standard charm of most modern VNs. \n\n[b] Story: 5.0/10 [/b]\n\nIn my opinion, the weakest aspect of the whole. I have not read many recent VNs lately, but it seems that the one that I did (post 2015) focused too much on each story segments and neglect to seemlessly connects common route to character routes in a seemless, coherent manner. A lot of stuff happens during the common route and the narrative there is quite enjoyable, while most of the characters' arcs were almost too bland and cliche to the point of being almost a filler. I almost felt like I have finished reading the whole story after the common route ends and there was no need to read any further. There are some routes that are exceptions, in which the narrative from the common route continues to be relevant throughout, but most of them hardly ever answer the questions set in the common route. This really kills the urge to replay the VN after finishing everything.\n\nAnother disappointing aspect to the story is that everything feels too \"optimistic\". The situation dealt a god-like hands to our cast almost all the time, and I felt almost no tension from the scenes in which other VNs with tense situation would keep me on edge (I am talking to you, Kara no Shoujo). I felt that the character does not have things 'at stakes' despite the situation portrayed them to do so, and that made the story felt too bland on the serious side despite having serious tone of lore with Japanese mythical curses, gods, and legend.\n\n[spoiler] Story enjoyment: Lena > Murasame >> Mako >>>>>> Yoshino \n- Yes, most of us played the Yoshino arc first, and after finished every arc I was really annoyed by the fact that Yoshino route meagerly, if not least, contributed to the lore of the medium and cursed spirit despite being the priestess route.\n- On the other hand, even without a proper elaboration to the curse and the medium, Murasame's arc was the only one who shed light on what eventually happen to Murasame after the end of the curse, while other route completely, or almost completely, forgot about her existence altogether. \n- Lena's arc was the reason I gave story score about 5 (average), as I like the symbolism that played there with \"The local problem of a conservative, traditional community solved by a pair of outsiders who turned to be the one who care the most\". If only there was a ceremony to enshrine Murasamemaru back like in Murasame's arc, Lena's arc would be almost perfect. [/spoiler]\n\n[b] Character & Development: 6/10 [/b]\n\nThis pains me the most as there is a lot of potential here, and at one point it almost able to break through the filter of infamous Japanese tropes. What I like about characters in this VNs is that almost all of them started with their own specific archetypes, but later on show several signs that they have other layers in which they could feel like a legit natural character in non-Japanese media. However, those signs quickly dissipates as the common route reaches climax and became almost non-existent during character arcs. Character's portrayal also tends to fluctuate a lot during the latter part, when they either goes in circle or revert back and forth between their developed and undeveloped part. Which makes me grit my teeth in pain for such a missed opportunity to perfection.\n\nAll negatives aside, I actually quite enjoyed the (existed) character growth in most of the routes, and the attempt to make several characters cross their archetype, although not 100% succeeded, was charming and refreshing for me. (like in figurative sense, The Coo-dere does not remain only as one, while the annoying small char does not remain annoying or loud throughout.)   \n\n[spoiler] Character enjoyment: Murasame = Yoshino >> Lena > Mako > The Childhood Friends\n- Murasame and Yoshino received most of the chances to break through their old archetype to become a well-round attractive character with a sense of their former self left as little spice. Although I would slightly rate Murasame a bit higher as her character arc has a much more fulfilling and fitting closure to the story aspect. \n- Mako was the one who I felt was the biggest missed opportunity I mentioned above[/spoiler]\n\n[b] Music and Voice acting: 7/10 [/b]\n\nMusic: Nothing too fancy, nothing horrible. The most proper term I could say here is \"fitting\". Everything goes very well with its rural Japanese aspect of the game.\n\nVA: I was prepared to be annoyed by some of the voices judging from the character design, however, everything turned out to be very pleasing. I was actually shocked how different the voice range of Yoshino were portrayed throughout the game, which kind of strange for her character archetype, but all in all, I enjoyed it quite a lot.\n\nVoice enjoyment: Yoshino >>>> Murasame > Mako > Childhood friends > Lena\n\n[b] Extra scenes: 8/10 [/b]\n\nYes, we all know why we are here, and I can say with confidence that this is has been done well and upto Yuzusoft's standard. \n\n\n[b] Summary [/b]\n\nDespite talking a lot about its flaws. I am by no mean saying that I do not enjoy this VN. Minus all the negative parts, it was a very comforting, leisure read with cute character design and good atmosphere. There are AAA quality visual novels out there, but sometimes, you just need something easy-reading, decent VN to pass the time. This is one of the top-quality of such type.\n-----------------------------------\n\nReviewed on: 7 May 2020\nHeliumHe", "timestamp_created": 1588874470, "timestamp_updated": 1589233916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68700547": {"recommendationid": "68700547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114623333", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2427, "last_played": 1686330030}, "language": "english", "review": "Good day to you fellow visual novel lover.

A+.  The art is gorgeous with tons of animated facial expressions. Music is catchy and doesn't overstay its welcome. Story is OK, but interesting enough to keep you engaged. Main girls all have unique aspects to them and grow as characters. MC is a cardboard box. Highly recommend for first time VN readers or those looking for a nice Slice of Life story, with some action and a bit of mystery.\n\nSenren Banka has H-scenes. I would recommend going to the official website to download the patch, if it interests you. \n\n\nMy main criticism is that the story is weak. It has a great setting and sets up a potentially interesting scenario, but doesn't deliver. The common route is generally very good, but it doesn't really go anywhere or expand on its ideas too well. Some of the girls routes are much better than others (although that's normal for many VN's) Masaomi is pretty weak as an MC. I feel like he has no distinct traits besides being a hard-worker and \"good guy\". I felt no connection with him at all.\n\n\nFavorite Routes In Order (Spoiler Free):\n\nLena - Felt like the true ending to me. Would recommend you do this one last, although honestly you can do the routes in any order. Loved the chemistry between these two the most. The story actually felt like it had a point, as it unveiled a lot of the mysteries of the curse. Her quirks were super adorable and I loved her VA. Overall, a very satisfying route.\n\nYoshino - This was my first route. I really like Yoshino's personality, and how she changed over the course of the story. I feel like some of her arc was a bit contrived and didn't feel natural, but overall I was satisfied with how it ended up. Easily had the best epilogue and \"After Story\". SO DAMN CUTE. Also had great h-scenes. *wink*\n\nMurasame - I liked Murasame as a character, but she felt more like a little sister or confidant to Masaomi, rather than a lover. (In my opinion!) I just couldn't really get behind their romance. I did find her character to be super interesting and a bit tragic. I will admit the ending was incredibly sweet and it makes me sad she might not be as happy in other routes.\n\nMako - This was the last route I completed, and also was the weakest. It had the weakest story aspects and was just 130% fluff and diabetes inducing scenes when Mako and Masaomi become a couple. (Not necessarily a bad thing, but it dragged on) The ending felt the least satisfying, as you learn barely anything about the curse. One positive of this route, was that it was hilarious. The dialogue at times had me cracking up more than any other route. \n\nRoka/Koharu - Extra, shorter routes. Both were cute in their own way. I think Roka deserved her own fully fleshed out route, but oh well. Koharu was forgettable, but Roka at least had an interesting story line. \n\n\nI would recommend you play Mako first, and Lena last. Yoshi and Murasame can be fit in however you like. (Same with Roka/Koharu) Although you can really just play it in any order and you'll still enjoy it. The story isn't THAT deep, but I feel like you'll get the most out of it this way.\n\nThanks for reading.

One of my most anticipated visual novels of the year. After the great showing that was Sabbat of the Witch back in 2018, NekoNyan returns to Steam with another Yuzusoft title. Not only did this game commemorate Yuzusoft's 10th anniversary, but it won numerous awards on the year of its release in Japan. As such, I was very excited to finally get to play it in English.\n\n[i]Note: Had to trim review to fit Steam's character limit, check video for full version![/i]\n\n[h2]Pros:[/h2]\n[list][*][b]Excellent art and music.[/b] Not only does the game run natively at 1080p (which is already rare for a visual novel), but it does so with some excellent character designs, high-quality CGs, and plenty of movement. In fact, it's not unusual for a character to go through three or four different facial expressions and/or poses when delivering just a single line. Couple that with the detailed character designs and CGs that perfectly match the game's traditional Japanese setting and you have quite the visual experience.\n\nThis extends into the game's audio, with Senren\uff0aBanka offering up both some nice voice acting and some really good background music. I wasn't impressed with the music in Sabbat of the Witch, so I honestly wasn't expecting the music here to be as good as it is. There's quite the assortment too, including slower piano tracks for the romantic scenes, high-energy electronic tracks for the game's action scenes,\u00a0and a bunch of tracks using traditional Japanese instruments to match the game's setting. In fact, I'd say about half of the game's music features the shamisen or koto in some form. It makes for a very nice overall soundtrack and the best I've seen from Yuzusoft thus far.\n\n[*][b]Great mix of fantasy/romance elements.[/b]\u00a0Despite how it looks, Senren\uff0aBanka is actually more of a fantasy story than it is a romance story. It takes place in this rural Japanese town cut off from most of society, features themes from Japanese mythology, and has both a priestess character and a sentient sword character (both with their own respective routes). It's a fantasy-heavy VN, but yet it manages to actually pull off some decent romance regardless.\n\nUnlike in Sabbat of the Witch, where the fantasy elements felt like an afterthought to the romance, Senren\uff0aBanka manages to find a really nice balance there. The romance gets enough focus that it still progresses in a reasonable manner, yet leaves room for the main story to fully develop.\u00a0And that main story isn't even that bad. Sure, it's nothing special, but it never grows too ambitious for its own good and doesn't overstay its welcome, making for a really good vessel for the romance bits.\n\n[*][b]Fun and likable characters.[/b] Here we have a cast of heroines that are not only decently developed writing-wise, but are quirky enough in their own right that it's kinda hard not to like them. You've got the shrine maiden who has a problem with cat ears that keep appearing on her head, a kunoichi who has sworn to protect said shrine maiden, a sentient sword spirit that is accidentally summoned by the game's protagonist, and a blonde exchange student that seems to only know how to speak old Japanese.\u00a0\n\nNone of these characters felt like they were introduced just to fill a specific trope, but rather felt like natural additions to the overall story. They each have some backstory related to the main narrative that you'll find out through their respective routes, routes that also develop said characters at the same time. They're fun to interact with and really carry the experience through the game's writing problems.\n\n[*][b]Cool flowchart feature.[/b] At any time during play, you can open said flowchart and see which choices led you where and which scenes you have and/or haven't read.\u00a0This makes it incredibly easy to get on the route you want and also eliminates the need for any sort of guide. (trimmed)\n\n[*][b]Plenty of configuration options.[/b] Senren\uff0aBanka really goes above and beyond what I would normally expect from a VN, setting the example for others to follow. (trimmed)[/list]\n\n[h2]Cons:[/h2]\n[list][*][b]Slow overall pacing.[/b]\u00a0The main problem I have with Senren\uff0aBanka's writing is just how slow it is. This is not one of those VNs where the common route is slow and the character routes pick up pace later nor one of those VNs with constantly shifting pacing. Senren\uff0aBanka\u00a0is just slow 100% of the time. Whether you're in the common route or in one of the game's many character routes, the pacing just never really changes. Don't get me wrong, I think a VN with slow pacing can be great, especially so because\u00a0most VNs suffer from writing issues caused by erratic pacing, but in Senren\uff0aBanka's case, it just makes everything feel dragged out.\n\nThis is a VN that stretches its story to the absolute limit, dragging out story scenes, giving overly wordy descriptions, and adding in a bunch of filler along the way. A story event that can maybe take half a day to resolve somehow takes several days to do so, with Murasame's route being the worst offender here. The characters carry the story to an extent, but it becomes very hard not to notice just how slow everything is, especially once you get into the character routes where major story developments usually happen. It really brings down the reading experience, making it difficult to read for more than a couple hours at a time.\n\n[*][b]Character route writing issues.[/b]\u00a0The pacing issue may be prevalent throughout the entire game, but the character routes have some additional issues exclusive to them. And unfortunately, these issues are the result of the game's H-scenes. In fact, these scenes are a large part of why the pacing felt so slow in the character routes. That is because, once the romance has been developed enough, the character routes devolve into a series of filler scenes to pad out the game's H-scenes. You'll go from H-scene to a day full of filler and maybe a small story development back to another H-scene and so on.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that it is 100% noticeable that these filler scenes are just there to serve the H-scenes, as the protagonist and heroine will often discuss when the next time they can do it is or what they'll do during it. Yoshino and Mako's routes are the main offenders there. It's like the writers knew they had to include the H-scenes somewhere, but spent so much time developing the story and characters elsewhere that they were forced to dump them all at the end of each character route and hand over the reigns to a teenager to write. Again, I don't have any problem with such scenes being included, but when it leads to issues like this, it does bring down the experience a bit. Fortunately, it's only around the last third of each character route that suffers from this, but its still an issue regardless.[/list]\n\n[h2]Overall:[/h2]\nAlthough not quite as good as Yuzusoft's last English release, Sabbat of the Witch, Senren\uff0aBanka is still a good visual novel all things considered. The mix of fantasy and romance is done well, the art and music are top-notch, the flowchart feature is cool, and the characters are interesting enough that they carry the experience through the game's writing problems.

However, technically Senren\uff0aBanka does not play in this era but the village our protagonist visits just happens to somehow be stuck in the past. Therefore, I suspected this game to be a little bit different than the usual games I'm used to that rather played either in modern times or well.. in the past. If I had to describe my appeal to this genre, I would say it mostly is because the female characters often do have a strong personality, especially since they grew up with constant danger around them.\n\nSenren\uff0aBanka opens with Masaomi visiting the village Hoori. You see, his grandfather lives here and thus, he has memories of spending his childhood here as well. This village is quite special since it seems to be stuck in the past. During his time there, he tries to draw a blade, that is stuck in a stone, as a lot of people tried to achieve this - without any success. However, it happens that Masaomi breaks this blade in half and while being totally shocked, he starts to get aware of Murasame, the caretaker of the divine blade, who luckily manages to restore it. To make it worse, he has to take responsibility for his actions now and gets involved in an arranged marriage with the village's shrine maiden.\n\nAs aforementioned, I found the technically mixed genres very appealing since I often happened to be unsure what genre I want to play. I'm sure it's relatable that sometimes one is in the mood for something light-hearted whilst other times some action would be a nice change of scenario as well. However, despite containing the modern and past era, it hardly feels like it does actually play in the modern time besides Masaomi being a little bit surprised in the beginning, yet he just accepted it pretty soon and it wasn't really any different than the usual history games I've played before although I would say it's less gory. Sometimes, Senren\uff0aBanka makes use of the merge and uses modern clothes for casual occasions or when the characters are in school.\n\nOf course, the action isn't missing here as well, which is one of the most interesting parts of this game. Unfortunately, there is a curse lingering here in the family of the fianc\u00e9 of our protagonist and she has to purify evil beings. This confirms my suspect above with the strong female characters, as she usually fights them off with her childhood friend and bodyguard. Actually, I found that all the female characters were independent and adorable, to top it off. I really appreciate it when a girl isn't helpless and has to get protected by the guy simply because she is female, but in Senren\uff0aBanka Masaomi and his fianc\u00e9 are fighting the spirits off together, which is a nice resolution as he still takes care of her and honestly, it's a lot more romantic to work together.\n\nTalking about romantic, I am an ultimate fan of arranged marriages. It's like Masaomi forced to marry someone and therefore, it's evident that he will spend a lot of time with his fianc\u00e9. The thing I like about this relationship is that it resembles a hate-and-love relationship. And for unknown reasons, the shrine maiden really does not like him, well in the beginning at least. However, it was heartwarming to see her slowly opening up to him and with this, her behavior started to change as well. After all, there is a secretive reason why she doesn't have any friends besides her bodyguard, but that's fine too since their relationship is just adorable and one can easily tell they're very close despite their different personalities.\n\nNow, the disappointing thing here is that there is basically zero romance available in the common route although the arranged marriage was such a promising premise. I felt rather like the common route focused entirely on telling the story and after it's done, the romance starts to bloom. Initially, I wouldn't mind this concept as well, yet, it was such a shame that both genres didn't get merged within the common route. It rather feels like I went through an action story-driven visual novel at first and then ended up with a slice-of-life dating sim the other half of the game and honestly, it would have been much more interesting if both elements would have been present at the same time.\n\nIn total, there are four main romance routes available and two sub-routes that unlock after going through at least one route. Although the choices do alter a few events, there are very little and mostly determine with which heroine the player is going to get together. That being said, there are a lot of interesting features here that I didn't often see in visual novels such as the flow chart where the player can choose different choices but doesn't have to skip through the whole game, plus the system is more visible this way. On a piece of side information, there is also a skip text button, as well as skip to previous and next choices and events. I occurred a few crashes right when the game jumped to the next chapter so that wasn't a problem when I launched it again because I could skip right to the part immediately.\n\nGraphic-wise, one can immediately tell that Senren\uff0aBanka is a high-quality visual novel. Besides the usual sprites, there are cute chibi drawings available as well which greatly spiced up the happenings. A thing I noticed right away was that the sprites have multiple facials expressions, poses and a lot of different clothes plus hairstyles available depending on the impressive scene, to say the least. The variety of the sprites greatly helped with the immersion and along with that the top-notch voice-over. For this aspect, there is a new feature implemented as well: A bar where you can see when the voice over is going to be done. This was often an issue for me since I cannot understand Japanese and therefore, never knew whether the characters were done talking or just leaving some room for a dramatic pause.\n\nSenren\uff0aBanka is a gorgeous visual novel that includes adorable girls with a supernatural theme. Whilst I found it was a shame that the romance and action plot didn't get fused until the common route was over, I still liked each girl and it was tough to decide which girl to pursue first. Regardless, I enjoyed that this game was a nice change to the usual dating sims I've played before since the common route isn't all about slice-of-life but offers an actual story with some action that made me curious about all the mysteries that came along with the supernatural aspect. That being said, Senren\uff0aBanka is an adorable visual novel with strong female characters to romance fueled with a mystery that is just waiting to get unfolded.\n\n[code]\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc32 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34470115/]\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e[/url] \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/5413792/]\ud835\udc15\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2c[/url] \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc2c!", "timestamp_created": 1585601502, "timestamp_updated": 1585601606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759168565273284912", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66149424": {"recommendationid": "66149424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278510962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 9530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2795, "last_played": 1679732571}, "language": "english", "review": "Senren*Banka is an excellent romance/slice of life VN that sprinkles in a bit of drama and mystery along with a lovable cast to create a heartwarming experience. The writing, art, and extras hit all the right notes, and the game has no major flaws. It's an easy recommend to anyone who enjoys VNs.\n\nThe game starts off in the common route, where the protagonist, Masaomi, has returned to the quaint village of Hoori where he grew up. The common route serves to introduce the heroines, and does this better for some than others, but also is a compelling story in its own right.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and in no way felt like I was treading water until the real action of the heroines' routes began.\n\nAfterward, the game branches off into routes for the different heroines that offer some nice variety, with some focusing more on lighthearted comedy and slice of life and others more on emotional drama and Hoori's supernatural mysteries. Of course, this means that depending on your tastes you will likely enjoy some more than others (my favorite was Murasame's,) but I found all the routes enjoyable. Even in the more serious routes though, Senren*Banka still makes time for jokes (which mostly land) and showing the little interactions between the characters that breathe life into their relationships. It also helps that all the heroines are quite likeable and written with believable and compelling motivations and challenges.\n\nSenren*Banka also offers top notch production values and QoL features. The art looks great, with characters constantly exhibiting subtle changes of expression during their lines, and the use of traditional music and instruments compliments the aesthetic of Hoori. On the QoL side, the game offers a flowchart that maps out decisions and routes, and it's so convenient I wish more VN's had this feature. No more saving in 10 different slots and trying to remember which one goes with which route. There's also a free 18+ patch easily available from the developer's website for those who are interested, though I think the game is worth playing either way. \n\nAgain, if you enjoy VNs, I think there's little reason not to play Senren*Banka.

With its strong characters, top-notch presentation, great sense of childish humour, and it's surprisingly emotional storylines, I fell in love, and shortly after that began the wait for the now released Senren*Banka! So the question is, does it live up to the former release? My answer is, in many ways, yes! However, in one way, I simply find it a bit lacking in comparison (which may or may not be an issue depending on what you expect).\n\nFirst of all, the comedy is absolutely on-point. Just like Sanoba Witch, Yuzusoft's perfected brand of perverse juvenile humour really shines through, bringing life to the characters in a way that other VNs often fail to do. The characters themselves are strong & wonderfully voiced, although perhaps a bit too similar in the romance scenes with our rather likeable protagonist, but the humour & general writing more makes up for that somewhat minor shortcoming.\n\nThe story itself is interestingly ridiculous, which is exactly what I'd hope for from a lighthearted playful read like this, but that does bring me nicely to my one subjectively negative comparison to Sanoba Witch: Senren*Banka, in my experience, quite a bit less emotionally charged than Sanoba Witch, which repeatedly caught me off-guard with its surprisingly touching story & heartfelt moments.  It's not that S*B is completely devoid of them, with Murasame's route being an obvious exception to me, but unlike Sanoba Witch, it's the exception, rather than the norm. \n\nOn a few perhaps brighter notes, the art is absolutely top notch, with the varied facial expressions changing constantly mid-sentence to breathe real life in to the characters. Not only that, but the OST is also very enjoyable, with its traditional sounding pieces really adding to the title wonderfully, although it's perhaps the lovingly performed piano ballads that really stand out the most for me.\n\nFrom a tech POV, I can't help but be impressed. Being able to jump seamlessly between lines of text/VA, instant choice skipping, and the best auto-mode I've seen in a VN made this a pleasure to read from start to finish. Also, as you'd expect, Nekonyan's localisation work is absolutely on point, with the translation being fluid with less mistakes than I've been able to notice on one hand throughout my read.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a damn fine moege that perhaps lacks the emotional punch of its previously translated sister title, but still nails every other element wonderfully, and so, I'd be glad to recommend it to anyone who just wants to relax with a lighthearted tale & lovable comedy. With more Yuzusoft titles on the way, now's a great time to jump in & see what all the fuss is about.\n\n(Note: While I did get a review copy for free, I was fully intent on supporting the release on day one, so I did a giveaway of the copy I would've bought through our Steam group.

If for whatever reason you are not interested in this content, or aren't legally allowed to play it, you should just skip this review.\n- Since many Visual Novels are similar in a bunch of ways, I'm gonna review this one on a few common aspects, including heavy reference to the previous title from YuzuSoft as well as independent explanations.\n\n[hr]\n[h3]Graphical & Technical Quality[/h3]\nHave you played the previous title, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/0256667/recommended/888790/]Sabbat of the Witch[/url]? If so, this makes it easy. If not - let's just cut it short, you should do so right away. Senren * Banka's story does not require any knowledge from Sanoba Witch, but with it being the next title from the very same developer, it is very similar (and does contain very funny joke references you only understand that way) - and Sanoba Witch is even better.\nAnyway, as to be expected from YuzuSoft, Senren * Banka features amazing quality in both graphics and technical features. You get the whole spectrum from Sanoba Witch, alongside some cool newcomers and enhancements.\nSuch as the KiriKiri engine default features like dozens of saveslots, skipping back and forth throughout the story (as far as you have already seen it once), costumization for menu voices, skip mode behaviour, text colors, fonts and so on.\nThe cool additions back in Sanoba Witch like saving voicelines to rehear them whenever you wanna hear your favorite \"Baka baaaaka!\" again, mouse gestures, the option to add even more saveslots and so on.\nAnd finally all the cool new gimmicks Senren * Banka brings to the table, like detailed backwards skipping, quick chapter jumping, customizable keyboard shortcuts, a customizable menu bar, being able to jump to the scene of a saved voiceline, a more user friendly savegame manager and finally - the flowchart diagram, the easiest way ever to keep track of every story segment, find out what you're missing and as easy as ever build your new route for a new playthrough.\nAlso, with the hidden \"Advanced settings\" menu you can now feel like a pro, adjusting stuff like render methods, cache sizes and all that juicy expert stuff.\n\nAs with Sanoba Witch there are no character sprite animations (like blinking or moving mouths) but the various character sprites are vividly used and changed mid-sentence to bring the scene to life.\n\nThough, also like with the previous game, Senren * Banka features a few textual errors in the translation here and there, but nothing too disturbing.\nAnd Senren * Banka seems to have some technical hicups too, atleast the reaction of the mouse gestures is far worse.\n\n[hr]\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2034918446[/url]\n\n[hr]\n[h3]Content & Runtime[/h3]\nOf course not spoiling anything on the actual story, Senren * Banka is much more of a casual, ecchi humor RomCom than it's predecessor focussing more on - stuff that the romance and adult genre entail. So if you are looking for a serious, deep, heartfelt story giving you an emotional journey of your lifetime - I again highly recommend the predecessor, Sabbat of the Witch. Though if you are looking for a good laugh amongst some good looking virtual characters making out, this is one of the best things you could get.\n\nSenren * Banka features the usual 4 main routes (without a real \"main\" route like Sanoba Witch) with an additional bonus route (shorter in comparison) splitting between the two side characters, which gives a total of 7 (\"bad\" ending included) endings on 5 routes to enjoy. The Prologue/Common route takes around 10h of time, the main routes around 15h each and the bonus route around 10h whole (as always measured by not rush-skipping standards), totaling to around 80h.\nThe characters are well developed and distinct, giving lot's of variation to enjoy no matter which route you play, though the male protagonist has been reduced to your everyday anime protagonist again (even though he looks exactly like the one from Sanoba Witch :I).\n\nAs this again is a full fledged Visual Novel with multiple routes/endings, you determine your path with the 8(+1) in-dialog-decisions made throughout the story, with some of them having more than the regular 2 options and some of them even leading to different event-paths right on the common route.\n\nIf you're not after your personal Waifu I'd recommend playing the routes in the order they are displayed (flowchart menu, shoppage description, ...) for maximum effect.\n\nAfter clearing your first playthrough you unlock the gallery, where you can enjoy the 93 wallpaper CGs, 30 (somewhat animated) SD Chibi arts, 53 really awesome soundtracks and 7 opening/ending movies (as long as you saw/heared them once before of course), neatly sorted by category and character.\nThere also are After Stories again, which contain another bonus scene for every character whose route you already cleared.\n\nUpon clearing all routes you unlock the Sprite Viewer too, where you can play around with all the backgrounds and character sprites in all their variations to your heart's content, and even load custom backgrounds for all your photoshop needs.\n\n[hr]\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2027016060[/url]\n\n[hr]\n[h3]The R18 content[/h3]\nConsidering the content is for free, you can still expect an experience worthy of any regular full price R18 DLC. Each main character comes with 3+1 hentai scenes, each bonus character with 2+1.\nGreat voice acting alongside missing weird sound effects (you know, those weird \"break bones\" and \"mix cement\" sounds you often hear) and CG backgrounds with high variety make up for the previously mentioned  lack of animation and the likes.\nWhen it comes to the depictions of bodily fluids and the will and stamina of the participants, it's noteably more than with the predecessor, but nothing out of the ordinary hentai and even varies strongly from route to route.\n\nSenren * Banka does a slight serving on fetish play, with the concept of \"turning into sex crazy monsters\" and that peeing fetish thingie being a thing to look out for.\n\nYou get to choose between coming inside or outside in most occasions, with personal preference (aka. auto choice) to be set in the settings.\n\nAnd again there is your best buddy, the panic button, customizable in function (minimize, placeholder image, custom image).\n\nAlso, as is suitable for having a foreign character on board, you even get a free lesson on \"Japanese for Beginners - Hentai Edition\".\n\n[b]As usual (sadly) mosaic censorship on the 'good' bits is in place.[/b]\n\n[hr]\n[url]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2011875313[/url]\n\n[hr]\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nIs this game worth it?\nWell, if I'd go and rate it on a simplistic scale from 1 to 10, with 12 being where the predecessor managed to land, I'd give Senren * Banka an overall 9/10, depending on personal taste.\nIf you played and enjoyed the predecessor (or any other VN of the same caliber) for it's rich, deep and serious story, this here might not be the thing for you. If you don't mind or are actively looking for a nice, lighthearted RomCom with adult content, Senren * Banka is well invested money.\nAlso, if you're still unsure - there will always be a next sale.\n\n\n\n\n[code]Helpful review?

The branching routes are different in that they offer more insight into the lore of the legend, which i liked. However, how you \"hook-up\" with each heroine has exactly the same format. Which cheapens the replayability. \n\n-ART: 10/10 \nThe characters look great and the facial reactions do a great job portraying their reactions. I'm mostly impressed with the backgrounds. There's so much detail in most scenes that my eyes can help but explore.\n\n-Music: 9/10\nThe music is very enjoyable and there are a few that I wouldn't mind playing on repeat on my playlist.\n\nTLDR: Game has good art and music.

I did play through the four main routes, though, so after giving it some thought I decided to write a review anyway.\n\nSenren\uff0aBanka is a great game. The art is top-notch (also the first 1080P title by Yuzusoft), the cast beats out just about any other game's in terms of talent and experience, and the tracks include quite a few memorable ones, especially the opening theme song, Koikou Enishi. Each of the four main routes also manages to tell an engaging story, with Lena's route being the closest to the core plot of the game, which comes off as a surprise given her role as a foreign student in the village. On top of all that, Yuzusoft's customized Kirikiri engine famously provides for a highly configurable and enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nIn short, this game is well worth its price tag, with or without discount - you won't regret buying it, period. Buying it will also support NekoNyan in their quest to introduce more high quality VNs to the western market - especially given the incredibly exciting news that they have now convinced and partnered with another great VN developer SAGA PLANETS to publish an English version of Kin'iro Loveriche, SAGA PLANETS's 2017 work that was so successful in Japan it prompted them to make their first fan disk in over a decade. I can't wait for the day when all of the great games made by Yuzusoft and SAGA PLANETS receive the renown they deserve by fans all around the world. (Sorry for using this review to blatantly lobby NekoNyan for more SAGA PLANETS titles; as a devout fan of SAGA PLANETS and especially of Karumaruka\uff0aCircle, I couldn't resist. Both Yuzusoft and SAGA PLANETS are located in Osaka, and they often ran joint campaigns to promote each other's works, so hopefully this little bit of digression can be forgiven.)", "timestamp_created": 1581924714, "timestamp_updated": 1581926622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622425615787506104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63649834": {"recommendationid": "63649834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111325423", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1073, "last_played": 1610695078}, "language": "english", "review": "Lena is love, Lena is life.\n\nPS.

I just finished playing my first Playthrough which was Murasames Route and there isnt a single thing I didnt like. The Characters are all fleshed out perfectly and all have their own little querks and stories. The VN itself has the common route where the game mainly focuses on the supernatural mixed together with comedy parts and has a more relaxed feel to it. After you start going to the specific Character Routes however you get a lot more Character development of the specific character and a lot more Romance. The Game also gets a lot more realistic and doesnt focus on the supernatural anymore, but more on actual problems. Just the fact that it nearly took me 15 hours for a single Playthrough and I didnt get bored a single time should tell you that the Game has a great flow and development. It never stretches the story to make it get boring and it never feels rushed.\n\nYou can also clearly tell that they put a lot of work in this Games technical Development as the Art and Sprites are all amazing. The Soundtrack is also great and they even added nice little extras like a Storytree where you can always see how your Story is progressing and even jump back to specific points in the story. This makes it very convenient when it comes to changing between Routes. The Translation and Writing  is also very polished and you can tell that they really took their time with it to get as many funny parts in and to make it as realistic as possible.\n\nOverall I really can only say that you should try the game out for yourself and that you really should support the Developer and the publisher as they are both doing an amazing job especially if you consider how much work they put into this and how cheap the Games they offer are. The 30 Euro are so worth it when you compare them to other Visual Novels and I can only recommend checking out the other VNs Yuzusoft has created as they are all amazing.\n\nThank you for the Key NekoNyan as well really appreciate it :)\n\nScore: 10/10\n\nCheck out my Curator Page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34401214/", "timestamp_created": 1581778262, "timestamp_updated": 1581946436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683719754219055176", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63542445": {"recommendationid": "63542445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799511683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 801, "last_played": 1692016351}, "language": "english", "review": "Best valentine gift ever, sorry for not giving a reliable review but you should just try it yourself to find out!

First playthrough took about 24 hours. The common route took me about 12 hours to complete, each main character route seems to be about 10 hours \u00b1 2 hours, while the side heroine routes (only did Koharu's so far) took about 4-5 hours. \n\nSo far I am extremely happy with my purchase of this game. The art and character designs are phenomenal in my opinion and the music does a great job of setting the tone of the scene and really drawing you into the atmosphere of the story.\n\nThe comedy in the game was a great distraction from my loneliness on Valentines Day and kept me laughing for a large portion of what I read so far. The scenarios were also made very believable by the writing in the story. Though, I am usually a laid back reader, so if something is \"bad writing\" I wouldn't really care or be able to tell unless it really stood out.\n\nThe romance in the game was very well done, felt believably, and had really sweet moments too. At the moment, Murasame is best girl for me, but both Yoshino's and Murasame's routes were very good, and handled the drama/struggles aspects well. In Koharu's route, I also liked the [spoiler]love triangle that ensued between her and Roka; I thought it was cool to see the interactions between them.[/spoiler]\n\nLastly, the technical features of the game are superb, some of the best I have seen in a visual novel, and I have read many. There is a voice bookmark feature which is improved from their previous novel, a customizable menu bar (the bar that is at the bottom of the text box), and bindable keybinds, which is rare (in my experience) to see in a visual novel.\n\nSo far this has been a great vn, and I don't regret buying it. I greatly enjoy the characters, story, setting, and fantasy aspect. \n\nIf you are still hesitant, try out the free demo first, and if you decide to get it, you can copy the data in the Trial Version savedata folder (can be found in Steam\\userdata\\[your user id]\\1221010) [b]before[/b] buying the game, then pasting the saves into the main game save folder (Steam\\userdata\\[user id]\\1144400) in order to keep your old data, or you can just skip through until you get where you left off in the Trial Version (change ctrl skip from skip only \"read text\" to skip \"unread text\" in order to skip without needing to rapidly smash the spacebar or enter key).", "timestamp_created": 1581745912, "timestamp_updated": 1582377854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63525146": {"recommendationid": "63525146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145288322", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1592599372}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean it's a Yuzusoft game, what more do I need to say", "timestamp_created": 1581744401, "timestamp_updated": 1581744401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494915962219238281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63524625": {"recommendationid": "63524625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066963532", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1659192982}, "language": "english", "review": "i don't have anything to write, just recommend this!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1581743478, "timestamp_updated": 1581743478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494915962219238281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63521276": {"recommendationid": "63521276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834888908", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1653481401}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Visual Novel~", "timestamp_created": 1581737996, "timestamp_updated": 1581737996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496177315711975098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63520142": {"recommendationid": "63520142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113083281", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 417, "last_played": 1587191619}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, this VN is one of the best Yuzusoft games I\u2019ve played .

This is an anime visual novel developed by Yuzusoft and published by Nekonyan. The original released in 2016(Japan) and also awarded the 2016 Moe Game Award for the second tier. (As you may know, the best visual novel of that year was awarded to WAGAMAMA HIGH SPEC.) Anyway, when we talk about Yuzusoft games, we will generally agree that their games are a safe choice. Their work has provided a certain level of quality, and has given great pleasure to Japanese anime VN fans.\n\nThis game well follows the typical features of Yuzusoft. It features romance comedy story lines, full voice supported, attractive heroines, nice sub-characters, cute artworks, vibrant animations, and the free extra uncensored patch. Of course, there are some differences in detail. It took place in a mix of historical and modern fantasy settings. And your relationship with heroines are already fixed to some degree. Especially this game has some swallow holes in the story plot. It gives the impression that some processes have been omitted. If you are insensitive to those things, this game can still bring you a lot of laughter and fun.\n\n[b]Pros (+) & Cons (-) [/b]\n[table]\n[td][list]\n[*][+] Fully voiced\n[*][+] Nice soundtracks\n[*][+] Colorful animations\n[*][+] Attractive characters\n[/list][/td]\n[td][list]\n[*][-] Minor Bugs\n[*][-] Slow Pacing\n[*][-] Shallow Plot\n[*][-] \n[/list][/td]\n[/table]\n\n[b]Verdict: Game 8.5/10, Translation 10/10[/b]\nSenren\uff0aBanka. This is definitely a Yuzusoft style visual novel. It focuses on the romance comedy theme and features outstanding anime artwork and voice dubbing. In addition, NekoNyan's global localization quality is so good that it's very comfortable to read. Some glitches exist, but not enough to worry about. One thing not to miss is Yuzusoft's previous game characters appearing as cameos in the background. Discovering that will be another fun part of this visual novel.
