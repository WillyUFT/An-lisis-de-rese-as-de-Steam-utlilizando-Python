So that is a first good point. The controls are fairly easy to understand and complexity is added gradually enough that you never feel overwhelmed.\n\nWhat I liked the most about this game is how satisfying combat is. The combos look cool, finishers are brutal, and you do feel powerful even when enemies are challenging.\n\nThe level design also blew my mind. Learning a mechanic to solve puzzles to advance through a level feels organic and natural, it does not feel like a tutorial. And when you get to each boss, you have to use all the mechanics you have learned to beat them, meaning the boss fights are also a bit of a puzzle. So every advance you make, every win, feels extra good because you also have to think, not just be good at combat.\n\nStory-wise, I did not expect much, but I was wrong. What starts as a simple redemption quest leads you to uncover a much more intricate plot, that I did not see coming. A very good surprise.\n\nCharacters have a lot of personality and I love them all. (Or love to hate, depending.) They have their own motivations and stick to them, and interactions always elicit a reaction from the player, from laughter to tears. (I'm not fond of the lack of female characters, but I unfortunately expect it.)\n\nAll in all I really recommend it, Darksiders is a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1699211516, "timestamp_updated": 1699211516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149430516": {"recommendationid": "149430516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835380633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1699006168}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game love the story and the weapons the gameplay is great I love how they make you feel like a OP god in this game", "timestamp_created": 1699006235, "timestamp_updated": 1699006235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532374083995819092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149175900": {"recommendationid": "149175900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032837237", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 1433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1433, "last_played": 1698643661}, "language": "english", "review": "Played it multiple times.

Like you can't run, you kinda just use the dashes in the game because that's faster than just walking.\n\nBut other than that, the puzzles, enemies and options you have when fighting enemies give a bit of a deeper combat. So for example, you can grab an enemy, but that 9 out of 10 times yields more health drops for you, but should you just kill them, you'll receive more souls which you can use to upgrade and buy more abilities.\n\nGreat game with a great take on the characters of the End Times.\n\nHighly recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1698433542, "timestamp_updated": 1698433542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148972706": {"recommendationid": "148972706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930429162", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1739, "last_played": 1661801561}, "language": "english", "review": "Good lore, nice game play, difficulty levels, puzzle solving, reminds me on Legacy of Kain series.

(2010) is an action-adventure game developed by Vigil Games and set in a post-apocalyptic world inspired by various mythologies and biblical references.\n\nIn Darksiders we assume the role of War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The story begins when a premature and destructive apocalypse occurs on Earth, triggering a battle between Heaven and Hell. War is blamed for prematurely initiating the end of the world and is stripped of his powers.\n\nThe gameplay of Darksiders combines elements of hack and slash combat, puzzle-solving, and exploration. War possesses a wide array of weapons, including a giant sword called Chaoseater, which can be upgraded and enhanced as players progress. He also gains access to various supernatural abilities and forms that grant him additional combat options and traversal abilities, just like in the God of War and Devil May Cry series.\n\nAs players progress through the game, they acquire new weapons, abilities, and equipment, which allow for more varied combat strategies and exploration. Even though the world is nonlinear, featuring interconnected areas that can be revisited as new abilities are unlocked, enabling access to previously inaccessible locations.\n\nDarksiders is quite an average project combining a lot of mechanics from the genre; yet for those who like hack and slash combat with exploration elements, the game might be worth your while.\n\nreVote 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1687085888, "timestamp_updated": 1687085888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685074806213378906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139258108": {"recommendationid": "139258108", "author": {"steamid": "76561199045894660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1679250431}, "language": "english", "review": "Muito mal otimizado, simplesmente ruim", "timestamp_created": 1685440939, "timestamp_updated": 1685440939, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138312815": {"recommendationid": "138312815", "author": {"steamid": "76561199195610119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1531, "last_played": 1684081528}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels good to make all achivements on warmastered and original one in same year, can say uriel is the Best character \ud83e\udd23", "timestamp_created": 1684100389, "timestamp_updated": 1684100389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137970176": {"recommendationid": "137970176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007343154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 446, "playtime_forever": 1522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1522, "last_played": 1355644800}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where players take on the role of War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\n\nGraphics:\nDarksiders features high-quality graphics with detailed environments, character designs, and special effects. The art style is unique and creates a dark and atmospheric world for players to explore. The game's graphics hold up well even years after its release.\n\nSound:\nThe sound design in Darksiders is excellent, with a powerful soundtrack that sets the mood and accentuates the action. The sound effects are also well-done and add to the overall immersion of the game.\n\nStory:\nThe story of Darksiders is well-written and engaging, following War as he sets out to clear his name after being accused of starting the Apocalypse. The game's narrative is well-paced and has plenty of twists and turns that keep players interested.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay in Darksiders is a mix of combat, puzzle-solving, and exploration. The game features fast-paced and fluid combat, as well as challenging puzzles that require players to use War's abilities to progress. The game also allows players to upgrade their abilities and weapons, adding a level of depth to the gameplay.\n\nGood Points:\n\nHigh-quality graphics with a unique art style\nExcellent sound design with a powerful soundtrack\nWell-written and engaging story\nFast-paced and fluid combat\nChallenging puzzles and upgradeable abilities\n\nBad Points:\n\nRepetitive and sometimes dull combat\nLinear level design\nLack of enemy variety\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, Darksiders is a solid action-adventure game with high-quality graphics and sound design, as well as a well-written and engaging story. The gameplay is fast-paced and fluid, with challenging puzzles and upgradeable abilities. However, the repetitive and sometimes dull combat, linear level design, and lack of enemy variety can make the game feel a bit stale after a while.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1676022773, "timestamp_updated": 1676023072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132351915": {"recommendationid": "132351915", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995285008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1041, "last_played": 1482884178}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay is as follows:\n1) Go where the game says\n2) Mash X to fight arena of enemies\n3) Get blocked from progressing without an as-yet-unheard-of ability/key/item\n4) Backtrack through most of what you just did, still mashing X sometimes\n5) Get to the area you were [i]actually[/i] supposed to find first\n6) Mash X more to kill more enemies\n7) Do a QTE and watch your enemy defeated via a cutscene that may as well just say \"Hey, wow, you pushed the B button when we told you to!!\"\n8) Find missing ability/key/item, discover its usage is deeply specific for 1, [i]maybe[/i] 2 things\n9) Backtrack [i]once again[/i] through Dracula's Castle--sorry, [i]the Black Tower[/i]--and get through the original progress block from Step 3.\n10) Repeat this dreadful loop.\n\nSumming up: It's about as fun as that one 3D Castlevania with the hack-and-slash action-adventure mechanics.

The only thing it killed with any proficiency was braincells.\n\nComing from the same crop of ideals that spawned hypermasc power fantasies that would later become sad thirty year old boomer dad memes, Darksiders' comic book roots don't save it from becoming a muddled hodge-podge of everything cool and good in gaming that ends up falling short of cool and good. It's like store-bought chocolate cake from the local supermarket chain. Sure, it's got all the ingredients, and it looks and tastes like it's supposed to, but are you really going to remember and cherish its memory?\n\nThe first comparison most people will make is the WoW-inspired art style. And while that might be true, they overlook how American comic books have largely informed WoW and everything that came after. There are hints of Frank Miller, Todd McFarlane, and Chris Liefeld in there. And while you'd hope this would result in a hard, pounding opera of gore and emotion, what came out the other end was a rote and dreary beat-em-up starring roided-out kewpie dolls bouncing around contract concept art. To be fair, this first foray into the world of Darksiders was likely an exploratory step, but first impressions count, and aspirations at weaving a grander cosmology without directly stepping on Christian toes is merely that - aspirations.\n\nMeanwhile, the puzzles, combat, and exploration make you experience a hellish grind for no real reason, just because it's what a video game like this is supposed to do. You'd think exploring a ruined Earth would be more compelling, but little more than palette swaps and a new mechanic do anything to make you care about the world and how it works - if it works.

la exploracion\n+ El combate es genial, si bien los combos no son tan numerosos, mientras mas avanzas desbloqueas nuevo equipo que puede cambiar tu forma de combatir y asi combinarlo con los combos para complementarlos\n+ El mismo equipamiento son siempre nuevas mecanicas que se explotan a lo largo de todo el juego, cada vez que consigas algo nuevo quiere decir que tendras que volver a explorar por donde ya pasaste para descubrir otros caminos, ni en el final del juego dejas de aprender cosas nuevas o combinaciones entre estos mismos y eso se agradece\n+ Los dise\u00f1os son hermosos, tanto de los personajes principales y bosses, hasta el esbirro mas inutil, todo tiene un cari\u00f1o en su dise\u00f1o y se los puede diferenciar facilmente a la hora de combatir con cada uno\n\n- Quiza lo

Combat is simple but very satisfying. Puzzles are not frustratingly difficult and, again, are satisfying to solve. The theme and design are fun and cool, but the story itself isn't anything groundbreaking - it's pretty simple and not all that prevalent in the gameplay. None of the characters are very fleshed out, but the voice acting is excellent and includes talent like Mark Hamill, Troy Baker, and Phil LaMarr. Soundtrack and sound design are also very good. The graphics are dated obviously, but the game doesn't really suffer for it as the style and atmosphere are still very much engaging and nice to look at. As others have said, the gameplay is quite similar in a lot of ways to the Legend of Zelda games, with the art style of Warcraft and a (secular) theological, apocalyptic flavor. \n\nMy biggest complaint is what feels like a big imbalance in difficulty in a few places. There are a couple of enemies that are WAY harder (and take longer) to beat than any of the game's bosses, including the final one! It took me 10+ tries to beat a team of two Iron Giants, but only 2-3 to beat the final boss of the game... Even once you figure out how to beat those enemies, they have so much health that it just takes forever to kill them and it gets a bit tedious.

I feel like it comes up a bit short in places, combat feels particularly shallow, and the world feels a bit too big in comparison to how much there is to do/find/collect, but as far as Zelda-likes are concerned, it\u2019s ok. I felt personally disappointed by it\u2019s failing to \u2018go above and beyond\u2019 in any aspect. Despite it having enough of an aesthetical identity, it still has this distinct sense of \u2018generic late 2000\u2019s game\u2019 in that it throws random \u2018side segments\u2019 that differ from regular gameplay in for seemingly no reason than to stretch the game out. They\u2019re never particularly engaging and generally feel like the game would\u2019ve been better if they\u2019d been excluded. There\u2019s also the matter of how needlessly edgy it feels that gives it a sense of being aged. If you are going to play it, I recommend the Warmastered edition rather than the original I played, simply a better version of the same game. Though if you are planning on playing the whole series, or are just out of better Zelda-likes to play, my main complaint would be the previously mentioned shallow combat. The most baffling aspect of Darksiders to me is how they clearly took some inspiration from God of War\u2019s bloody fast paced combo driven hack and slash gameplay\u2026 and yet weapons don\u2019t really combo into each other well at all in my experience, leaving you with 2-4 hit chains of attacks with a single weapon being the only reliable way to attack. It seems like some of the groundwork is there, it seems like it\u2019s what they wanted, but just couldn\u2019t deliver on, so you\u2019ll pretty much just end up doing the same small string of attacks over and over throughout the whole game.

In my humble opinion, it was the last generation, in which console war was still a thing. I mean, seriously. Look at the world we live in now. We have [b]Kingdom Hearts[/b] and [b]Final Fantasy[/b] on [b]Xbox[/b], [b]Crash Bandicoot[/b] and [b]Forza[/b] on [b]PC[/b] and so on. Sure, technically, the console war is still on and some titles are still available only on certain platforms, but all in all, seventh generation was the last one when it was still interesting. The last one when it was actually worth having more than one system on you. And this game? It's taking advantage of that.\n\nSee, even up to this day we never had [b]The Legend of Zelda[/b] game outside [b]Nintendo[/b]'s system. We also never had [b]God of War[/b] game outside [b]PlayStation[/b] family. [b]Vigil Games[/b] decided to change that. Not by porting those games, of course (we all know what [b]Nintendo[/b] does with those who mess with their property, the guys are worse than any inquisition), but by making their own high quality alternative. That's pretty much all you need to know about the [b]Darksiders[/b]. It's stylish and charming mix between [b]The Legend of Zelda[/b] and [b]God of War[/b].\n\n[b]Vigil Games[/b] didn't stop there, though. They literally took everything that was cool about popular titles like [b]Devil May Cry[/b], [b]Gungrave[/b], [b]Ubisoft[/b]'s [b]Prince of Persia[/b], [b]Legacy of Kain[/b], [b]Portal[/b] and even [b]WarCraft[/b] (design in this game was copied from what we had in [b]WarCraft III[/b] / [b]World of WarCraft[/b] almost as is), mixed all that together and called it a day. Sure, it doesn't sound that good. I mean... we all hate plagiarism, right? But you know what? It actually [i]is[/i] a good thing. Thanks to [b]Darksiders[/b], a lot of people who never played such games before finally got a chance to do so, while the others? The others just got even more of a good thing.\n\nLike I said, [b]Darksiders[/b] is a high quality product. It looks good and it feels good. Almost as good as the original titles. And all of those different elements from different games? They work surprisingly well together. While playing as a brutal guy who looks almost exactly like [b]Arthas Menethil[/b], we'll explore a [b]Zelda[/b]-like world with dungeons, use a gun like [b]Dante[/b] and [b]Beyond the Grave[/b], do some basic tricks like in those early [b]Prince of Persia[/b] titles from [b]Ubisoft[/b], we'll fight some huge enemies and do [b]QTE[/b] like in [b]God of War[/b], solve the puzzles similar to what we had in [b]Zelda[/b], [b]Legacy of Kain[/b] and [b]Portal[/b], and so on. It really does work perfectly well. The addiction, the satisfaction... it's all here.\n\nAdd the fact that this game also comes with surprisingly great cast (not only we've got [b]Troy Baker[/b], we've also got [b]Mark Hamill[/b] himself, so, it's, like, one heck of a [b]Joker[/b] paradise here) and you'll see that... well... this game is good. Simple like that. You want a good game? Here it is. It's really hard to find something really bad to say about the [b]Darksiders[/b]. No matter how you look at it, it's a good game and that's it. Even the fact that [b]Vigil Games[/b] kind of overdid it with puzzles at one point can't change that (even though they sure did and this game comes with even more annoying dungeon than that [b]Water Temple[/b] thingy from [b]Ocarina of Time[/b], keep that in mind if you don't have enough patience).\n\nThere's one thing, though, that gives [b]Darksiders[/b] a certain... unpleasant aftertaste. I'm talking, of course, about the fact that this game doesn't have a face. Like [b]John Travolta[/b] in that certain [b]John Woo[/b] movie. Sure, it looks very impressive and stylish, but at the same time, when you look at this game? You don't see [b]Darksiders[/b]. You see the original games. When you watch cutscenes? It's a bloody [b]WarCraft[/b]. When you shoot? You see [b]Dante[/b]. When you pick up bombs from the ground? You see [b]Link[/b] who's getting ready to face [b]King Dodongo[/b]. And so on. The biggest problem with this game is that it can't really offer you anything unique, while everything that [b]Vigil Games[/b] borrowed from the other titles is so obvious that it's literally impossible not to think about that. It's just a bunch of some really cool stuff from the other, more famous titles and that's it. Does it ruin the game? Of course, not. And yet, like I said, it adds a certain unpleasant aftertaste. Like... you know. When you're playing one of those so-called \u201cclones\u201d, no matter how good it is, it's still just a clone, right?\n\nThere was a good chance to fix all that through story, bu-u-ut... let's just say that story is not the strongest point here. All in all, it's fine, but it relies too much on setting. You know, angels, demons, post-apocalyptic future... In other words, it's [b]Requiem: Avenging Angel[/b]. Which is pretty cool and stylish, but... let's just say that the actual storytelling is not really that good. [b]Vigil Games[/b] tried to follow the [b]God of War[/b] formula, in which our character just keeps beating the heck out of one character after another, but... let's just say that without [b]Kratos[/b] and his charisma you can't help but want more twists. I'm not trying to say that [b]War[/b] (yes, we're playing as one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse here, because... you know... [b]War[/b]... [b]God of War[/b]... good grief...) isn't a charming character. It's just... it doesn't make as much impact as [b]Kratos[/b]. At least, not enough to cover for the lack of plot twists. In other words, the story just can't cover the fact that this game is just a clone. Unfortunately.\n\nThen again, for those of us who don't have any consoles on them, this game is a great choice. And even for those who already played all of the games I've mentioned above, I can still recommend this one. Because, let's just admit it, having a good clone from time to time? It's a good thing. Like, OK, [b]Age of Empires[/b] is a good game. But it doesn't mean that we can't enjoy clones like [b]Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds[/b], [b]War Diary II[/b] and even [b]BC Kings[/b] because why the heck not? And [b]Darksiders[/b]? It's sure a good clone. Seriously, guys, you haven't played it yet? Go buy it.\n\n[b]P.S.[/b] Nowadays, though, it may actually be a good idea to go for so-called [b]Warmastered Edition[/b] instead. The new version comes with the [b]4K[/b] resolution support (in the original version you can't go higher than [b]2K[/b]), high resolution textures, improved shadows and post-processing effects, re-rendered cutscenes and, the best of all, the pre-order weapon (the [b]Harvester[/b] scythe) as a free bonus. Well, it won't be [i]free[/i], since you'll need to buy it with the in-game currency, but you know what I mean. In [b]Warmastered Edition[/b] you won't need any pre-order codes to get [b]Harvester[/b]. In other words, it's, like, the same exact thing, only better and with pre-order bonus as a gift. Which makes purchasing the original version kinda useless. As long as you're not a die-hard geek who wants to have every single version of this game.

You play as War, the first of the horsemen of the apocalypse, who comes after the legions of hell have been unleashed upon Earth and the forces of heaven have gone to intercept them, starting the biblical apocalypse. However - unlike what has been foretold, you are the only Horseman to answer the call and thus strive to find out what is going on.\nCombat will be an integral part of your gameplay and the combat here is a generally fluid, relying on timely dodging, parrying and counter-attacks. When I say \"generally fluid\" I mean, that the game sometimes fails to register your input or registers it wrongly (I played with a controller on PC, using the Steam controller emulation). You will have three main weapons to choose from - the Chaoseater sword (with a wide variety of potential attacks and a higher rate of generating wrath/chaos, more on those later), a Scythe (which generates more souls per kill) or the Tremor Gauntlet (which knocks down enemies with every completed attack sequence and is used in puzzles to break walls of ice). Along with these weapons there will be six items, which are mainly used to solve puzzles, but some of which can also enhance your combat. Ill let you find those yourself. I also feel that the opponents are more poorly balanced here than in the Warmastered edition, meaning you will have a worse time of it than in that game.\nWar has all of his powers stripped at the end of the Prologue, which means you will have to power him back up. Despite of this - there are no levels to speak of. You gain souls from killing enemies and use these to buy upgrades from a merchant. These are mostly skill upgrades (you buy new moves for each weapon and upgrade them), but there are also the classical health restoration items, upgrades, a few weapons (the Scythe for example) and skills. The skills are launched when War has enough Wrath, which is kind of a mana/stamina reservoir. The devs have kept the Wrath pool relatively low, meaning that while you can have powerful spells, you shouldn't reach a point where you can just comfortably walk through areas and steamroll everything with spells alone. Lastly there is Chaos, which is an attribute that launches War's Chaos form - this looks pretty much exactly as a Balrog from The Lord of the Rings and is invulnerable, but only lasts a limited amount of time.\nThe setting means, that you shouldn't expect much cheer here - Humanity has been annihilated and its cities lie in ruin. Despite this the graphics and color schemes are a lot more bright than in Soulsborne products - despite the setting I found there to be very little actual gloom and/or negativity. You basically have little to no time to build any sort of a relationship to anything you meet and thus won't much care what lives or dies. So if you're looking for something straight-forward and simple to turn your mind off to - Darksiders is a very good choice.\nDespite how straight-forward the story is however, it doesn't mean its shallow or that it has no surprises along the way - the villain of this installment is not obvious [spoiler] (they also officially die very early on) [/spoiler] and ..... getting more into this would be a major spoiler, so lets just leave it at that everyone you meet has their agenda and very few things are as simple as they first seem.\nHowever it must be said, that the Warmastered Edition is VASTLY superior to this game and to be perfectly honest with you - this review is positive only because this version comes with that version by default. Thus my advice to you - only ever play this game after you have played the remaster and want to compare what they have done better there or want to go achievement hunting in a game you \"already know\" (from the remaster). And speaking of achievements - those are bugged, so if you have to restart the game at any point, anything that should count towards your achievements will not. The solution is to restart steam and then launch the game again. \nIf you find this game stand-alone, do not waste your money on it and go for the remaster instead.", "timestamp_created": 1625155406, "timestamp_updated": 1625161858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94677098": {"recommendationid": "94677098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158478433", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 976, "last_played": 1639853661}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la verdad excelente juego para pasar horas y horas viciando sin parar hasta que tu familia te cague a pedos por ser un inutil de mierda que no mueve el orto de la silla todo el dia, muy recomendado muchachos ahora yendo a jugar el 2", "timestamp_created": 1624991778, "timestamp_updated": 1624991778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94642948": {"recommendationid": "94642948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066116688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 1397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 678, "last_played": 1648549725}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Creo que con el tiempo que tiene este juego, no ha envejecido tan mal, se puede jugar y es divertido.

I used to think videogames were for nerds until I played this masterpiece. As soon as I saw the case in Walmart I knew it was for me, brah! The swole armoured dude on horseback matched the TapOut tee I was wearing perfectly! I asked the store nerd about it and he said something about puzzles and zelda or something. WTF is a zelda?!?! Then he said that you literally are the embodiment of war in this game. I took off my shades and stared at him, the veins on my huge traps popping out like the Incredible Hulk on steroids. \"The embodiment of war?!?\" I screamed, the whole of the electronics section staring now. \"I AM THE EMBODIMENT OF WAR, BUSTER.\" I dropped down did 100 push-ups right there, kids were clapping.  Followed that up with 100 crunches, now the ladies were swooning. THEN I start with the lunges, show off these glutes, now the DUDES is jealous. I got like 15 numbers after and 8 of those were dudes looking to get buff with me at the gym, which is awesome because making fitness more accessible and open is totally rad.\n\nAnyway I threw the game in my shopping cart with my 12 packs of extra magnum condoms, a 40lb Big Boi Brand creatine sack and 28 flank steaks (4 a day, baby). After my 3rd work out, I popped this bad boy in my CD drive, and after 12 hours of figuring how to work my tiny keyboard with my gigantic hands, I finally got started. My life changed after playing this, bro, it was the deepest game I've ever played. There's like angles and demons fighting over earth, but humans are like extinct. Some of the angles are bad and some of the Damons are like good? Really made me think about stuff, like you know, the fragility of it all, the concept of religion, how I could arms as big as the main character, stuff that I hadn't thought about before. Also your sword is huge, bro, and there's blood when you kill stuff, like a UFC fight but COOLER.

I'm sure that playing this game on console would be 10x more enjoyable solely for this reason. Movements feel very 'static' and linear, something you see often in 2010 games. A game having lackluster controls doesn't instantly make it a bad game, however the issue here is that the game is heavily revolved around solving terrain puzzles where you often find yourself needing to go through small holes or having to time your jumps perfectly to reach a certain part of the map. Hence you'll find yourself wanting to ragequit because of this matter quite alot.\n\n- Map design:\nThe developers tried to stick with the 'dark theme' by using similar gloomy color palettes throughout the game which gives the maps a dull and somewhat repetitive vibe.\nFurthermore, I found alot of the terrain puzzles being unclear and I caught myself watching walkthroughs on youtube more than once on parts where I was stuck.\n\n- Killing enemies\nKilling enemies in this game gets very repetitive; there's no actual fun in killing them, you just do it for the sake of getting them out of your way so you can continue trying to solve your dumb stage puzzles for the 100th time.\n\nTo anyone looking to pick this game up (even if its on sale); I suggest watching a couple of gameplay videos first to see if it would be worth your money.

That types are slasher and RPG, in some moments this combination is made well, but also there are some things that I find irritating. But about the story now, in this game we play as one of the horsemen of the apocalypse, he is called War. At the start of the game, we are killed by the demon, but after that, we come back to life after the year out of knowing what was happened in the world. We have been returned to life by Council, they said us what was happened, with that knowledge to get our honor back, we have to restore the balance of the world. To be sure that we will do it, Council gives the power above us to observe. In the whole of the game, developers give us some perfect plot twists, the last of them made truly smile on my face, it's because we get cut scene that shows what will happen at the end, after that, I felt so disappointed, but that plot twist made it the best end of the game, which could ever imagine. Also in-game was the moment that made me laugh, it's the moment in dialogue after we killed the second boss. Now some words about type game combination, that developers use to make Darksiders. About the good sides of that type of game combination, in the whole of the game we're able to fight with one main weapon, two secondary weapons, and six additional gear and equipment. The more we use a main or secondary weapon to fight, the much they are getting more powerful, every they can have a maximum fourth level of power. Even, if we upgrade all weapons to level four, we can make them stronger, to do it we're using special runes, all of them gives different passive, or active bonuses to fight. About the bad aspects of that idea, things we get from chests. In-game we have three types of souls, these are: blue, it's our currency, we can buy everything with using it, all additional moves upgrades, special attacks, and many types of crystals (remember that last thing), green gives us health, and orange gives us fury. So why things in chests are bad in my opinion? The answer is: In the game are many of chest, at some moments are four chests next to each other, and all of them almost always have only souls and that's why many times we take only two of them, rest of them most will not be open forever. In-game as I said before we have many types of crystals in it are health crystals, but we're able to find only about four of them in chests, okay but we can buy them, yes, but there is the main problem they are expensive. We get additional items but we can't use them, because it's completely unprofitable for us. At the end here are some tips about achievements. First, you can end the game with all achievement after one passing the game, to do it you have to choose the apocalyptic difficulty of the game, it will give you some problems at the beginning, but while you're further, the game start being easier (calmly you can die as much as you need to pass the game). Second, to get an achievement called Aerial Predator, to get it you have to kill one hundred and sixty, while you fly on the flying beast. It's not hard, but there is some problem with it. If you forget to make a save before the sequence has started, do it as fast as you can, if you didn't kill enough enemies, or you just die, you must load your save and go back to the main menu of the game, then choose to continue the game. The last one, the achievement is called Dark Rider. To get it you must ride one hundred miles on the horse, it's not hard but here is one problem, the counter can glitch so easy, so when you only get your horse don't get off him and just ride around the arena it's the safest way to do it, even the counter get a glitch, you can load save in which you're at the moment before you get the horse and try to do achievement again.

The artistic design is the brainchild of Joe Madureira, comic book artist of Uncanny X-men and Battlechasers. This distinct art-style is the icing on the cake for the hack-and-slash gameplay. \n\nDarksiders 1 is the most Zelda-like of all four titles. There are classic dungeons, classic unlockable items that allow for additional exploration, and tons of areas you can backtrack to in order to unlock health and mana upgrades. Customization is minimal. You always use War\u2019s sword Chaoseater, but have the option of using a Scythe or Gauntlets as your secondary weapon. You also have a few activated abilities you can take advantage of. You do have the ability to change what \u201cenhancement\u201d is attached to each weapon, but the impact they have is pretty minimal. Combat gets repetitive, but it\u2019s balanced nicely with exploration, puzzles, and scripted action sequences.\n\nSome elements of progression are annoying, like leveling-up your weapons. As you kill enemies, your weapons gain miniscule amounts of experience and become more powerful. The main issue is that only the weapon that deals the killing blow gets any experience. \n\nIn the remaster, the controls have been mostly untouched. This is simultaneously a good thing (the combat controls in the original were tight) and a bad thing (the aiming in the original was way way too sensitive). Fortunately, it hooks right into Steam\u2019s controller API that allows you complete control over inputs and layouts. I had a few crashes while playing the remaster, but mostly my experiences were positive.

I have played Darskiders on both Xbox 360 and PC and I can truly say that the experience on both were absolutely amazing. Controller configuration is superb and the game handles and plays like a dream. Your trusty keyboard and mouse will not fail you either. The game plays just as smooth and fluid on the PC. You can customize and rebind your keys if you need to. The game also offers some controller support, it depends on the controller type you use.\n\nAnswering the call, you fulfil your duty, and ride brining about the apocalypse\u2026 \nYou are War, one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who has set out on a journey to clear his name and find the ones responsible for brining doom to the third kingdom.\n\nThe game is a Semi-Open world experience. To unlock new areas, you will have to progress the main story line to unlock newer areas. You can revisit previously cleared areas as well. This is mainly to find items or secrets you missed the first time around, or were unable to obtain or open before.\n\nAs War progresses through the game you will increase in power by increasing your life and wrath bars. Your weapons also gain experience as you defeat enemies with them unlocking new abilities and moves. The combat for the game is pretty decent and fun. It is pretty much your average Hack and Slash with some Epic combos and finishers. Plus, you are literally one of the Horseman of the Apocalypse, making it ten times more fun and awesome. \n\nWar has a pretty deadly arsenal at his disposal once he starts collecting them. With each new area you unlock you are also met with new mechanics and requirements and you make use of your newly acquired weapons and abilities to beat or meet these requirements. There are some fun puzzle mechanics and platforming to do, but nothing that is overly difficult or complicated. It is one fun filled experience to seek out and explore every nook and cranny of this apocalyptic world.\n\nGraphics:\n\nMore than just impressive! The colours and themes were brilliantly designed to offer us a visual marvel that doesn\u2019t just look pretty but offers beauty in everything it does. No matter where you are there are tons of beaty to be seen. Early mornings or dark nights. There is beauty in everything.\n\nThe game blends are shadows and lighting very well to further enhance the visuals of the game; it is the little things after all! The entire game is one massive world that is so vibrant and filled so bright and unique colours and themes, you can\u2019t help but be amazed by the living art style that the game has to offer.\n\nCharacter models were also created quite decently, with unique appearances and behaviours for every enemy type. NB NPC\u2019s received a whole lot more attention and it is clearly visible through their marvelous characteristics and detailed appearances.\n\nSounds:\n\nSuperb, absolutely amazing! The Soundtrack makes this game so much more enticing! It not only entertains you, but it captivates you! The Soundtrack was chosen well for the game.\n\nThe background sounds bring the game world to life and enhances the overall experience immensely. Voice over artists did a fantastic job with their characters and lines, ensuring they bring their characters to life. \n\nReplayability:\n\nDarsksiders may not have multiplayer or co op mode but it has quite the replay value nonetheless. You can always replay the game on a higher difficulty once you had your fun with story mode. \n\nCompleting your playthrough though will keep you busy seeing as there are numerous collectables and secrets to find hidden throughout the world as well.\n\nMGR Gaming\u2019s Conclusions:\nSpoilers Ahead:\n\nThrough and through a masterful game! They did an absolutely fantastic job bringing the Horseman of the Apocalypse to life with this game. The lore, the story line and the execution are pretty much perfect. I want more, I simply couldn\u2019t get enough of Darksiders. \n\nThe Boss fights were an absolute blast, the world is gorgeous and so welcoming and then there is War! Loyal and honourable to a fault! The journey you two undertake to prove his innocence is so memorable and captivating it just leaves you wanting more! The deeper mystery and conspiracy that takes place makes the entire experience that much more enticing, \n\nLevel design and layout is pretty decent and fun to explore. It is never that difficult or complicated, it offers the right amount of challenge and excitement. The hidden secrets and chests aren\u2019t that hard to find or open once you retrieve the proper tools either. World navigation is simple and quite an enjoyable experience. They pretty much executed this game and its mechanics really well to ensure there is an abundance of fun to be had. As a new game and new franchise, I can\u2019t criticize it for what it doesn\u2019t have yet. However, I would like to see more side quests, and a bigger more open world to explore\u2026 But what we have is totally amazing so far!\n\nThis game and franchise have so much potential and there is so much room for it to grow and expand. I can\u2019t wait to see where they are going to go with this game\u2026 \n\nThe Official trailer for Darksiders.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fx-IWy9hkQ\n\nScore 9\n\nBy: MGRza\nDate: 12 January 2010\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nPlatforms: PC: Nintendo Switch: PlayStation 3: PlayStation 4: Wii U: Xbox 360: Xbox One\nGenre: 3D Platformer: Action: Action RPG: Action-Adventure: Adventure: Beat 'em up: Character Action Game: Controller: Fantasy: Gore: Hack and Slash: Metroidvania: Open World: Platformer: Post-apocalyptic: Puzzle: RPG: Singleplayer: Spectacle fighter: Third Person\nCensor Rating:  Mature: Blood and Gore: Intense Violence: Suggestive Themes\nAge Rating: 17+\nDeveloper: Vigil Games\nPublisher: THQ Nordic\nRelease Date: 5 January 2010\n\nMGR Gaming Steam Curator:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32364038/\nMGR Gaming:\nhttps://www.mgrgaming.co.za\n", "timestamp_created": 1609226986, "timestamp_updated": 1609226986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83432505": {"recommendationid": "83432505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318331675", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1218, "last_played": 1609208692}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es muy interesante el arco argumental del juego, lo recomiendo.", "timestamp_created": 1609199027, "timestamp_updated": 1609199027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83430905": {"recommendationid": "83430905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293402136", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1609283488}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bueno es un cl\u00e1sico de ir matando bichos, subiendo habilidades y dem\u00e1s.

I've been playing through all existing Darksiders games including Warmastered and Deathinitive remakes several times and i just love them!! (which is up to genesis atm of this review)\n\nThe Hack and Slash Action Adventure type has always been my personal favorite type of game and the very most important aspects for me personally to really dive in and enjoy the game is first the character design and cutscenes, second the story, third flashy fighting with good mechanics. Ooooooh boy does Darksiders (ALL games) hit the nail on all of those.\n+ One of the, if not the single best character design I've ever seen and throughout ALL games of the series. I just so love the attitude and personality of every single one of the horsemen. But the one character I absolutely love the most is Samael. He's like the goddamn big babbo ultra doomlord of badassness.\n+ I also really like the Darksiders story and I think most people who do have a thing for the whole apocalypse, end war, demons and angles beating the sh*t out of each other type of story will like it it as well. Though I do admit that it is maybe a bit thin throughout some of the games.\n+ The fighting mechanics themselves throughout all games are awesome I think. Though there different approaches for leveling weapons/gear, upgrading or crafting throughout the series and not everyone might enjoy all of them and I personally do also not like every aspect of it, but for the fighting itself I personally love it. It's flashy while easy to control and there are a lot of boss fights with cool strategies involved. Though please keep in mind that by the time I am writing this review Darksiders 1 is already out for over 10 years, so if you're getting started with the series just now you should not compare it to the fighting mechanics to say for example Devil May Cry 5. But I personally think it is even now still far from being too boring to play the game or unfun or anything. Of course, if the game just released in 2020 you might have expected a bit more depth to the fighting though but for a game that released over 10 years ago this is really good sh*t.\n\nThough I do also have some minor points of critique for all the games of the series, they are in fact minor in my opinion and I would MOST DEFINITELY recommend all games of the series. For Darksiders 1 specifically there is only maybe one really, really minor critique I may have which is a bug that has that seems easy enough but never has been fixed. There is an item which lets you locate artifacts, chests, etc on the map and there is one chest (in Drowned Pass I think) within the game displayed on the map by that item which simply doesn't exist. Many players (including myself) tried to find it for quite a while before it has been confirmed to be a bug, but as I said it was never fixed though it seems to me to be really easy to fix.\n\n--> buy it, play it, love it", "timestamp_created": 1608210995, "timestamp_updated": 1608210995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540238916873931885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82431893": {"recommendationid": "82431893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349266573", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2088, "last_played": 1609287539}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor, muy recomendado.\n", "timestamp_created": 1608042809, "timestamp_updated": 1608042809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82369531": {"recommendationid": "82369531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365851240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1295, "last_played": 1607975375}, "language": "english", "review": "very good\n", "timestamp_created": 1607975424, "timestamp_updated": 1607975424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508823037147521973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82059134": {"recommendationid": "82059134", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034057160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 916, "last_played": 1607678870}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid hack and slash game, slight mechanics required for boss fights.

I played the hell out of this game, beat it every single week, idk why, but it was so fun and simple, no complex combo system, just a simple hack and slash combo system.\nThe story is so intriguing and interesting. I really don't know what to say, but I really love this game.\nPlaying and discovering stuff, backtracking and such.\nBe sure to choose the hardest difficult, you take a lot of damage, but it's still fun :3\nIt felt like a good ps2 game (not diminishing it, just saying how good it was).

That's literally all the combo you can do in the game. It's very simple and the game doesn't ask for you to do too much, but still, they should've added some more.\n- The gear, only two are good, the pistol and the chakran, tho the last one is op and make the gun obsolete, the gauntlet and scythe are practically useless, as far as combo goes.\n- Near the end you lose the option to use the sword upgrades, forcing you to use that op sword.\n- The story, it's very interesting, however it isn't shown in a good way, some characters are shown and talked about, but little are told about them.\n- The game is very easy even choosing the hardest difficult.\n- There were 2 poop sequels, one that turned the game into a rpg and the other that made it soulslike, and there's also a remaster.", "timestamp_created": 1597061435, "timestamp_updated": 1597061547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495931059122085571", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74051759": {"recommendationid": "74051759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034375541", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1401919430}, "language": "english", "review": "Wait a sec let me unistall DarksidersInstaller\nSorry played one time", "timestamp_created": 1597011359, "timestamp_updated": 1597011359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397350996732711792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74035993": {"recommendationid": "74035993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041836698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1010, "last_played": 1597120598}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like God of War and Devil May Cry had a baby.", "timestamp_created": 1596988573, "timestamp_updated": 1596988573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74021373": {"recommendationid": "74021373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088156219", "num_games_owned": 894, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1355, "last_played": 1448174618}, "language": "english", "review": "A very plain hack and slash with not a lot to distinguish it from 10000 other hack and slash games, story and world have a lot of potential but it doesn't take the time to explore it enough to make it interesting, instead it just had repeatative beat em up sequences.

first.\nIf you close the game and want to play the game right after, you need to restart steam to make the achievements count.\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nThe story is perfect, The 4 Horseman of the Apocalypse, The End of the World, Hell and Heaven, its similar to the history at the Christian Bible but with some differences that don't even mention the Holy Bible itself, you don't need to be religious or anything, the game isn't religious or going to make you religious but the concept of the game was taken from the words of the Holy Text.\n[h1] Bugs [/h1]\nI have seen only the one from the Achievements.\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\ni have played the game on apocalyptic and was quite easy, also unlocked the achievements for completing the game on normal and easy at the same time.\nThe game makes you go to the prior maps you have done to collect all the lifestones (increase life) and wrath cores (increase wrath) and abyssal armor shards (ultimate armor) when you acquire the new weapons later in game, and its hard to remember the location of all the chests you have encountered and couldn't be opened at the time.\nThe combat is good, its not so much fun but its good, its not bad and there is a lot of puzzles too. The game is well balanced between puzzles, combat and history, there is a new puzzle every time.\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n-Perfect History\n-Combat is Ok\n-Puzzles are Ok\n-Not Even Close to Repetitive

2016 after I moved on to multiplayers (by this I mean CSGO mostly). But after the country wide lockdown was announced on 24th March 2020 (and extended for several months) we all became literally stuck in our houses with nothing to do mostly. So, I decided to play a couple of singleplayer games and since I have a dual core CPU, I only had a few options mainly so I zeroed in on Darksiders. I started playing on 3rd June 2020 and finished it on 26th June 2020. This is a typical hack and slash game like DMC (that I have played and finished before) though not that colorful and entertaining. The game is heavily inspired from the Prince of Persia (PoP) series in terms of puzzles (door opening, adjusting mirrors for reflection, weighing puzzle etc.) with a look and feel like Gears of War (PC version of 2007). The only difference with PoP here is you can\u2019t walk on walls and you can\u2019t take time backwards. Here you control one of the three horsemen called War who wields a sword (called the Chaoseater) as a primary weapon and there are a handful number of secondary weapons (like a scythe, a chakra (Crossblade), tremor gauntlet used for tremor punches and also a gun quite similar to DMC though the gun is not that powerful). War can also call on spikes from the ground whenever needed in a fight. You also get a grappling chain and a horse (called Ruin) in later parts in the game. The horse can be called upon in certain places but not everywhere throughout the game. The Voidwalker is used to open portals at certain points from where you can hop into some other points. A few weapons (type of laser guns) can also be picked up at some points from the enemies and can also be used against them. There are a wide range of enemies with different attacking styles some easy and some pretty much hard to defeat. Even the fishes underwater are hostile towards you \u2013 they give electric shocks when you come in contact with them. Personally, I had a hard time defeating the teleporting double sword wielding flying blue witches that came in the middle of the game. The game is too long than normal standards and might seem a bit repetitive in the second half when you need to backtrack to the same locations again and again. But the boss fights were like a breath of fresh air as fighting them were challenging as well as pretty entertaining. Before the final boss battle (Abaddon) you get a Mask of Shadows that enables you to see shadowy objects that are usually hidden in an environment. The first thing that you do after getting it is fight your own shadowy self \u2013 that was really good. The final battle requires you to find seven pieces of the Armageddon Blade scattered in seven different locations in the map. There are ten total locations in the map and you need to meet Vulgrim (a merchant) in all those locations otherwise you won\u2019t be able to fast travel (called the Serpent Hole) to all the seven locations from where you need to find the pieces. I missed Vulgrim in one of those ten locations (The Dry Roads) and I had to backtrack there manually to find the final piece of the Blade as fast travel was not available for that location. In the end after killing the Dragon form (The Destroyer) of Abaddon I thought the game ended but then he took the human form and I had to kill him again that pretty much surprised me. The game is no doubt well made and good except for the frustrating backtracking every now and then. I rate it 7 out of 10. But my advice is to play the game with joystick controllers otherwise it will difficult for you to make most of the combos.  \nP.S. My achievements on Steam were not unlocking properly. For example, I defeated the boss Tiamat but that achievement is still locked. This is because this game has an issue with Steam. In order to unlock achievements, you need to play Darksiders immediately after opening Steam but if you play some other games or do something else after opening Steam then the achievements won\u2019t get unlocked properly.\n", "timestamp_created": 1593262193, "timestamp_updated": 1593262193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486267447471618652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71446026": {"recommendationid": "71446026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059361840", "num_games_owned": 1122, "num_reviews": 995, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1090, "last_played": 1380377634}, "language": "english", "review": "It was and it still is one of the best games ever.\n\nPlay as \u201cwar\u201d, the first apocalyptic rider, and fight hordes of creatures from hell.

The story is decent with a few twists and turns backed by some well-done voice acting. While the concept is dark and gritty the cartoonish style of some of the characters and other elements left me a little disappointed. Prime opportunity for some more blood but there is some. Regardless, these are minor gripes and complaints. A major complaint would be the achievement issue. If you close the game and reopen it, any achievements gained will not proc. This means you need to close the game, then steam completely then start it again. The in-game barriers are also an issue, a majority of the time these look accessible but can get you stuck.

This game have a system similar to Devil May Cry where you have to kill enemies before progressing, and the story is very well written. The story is so interesting that gives game +++ to everything.

The game is amazing but short. You can do the whole game in 14 hours may be - or + 2 hours for puzzles. Yes the whole game sadly is short. With 100% achievements you can finish the game in 16 to 40 hours (40 cuz some achievements are missable).

combina buena banda sonora, buenos jefes, ambientaci\u00f3n acorde a lo que pasa en el momento. [/b]\nEn general el juego me gusto mucho, me hizo recordar en su mayor parte a TLOZ.\nYa que habr\u00e1 que:\n-Recorrer Mazmorras\n-Resolver Puzzles\n-Obtener ciertos objetos que nos ayudaran en nuestro camino\nEso y muchas otras cosas m\u00e1s me hizo pensar que ten\u00eda como esa estetica de los juegos de Zelda.\nAdem\u00e1s de que al ser un juego basado en el apocalipsis se mencionan a varios personajes biblicos.\nEn este juego tomamos el control del [b]Jinete Del Apocalipsis: Guerra[/b] el cual al ir avanzando la historia nos damos cuenta que fue traicionado y obligado a cumplir con lo que le dice el \"consejo\".\n\n[h1] PUNTOS MALOS DEL JUEGO [/h1]\n[b] A lo largo del juego vi que tenia un par de cosas malas. [/b]\n\n[i] 1.-Las Cinematicas [/i]\nCuando inicie el juego note que las cinematicas no iban acorde al sonido de estas, ya que, aparecian entre cortadas, se quedaban trabadas o simplemente transcurrian con lentitud.\nPara poder \"Solucionar\" esto tuve que ver tutoriales y consejos que dec\u00edan que hab\u00eda que instalar varios codecs de video, ya que el formato de estos estaba en .mwv y no se si exista ese problema en la versi\u00f3n Warmastered o si tenga que ver el sistema operativo (Lo Jugue Con Windows 10)\n\n[i] 2.-Los Logros [/i]\nY no me refiero a que sean dif\u00edciles de conseguir, sino que, existe un problema en el cual notaras que solo te dar\u00e1 los primeros logros.\nY eso es porque al estar leyendo, parece que cada vez que cierras el juego pareciera que este pierde conexi\u00f3n con los servidores de Steam, por lo que si vuelves a iniciar el juego no te dar\u00e1 ning\u00fan logro que vayas a realizar.\nPor fortuna esto se arregla saliendo se Steam y volviendo a iniciar. Esto se tiene que hacer cada vez que cierras el juego y quieres tener los logros.\nAunque es algo molesto estar cerrando e iniciar Steam cada vez que quiero iniciar el juego para que me puedan dar los logros.\n\n[i] 3.-HORAS DE JUEGO [/i]\nSi bien es cierto que me divert\u00ed cada segundo en este juego la verdad es que su duraci\u00f3n es algo corta.\nPara dar un ejemplo: Me pase el juego en 14 Horas en la m\u00e1xima dificultad, eso incluyendo que estuve buscando la armadura abisal, y tratando de farmear un poco de almas (dinero del juego).\nNo quiero decir que esto en si sea un punto en desventaja, pero como mencione, el juego me lo pase relativamente r\u00e1pido a pesar de estar en la dificultad m\u00e1xima. \nSobre la dificultad no puedo decir con certeza dado a que no lo jugue en sus dificultades mas bajas (F\u00e1cil, Normal) \nLo que si note es que a veces el tiempo de reacci\u00f3n de los enemigos es algo lenta (No todos los enemigos)\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, es un buen juego, tiene un par de errores pero que no logran arruinar la experiencia del juego.\nRecomiendo comprarlo en rebajas o de forma normal y si te es posible, juegues la versi\u00f3n \"Warmastered\"\nYo jugu\u00e9 esta versi\u00f3n dado a que pesaba menos y pues ya lo quer\u00eda probar.", "timestamp_created": 1584761848, "timestamp_updated": 1584761884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557979345321655273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65405502": {"recommendationid": "65405502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198831093150", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1682077644}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si jugastes god of war este tiene un parentesco a mi opinion este es mas diferente buena jugabilidad tanto en teclado como en joystick 10/10\n\n[spoiler]buen simulador de tirar mesas [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1584718484, "timestamp_updated": 1584718484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65101432": {"recommendationid": "65101432", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986906747", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 3156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3156, "last_played": 1351407600}, "language": "english", "review": "It's okay, but you really want to play the Warmastered edition instead of this one.", "timestamp_created": 1584293896, "timestamp_updated": 1584293896, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64729758": {"recommendationid": "64729758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265049787", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 866, "last_played": 1583722646}, "language": "english", "review": "combat just isn't very good and the puzzles are really boring", "timestamp_created": 1583701221, "timestamp_updated": 1583701221, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472972989082336426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64681792": {"recommendationid": "64681792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035310977", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1590166408}, "language": "english", "review": "The last of its kind.

There is room for improvement for many things, but none of them really fall in the bad category to begin with.\n\nFirst reason for it: it's so incredibly angsty-edgy that it's mindblowing, I'm too old for this. The dialogues are all made in this style, and it's just so far from me it was hard to bear.  The art direction is coherent and unique, the actually story underlying is pretty good but spread thinly, you're just doing the next thing because you were told to do 4 things.  Last 2-3 hours got a lot better as the storytelling department realised they can tell a story and that would give more personality for characters, paint the bigger picture, start storytelling and such :)\n\nSecond reason: It's puzzles and progression are... trivial? Basic? Absolutely not stupid because it has some really fun times, but most of the time the various equipment you have just excuses for speedbumps. The gauntlet that can break ice is essential to progress the story at a point, but later just completely random iceblockades take the path you need to take. They are just there to slow you down, but give no \"sense of accomplishment\" that you could pass through them.  Most of the puzzles are so little and self-contained, that it takes seconds to figure out what you need to do then minutes to pull it off simply because of movement speed, running around, draggings stuff. [spoiler] The portal gun allows for some really-really good puzzles though. [/spoiler] I would have loved more of the same caliber puzzles.\n\nCombat in general is pretty solid. Killed about 2k enemies in a playthrough, and while they are unique, they are not *too* unique. Many has same or sameish combos, but what really matters: they can be learnt. You have a very-very generous block/parry, a good dash, and by paying attention to the fight you can combo/control a lot of enemies while dancing around attacks. It's not hard on normal, and I risk to say it's likely newbie-friendly on easy. Just don't buttonsmash. Bosses are gimmicky but good, except the worm one, that was just super boring.\n\nAlso, abyssal chain? More like abysmal chain. It's great fun that you fire it two times to the same spot, and the first one just goes through the hook. Or when the hook's hitbox is two reticle's worth to the right from the texture..", "timestamp_created": 1581800004, "timestamp_updated": 1581800004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619596540927886963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63373974": {"recommendationid": "63373974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871263161", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1578987029}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the greatest game ever", "timestamp_created": 1581491493, "timestamp_updated": 1581491493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63257722": {"recommendationid": "63257722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147793221", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1483, "last_played": 1576091948}, "language": "english", "review": "best game in Darksider saga", "timestamp_created": 1581314156, "timestamp_updated": 1581314156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63186730": {"recommendationid": "63186730", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996990681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1581327207}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1581203771, "timestamp_updated": 1581203771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63172739": {"recommendationid": "63172739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213061060", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1777, "last_played": 1620063629}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the nice game", "timestamp_created": 1581183754, "timestamp_updated": 1581183754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62935652": {"recommendationid": "62935652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093213295", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 1620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1616, "last_played": 1612895160}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Dated[/h1]\nI don't know where to even begin. So here's a list of complaints:\n\n[list]\n[*]Character walks too slow. And the maps are huge. If you want to explore the maps for secrets and loot, be prepared for a slog;\n[*]Teleport stations make you do a 1-minute walk to complete the teleportation. Yeah, that's right. Another slog. Like, you walk to the NPC that teleports you, select where you want to go, then it loads you on a walkway with little platform sections, then you get to your destination. It's genius;\n[*]Lack of combo moves, compared to other games of the genre. Makes for combat consisting only of spamming the attack button;\n[*]Dodge and block are the same button. So if you want to block, you better not have touched any movement keys in the last half-second, otherwise you'll dodge instead;\n[*]Stiff controls that can be unresponsive at times. You click to jump, you don't, not unless you really, really pushed that button one second earlier than when you actually wanted to jump. It's frustrating;\n[*]Long, drawn-out, boring busywork puzzles. They don't test your rationale, they test your patience;\n[*]On Apocalyptic difficulty, why do we even have multiple life bars when most common enemies can just shrug off a whole life bar in one blow? Bosses make this even funnier, when one attack destroys 5 or more entire life bars from you. It's not about balance, it's about communicating to the player how much they're able to endure. As it is, you can never be sure if you're ready for a fight;\n[*]The whole writing is dumb. Edgy protagonist being angry at all times, and everything and everyone being two-dimensional. I cringed at every cutscene, it's awful;\n[*]Lots of glitches on the cutscenes and sound in general, being cut off randomly;\n[*]Steam achievements are broken, requiring you to restart Steam every time before launching the game. That's because it needs to be the first game launched for it to sync your accomplishments. Did you know that game updates count as launching, at least in this aspect? So I had to replay two hours of the game from a previous save just to get the achievement I've earned. Also, there are no retroactive achievements here, nothing checks if you completed the requirements for one after you did, so you really need to keep restarting Steam and making multiple saves if you want them. Actually, not even all that works for some achievements.

I found that these glitches also are attached to achievements. Which was exceptionally frustrating. I eventually had to follow a recommendation I found in one of the discussions; it included turning off my Steam Overlay, restarting Steam, and turning off my friends list off/ or making myself appear offline. Even then this allowed me to get some of the achievements, meanwhile ones I continued to strive for hours, I found out I got only after returning to steam where it said I had unlocked them a while ago.\n\nThis is way to common an issue and whether its Steam's fault or the distributor, it really needs to be fixed.

It fits the same story genre as Devil May Cry.\n\nHowever, the controls for this game are just utterly horrendous. The tutorial, or lack thereof, doesn't explain any of the controls or how they work. Sure I don't like everything handed to me, but having never played a game like this on PC I spent the first hour trying to deduce them before I gave up and had to look at the key bindings. \n\nOther than many of the key bindings being a series of keys that I've never had to use for a game before, some of them are just atrocious. Who the fuck puts more importance in terms of key binding into the mouse wheel than the your right click? Sure lets just make the thing that scrolls (because it's a fucking wheel) serve two completely different functions depending on if you press it down, or scroll, even if accidentally.\n\nSo I did the only logical thing and switched the key bindings to the less retarded option to actually make them combat viable. Sure it became a pain in the ass to use the scythe or the gauntlet, but only the gauntlet is important, infrequently so as I only used it to break ice. However, this led to another problem. Switching these key bindings makes throwing environmental items impossible as no matter how much focus after pressing Q to aim at something, your character will forever throw in a straight line directly in front of himself. Wishful thinking on that keybind I suppose.\n\nThe above reason alone is enough to stop me from ever replaying the game as it just isn't streamlined for PC playing.

Graphics still hold up well even for the original, but overall the game hasn't aged well...\n\nPros:\n*Graphics are easy on the eyes and have a comic vibe to them\n*Some combos are satisfying\n*Characters are pretty cool\n*Story is interesting and original\n\nCons:\n\n*War is slow as hell and this becomes a huge con in the game because I spent more time walking around than anything else, you get wings early on which at first got me excited until I figured out that you can only glide with them for a couple feet and then they disappear, and you also get your horse (Ruin) but only after you complete about 80% of the game and you can only ride him on dirt terrain which only added to my frustration because most of the game takes place in concrete and stone levels...\n\n*Movement is clunky, and for someone who can wield a sword the size of a car like a feather, you would at least expect him to jump a few feet higher, but no, War skips leg day...\n\n*Puzzles suck, I'm not a big puzzle fan to begin with, but I can appreciate a good puzzle when it is good, and let me tell you, the ones in this game are not, they are easy and the very definition of tedium... You can figure out what to do within a few moments, but they decided to add platforming into the mix with floating slates of rock, laser beams, and s***, and War sucks a** at this, I spent a whole level without making a single mistake and still spent an hour moving from one place to another.\n\n*Then there are weapons, gear, items, and leveling up (this is a long and major gripe), if you thought War was slow just wait until you try leveling up, you get a total of five main weapons throughout the story, I finished the entire game and only got to max out his main weapon, you get so little in game currency for upgrades that you eventually find yourself in a situation where all the enemies aside from the zombies take more damage than a hooker during an orgy... So your practically forced to focus on leveling one weapon or suffer the consequences of being completely under-powered for the entirety of the game...\n\n*When it comes to Gear they don't give you stuff to compliment your fighting style at all, its more like trinkets to access other parts of the map that you get to keep after completing more damn puzzles, and some of them serve absolutely no use at all outside of their main purpose...\n\n*Items are simply not worth your time, mainly because of how expensive they are, putting it into perspective you only get around 75,000 to 80,000 soul in the entire game and that's with moderate grinding, if memory serves me right one thing of regular health runs for 750 soul and a large one runs for 1500 soul, which is absolutely absurd since this is the same currency you use to upgrade your weapons as well... To make matters worse, you can only carry one potion at a time and they are disposable after each use... Also, the health potion is the only potion that I ever found to be useful in the game, the others give temporary rage or poison alterations for your weapon, neither of which add a reasonable amount of damage to your attacks, and in combat the enemies, like I said before, are few and far apart so if your lucky enough to kill one or two enemies before the potion runs out then you still wasted a ton of soul, so unless you found the potion lying around in one of the levels (you'll have a higher chance of finding a unicorn, that won't respawn for your information), then you just spent the soul that you could have used to upgrade your weapon instead... \n\n*The camera does what it want's and doesn't give a rat's a** about your opinion...\n\n*Combat is difficult, which wouldn't be a bad thing at all, but it's difficult in the wrong way, war has slow and clunky movements and this doesn't mix well with the hack and slash genre, reason being that your often surrounded and would get combos broken either because the camera didn't let you see that one guy about to rock your world from behind, or the huge gaps between War's attacks gave the jerk the opportunity to hit you anyway, you can't counter or block between attacks, not only that but some attacks can't be countered or will damage you nonetheless, and there is no indicator to tell you what War can and can't block or counter, so your kinda just left to hope for the best, you can also try dodging but Wars mobility is so low that you often get hit anyway, you can eventually find a way to strategize some crowd control; and by that I mean retreating after every single attack, but at that point I personally rather not...\n\n*Everything is scarce in this game, from enemies to items, there are no survivors, just crows which you can mercilessly chase and hack down for a sip of health, whatever soul or rage or health you manage to squeeze from whatever enemy you happen to cross by is so minimal that it barely makes an impact on any of your bars or income, the game is a very linear open world where you get one or two routes towards an end destination and though pretty, I had a very lonely, boring, and frustrating experience crawling through the maps in this game.\n\n***Conclusion, War is actually the deadly sin of Sloth, and he's always late...***", "timestamp_created": 1571547983, "timestamp_updated": 1619579072, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55605812": {"recommendationid": "55605812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198886987138", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1574808167}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is not work", "timestamp_created": 1571080932, "timestamp_updated": 1571080932, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55537780": {"recommendationid": "55537780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191189787", "num_games_owned": 7222, "num_reviews": 2542, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1644770366}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Oyun d\u00fcnyas\u0131n\u0131n en g\u00f6zde, en sevilen Hack & Slash oyunlar\u0131ndan birisidir kendisi. \u00c7\u0131k\u0131\u015f yapt\u0131\u011f\u0131 y\u0131la g\u00f6re ortalama seviyede grafikleri olsa da son derece tatmin edici oynan\u0131\u015f kontrollerine sahip.

Gameplay, al final me di cuenta que sonaba muy interesante, as\u00ed pues lo a\u00f1ad\u00ed en la lista de deseos.\n\nUna vez pude comprarlo y empece a jugarlo me encanto, la historia interesante, todo en Espa\u00f1ol textos y Doblaje, las Luchas contra los enemigos muy chulas, los combates contra los jefes MUY \u00c9PICOS, mucho que explorar y volver a explorar con los nuevos artefactos que vas encontrando durante la aventura, a veces hasta tuvo escenas algo divertidas.\n\nLo jugu\u00e9 en modo f\u00e1cil ya que era mi primera partida aun as\u00ed el juego es dif\u00edcil si no calculas bien los saltos o los golpes.\n\nLo \u00fanico que me saco un poco de quicio, son algunos bugs raros que me encontr\u00e9 y el manejo del caballo que no esta muy pulido y a veces se queda atrapado en sitios raros y para sacarlo sufres un poco XD.\n\nEn definitiva, aunque tiene bugs el juego es genial, es \u00e9pico, cada lucha contra los jefes es inolvidable, recomiendo su compra al 100% sobre todo si consigues el Pack donde puedes pillarte Darksiders versi\u00f3n normal, el Darksiders warmastered edition y el Darksider II deathinitive edition, no lo pienses mas y a\u00f1ade Darksiders a tu

Puzzles are ridiculously easy - to the point of boredom and frustration. The combat is boring unless you're faced with hordes of monsters, but that's rare in this hack and slash title. There is little variety in the enemies you fight in the game. \n\nThey obviously contracted out the world design, because that's one of this game's few redeeming factors. However, when it came to adding content to the world they failed miserably. So many empty spaces. You spend most of your time walking back and forth in an empty world.\n\nThe game is incredibly linear. The story is pretty much non-existent; they give you about a 1 minute summary of the background. Boss battles are pathetic; they have maybe 1 or 2 unique moves that they repeat over and over and over... The bosses are so easy. Cutscenes are forced and there are a lot of them. Often times there are forced cutscenes to show you the door you just unlocked ... in front of you next to the lever.\n\nCamera control is rather awkward, which makes the underwater combat annoying. \n\nThis is a direct console port, so it is a buggy mess that crashes if you ALT-TAB away. The UI will completely disappear at times if you ALT-TAB while playing in borderless windowed mode. If you don't remove the 20 loading videos, you'll spend more time waiting to press 'continue' then you will playing the game.\n\nWant a similar game? Play Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 1.

One you stop expecting something new, it starts to get refreshing just by playing into the things you know and probably love. Its like a warm and funny and gritty reminder of why you probably like the genre.\n\nArt style is probably an homage to WoW now that i think about it, haha.\nAnyhow, i think before you know it, you'll grow to like it. Its likely not changing your world, it wont impress you by having a big, suprising story - but it will let you have raw, wacky fun. And let you life out one of your fantasy-power fantasies \n--- i mean you are a god and basically punch everything dead xD\n\n[h1] So yeah. Its simple, but fun. I cant sell something new or extraordinary to you bc there frankly isnt. But somehow - somehow its something really worthwhile, that i probably wont forget. And i know, when i just want a good time, and enjoy all that fantasy has become, i'll likely check out the sequels. [/h1]\n[b]Ordinary doesnt mean bad, y'know?

But I do know that I first played it on Xbox 360 and it is a shining example of what a \"Triple-A\" release can be if it is allowed to: A game that has almost nothing new but does almost everything right. It's a fusion of PS2-era God-of-War-style hack-and-slash combat with Zelda-style dungeon crawling and equipment gathering, dressed up in a comic-book retelling of the biblical apocalypse, with bulging muscles and growling voices, born from the mind of noted X-Men author Joe Madureira. Darksiders is a spectacle of visual effects and button mashing that looks ridiculous on the surface- but it absolutely works in practice. As a life-long non-fan of the Zelda series, my frequent refrain is that Darksiders is my favorite iteration. \n\nThe player takes the role of no-one less then War, horseman of the apocalypse. Banished to a wasted Earth following a premature triggering of Armageddon, for which he has been blamed, War must tear his way through demons, angels, the walking dead and towering monstrosities to discover the truth. He has his trusty sword Chaoseater and horse Ruin, a variety of other weapons and magic artifacts, and help from small handful of non-hostile NPCs. \n\nA lengthy and meaty game without excessive difficulty, Darksiders is an entertaining romp and certainly one of the better large titles of it's generation. It would then be exceeded by it's sequel, this time starring Death and taking on an Action-RPG bent with upgradable weapons and armor, new worlds beyond Earth and a quest system.\n\nThe death of THQ cast the future of the series in doubt, though not forever, as there is now a much-awaited third entry in the series that I have yet to play.

Sometimes I would just fall through the earth, but sometimes the bugs were amusing like when monsters were stuck in the air. As many has said, I wish there was a neutral recommendation.

It is based on the biblical story of  the arrival of four horsemen of Apocalypse to end the battle between Heaven's Hellguard and Hell's legions to maintain the balance whenever the seven seals are broken.\n\n[h1]\"The Seventh Seal Is Not Broken\"[/h1]\n\nThe game starts off with Earth being a battleground for a barbaric war between angels and demons.Our protagonist WAR( the youngest among the horsemen) arrives to put an end to the Apocalypse.But to his surprise he doesn't find his brothers joining him in this cleansing act.\n\nConfused and angry WAR wreaks hell on anything that comes in his path, killing a large number of heaven's and hell's forces without any hesitation. Soon he ends up fighting a giant mechanical monster called destroyer and during this fight he overhears the conversation between two angelic leaders of their plan to bring the apocalypse on Earth without breaking the seventh seal.\n\nFurious and filled with rage WAR charges at the Destroyer but is easily overpowered and mocked. Seemingly killed during this brutal battle WAR finds himself saved by the Charred Council ( the entites charged by the creator to ensure balance). WAR pleads them of a wicked trickery and manages to get their allowance to uncover the truth and prove his innocence.Will WAR survive the hostile Apocalyptic Earth and its challenges to raise the curtains from a well devised plan or will he succumb, which is left to the player to find out and enjoy this roller coaster of a apocalyptic ride.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nPlayers control WAR through a third person perspective where the game requires players to fight hordes of varied enemies and engrossing boss battles. Another aspect of the game is puzzle soving which needs the usage of correct equipment at the right time to progress through the levels.\n\nThroughout the game there are a number of scattered Vulgrim shops which can be accessed to improve or buy new gear in exchange of souls received by killing opponents. There are also parts in the game where WAR can summon his horse Ruin to assist him in combat and is absolutely essential while facing some specific boss battles.\n\nCombat is the usual hacking and slashing, along with some ground shattering earthquake intensity punches. Different types of weapons for different playstyles are instilled to avoid repetitiveness. Along with combat comes blocking and dash which is needed to avoid incoming attacks or to send a devastating counter blow.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sounds[/h1]\n\nGraphics and sound quality of this game fail to produce the desired effect. Even with the presence of different play areas the visuals are boringly same all around with exception to a few select areas such as Eden which is visitable only once throughout the game.  On the contrary the cutscenes of Darksiders are really well done and are quite motivating for a player to explore the game. The music and in game music gets irritating really soon and there is no major change in this field till the game ends.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n [list]\n  [*]Interesting plot.\n  [*]Satisfactory and enjoyable combat.\n  [*]Awesome Boss Battles.\n  [*]Well created cutscences.\n [/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n [list]\n  [*]Repetitive gameplay and low replayability.\n  [*]Music is well created.\n  [*]Mediocre graphics.\n  [*]Slow mechanics of WAR and under use of Ruin.\n [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nDarksiders is a good enough game to enjoy for the gamers having a taste of Hack-Slash with a really captivating story line. It does lack big time in some areas but it can surely be enjoyed for the first time around. I would recommend it to specific gamers with a liking of fast paced action.

The combats become less frequent, instead being drowned out by boring puzzles where the hardest part is hitting a button at the right time instead of solving them. I found there was a lot of backtracking at this point through levels and War isn't the hastiest thing alive. The last major dungeon was very boring, consisting mostly of solving the same type of puzzle 3 times, but slightly harder each time.\n\nAfter this you've to backtrack and find the pieces of the magic Maguffin that are hidden throughout a bunch of the areas you've been through. Finally, you get to the final boss, the bosses so have far generally been pretty interesting and challenging so I was pretty hyped up for this one.\n\nIt was woeful. The first phase involved doing the same attack to knock down the boss three times and then pressing the dodge button whenever they telegraphed an attack. After that, you went to a new phase where you dodged whenever the boss did one of their incredibly obvious tells with loads of lead time and then hit them a few times. Rinse, repeat, throw in the odd button mash and there you go. Final boss.\n\nNo using all the cool gear you've picked up, no puzzle elements, nothing. Just press dodge and slash. \n\nThe post boss scene wasn't very exciting or interesting and overall the ending left a lot to desire.\n\nI'd probably still recommend the game as the majority of the time I spent playing, I enjoyed.

You play as War, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse summoned to earth after the war was mysteriously started prematurely, before mankind had a way to defend itself against angels and demons. Framed for staring this war, you venture out into the now destroyed, demon-infested world only to find that mankind has gone extinct, and it's up to you to clear your name, and prove your innocence. \n\nThe hack and slash combat is madly entertaining, very well done, and not easy to get bored of or feel like it's getting repetitive. Interesting combos and weapons, allowing you to mix up how you choose to destroy your enemies, whilst feeling like a total badass doing so. And of course there's nothing more satisfying than unleashing the fury of a million\ngods on that one spider you missed that got lucky and attacked you, screwing you up mid-combo.\n\nExploration is also very fun, with hidden goodies and things to find around the world, there's always some goal driving you clear the whole map. The characters were decent, albeit a bit, boring sometimes, maybe? Namely speaking, War. He felt a bit lacking of personality. While yes okay, he is War, supposed to be super serious and all, he just seemed very bland in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, I'd say the game is definitely worth it, maybe not at default price for everyone, but then again it never hurts to get games on a discount instead. Good amount of gameplay, around 30 hours or so. And, of course, achievements! Please note that if you are an achievement hunter, these ones can be very buggy and don't unlock, but there is a simple way to bypass it.

Controlaremos a Guerra, uno de los cuatro jinentes del apocalipsis que es llamado a la tierra porque, supuestamente, se ha desencadenado. Cuando llegamos nos encontramos una masacre por parte del infierno, algo no anda bien y tendremos que descubrir que es.\n\nLa historia es muy entretenida, con bastante trasfondo y alg\u00fan que otro giro inesperado. Guerra es sin duda uno de los personajes mas carism\u00e1ticos que he jugado, con mucha personalidad y sin duda se hace querer.\n\nLas mec\u00e1nicas, tanto de plataformeo como de combate son f\u00e1ciles de controlar y vamos a tener una amplia variedad de movimientos tanto con la espada como con las armas secundarias para segar la vida de todo aquello que se cruce en nuestro camino.

Al mismo tiempo, una vez llegamos a cierto nivel de poder los enemigos son irrelevantes y el mapa se queda un poco vac\u00edo de enemigos.

War makes a deal to be placed back on Earth to find out who was behind the catastrophe and punish them. \n\nIn terms of gameplay Darksiders dosen't stand out from other hack and slash games.\nGame combines combat and puzzle-solving/platforming and has a linear story with semi-open world.\n\nCombat is similar to Devil May Cry or God of War and focuses on combo based sword combat, that means that typical smashing of a one attack shouldn't allow you to make far. But in practice...it's 50/50. Yes, you will use your main attack the most, but you won't get far without others, especially against tougher opponents. \nHere is a problem, after unlocking stun attacks you are basically jacked as they work against 80% of enemies in game, making fights one sided, even more at the later stages where you have all unlockables. \nGame features executions system which dosen't help you in making a game harder, as even near death, enemies could stab you instead of smashin E everytime someone is near death. \nOh and because you can do that on every enemy, those will get repetitive really soon.\nSpeaking of enemies, issue lies in those aswell. Mostly what I can point out is lack of attacks. \n\"Smaller\" enemies in game have only 1 attack, bigger ones and bosses, expect last boss in game, about 2-3 in total. \nEasy to predict and avoid, often those attacks fail and game tries to balance that with more waves or simply, more enemies in one wave. Still, even with those issues, combat is fast paced, fluid and enjoyable. Just too easy, even for a hack and slash newbie like me.\n\nWar main weapon is a sword, he also has two secondaries, and few items in equipment you will get along your journey, yet those often are used only in specific boss  (I will talk about that a little later) or for collectibles. In a fight you should rely on a sword and secondaries much more.\n\nSouls are in game currency which you can get by killing enemies, destroying enviroment, or opening chests.\nYou can spend them in your friendly merchant for new toys, enhancements, attacks, and more!\nBesides that, you can upgrade your health and rage meter by collecting shards, you can use wrath meter to show off your true nature of a demon for a short amount of time, upgrade weapons damage by simply using them, add enhancements to each of them to get bonuses, collect armor, and more. A lot, but afterall, you are War so you better be prepared for a fight. \n\nSecond part of a game is focused on semi-open world and puzzles.\nSemi open world biggest issue is lack of content. Expect collectibles to upgrade yourself, you don't have anything to do. No arenas, no challenges, no sub quests, no nothing. It's beautiful, and I liked to explore it, but it lacks content. \n\nPuzzles are great! But. There is but. I hate that game treats them not as puzzles. What I want to say is, game holds your hand really strong though the game, in puzzle sections aswell. Most of them could be difficult or atleast challenging if game didn't show me what to do in first few seconds. There is only 2 or 3 real puzzles where game dosen't tell you what to do. Shame. Still, enjoyed \"solving\" them.\n\nExpect problems I already mentioned, game boss fights are weak. Most of them includes usage of a item you got in their arena more than the sword fight itself. The last boss fight is the only really good one. Which is a shame because boss fights should show off your skill and performance, not your new toy. Or rather, balance it, atleast!\n\nPerformance was bad for me. Game overall crashed about 5 times, plus I had weird bug with muffled sound like I was underwater, and once I had a game breaking bug which caused me to start the game all over again. \nAtleast FPS didn't freak out, had constant 60 FPS thoughout whole game.\n\nGame dosen't have Multiplayer or Coop mode.\n\nSound design is great!\nVoice acting is good, maybe beside War, he just dosen't click with me, besides that everything else is fine.\nEnemies sound just like they want to rip you apart, soundtrack in game adds climat it should add.\n\nOverall, even with issues, game is great and enjoyable. \nCombat even when too easy, is fun, story and lore in game is interesting, and locations are really good looking as for a game about Apocalypse. Game manages to combine puzzles with combat perfectly! \nStill, have to include many issues this game has, a rather empty world, pretty weak boss fights, and performance.\n\n7/10! \"It's not *death* that you should fear.\"\n\nIf you enjoyed that review check out my curator page!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/31947302/", "timestamp_created": 1537815915, "timestamp_updated": 1541320345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709147155284881592", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44883465": {"recommendationid": "44883465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007150584", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 2170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1865, "last_played": 1561725576}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[b]Darksiders desembarca en PC para reeditar su \u00e9xito en consolas como uno de los grandes lanzamientos de acci\u00f3n y aventuras del a\u00f1o 2010.

Well, actually it\u2019s still as good as it was if you\u2019re looking for a gory, adventurous experience filled with fast-paced action. The game was developed by [b]Vigil Games[/b] and released by [b]THQ[/b].\n\nAt first glance it looks like when Joe Madureira was designing characters and the setting of [i]Darksiders[/i], he was inspired by the [i]Book of Revelation[/i], simply because the game begins with the Apocalypse - angels and demons falling from the sky fighting each other, defenseless people fleeing and trying to save themselves\u2026 and out of nowhere, in the middle of this pure madness appears one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War. However, it turns out that the protagonist arrived unsummoned and the so-called Charred Council blames him for disturbing the balance between Heaven and Hell, which ended up with the demise of the entire humanity. Well, that certainly doesn\u2019t sound good. Anyway, in order to set things right, War is sent back to the Earth not only to restore the balance, but also to find and punish those who are responsible for this whole mess.\n\nIn short, [i]Darksiders[/i] is a well-optimised game that runs smoothly, presents decent graphics along with the atmospheric soundtrack as well as rather unique gameplay. On the way to War\u2019s redemption, there\u2019s a few weapons offering different combat styles, a lot of combos to master, numerous epic boss battles and many challenging puzzles.\n\nSince [i]Darksiders[/i] is a third-person hack-and-slash action adventure game, it focuses mostly on dynamic and aggressive combat, but the storyline is also really well-written and serves as a great completion of the whole game\u2019s image. The combat system itself is simply spectacular in its goriness and flow, especially in terms of finishing moves when enemies are left with just a tiny bit of health, however, those animations don\u2019t work as quick time event (QTE) sequences - you just press the button and voila! No mashing your gamepad or keyboard. The gameplay is rather linear and as War progresses through the game, he unlocks new weapons and abilities, but I\u2019d say that his primary sword Chaoseater is the best all-round and I stick to it most of the time during my playthroughs. Then, there are also the so-called Wrath Abilities, but they\u2019re rather limited, even when fully upgraded. And last but certainly not least, War\u2019s ace in the hole known as Chaos Form; after building up enough chaos energy, he is able to transform into an incredibly powerful fiery demon, being invulnerable and hitting harder.\n\nConsidering that [i]Darksiders[/i] was ported to PC, I highly recommend playing through the game with a gamepad, but if someone is out of options, then a mouse and keyboard will do. Still, controlling War may be sometimes troublesome, especially when it comes to climbing or dropping off the ledges.\n\nAll in all, [i]Darksiders[/i] is a solid hack-and-slash based game with unique gameplay and design. Decent graphics, the atmospheric soundtrack along with a well-written storyline make it even better. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing. So, in the end, 9/10 would slay some angels and demons again.

Una mezcla de g\u00e9neros que originan una \u00e9pica historia de fantas\u00eda con una larga duraci\u00f3n, de entre 30 a 40 horas.\n\nBasado en el mito de los 4 jinetes del apocalipsis, en esta primera entrega de la saga manejamos a Guerra en una lucha por el descubrimiento de una verdad oculta. Con numerosos elementos extra\u00eddos de la religi\u00f3n y de las leyendas relacionadas con el cielo y el infierno, Darksiders muestra un rico mundo lleno de personajes con una trama llena de traiciones y secretos, en ocasiones algo confusa si no se presta mucha atenci\u00f3n.\n\nGuerra se ver\u00e1 envuelto en una encerrona de la que tratar\u00e1 de salir airoso tras un enfrentamiento entre el cielo y el infierno. Un consejo convoca a nuestro protagonista para darle la oportunidad de redimirse por algo que realmente \u00e9l no ha provocado, pero castig\u00e1ndole despoj\u00e1ndole de muchos poderes que m\u00e1s tarde iremos recuperando en el juego.\n\nEl mundo de Darksiders est\u00e1 dividido en varias secciones grandes interconectadas entre s\u00ed alrededor de una zona central a la que habr\u00e1 que volver en varias ocasiones a lo largo de la historia. A\u00fan siendo un juego lineal, hay escenarios bastante amplios, y la exploraci\u00f3n es casi siempre algo prioritario. En los primeros escenarios hay menos posibilidades, pero a medida que se avanza \u00e9stos poseen m\u00e1s caminos escondidos y m\u00e1s profundidad de exploraci\u00f3n. Escondidos en los niveles encontraremos reliquias que podremos vender para conseguir almas con las que comprar y mejorar nuestro equipo-, habilidades especiales, cofres con partes de una armadura especial o mejoras de vida y de nuestro nivel de furia.\nCon una gran similitud a los esquemas jugables que propon\u00eda Soul reaver o Zelda, este juego trata de abarcar una jugabilidad bastante extensa que se va desarrollando lentamente, aunque es cierto que algunos puntos son m\u00e1s explotados que otros.\n\nGuerra tiene una gran libertad de movimiento pudiendo correr, saltar, hacer doble salto, escalar, nadar, bucear, colgarse de cornisas, empujar bloques, etc. Adem\u00e1s ir\u00e1 ganando nuevas habilidades y herramientas que expandir\u00e1n a\u00fan m\u00e1s sus movimientos. El juego es muy inteligente al ir a\u00f1adiendo con cuentagotas todas las nuevas habilidades que se van sumando, llegando a tener hacia el final tantas posibilidades que incluso se nos olvidar\u00e1 todo lo que somos capaces de hacer. Una de las habilidades m\u00e1s destacadas es la que nos permite abrir portales de entrada y salida gracias a una herramienta especial. Los puzzles y pruebas dise\u00f1ados para usar esta pistola abreportales son muy imaginativas y resultan totalmente satisfactorios y divertidos de ejecutar. Otras posibilidades ser\u00e1n la de ralentizar el tiempo para poder sortear peligros r\u00e1pidos, lanzar bolas explosivas y romper barreras para abrir nuevos caminos o la posibilidad de montar a Ruina, el caballo de Guerra, con el que podremos sortear grandes distancias en poco tiempo, as\u00ed como luchar montados en \u00e9l.\n\nEn la 2\u00ba mitad del juego todas estas posibilidades se combinan acertadamente originando una jugabilidad muy rica. De hecho el \u00faltimo escenario del juego es el que mejor dise\u00f1o de niveles y puzzles tiene. La parte mala es que el ritmo de juego no est\u00e1 tan bien llevado, ya que en esta \u00faltima parte del juego se concentran la mayor\u00eda de puzzles donde tendremos que explotar nuestro gran set de habilidades, dejando muchos compases carentes de estas pruebas y saturados de combates muy similares, que pueden resultar mon\u00f3tonos.\nAlgo similar ocurre con el plataformeo, que en la 1\u00ba mitad del juego es bastante sencillo y f\u00e1cil de ejecutar, no demasiado estimulante, pero despu\u00e9s se enriquece y los escenarios nos retan debiendo ejecutar movimientos m\u00e1s precisos y calculando mejor nuestros pasos. El control y movimiento de Guerra se siente relativamente tosco. No responde con rapidez si lo comparamos con otros juegos similares, y lo peor es que realmente entorpece la jugabilidad porque no ser\u00e1 dif\u00edcil que muramos en secciones plataformeras por culpa de este poco \u00e1gil control. Adem\u00e1s, en mi opini\u00f3n, los movimientos suelen ir algo acelerados, lo que vuelve el juego algo alocado en ocasiones adem\u00e1s de dificultar el control y de no resultar est\u00e9ticamente vistoso.\n\nEn general los puzzles son diversos e involucran grandes escenarios y sus mecanismos, as\u00ed como las posibilidades de Guerra para avanzar. Su complejidad va en aumento mientras progresamos, encontrando pruebas muy variadas que poco tienen que ver entre s\u00ed, ya que constantemente se introducen nuevos elementos con los que interactuar.\n\n\nEl combate es bastante solvente. No est\u00e1 tan desarrollado como en otros hack and slash como God of War, ni tiene tantos combos ni posibilidades, aunque disponemos de muchas armas con sus peque\u00f1as variaciones. Una de las particularidades para que el combate resulte m\u00e1s divertido es la posibilidad de usar el escenario y varios objetos en \u00e9l para combatir a los enemigos. As\u00ed por ejemplo podremos arrancar algunas vigas y golpear o lanz\u00e1rselas a las criaturas. Tambi\u00e9n podremos utilizar coches, mobiliario variado o trampas naturales como lava o fosos para acabar con ellos. Tendremos la opci\u00f3n de golpear a enemigos voladores desde la distancia con una pistola o un shuriken gigante, aunque ciertamente no son muy eficaces. Podremos tambi\u00e9n agarrar a algunos enemigos y realizar ejecuciones finales bastante expl\u00edcitas cuando \u00e9stos se encuentran debilitados. Tambi\u00e9n Guerra posee una barra de furia que iremos ampliando, gracias a la que podremos ejecutar algunas habilidades potentes como mejorar nuestra defensa o un ataque de gran alcance.\n\nLos jefes finales son un elemento a destacar, con un dise\u00f1o chul\u00edsimo todos ellos, muy diferentes entre s\u00ed, y bastante complejos en general para derrotar. Habr\u00e1 que seguir una estrategia diferente (o varias) para cada uno de ellos, normalmente implicando elementos del escenario para usar a nuestro favor. As\u00ed, los enemigos b\u00e1sicos no poseen siempre un dise\u00f1o tan trabajado ni tienen este toque t\u00e1ctico particular para derrotarlos con alguna peque\u00f1a excepci\u00f3n, pero s\u00ed es cierto que hay un buen pu\u00f1ado de diferentes tipos de ellos.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de niveles es muy creativo, adem\u00e1s de captar la atenci\u00f3n del jugador con una ambientaci\u00f3n muy cuidada. A\u00fan dada la gran diversidad que hay entre los escenarios, el juego exhibe una gran cohesi\u00f3n en su estilo, dot\u00e1ndolo de una gran personalidad art\u00edstica, aunque recuerda mucho a la imaginer\u00eda del mundo de World of Warcraft. Se encuentran ciertos altibajos en este apartado, ya que a pesar de que la mayor\u00eda de niveles son bastante imaginativos, hay algunos bastante sosos y vac\u00edos, con pocos elementos y que resultan gen\u00e9ricos. Es importante destacar que la mayor\u00eda de escenarios se sienten vivos, con muchos elementos din\u00e1micos y rompibles, por lo que la sensaci\u00f3n de decorados de cart\u00f3n-piedra no tiene lugar en este juego, como s\u00ed ocurr\u00eda en el similar Castlevania Lords of the Shadows.\n\nTanto en el dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico como el sonoro, as\u00ed como la historia, se percibe un gran tono oscuro. El juego es bastante maduro y ofrece escenarios desolados, con una paleta de colores apagados y una m\u00fasica sombr\u00eda. La historia que se nos cuenta es bastante elaborada, con unos personajes muy cuidados y bien representados, incluso los jefes a los que nos enfrentaremos tienen su propia personalidad, ejerciendo de personajes secundarios. Hay muchas escenas de v\u00eddeo donde transcurre la historia con m\u00e1s o menos inter\u00e9s, aunque tampoco el gui\u00f3n se desmarca ni puede sacar pecho, s\u00ed que funciona bien a la hora de presentar nuevos personajes y escenarios.\n\nLa BSO es notable, as\u00ed como los efectos de sonido, aunque en ocasiones \u00e9stos no est\u00e1n lo suficientemente cuidados y se escucha cierto ruido general, sobre todo en secciones de combates. Tambi\u00e9n hay alg\u00fan problema con la sincronizaci\u00f3n de v\u00eddeo y sonido en las escenas cinem\u00e1ticas que empobrece el resultado.\n\nPuntuaci\u00f3n final: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1534834213, "timestamp_updated": 1534834277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44265237": {"recommendationid": "44265237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043176189", "num_games_owned": 1404, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 896, "last_played": 1375203731}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun Game.", "timestamp_created": 1534731347, "timestamp_updated": 1534731347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44256405": {"recommendationid": "44256405", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966052070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 1126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1126, "last_played": 1513558730}, "language": "english", "review": "I was enjoying the combat and theme a lot, but then the game just got tedious with the portal puzzles and boring exploration segments.", "timestamp_created": 1534696062, "timestamp_updated": 1534696062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132211208343506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44246335": {"recommendationid": "44246335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021533360", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1481, "last_played": 1460572443}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]Opini\u00f3n[/h1]\nJuego [i]\"hack and slash\"[/i] con un estilo comic-book americano que narra las aventuras de [b]Guerra[/b], uno de los cuatro jinetes del apocalipsis.\n\nBebe much\u00edsimo de juegos como [b]God of War[/b] o [b]Zelda[/b], pero consiguiendo su propia personalidad gracias a la fant\u00e1stica labor art\u00edstica de [b]Joe Madureira[/b].

that's just heresay. The game itself is quite fun, it's a God-Of-War like game (to the point where you are actually playing one of the four horsemen, War) where you gather souls to buy ability upgrades, weapon movesets and upgrades for certain weapons. Your main and secondary weapons, however, are only upgraded through useage which can become a real drain if you're aiming for that 100%, since the gauntlets are very slow and have a simple moveset.\n\nYour teritiary weapons are what you use to unlock new locations, get to hidden items and so on for upgrades. The story is ok, it's certainly not one that'd win awards, but it's enough to get you motivated to want to complete the game and see what happens at the end and who framed you. It has some mild puzzles throughout the game, however bosses are pretty simple in combat, usually requiring use of whatever new item you unlocked to kill it.\nOverall, I'd say it's a decent and fun game, but I wouldn't have bought it at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1532029965, "timestamp_updated": 1532029965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43627768": {"recommendationid": "43627768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103193980", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1625007302}, "language": "english", "review": "you can pick up chairs", "timestamp_created": 1532019803, "timestamp_updated": 1532019803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43616440": {"recommendationid": "43616440", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997346333", "num_games_owned": 796, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1531969758}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy fuck the game is so bad", "timestamp_created": 1531969822, "timestamp_updated": 1531969822, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.354798555374145508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43615175": {"recommendationid": "43615175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797592427", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 12079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2494, "last_played": 1554728263}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent Game! - [10/10]", "timestamp_created": 1531963058, "timestamp_updated": 1531963058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43599022": {"recommendationid": "43599022", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981140441", "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2927, "last_played": 1518750202}, "language": "english", "review": "This is cool as heck my man.", "timestamp_created": 1531893152, "timestamp_updated": 1531893152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43524583": {"recommendationid": "43524583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041344984", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1398145749}, "language": "english", "review": "Meh slashing.

I started to love it from the first chapter up to the last one, from the first game quest and up to the last boss fight. Its colorful and history attract to it like a magnet, the heroes are charismatic and vivid, and the plot makes you devote yourself to the game on 110%\n\nThe plot causes me the most curiosity - we are met by the ruins of a large and modern city, which are filled with demons of all possible kinds and they all oppose to the angels from the Heavenly Kingdom. It comes to us like The Last Battle, the apocalypse, and in fact, we - the War - is one of the unholy riders of the apocalypse. But something immediately becomes suspicious, and we have to confront both the one side and the other - we were not expected on this party. Later, we get that we have been fabricated and the apocalypse started just through our appearance. War requires all the strength and power to find who started the Last Battle and clean his own name...\n\nGameplay wise this game is a blast to play and its almost hilarious how much Darksiders borrows from the God of War franchise, right down to the combat style, loot system, and platforming, but does it all so brilliantly that it's a cut above it in every way. As I was never a big fan of Kratos and I could not understand why that franchise was as highly rated as it was. Darksiders is a classic case of taking what's already been but build on it until perfection.\n\nBut knock-offs Darksiders earns tones of creative points in its level design, characters, puzzles, diverse environments and intriguing boss battles. The art style is superbly done, and in this day and age with the AAA games industry focusing too much on realism there is something refreshing about playing a quirky game over the top of the world where the nothings real, but everything just looks cool. With the post-apocalyptic sense of nature reclaiming the decimated city streets being taken over by the demons at the same time, the visual style falls somewhere between 'The Last of Us' and 'The Lords of the Fallen'. Unlike most puzzle-based games, the puzzles in Darksiders are actually unique to any game of these genera and fun to traverse and conquer require a fair amount of thought without pushing the player to give up and look up the quick guide on Youtube.\n\n[h1]The verdict[/h1]\nThe game is definitely worth the attention.

You don't save the world. Being one of four Horsemen means you that you came to play only when apocalypse is now.\n\n[i]Design[/i]. I like Darksiders very much for its catchy desing of weapons and armors. I would not say that it is very original but the level is pretty high. Characters and monsters(excluding few low level generic) have great concept aswell.\n[i]Atmospheric.[/i] Ruins of modern civilization mixed with a pieces of hells interior look great. Designers did really good job here. (Ever though that people are more easely facinated with ruins than with functioning architecture?)\n[i]Combat.[/i] Standard. Three main wepons, projectiles, a hadful of combos. Nothing innovative, yet no complaints.\n[i]Difficulty.[/i] If you are some kind of Darksouls fan you won't be close to testing your skills here. Also if you are experienced with slashers, I would recommend hitting hard-difficulty setting righ away.\n[i]Plot.[/i] Does not look poorly, but overall is delivered somehow roughly. An unbelivebly strong being is going to set things right, you probaly know how it's gonna end. So basically the starting point is ravange and War is professinal warrior who doesn't talk much(Death on a contrary is a joker), so without some side stories (and there are none) you can't build intresting script. So no hard feelings.\n[i]Linear.[/i] Wrath of war is \"old-style\" slasher. You basically run corridors and there are forks, but you can't go one of ways because you need to acquire some key or item or ability. You can go back some times to find treasures or to farm, but thas not open world.\n\nWell, you might feel a bit discoureged, cause I named a lot problems. But they are more disclaimers, that you should know about. Over all game is great. Depending on what you seek in hack and slash game it can make in top 5 -10 best. It aged very well and looks good even today. So if you are into swingin swords, Wrath of War if a must try, and worry not...\n\n...

It's tough to play describe Darksiders without going down the rabbit hole of comparing it to other games; \u201cIt's like a more mature Zelda\u201d, \u201cIt's like God of War\u201d, \u201cYou get a literal Portal gun\u201d, etc. Thankfully, the mix and match nature of the design steals (borrows) the best elements from legendary sources, and the fantastic art from Joe Madureira lets it stand on it's own.\n \n  You play as War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, arriving on Earth to partake in the final battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. You've arrived to the party early, and are swept up in a plot of revenge, backstabbing, and servitude involving the defeated army of Heaven, some demon creatures, and The Council of Something or Other. It's a twisted, rather convoluted story that's relayed through sporadic cutscenes varying in tone from epic drama, comic book heroics, lighthearted comic relief, and being metal as fuck. I could barely follow it (it's full of hyperlinks and the game comes with a digital comic if you care), but it sets up a nice background for the brutal action and ruined, fantastic landscapes you must explore to get revenge... on someone. For something.\n \n  Darksiders is heavy on the action; you're not going to travel very far without running into a pack of demons to dismember with sword, scythe, pistol, or any of the various tools you collect throughout the adventure. The combat system is more free-form than most other \u201ccharacter action\u201d games, asking you to chain together simple special moves rather than memorize long strings of button presses to pull off intricate combos. The game does a good job of slowly introducing the basics of the combat, then adding onto it once you grasp how it works; you'll go from button mashing to finger-twisting controller acrobatics by the end. As you use each main weapon it increases in level, allowing you to unlock more moves for them or upgrade the ones you already have by spending Souls (currency awarded for defeating enemies) at a shop.\n \n  While most encounters are typical melee affairs where you beat on hordes of enemies until a prompt appears above their heads and you deliver a gruesome finishing move, there is plenty of variety to keep the action from getting stale. Aside from the expected arena fights and boss battles, many of the objectives in Darksiders are based around to puzzle-solving, be it figuring out how to reach areas with the many tools you're given or how to deal with a group of creatures blocking your progress. As previously stated, the exploration is not far off from a Zelda game; You'll enter themed \u201cdungeons\u201d (some of them incredibly massive and complex), discover tools to help you advance, and fight a boss at the end of the stage that most likely involves the newest addition to your arsenal being it's weakness. There isn't much hand-holding here; you're expected to experiment with what you're given and use observational skills to get to the solution. It's rewarding to puzzle things out on your own, even if the goals aren't always apparent.\n \n  A couple issues arise from the game constantly adding new abilities to War. One is the menu system; while it looks slick, it's rather daunting and isn't the best at conveying information. Just when you get used to the controls and have your hotkeys nailed down, you're given yet another tool or sub-weapon and have to shuffle everything around again. If you're playing on a controller it's not uncommon to run into an environmental puzzle and have to pause the game completely, making sure you have access to quick-swapping the abilities needed. Another is some of the cooler concepts are underutilized. For instance: You gain access to a badass-looking horse, only to ride it a short distance before you're dismounted and have to go into a claustrophobic, lengthy dungeon. Once you emerge, you've all but forgotten about it and it's only available in very limited areas. Same goes for the Portal gun... after the initial dungeon where it's introduced, it's barely a factor. Kind of disappointing for a game that let's you revisit most of it's stages.\n \n  Darksiders is a competent and solid action game. With it's unique art style and mind-bending dungeons, it's still a blast to play even eight years after it's initial release. It's deceptively lengthy, but remains engaging until the end thanks to the constant evolution of War's toolkit. It might be guilty of \u201cborrowing\u201d from other games piecemeal, but it does so with the purpose of creating it's own unique vision of comic book apocalypse badassery and it succeeds.", "timestamp_created": 1523721346, "timestamp_updated": 1523721346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41474616": {"recommendationid": "41474616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060576203", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 604, "playtime_forever": 1966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1966, "last_played": 1558733495}, "language": "english", "review": "Stunning visuals, addictive gameplay and an engrossing story.

Una mezcla de g\u00e9neros que originan una \u00e9pica historia de fantas\u00eda con una larga duraci\u00f3n, de entre 20 a 25 horas.\n\nBasado en el mito de los 4 jinetes del apocalipsis, en esta primera entrega de la saga manejamos a Guerra en una lucha por el descubrimiento de una verdad oculta. Con numerosos elementos extra\u00eddos de la religi\u00f3n y de las leyendas relacionadas con el cielo y el infierno, Darksiders muestra un rico mundo lleno de personajes con una trama llena de traiciones y secretos, en ocasiones algo confusa si no se presta mucha atenci\u00f3n.\n\nGuerra se ver\u00e1 envuelto en una encerrona de la que tratar\u00e1 de salir airoso tras un enfrentamiento entre el cielo y el infierno. Un consejo convoca a nuestro protagonista para darle la oportunidad de redimirse por algo que realmente \u00e9l no ha provocado, pero castig\u00e1ndole despoj\u00e1ndole de muchos poderes que m\u00e1s tarde iremos recuperando en el juego.\n\nEl mundo de Darksiders est\u00e1 dividido en varias secciones grandes interconectadas entre s\u00ed alrededor de una zona central a la que habr\u00e1 que volver en varias ocasiones a lo largo de la historia.  A\u00fan siendo un juego lineal, hay escenarios bastante amplios, y la exploraci\u00f3n es casi siempre algo prioritario. En los primeros escenarios hay menos posibilidades, pero a medida que se avanza \u00e9stos poseen m\u00e1s caminos escondidos y m\u00e1s profundidad de exploraci\u00f3n. Escondidos en los niveles encontraremos reliquias que podremos vender para conseguir almas con las que comprar y mejorar nuestro equipo-, habilidades especiales, cofres con partes de una armadura especial o mejoras de vida y de nuestro nivel de furia.\nCon una gran similitud a los esquemas jugables que propon\u00eda Soul reaver o Zelda, este juego trata de abarcar una jugabilidad bastante extensa que se va desarrollando lentamente, aunque es cierto que algunos puntos son m\u00e1s explotados que otros.\n\nGuerra tiene una gran libertad de movimiento pudiendo correr, saltar, hacer doble salto, escalar, nadar, bucear, colgarse de cornisas, empujar bloques, etc. Adem\u00e1s ir\u00e1 ganando nuevas habilidades y herramientas que expandir\u00e1n a\u00fan m\u00e1s sus movimientos. El juego es muy inteligente al ir a\u00f1adiendo con cuentagotas todas las nuevas habilidades que se van sumando, llegando a tener hacia el final tantas posibilidades que incluso se nos olvidar\u00e1 todo lo que somos capaces de hacer. Una de las habilidades m\u00e1s destacadas es la que nos permite abrir portales de entrada y salida gracias a una herramienta especial. Los puzzles y pruebas dise\u00f1ados para usar esta pistola abreportales son muy imaginativas y resultan totalmente satisfactorios y divertidos de ejecutar. Otras posibilidades ser\u00e1n la de ralentizar el tiempo para poder sortear peligros r\u00e1pidos, lanzar bolas explosivas y romper barreras para abrir nuevos caminos o la posibilidad de montar a Ruina, el caballo de Guerra, con el que podremos sortear grandes distancias en poco tiempo, as\u00ed como luchar montados en \u00e9l.\n\nEn la 2\u00ba mitad del juego todas estas posibilidades se combinan acertadamente originando una jugabilidad muy rica. De hecho el \u00faltimo escenario del juego es el que mejor dise\u00f1o de niveles y puzzles tiene. La parte mala es que el ritmo de juego no est\u00e1 tan bien llevado, ya que en esta \u00faltima parte del juego se concentran la mayor\u00eda de puzzles donde tendremos que explotar nuestro gran set de habilidades, dejando muchos compases carentes de estas pruebas y saturados de combates muy similares, que pueden resultar mon\u00f3tonos.\nAlgo similar ocurre con el plataformeo, que en la 1\u00ba mitad del juego es bastante sencillo y f\u00e1cil de ejecutar, no demasiado estimulante, pero despu\u00e9s se enriquece y los escenarios nos retan debiendo ejecutar movimientos m\u00e1s precisos y calculando mejor nuestros pasos. El control y movimiento de Guerra se siente relativamente tosco. No responde con rapidez si lo comparamos con otros juegos similares, y lo peor es que realmente entorpece la jugabilidad porque no ser\u00e1 dif\u00edcil que muramos en secciones plataformeras por culpa de este poco \u00e1gil control. Adem\u00e1s, en mi opini\u00f3n, los movimientos suelen ir algo acelerados, lo que vuelve el juego algo alocado en ocasiones adem\u00e1s de dificultar el control y de no resultar est\u00e9ticamente vistoso.\n\nEn general los puzzles son diversos e involucran grandes escenarios y sus mecanismos, as\u00ed como las posibilidades de Guerra para avanzar. Su complejidad va en aumento mientras progresamos, encontrando pruebas muy variadas que poco tienen que ver entre s\u00ed, ya que constantemente se introducen nuevos elementos con los que interactuar.\n\n\nEl combate es bastante solvente. No est\u00e1 tan desarrollado como en otros hack and slash como God of War, ni tiene tantos combos ni posibilidades, aunque disponemos de muchas armas con sus peque\u00f1as variaciones. Una de las particularidades para que el combate resulte m\u00e1s divertido es la posibilidad de usar el escenario y varios objetos en \u00e9l para combatir a los enemigos. As\u00ed por ejemplo podremos arrancar algunas vigas y golpear o lanz\u00e1rselas a las criaturas. Tambi\u00e9n podremos utilizar coches, mobiliario variado o trampas naturales como lava o fosos para acabar con ellos. Tendremos la opci\u00f3n de golpear a enemigos voladores desde la distancia con una pistola o un shuriken gigante, aunque ciertamente no son muy eficaces. Podremos tambi\u00e9n agarrar a algunos enemigos y realizar ejecuciones finales bastante expl\u00edcitas cuando \u00e9stos se encuentran debilitados. Tambi\u00e9n Guerra posee una barra de furia que iremos ampliando, gracias a la que podremos ejecutar algunas habilidades potentes como mejorar nuestra defensa o un ataque de gran alcance.\n\nLos jefes finales son un elemento a destacar, con un dise\u00f1o chul\u00edsimo todos ellos, muy diferentes entre s\u00ed, y bastante complejos en general para derrotar. Habr\u00e1 que seguir una estrategia diferente (o varias) para cada uno de ellos, normalmente implicando elementos del escenario para usar a nuestro favor. As\u00ed, los enemigos b\u00e1sicos no poseen siempre un dise\u00f1o tan trabajado ni tienen este toque t\u00e1ctico particular para derrotarlos con alguna peque\u00f1a excepci\u00f3n, pero s\u00ed es cierto que hay un buen pu\u00f1ado de diferentes tipos de ellos.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de niveles es muy creativo, adem\u00e1s de captar la atenci\u00f3n del jugador con una ambientaci\u00f3n muy cuidada. A\u00fan dada la gran diversidad que hay entre los escenarios, el juego exhibe una gran cohesi\u00f3n en su estilo, dot\u00e1ndolo de una gran personalidad art\u00edstica, aunque recuerda mucho a la imaginer\u00eda del mundo de World of Warcraft. Se encuentran ciertos altibajos en este apartado, ya que a pesar de que la mayor\u00eda de niveles son bastante imaginativos, hay algunos bastante sosos y vac\u00edos, con pocos elementos y que resultan gen\u00e9ricos. Es importante destacar que la mayor\u00eda de escenarios se sienten vivos, con muchos elementos din\u00e1micos y rompibles, por lo que la sensaci\u00f3n de decorados de cart\u00f3n-piedra no tiene lugar en este juego, como s\u00ed ocurr\u00eda en el similar Castlevania Lords of the Shadows.\n\nTanto en el dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico como el sonoro, as\u00ed como la historia, se percibe un gran tono oscuro. El juego es bastante maduro y ofrece escenarios desolados, con una paleta de colores apagados y una m\u00fasica sombr\u00eda.  La historia que se nos cuenta es bastante elaborada, con unos personajes muy cuidados y bien representados, incluso los jefes a los que nos enfrentaremos tienen su propia personalidad, ejerciendo de personajes secundarios. Hay muchas escenas de v\u00eddeo donde transcurre la historia con m\u00e1s o menos inter\u00e9s, aunque tampoco el gui\u00f3n se desmarca ni puede sacar pecho, s\u00ed que funciona bien a la hora de presentar nuevos personajes y escenarios.\n\nLa BSO es notable, as\u00ed como los efectos de sonido, aunque en ocasiones \u00e9stos no est\u00e1n lo suficientemente cuidados y se escucha cierto ruido general, sobre todo en secciones de combates. Tambi\u00e9n hay alg\u00fan problema con la sincronizaci\u00f3n de v\u00eddeo y sonido en las escenas cinem\u00e1ticas que empobrece el resultado.\n\n8'2", "timestamp_created": 1523126873, "timestamp_updated": 1523126873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41277963": {"recommendationid": "41277963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117209225", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 3282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3282, "last_played": 1688037604}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Personally, few things are out there richer than Darksiders universe, thing that makes me like it and be so passionated about it. \n\nDarksiders 1 is a brutal hack and slash, with a deep, very interesting world, and exceptional personalities within their characters.\n\nMust try.", "timestamp_created": 1522881250, "timestamp_updated": 1688937740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41238845": {"recommendationid": "41238845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076206247", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2011, "last_played": 1521426772}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendado, vale la pena jugarlo, tiene su cositas pero no estropea el juego tanto.\n\n+ Tiene una trama interesante y entretenidad.\n+ Buena actuaci\u00f3n (voz) y personajes.\n+ Buenos graficos de 2010 y no consume tantos recursos.\n\n-/+ Pese a que uno puede viajar a ciertos lugares a gusto propio, No hay misiones secundarias.\n-/+ Un poco fastidioso la selecci\u00f3n de las armas por lo que s\u00f3lo dan 3 espacios y 8 usables y pues toca estar cambiando.\n\n- Pesimo sistema de apuntado, la camara independiente de la mira, por lo que si uno quiere girar tiene que arrastrarla hasta el borde de la pantalla.\n- Si uno se acerca al borde, as\u00ed se oprima el boton de saltar el personaje se tira al vacio.\n\nMe gust\u00f3 el juego, ya me un\u00ed al la saga.", "timestamp_created": 1522711430, "timestamp_updated": 1522711430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41222182": {"recommendationid": "41222182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320121379", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1596042299}, "language": "english", "review": "God Of War PC !!", "timestamp_created": 1522653039, "timestamp_updated": 1522653039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532429873943328857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41125230": {"recommendationid": "41125230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053099554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1394305224}, "language": "english", "review": "5/10", "timestamp_created": 1522311688, "timestamp_updated": 1522311688, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419954210519790649", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41097728": {"recommendationid": "41097728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143750334", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 7230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6713, "last_played": 1522134164}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fantastic game.

From games like Devil May Cry to even God of War, combat has always been a prime focus on their respective games, and the same can be said for a lot of hack-and-slash games out there. However in a game like Darksiders, it does something pretty rare that you don't see in a lot of games in its genre, and that's combining the hack-and-slash combat to a more puzzle/exploration driven game like you'd see in the Legend of Zelda series.\n\nFirst off lets focus on the gameplay. in terms of the combat-side of the gameplay, it's your typical hack-and-slash affair, with your weapons doing different comboes based on the button input, upgrading them as you use them overtime, and buying new comboes to add to your arsenal, however that's where the combat goes as it's a bit bare bones. While you do get to buy new comboes for more choice, it doesn't really add much depth considering a lot of the attacks don't mesh well with each other. Regardless if you're in a middle of a combo with your Chaoseater (the primary weapon of the game) there's nothing new you can do when you switch to your scythe or gauntlets, the latter being the most underdeveloped in the game (unless you count the tools then Strife's gun takes the cake.) While this may be a turn off for plenty of hack-and-slash fans, I'd argue that it makes up for it with it's other side of the gameplay: the exploration and the puzzles. Now if you've ever played a Legend of Zelda game, you will find your familiar bells and whistles. You have a bunch of tools (some of them can be used for combat) to traverse the land you roam. The tools being the key to help you solve the puzzles in their respective dungeons, fighting a boss in the end that's weak to the tool that you gained in said dungeon, and increasing your health cap when the boss is finished, or you can stray away from the destination to find some chests that give you some items or collectibles that may aid you in your journey. Now considering the exploration based gameplay integrated here, some people may be turned off by the fact that you have to backtrack all over the world to find some collectibles that you missed, but it's not that annoying due to the shopkeeper being a fast travel area for you once you find more than one of his spots. When you look at it on paper, it seems like a weird concept, but it does pay off, even though there were some setbacks (the combat being an example).\n\nIn terms of graphics and Artstyle, the game looks pretty good for it's time. Nothing majorly fantastic like say Metroid Prime 3 or the Arkham games, but the game does hold up, and the artstyle really looks good. It does give off the vibe that you're in a post-apocalyptic earth while having some diverse areas that make a lot of the places stand out from each other, and more easier to remember them by. Some of the monsters in the game look pretty cool, from the big brute demons, to the bosses, to even the high tech gear that the angels in the game contrast with each other pretty well. One thing I cannot for the life of me take seriously is the design for War, the main protagonist of the game. His design is so needlessly complex to the point that he looks like he's trying way to hard to be dark and edgy for the sake of it.\n\nBoth the music and the story are easily the weakest aspects of the game, with the former being pretty non-existant majority of the game, and the latter being a story about a horseman of the apocalypse trying to prove his innocent by finding the man responsible for bringing armagheddon, and that's pretty much it. \n\nSo if you're a fan of hack-and-slash games, and wants to try out something new, or if you are a Legend of Zelda fan and want to try out a non-TLOZ game,  I'd recommend this. If you're neither of those fans, then I'd hesitate to recommend this since it's more of it's own experimental thing (which it does fine, don't get me wrong) rather than a game that shows what hack-and-slash or puzzle/exploration based games are all about.", "timestamp_created": 1519099442, "timestamp_updated": 1519099442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40174634": {"recommendationid": "40174634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124560056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1175, "last_played": 1517615913}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego en verdad muy bueno.

Comenc\u00e9 pasandome aquel reboot de Devil May Cry (y algunos fans se me echar\u00e1n al cuello por empezar por ese y no por los de PS2). El caso es que me dej\u00f3 muy buen sabor de boca. Poco despu\u00e9s me compr\u00e9 Darksiders.\n\n\u00bfCU\u00c1L ES MI PROBLEMA CON DARKSIDERS?\n\nMi problema con Darksiders es, de forma muy breve, que me cansa jugarlo.\nPero \u00e9sto no lo digo porque me d\u00e9 la gana o por aquello de \"es mi opini\u00f3n y mi exeperiencia subjetiva bla bla bla\", sino que tengo una serie de cr\u00edticas que hacerle al juego las cuales (creo yo) son las razones por las que me ha resultado tedioso y hasta agotador pas\u00e1rmelo.\n\nPROBLEMA 1, LA C\u00c1MARA: Mi problema con la c\u00e1mara de Darksiders seguramente sea mi problema m\u00e1s subjetivo de todos los que dir\u00e9 a continuaci\u00f3n. La c\u00e1mara est\u00e1 cerca de nuestro personaje, lo cual te obliga a moverla bastante para mirar a tu alrededor, fijarte en los escenarios, buscar objetos escondidos... Si esto lo combinas con que su velocidad de movimiento es relativamente lenta y que en cuanto nos ponemos a andar la c\u00e1mara vuelve a fijarse mirando al frente (sin mucha visi\u00f3n perif\u00e9rica); nos queda que, o bien me paso todo el juego pele\u00e1ndome con la c\u00e1mara cada vez que quiero observar el mundo que me rodea, o bien me canso de luchar y me limito a mirar al frente e ir directo al lugar de la misi\u00f3n.\n\nPROBLEMA 2, EL DETALLE: En todo el recorrido del juego no recuerdo ni unas vistas espectaculares, peque\u00f1os momentos que me hayan llamado la atenci\u00f3n ni ning\u00fan decorado hecho con especial cari\u00f1o.

Su historia esta muy buena, aunque siempre deja uno que otro hueco que supongo se complementara con los siguientes juegos de la saga, el tema de los objetos y sus funciones es fenomenal, todos tienen un papel importante para el desarrollo de la historia, los personajes est\u00e1n bien para mi gusto aunque algunas veces logra fastidiar un poco la personalidad toda badass del protagonista (Guerra) pero de resto esta genial. Finalizando, el juego lo disfrut\u00e9 much\u00edsimo aunque no puedo terminar este an\u00e1lisis sin resaltar o hacer nombre a factores negativos. Lamentablemente y muy pero muy lamentablemente la banda sonora no es relevante y se nota mucho su ausencia, en el transcurso del juego logr\u00e9 encontrar aproximadamente 3 bugs que fastidiaron un poco pero solo aparecieron en una peque\u00f1a parte de alguna de las m\u00faltiples zonas, aunque tambi\u00e9n hay uno supermolesto con los logros de Steam, no los marco y ya lo acab\u00e9. Tambi\u00e9n me hubiera gustado que la historia fuera m\u00e1s profunda porque ofrece un buen material, pero solo es esperar lo que nos ofrecen los siguientes DarkSiders.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n a Darksiders lo punt\u00fao 7.5 / 10, aunque es uno de mis juegos favoritos creo que es la apreciaci\u00f3n justa debido a que le hace falta un poco m\u00e1s aunque es justificable para un juego del 2009, lo recomiendo al 100% para todo tipo de personas en general, no se arrepentir\u00e1n de hacer esta compra y sobre todo si aprovechan el Darksiders Franchise Pack en ofertas, es muy econ\u00f3mico y es una buena inversi\u00f3n.\n\nP.D. No se gu\u00eden de los an\u00e1lisis negativos porque la mayor\u00eda de estos habla de problemas de optimizaci\u00f3n, supongo que es por la GPU que tienen, a mi me ando perfectamente.\n", "timestamp_created": 1511653384, "timestamp_updated": 1511708363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37592485": {"recommendationid": "37592485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363361461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1274, "last_played": 1562122775}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the first games I remember ever completing.

Set in an apocalyptic Earth, after the \"End War\" between Heaven and Hell has started, you play as War, one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The story starts with War being sent to Earth during the Apocalypse, only to be accused of causing it himself; he must then embark on a quest to clear his name, by finding those responsible.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid; I've seen it mentioned as a mix of God of War and Legend of Zelda; while I'm not familiar with Zelda games, I can see the similarities to God of War, which I've played. The combat is great, there's three different weapons, plus several enhancements that you can equip your weapons with. There's also exploration and puzzle-solving, which make a good portion of the gameplay, and it's very well implemented. And that's without mentioning the collectibles, as there's lots of them, going from the already mentioned enhancements, to special items that grant you souls (which work as currency).\n\nThe story is excellent. While it draws inspiration from the biblical tales of the Apocalypse, having four horsemen and all, it still has its own spin to it.

Set in an apocalyptic Earth, after the \"End War\" between Heaven and Hell has started, you play as War, one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The story starts with War being sent to Earth during the Apocalypse, only to be accused of causing it himself; he must then embark on a quest to clear his name, by finding those responsible.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty solid; I've seen it mentioned as a mix of God of War and Legend of Zelda; while I'm not familiar with Zelda games, I can see the similarities to God of War, which I've played. The combat is great, there's three different weapons, plus several enhancements that you can equip your weapons with. There's also exploration and puzzle-solving, which make a good portion of the gameplay, and it's very well implemented. And that's without mentioning the collectibles, as there's lots of them, going from the already mentioned enhancements, to special items that grant you souls (which work as currency).\n\nThe story is excellent. While it draws inspiration from the biblical tales of the Apocalypse, having four horsemen and all, it still has its own spin to it. A creator is mentioned in passing, but has no real relevance to the story; War works for the \"Charred Council\", which seeks to maintain a balance between the forces of Heaven and Hell, and each of those factions has its own leader. The soundtrack is another solid point for this game, with some pretty good tracks.\n\nWell, I think that's all I have to say about Darksiders.

But this game finds a perfect balance between those two. I really enjoy 'limited' open-world games, such as The Witcher 2, where you get a big hub to explore, but it is still possible to explore the entire map without sinking hundreds of hours into it.  I didn't enjoy The Witcher 3 or games like Skyrim. \n\nFirst, let me explain how the game works exactly without spoiling. You play as War, one of the Four Horsemen, and you've basically been summoned to save the world from demons. Killing enemies and finding certain chests reward you with Souls. Souls can be spent on Life Essence (Health Potions), Rage Essence (which fills you with Rage, allowing you to use a super-ability, there's like 5 you can choose from) and permanent life increases, ability upgrades, new attacks,...\nThe game is semi-open-world, meaning you get to reasonably big hubs across the world and get to explore them one by one, much like the first two Witcher games.\n\nSo what exactly makes this game good? Well, here's a list of pro's & cons that came off the top of my head.\n\nPro's:\n-Visually fine, it's clearly outdated but it doesn't look like complete rubbish and is still appealing\n-Entertaining combat\n-Travelling: Running across the world with your horse can be entertaining, but also boring. There's 'serpent holes' in the game, which is pretty much just a quick travel feature, making it easy to go to objectives around the map.\n-Parcour: The parcour in this game is quite smooth and entertaining. Just climbing walls, but also using your grappling hook, portals,... is fun.\n-Puzzles are fun!\n\nCons:\n-Repetitiveness and drawn out: At the start it's not much of a problem, but towards the end, when you've unlocked all skills, the combat does get a bit stale. The last 6 hours or so are all with the same skill set, and unless I'm terrible wrong, you always perform the same, optimal combo. The surroundings and opponents cause for the same issue. There's a lot of gray and sand/dust around the world, with the exception of a small jungle and a few bits of snow. The story felt drawn out towards the end, when I thought I was near the ending, I had to do another few long quests that felt a bit unnecessary. I should add that I played through this entire game like 8-10 hours a day, but when I got to the end I got stuck and quit the game for a good month because it started feeling repetitive.\n-Serpent holes: though the quick travel is fun, for some reason you always have to run and jump across this weird path in some kind of space environment whenever you want to quick travel, and it felt really boring after a while.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask!", "timestamp_created": 1500629802, "timestamp_updated": 1500629994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33637939": {"recommendationid": "33637939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033785539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1477909570}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent remaster for an awesome hack & slash title. \n\nGreat Graphics, Sound, Gameplay, Art, Level of detail in zones, weapons, combos etc.\n\nSure you gotta grind through some tedious bits, but overall Darksiders is definitely worth it. \nIf you haven't played this game, and it's sequel (DS2) yet, I would definitely recommend them both, especially with Darksiders 3's release just around the corner.", "timestamp_created": 1500410907, "timestamp_updated": 1500410907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33619258": {"recommendationid": "33619258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203249452", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 973, "last_played": 1500336964}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego bastante divertido y dificil si le subes la dificultad.El sistema de combate esta bien hecho pero ha llegado un punto en el juego que de tantos puzzles parecia que estaba jugando al portal, demasiados mini-bosses y demasiado relleno para llegar al boss oficial.Tardas 40min en llegar al boss y 5 el derrotarle. \u00bfworth?.

So please take this review with some heavy salt, I liked this game & I may not remember all the flaws this game had/has instead remembering all the good.[/b][/u]\n\nI bought [b]Darksiders[/b] on December 1, 2013, for [i]$3.99[/i] US dollars on the Winter sale 2013 & I played a total of [i]40 hours[/i]. I\u2019ve aslo got the [b]Darksiders Warmastered Edition[/b], for free since I owned the original game, but this review is for [b]Darksiders[/b] the non-warmastered edtion.\n\n[b]Darksiders[/b] is a [i]3D, Single-player, 3rd Person, Hack & Slash, Plat-former, Puzzle, Action, Adventure Game[/i] with [i]Zelda-isk/God Of War[/i] (& Other Games too*) elements.\n\nThis game is best played with a Game-Pad, Yes I did play this game with a Game-Pad, & the Achievements are broken in this title. If you alt-tab &/or ctrl-alt-deleted out of the game, then you may not get the Achievements; this is a known & old bug from this game! I\u2019ve beat the game and many of the Achievements you get for killing of the bosses I did not get due to that reason.\n\nThis game is a simple one at it\u2019s core. You play as one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse; [b]War[/b]. As [b]War[/b], you smack things with your Giant As **** Sword till they die a Bloody & Gory Deaths; you need to dodge too though. You do get some side weapons, but Sword is here to stay; same with armor. If/when you upgraded your sword, if you can call it that, you can\u2019t switch out the sword; same goes for the \u201carmor\u201d if you found it that is, you where stuck with it.\nThe combat is fun but they tied the Dodge button with the block, if I remember right. Blocking was all but forgot by me, since I dodge and never used Block if at all. Though if I did block, I had a hard time doing so due to the Dodge & Block buttons where bound. Some executions can get old pretty quick, but the combat still holds up threw out the game.\nThe Bosses are not INSANELY hard, though seeing them die is fun to watch. War likes to be all that dude who is all ****** and at.\nThe platforming was okay, but it could be nightmare to get around since some levels are Mazes. Since there was a lot of back tracking, the map does help if you can find it in the level, but no one likes back tracking; even more so if you hunt the chests in the game...\nThe story though is rather interesting one. [b]War[/b] is quiet but angry fellow, he doesn\u2019t talk that much but he loves to kill stuff though. His \u201c[i]companion[/i]\u201d is called the \u201c[i]Watcher[/i]\u201d, his character is interesting but in-game he is useless to the player & he is [i]Navi[/i] reincarnated in this world; and yes I do mean he is [i]Navi[/i] reincarnated, yes I did like [i]Navi[/i] has much as the next person, but good lord was she annouying. I can\u2019t go into too much detail on the story since this is the focus of the whole Game; it is a Single-Player Adventure title after all. However, the story is very dark, gritty & depressing one. And most of the character within game are rather interesting to say the least.\nGraphic wise this game was pretty, but it\u2019s dated nowadays; then again this is a 7+ year old game. This game did come out in 2010!\n\nConclusion. I recommend this game. However, this game is for those who like Hack & Slash, though don\u2019t expect it to be HARD; well at least it shouldn\u2019t be for veterans of Hack & Slash games. Also, I played it on normal and not on Apocalyptic difficulty; so take that into account. Not everyone is going to like it, but I like a good Dark, Gritty & Gloomy story and a ****** Hero in games. This game does have both.\nThis game is [i]$19.99[/i] US dollars and you are getting TWO games with that as well; though you do get [b]Darksiders[/b] (original) & the [b]Darksiders Warmastered Edition[/b]. (It a remaster.) But if you don\u2019t want to spend that much wait for a sale, you can get it for very cheap these days.\n\n[i]* Regrettably, I\u2019ve only played Zelda games. I\u2019ve never played God of War Games & other that this game borrow from; or from what I\u2019ve read another people compare this game too.

Still you will be transfixed while it lasts.\n\n- Audio - A little over-the-top voice-acting and the music is only so-so and kind of gets lost in the midst of al the action.\n- Visuals - Decent, but hardly stellar.

But I did. \n\nSmall semi disjointed plot summary:\n\nThe armies of heaven and hell wage an endless war. This war was stopped by the charred council and its enforcers, the four horsemen. Eventually a third race, that of man was discovered. Man became the peace timer, for once these weak yet cunning creatures were ready to take their place in the grand scheme of things, the seven seals would be broken, the war would resume and four horsemen would rain judgement down on all three sides.\n\nSafe to say, shit hits the fan like a riding horsemen. You play as War, supposedly the strongest horsemen (measured purely in physical strength) and go down to earth do your job, only to notice your fellow horsemen haven't been summoned as well. And the shit keeps snowballing down hill.\n\nLet's start off with the good:\n\nThe combat (the thing you shall be doing for most of this game) feels amazing, when you hit something, you feel like \nyou've really hit something.\n\nCombos feel nice.\n\nThere is decent variety in weapons and combos. (despite the fact I only used one of these weapons in real combat.)\n\nCharacters were overal pretty good. Though there are very few side characters, they do all serve a purpose.\n\n\nNext up the mediocre:\n\nThe puzzles are meh, the real problem with them is that you are given no real hints, the best you get is a panning shot that hints vaguely in the general direction of the answer. \n\nThe boss fights aren't all that interesting, doing the whole \"do it three times and it dies\" thing for the most part. Though there are the \"bash it ti'll it's dead\" bosses. It was hard to distinguish between those and a health bar for therm would have been nice. \n\nEnemy variety is a bit lacking. (I do not consider a colour change and some more health and damage as \"variety.\")\n\nThe story isn't all that amazing either, but it's servicable and works for the most part.\n\nNone of these things were a deal breaker for me.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe game (at least for me) handled alt tabbing badly, to the point of crashing when I did, on occasion, alt tab.

It is a very well done combination between The Legend of Zelda and Devil May Cry with RPG elements to it.\n\nGameplay is fluent and surprisingly addictive while it maintains it's action packed sections and also with puzzle solving in dungeons. There is not much place to get lost, and it is \"kinda\" linear, now, you can still backtrack and get items you couldn't get before, like places you cannot reach without an specific item, very much like Metroid in a sense. Music is outstanding and also the voice acting, included Mark Hamill himself.\n\nGraphics are well done for a game of it's era, so no dissapointment there. Just stay away from the Warmastered Edition which has a lot of bugs.\n\n9/10\n\n******ACHIEVEMENTS NOT UNLOCKING?******\n\nTurns out the main game it's \"glitched\" so follow these steps so you can have them unlocked Legit:\n\n1) Make sure Darksiders is the FIRST game you load from Steam.

There is an satisfying variety of weapons/equipment and number of combos leading to a cathartic, meaty combat system. I should note that the writing of the main character makes him inhuman, apathetic, and brooding so as to make him nearly unsympathetic, but the game's aesthetic and combat more than make up for the shortcomings in story, which play out like a passable Warcraft fan fiction.\n\n My version featured a number of glitches and crashes, but nothing that broke the game, but did stop me from being able to equip the unlockable top tier armor.

Using the different weapons and attacks you can string neat combo's together to work the enemies HP low enough to execute them. You can dodge, block and counter incoming attacks, but that's really all there is to it. The combo system and variety of weapons and attacks is enough to keep the battles fun and engaging.\n\nOther then just fighting, you will be spending quite some time solving puzzles through the game's different dungeons. Using the tools you obtain in them, you really need to think about your possibilities within every puzzle. The puzzles are all well put together, but can be a little repetitive at times.\n\nWhich brings mw to my main complaint about this game, the repetitiveness.\nThe puzzles have enough variety to them, to stay fun, but I can't say that about the variety in enemies.\nThe game has this really bad habit of using old enemies you already fought quite oftenly in earlier zones (and are probably already sick of), give them a flashy new color, make them do more damage and make them have more health. Because of this I only actually remember encoutering new enemies in the last couple dungeons like, 5 times. And when it does not reskin enemies, it simply takes a tough enemy you fought earlier and then makes you fight two at a time to make it 'more challenging'. This seems really cheap to do and just kind of makes you go \"Oh come on now\" a lot more then is necessary. This is not at all a major problem, it was just a complaint I felt needed to be adressed.\n\nVerdict:\nSo this review is waay to long already, so imma just get to the point.\nDarksiders is a really good game, and I had a lot of fun with it. It seems to be suffering of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu every now and then, but that is never a big problem to me.

No es una maravilla en cuanto a originalidad, pero s\u00ed el contexto, que nos presenta un mundo desolado en el que el humano ha desaparecido, y sin embargo no le importa a nadie.\n\nControles: en general son sencillos. El combate permite hacer diferentes combos que te ayudan a acabar antes, pero no son necesarios en general. Con pulsar el bot\u00f3n de ataque sobra en casi todos los combates. El uso de objetos s\u00ed tiene, en cambio, algunos fallos, sobre todo en cuesti\u00f3n de manejo de la c\u00e1mara. Nada muy molesto, pero podr\u00eda estar m\u00e1s pulido.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos: si bien es un juego no muy bien optimizado, el dise\u00f1o me parece una maravilla. Unos dibujos que no buscan en absoluto realismo, sino m\u00e1s bien un toque comiquero, con dise\u00f1os cuidados que hacen de cada personaje \u00fanico. Colores muy bien elegidos, y escenarios bien dise\u00f1ados.

It looked really cool, and the story was great. Kill animations are seamless and look awesome, the voice acting is great, and War is a great character. The music was good, the collectibles were cool to try and find, and each level/area looks great. \n\nHowever, the gameplay itself kills it for me. Combat is more or less mashing the same button over and over. You can change timing and directions to execute different moves and you can switch weapons, but each different weapon feels like pretty much the same thing. Building up combos and introducing move variety has no tangible benefits, at least not from what I saw. It started out interesting and I was always entertained watching kill animations and stuff, but by about 2/3 of the way through the game I realized I just wasn't enjoying combat anymore, and hadn't been for a while. I just wanted to finish the game for the sake of completion, not because I was having fun.\n\nPart of that is from the puzzles. The puzzles are pretty easy to figure out, but a real pain in the ass to actually execute. You can almost immediately see what has to be done at any given point, but actually doing it can require a lot of tedious running around and platforming. \n\nBoss fights, as well, are really hit or miss. Some of them were really cool, but others were just an excuse to force you to use some new ability you just got, and just went on for way too long without adding any new attack patterns or anything to keep the fight interesting.\n\nOn the whole, Darksiders looks like a really good game, and it's enjoyable for the first half or so. If you like hack n' slash and don't mind button mashing you'd definitely like this game. However, going to this game from Devil May Cry just left me wanting more out of the combat in Darksiders.

I wanted to finish it quickly so i can move onto other games.\n\nI have put in a few hours and have reached near the end of the game and i'm not going to be finishing it. \nThis game has such great potential to be an excellent game but it suffers from huge design flaws. I was really looking forward to enjoying this game and wanted it to be a good game, but its not, small annoyances riddled throughout this game build up and render it unplayable towards the end. One of the biggest downsides is the \"Trap Rooms\" which seem to be every second room each one having a 2-5 waves of enemies in them, which is completely unnecessary and don't add any reward for the player once completed, not even a small amount of health. The Health is very sparse only coming in one use only chests and is not drop by common enemies. The only enemies that drop health are smaller \"Action Kill\" enemies, one of which only spawn in the overworld/hubworld. The others being bats and birds which again are Action Kill enemies which if you kill normally give you a reduced amount of health, the normal amount is quite small. \nThe Story i feel isn't as important as what this game is about, Killing things and making you feel quite the baddass while doing so. It loosely revolves around you redeeming your reputation as a Horseman by doing things for Demons.\nDungeon Design is reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda, so i will loosely compare to that. The dungeons have the normal elements of Fire, Water and Earth along with a Heaven and a Hell, I haven't seen a Hell Dungeon in a Zelda game yet but a Heaven/Sky one though. (I only got upto the Heaven part but i'm guessing you get to hell from where the game was heading) The Dungeon puzzels are quite easy to figure out although not every well explained from the entering fly though. If you were to play a board game you would read the instruction on how to play, the fly though at the start is the instructions for the player if they are not clear then the puzzle needs to be rethought. The Puzzles are often just throwing your boomerang though fire light a bomb, pushing blocks into place or hitting a switch to move some platforms to jump on. I should also mention that there will be instances were you get stuck and fall though the world, happened to me about 4-5 times causing me to reload a save file.\nAs mentioned before the biggest problem with the game are Trap Rooms in what seems like every room. They have no variety or strategy to them, the same 2-5 monsters come in 2-5 waves per room. The smaller monsters all have the same predictable attacks which are easy to dodge and finish off with an Action Kill. Some of the larger Monsters, not all, are the problem. Their attacking rage is greater than your dodging range so you have no choice but to soak the damage and continue slashing your sword on them until you kill them. After each Trap Room in a game like Zelda you would expect that classic tune to play and you unlock a chest with some loot in it. In Darksiders Trap Rooms you get nothing, no reward no health absolutely nothing, so what is the point of having a Trap Room there? Why are you trapping me in there, there is nothing of value, there is no chest of gold or health (which is the same as gold in Darksiders), its just a hallway with literally nothing in there. This is one of the best examples of the awful design. If you find yourself with little health and your unable to beat the next Trap Room, then congratulations your stuck and cannot progress until you get more health (more of this later) When you reach the end of a dungeon your faced with a \"Boss\". \nThe Boss fights are boring, easier than the dungeon itself and a good few don't include the item that you got whilst progressing though the dungeon. If your going to make a dungeon based game, make sure that the Bosses inside each dungeon use the item they hid away because its their weakness. You use it against them to defeat them, not just wack 'em with a sword a few times and they they say 'f**k it, you win'. That means any old person with a sword can do it make the player feel special and as if he/she was the only person who could have done it and not Divorced Doug with the failing lawn mowing business from across the road (no offence to any doug's). After you have \"defeated\" each boss you go back to the same guy and he says go to this place and kill this Monster, you get the point you've played Zelda before. You go though another repetitive dungeon, solve a few puzzles, kill the \"boss\" and head back. \nWhile you are exploring the dungeons you might end up doing some platforming, if fact you will. The platforming is nothing special just your standard Jumping, Climbing, Swimming, Sliding and Grabbing. The game does a somewhat nice job of this each dungeon is varied but it still similar to the last in terms of enemies. When preforming said platforming acts sometimes, not all the time, your button presses are unresponsive and you will fall to your death. Which brings me to my next point, Life and Death.\nDeath is a good thing in this game. If you die, you will spawn with more health then you started with. Some Monsters will do up to 2 whole health bars/skulls in one attack on easy. Health comes from smaller enemies like zombies, bats, birds and spiders, killing them will give you a small amount of health. You can also get health from one use only treasure chests, which don't completely fill your health bars/skulls. because of the shear lack of health in the game you will find yourself stuck in numerous locations, usually before an unnecessary Trap Room. If your in a situation where your on your last bit of health, find a cliff and jump off it your better off, really your are, you will respawn with 3 and a half bars ready to fight again. \nThe Art style for this game is great. I love it. Its reminds me of Warhammer 40k crossed with World of Warcraft crossed with Gothic Architecture. Its just a shame it was wasted on a game like this.\nThe PC Port for this game is better than most, the controls are okay, not the best but okay. The frame rate is great sitting on 60+ FPS. What bugs me is the lack of options for graphics, there is none. Just select your Resolution and if you want VSync then apply. You can't select Texture detail, Anti Aliasing or Model Detail. I have a low end system so i was pretty happy to be getting 60+ FPS in this game. Key mapping works good, the only problem i have is that Num Enter should be normal enter as well, i just like it like that so i don't have to move my hand off the mouse. I know i'm lazy. \n\nIn conclusion this game has its fun parts, but its mostly bad. The design of everything is bad, the story is forgettable and unengaging to say the least. What the games tries to do it fails in and it doesn't fail in the bad design will make you put the game down and never play it again. The best part about the game is the Art its everything i like Dark, Gothic and gritty, It really does complement the game but not so much im going to start playing it again. If you already own the game just avoid it and if you want to play it look up a Lets Play on youtube its not worth your time, just play a Zelda game again i would suggest Twilight Princess as its the closest to a game like this. (I didn't proof read this so it might be unintelligible nonsense, i wanted to go to bed.) Thanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR - 3/10 Good Art style wasted on a game that is badly designed.", "timestamp_created": 1485076195, "timestamp_updated": 1485076195, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29379540": {"recommendationid": "29379540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141016094", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1081, "last_played": 1460984113}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.However,i dont know if thats my fault but it doesnt seem easy to control my camera with my joystick", "timestamp_created": 1484932840, "timestamp_updated": 1484932840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508617043495178223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29349643": {"recommendationid": "29349643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261315632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1649, "last_played": 1625517951}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego, lo recomiendo al 100%, vale la pena tenerlo en la biblioteca :D....

Por ese motivo el Concejo Abrasado, una entidad formada para mediar entre los dos reinos para mantener el equilibrio, exigi\u00f3 que se honren sus leyes con el fin de preservar los cimientos del universo. Tiempo m\u00e1s tarde, aparecieron los primeros humanos, cre\u00e1ndose as\u00ed un tercer reino: El Reino de los Hombres. El Consejo augur\u00f3 que estos seres formar\u00edan parte vital del Equilibrio, por lo que se crearon siete sellos para mantener la tregua en el tercer reino, asegurando de esta manera la prosperidad del mismo alejado de los conflictos ancestrales. Los sellos se romper\u00edan en el momento oportuno en el que se librar\u00eda el apocalipsis, llamando a su vez a una hermandad conocida como Los Cuatro Jinetes; jueces encargados de erradicar a los malvados y pecadores, ya sean estos Se\u00f1ores del Cielo, Criaturas del Infierno o simples mortales.\n\nAs\u00ed es como un d\u00eda, \u00e1ngeles y demonios caen envueltos en llamas en la Tierra luchando nuevamente entre s\u00ed. Por este motivo el jinete rojo, Guerra, aparece para castigar a aquellos que lo merezcan. Pero... algo anda mal... sus hermanos no han acudido al llamado. \u00bfD\u00f3nde se encuentran Disputa, Furia y Muerte? \u00bfA caso el s\u00e9ptimo sello no se ha roto? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo?\n\nAs\u00ed damos inicio, con un Jinete con pocos recursos a su disposici\u00f3n pero los suficientes como para abrirse paso por un mundo hecho escombros. Esto es posible gracias a unos controles ya cl\u00e1sicos de este g\u00e9nero y un sistema de combate bastante divertido. Podremos desencadenar ataques r\u00e1pidos y combos que descuartizar\u00e1n a nuestros enemigos al combinarlos en el momento adecuado, tambi\u00e9n se cuenta con la posibilidad de esquivar y bloquear ataques, realizar ejecuciones y cambiar de forma -Guerra puede adoptar La Forma del Caos, una criatura enorme con una fuerza descomunal-.\n\nEs verdad que es posible generar paralelismos a nivel jugable entre Darksiders y God of War, a estas alturas poco se puede inventar, pero su gran variedad y la fusi\u00f3n de tantos otros elementos (que de tratarse de otro videojuego resultar\u00eda un desastre) que suman a la jugabilidad hacen de \u00e9ste un t\u00edtulo genuino, que si bien no redefine el g\u00e9nero, si llega a posicionarse como un gran exponente.\n\nVisualmente, Darksiders cumple con todas las expectativas. El arte de Joe Madureira se ha trasladado con creces al videojuego -una caracter\u00edstica para nada sencilla de lograr-, haciendo uso de una paleta de colores bastante variada para establecer su propio estilo utilizando colores vivos y muy vibrantes para no caer en la monoton\u00eda de un universo post-apocal\u00edptico representado a base de tonos oscuros o monocrom\u00e1ticos.\n\nEl apartado sonoro es de lo m\u00e1s brillante, compuesto por una banda sonora con 26 pistas musicales, que si bien no demuestran mucha personalidad, estas resultan espectaculares encajando con cada situaci\u00f3n presentada en la aventura. Los efectos de sonido para cada criatura que enfrentemos es estruendosa, por lo que aumenta la sensaci\u00f3n de adrenalina en los combates.\n\nDarksiders es un t\u00edtulo muy completo. Posee momentos de acci\u00f3n desenfrenada, jefes de nivel grandes y sistem\u00e1ticos, puzzles, buena variedad de objetos en el inventario y combos interesantes para comprarle a Vulgrim. Tiene una duraci\u00f3n aproximada de 15 horas y solo se te har\u00eda pesado el tramo final en el que hay que hacer uso del \"Viajero del vac\u00edo\" a una velocidad muy diferente a la que se manifestaba hasta el momento. No presenta un incentivo verdadero de rejugabilidad m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de encontrar todos los objetos ocultos y secretos. No es un videojuego que redefina el g\u00e9nero, pero si logra ubicarse como un gran exponente.

It's like a mix of Devil May Cry, Legend of Zelda, Portal, and Fable The Lost Chapters and balanced nearly perfectly. Combat is fluid and fun and the insane amount of combos and moves makes itfresh and not repetitive (unless you make it repetitive by just spamming the mouse button :P) Power ups are cool and are utilized well IMO. There's a lot of action but also a lot of puzzles and many oppurtunities for exploration. It's an open world and many paths to other areas require puzzles and such and most of the puzzles don't feel tedious and are challenging but very intuitive. There are few exceptions (freeing Azrael took FOREVER and was kinda tedious). Boss fights were a highlight in this game. Bosses were tough but had patterns that you'll pick up on after a while. But using the patterns to your advantage takes skill and precise timing. There are collectibles that help you, like finding artifacts that you can trade in for currency, 10 pieces of armor you can find, chests that include either currency, wrath, health, health or wrath shards to increase your total capacities, trinkets that show you where chests and artifacts are in the area, keys, etc. Cool gadgets and gear offer more variety and also help in puzzles such as a grapple, the voidwalker which is essentially a Portal gun, the shadow mask to go back and forth between the shadow realm and your realm (no this isn't Yu-Gi-Oh in any way), etc. Plus you get to ride a horse that can even help in combat. Controls are great IMO, and I played on the keyboard. Left Alt for dash felt weird at first, but after finding a good placement of my hand on the keyboard it became easy and flowed well. It took me about five minutes or less to get used to. The using CAPS LOCK + 1, 2, or 3 for abilities was the only thing I thought was a bit tricky. I rarely felt the need to use them, though. Also underwater movement was fluid and fun, which is rare I think in a game. The story was really engaging. The ending also had a great little twist. Voice acting was great, save for a few parts, with Mark Hamill doing a full-on Joker voice for the Watcher and Liam O'Brien, the guy who voices Gaara in the english dubbed Naruto series sounding like an ancient version of Gaara as War, the main character. Yes, it's just as awesome as it sounds. The added ability to pick up items in the environment such as cars or telephone poles and use as weapons only added to all the chaotic fun.

In fact in the first level or so there is nothing more to it, but after that the game really picks up and gets interesting. I was mostly drawn in by its great setting that takes place in a post-Armageddon world where both angels and demons deem you as an enemy. The art style and the environments were really beautiful as well, what enhanced the atmosphere. After you've gotten past the first level, that's when your character starts to learn new moves, making combat very fun and engaging. In addition you get some new weapons as well, like the Scythe, for more crowd control, and also a Tremor Gauntlet, if you fancy power punching. Among all the combat, the boss fights especially stood out for me. Each and every boss fight was both challenging and enjoyable at the same time and this is perhaps the game's biggest strength in my opinion. The cool cutscenes and the special kills were an icing on the cake. Although there are so many good things about this game and although I've given it a 9, I also have several criticisms. First of all, the game is not exactly a very good console port. The keyboard and mouse control scheme was more or less playable, but it's the fact that you couldn't change graphics options apart from resolution. Of course this isn't much of a problem for someone with a powerful PC, but for those of us with average machines, even on low resolution there is a noticeable drop in framerate in some areas of the game, making it quite stuttery. Another thing that I disliked - some areas were just a bit too long, like the Hollows and the Ashlands. Not sure whose bright idea it was that the sewers and the desert are good candidates for lengthy levels, since those usually tend to be amongst the most boring of the environments in any game. The Black Throne level was perhaps the biggest offender. Although it was a very beautiful level with some cool battles, it had way too much backtracking and also made you do the same thing 3 times! And my last criticism would be towards the puzzles. Although there were some great puzzles in the game, some others were really annoying. They weren't hard or anything. You could figure out most of them right away. It's just that to execute those solutions usually took too long, requiring too much running and jumping about, as well as tonnes of trial and error, and hence that was breaking the pace of the game. All those criticisms are quite strong for me and I guess if I wasn't so charmed by the game's setting and art style, I probably would've given it an 8 rather than a 9. Overall the game is highly entertaining and worth checking out. Going to be trying out the second one no doubt... \nVote 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1480357567, "timestamp_updated": 1480425909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588231146335601807", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27969383": {"recommendationid": "27969383", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987689483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2399, "last_played": 1423351793}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best!", "timestamp_created": 1480352307, "timestamp_updated": 1480352307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27959058": {"recommendationid": "27959058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096176121", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1117, "last_played": 1490898239}, "language": "english", "review": "When i started playin DS i cant stop it, always want 5 minutes more and more....Incredible game!", "timestamp_created": 1480346529, "timestamp_updated": 1480346529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27919928": {"recommendationid": "27919928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047998779", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1200, "last_played": 1480308107}, "language": "english", "review": "After just finishing this game, I have time to give a little review.\nSo here it is, real brief; if you are looking for a good story, with fun characters and pretty good gameplay, come on over, get the game. A typical hack-n-slash combined with dungeon adventure (often and not-inaccurately compared to Zelda games), Darksiders is a pretty good game.  The oversized weapons, the lack of fall damage, the incredible feats of strength, and the executions all make you feel pretty powerful, in a very God of War-like fashion.  My personal largest complaint is that the control scheme, specifically when it comes to using powers or consumables mid-combat, is a bit less than ideal, though it is possible a controller could help with that.\n\nIs it worth the $20 price tag? Sure.  In no way could my playing be described as masterful, and oftentimes not very efficient, but as of just completing it, I have 20 hours of gameplay.  That is about a dollar per hour of entertainment, so it's much cheaper than a movie in that case.  If you can't bring yourself to spend 20 bucks on it though, wait until a Steam sale or see if it ever shows up in a Humble Bundle or something, get it for 5 bucks.

It's typically called a mash up of God of War and The Legend of Zelda and if the sound of that makes you feel a little tingly, make the jump! The combat is 3rd person hack n' slash at its finest, just the way I like it! There is also a great deal of platforming and puzzle solving weaved into this fine tapestry. Prepare to pick your jaw up off the ground after stepping into gloriously apocolyptic environments of varying degrees, whether it's the ruins of a great city long past or a massive desert made of the ashes of millions of dead people.\n\n The theme of this game combines elements of various religeous mythologies, primarily those of Judeo-Christion myth, to craft an epic world full of very powerful entities and monsters intermingled with elemnets of modern human society. You play as War, one of the 4 Horsemen of the Apocolypse, who has been blamed for the premature destruction of Earth in an eon's long war between the forces of Angels and Demons. The Horsemen are extremely powerful enities who serve as judge, jury, and executioner, also serving as the middleground between the 2 warring sides, led by the mysterious Charred Council who attempt to maintain balance between Heaven and Hell. All throughout the adventure, you will move Heaven and Earth(sometimes literally) to clear your name, leaving a mountain of bloody corpses in your wake.\n\n As the embodiment of all that is War, you weild the mighty Chaoseater, your weapon of choice, cleaving your way through Angel and Demon alike. Along with your signiture sword, you will find other powerful weapons along the way like the powerful Harvester Scythe borrowed from your brother Death, Mercy, a pistol borrowed from your brother Srife, the Crossblade, and the mighty Tremor Gauntlet. On top of that, there are varois abbillities and other objects of power, used in similar ways to items in Zelda games, to help you progress as well as gain advantages to certain enemies. There is also an upgrade system for abillities and your 3 main weapons level up and gain experience as you use them. They can also be augmented with various runes found throught the world. Later into the game, you gain access to your horse, Ruin, who you then be able to ride in amany places in the game map. If all of that isn't enough for you, the deviously selfish creature called the Watcher, an entity bound to you who acts as your guide and a leash for the Council, is voiced by none other than Mark Hamill!

Attacking enemies is satisfying, you have access to a large diverse tool set, all of which has a variety of uses, not all of which are telegraphed, enemies don't just constantly bum rush you, and upgrades aren't so good that they nullify combat altogether, so... none of the glaring issues that usually bog down western action games.

The story is just a very average fantasy plot, nothing about it feels very unique, interesting or different. The Zelda like dungeons, progression and exploration is the highlight of the game, however there is no music to accompany you while you are doing these things it just kind of makes things feel a little empty, dour and less enjoyable. I also just want to point out how awful and drawn out the portal sequence towards the end of the game was, it completely killed the pacing on the game. My experience with this game was ultimately very boring, the pros of the game are not good enough for me to recommend the game but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad game either.

I tried really, really hard.\n\nThe concept is cool. Book of Revelation, four horsemen of the apocalypse, yaddayadda. Like any brawler the point is simple: smash dudes. Lots of dudes. Even if I don't much care for the Warhammer 40,000/World of Warcraft proportions and pauldrons fetish that Darksiders's art direction makes ample use of, the visuals are pretty good. The voice acting is fitting, given what script the VAs had to work with. And on that note, the characterization is about as shallow as either W40K or WoW's; angry guy is angry, thus, he does angry things. I didn't expect masterful writing going in, but when even mediocrity counts as a positive bullet point in a review, it heralds bad things to come.\n\nThere's only one category where Darksiders really shines, and that's the boss fights. The introductory cutscenes are great, the battle mechanics themselves are usually pretty neat, you feel great for fighting and winning, you get to watch War perform some pretty brutal finishers on the bosses at the end, and there is no annoying underwater fight to speak of. A+.\n\nThe final boss is the worst, though. No, not The Destroyer. The [i]final[/i] final boss.\n\nThe protagonist, War, and the final final boss, the camera, are introduced in the same cutscene sequence when you first fire up Darksiders and select New Game. And if you know anything about the camera angles in pre-rendered cutscenes, it's that you can't actually move them. Get used to a lot of that; Darksiders is an ongoing and constant battle of atrition against atrocious perspective shots, awkward lock-on phases, and jarring transitions.\n\n[list]\n[*]When clinging to platform edges and ledges embedded in walls that you can strafeclimb across, it can be difficult to see where you're going- especially if you need to leap to something behind you and you're in an enclosed area. The camera often can't be coerced to give you a view of where you're headed in such cramped quarters, so prepare to make many a leap of faith.\n\n[*]At times, the target lockon feature avoids traditional third-person, over-the-shoulder camera angles in favor of side-facing perspectives that skew your controls by 90 degrees and throw your depth of field off, resulting in many swing-and-a-miss and failed dodge scenarios on your part.\n\n[*]The lockon feature lets you cycle through enemies, but not consistently. On occasion, it will only toggle back and forth between the same two enemies instead of cycling over to whichever bigger threat you're trying to look at.\n\n[*]During battle sequences the camera will often be hijacked to show the arrival of more enemies from somewhere near the area. When control is reluctantly returned to the player, you are often not facing exactly the same direction you were when the camera was stolen from you. You are not always finished fighting when this happens, either, which only exacerbates the problem.\n\n[*]The awful teleportation mechanic introduced in the later part of the game wreaks havoc with the camera angle, snapping it to a fixed position and holding it there for just a second too long. Even if you look through your portals to preview where you're going, your perspective will be seized from you the moment you step through them, forcing you to react the way the game wants you to instead of the way you planned. Trial-and-error is not a fun mechanic.\n\n[*]Sensitivity is not consistent between different game views. In the handful of shooter segments, your aim is off-the-walls oversensitive. In the brawler and platformer segments, the camera is much less sensitive. I found myself switching the game's camera sensitivity back and forth to try to compensate.\n[/list]\n\nEntire swaths of the puzzles in Darksiders feel unnecessary. There's a lot of time-based puzzle mechanics that involve a lot of waiting to reset if you make a mistake.\n\nToss in an uncooperative camera that won't let you look up to see when it's safe to proceed until you're already hanging from the ceiling and the time-slowing Chronospheres to make you wait that much longer when the spinning fan blade you couldn't see coming knocks you down, and you've got a recipe for half an hour wasted on multiple, identical, really badly-designed obstacles in the Ashlands.\n\nOr, worse than player-controlled timers, there are entire rooms in the Dark Throne area in the later part of the game with floors that automatically build and remove themselves in cycles. If you miss the chance to step onto the path when it appears near you, you have to wait for the cycle to circle the entire room in order to continue. At least one of these also features a player timing puzzle.\n\nDarksiders features what most gaming circles call \"artificial difficulty.\" The harder game modes bump up the damage enemies do and, possibly, the number of enemies and the number of waves of enemies you face, but they don't become more intelligent or actually more challenging to destroy; they just take longer to finish off. My first run was on Apocalyptic, the hardest difficulty setting. When I briefly tried again on Easy to see what the differences were for this review I noticed a stark difference in survivability- mine and the enemy's- but I didn't play long enough to really see if there were fewer enemies to fight. It felt that way but I can't confirm.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the artificial difficulty is that it's irritating to be one-shot by some of the bigger baddies in the early game when you don't know how to fight them. Dark Souls players might find the challenge enjoyable, but the difficulty spike feels out of place in a brawler like this one. As I played, however, I picked up more Lifestones and was able to mitigate this problem. But it's still a problem.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, when I was instructed how to toggle between running and walking, I was ecstatic. My joy quickly turned to despair when I realized that the player's default state [i]is[/i] running. War's movement speed is agonizingly slow. This could be mitigated by Ruin, the demonic steed depicted in the game's promotional matierals, but Darksiders has a huge problem: you play one of the four horsemen, but you don't get many opportunities to [i]ride his horse.[/i]\n\nIt's unfortunate because everything in the game is either far too speedy or War is much too slow, though I suspect it's a combination of both. The result is a lot of chasing enemies around or trying to wade through piles of mooks to deal with the real threats and failing because everything can strafe circles around you. Thanks to a really jarring pause at the end, your dash is useless as a way to close real distance and seems to feature variable invincibility frames on top of it. I could never figure out what I did differently when I succeeded or failed; dodging always felt like a gamble.\n\nI experienced a handful of bugs while playing Darksiders, and if you look into my screenshot gallery for the game, you'll be able to see the few I had time to snag pictures of. In my playthrough of Darksiders, I...\n[list][*]...fell through the world, twice\n[*]...got stuck in level geometry and couldn't escape, several times\n[*]...got stuck in the Serpent Holes because the end portal didn't appear, once\n[*]...got stuck in midair after being knocked out of an aerial combo attack, once\n[*]...got pushed out of bounds underwater, \"died\", and respawned on land with less health, once[/list]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776105436\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776098965\nI can't speak for the original PS3 and Xbox 360 releases, but this first PC port is garbage.

Your mission is simply put; to find the real culprits.\n\nAs War, you find yourself travelling through marvelous landscapes, fighting against tougher enemies, exploring dungeons and solving puzzles. These puzzles are designed for older audiences, and in fact, i find that rather amusing. It takes time to figure out what to do, and when to do. You will often be rewarded with souls, mana or health points.\nSouls can be used to upgrade weapons, learn new combos and to upgrade them as well.\n\nCombat is slow-paced, combos aren't hard to master, and enemies are forgiving.\nYou start by only using your sword, Chaoseater, but you gain more weapons and gear throughout the game.\nGood examples are large scythe called The Harvester, and revolver called Mercy.\n\nArt style is maybe the thing i liked the most - it's cartoon-like, uses lots of color, has all these little details like ash floating mid-air, and spider webs hanging out of windows. The artist team sure knew what they did, environment changes from fires of hell to desolate lands, gothic-style manors and terrains crowded with grass and waterfalls.\n\nGame sometimes has little frame problems, but those can be simply fixed by changing angle of view.\nI also had some glitches throughout the game, none of them caused game crashes or anything bad.\n\nOverall it's a good game. It looks good and plays good, you're going to enjoy every minute of it.\nWhen it ends, you wish it would have not, not so soon. It's so much fun.\n\n+ It's available for only 19,99\u20ac on Store, and that, is a bargain.\n\nThanks for reading, hopefully this helped.\nConstructive criticism appreciated!\n\n-Nate", "timestamp_created": 1475402491, "timestamp_updated": 1475411986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691855907440185547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25802728": {"recommendationid": "25802728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333564390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1566, "last_played": 1475747922}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story, pretty fightining moves, big bosses and great soundtrack what can you wish more.", "timestamp_created": 1475337099, "timestamp_updated": 1475349420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25792584": {"recommendationid": "25792584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163273426", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1484978427}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanta este juego, uno de los mejores que prob\u00e9, una historia que te engancha y una jugabiliad excelente, muy recomendado!", "timestamp_created": 1475292259, "timestamp_updated": 1475292259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25788802": {"recommendationid": "25788802", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987652027", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1475271288}, "language": "english", "review": "Does not work with windows 10 on my PC.

venganza y la desesperacion como por ejemplo cuando un amigo tuyo hace un sinpa y te toca pagarle la cerveza, o cuando te quieres tirar a tu novia, no te quedan condones y te toca bajar empalmado al 24h mas cercano para mojarla en caliente.\nAhora fuera tonterias, lo que respecta al gameplay, bastante bueno, no excelente, un hack n slash mas con un par de combos que no le hacen sobresalir nada de otros en su genero, abunda mucho la repetici\u00f3n, salir de una sala y mas zombies, que si, que es lo propio de su g\u00e9nero pero si lo jugais ya vereis a que me refiero.\nUn punto flaco y negativo por el cual me hace no recomendar este juego es el tema \"puzzle\" si se pueden llamar asi.\nCada cierto avance, obtendremos un nuevo objeto que desbloquea una mecanica en el juego, pues bueno, la cosa es que los desarrolladores no sabian como rellenar el juego y repiten los mismos puzzles vez tras vez hasta que acabas desquiciado y con ganas de mandar el juego a tomar por culo.\nGr\u00e1ficamente es bastante chusta, pero teniendo en cuenta su tiempo le daremos ese pase, los sonidos son una completa caca, de repente te pueden sorprender con un sonido nordico que no viene a nada que con un grito de demonio extre\u00f1ido.\nSu duraci\u00f3n es totalmente innecesaria como he dicho antes y repito que la manera en la que han rellenado el juego no ha sido de mi agrado.\nPersonalmente me encantan muchisisimo los hack n slash pero este juego me ha dejado muy mal sabor de boca, cosa que espero que su secuela sepa endulzar.\nNo recomiendo este juego a nadie personalmente, pero si eres paciente pues dale un intento no se me vayan a echar los fanboys al cuello a meter ciberpu\u00f1etazos.\n\nNota : 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1475259329,

Es un juego de \u00e1ngeles, demonios, monstruos, esp\u00edritus c\u00e9lticos que no son esp\u00edritus c\u00e9lticos, sombras y traiciones.\n\nEl juego es una plataforma tridimensional al estilo de Legacy of Kain, Prince of Persia, The Legend of Zelda (estoy asombrado por la cantidad de usuarios que lo comparan, pero es entendible por qu\u00e9), entre muchos, muchos otros. El jueguillo, adem\u00e1s, tiene elementos de Hack & Slash, RPG y Metroidvania. Una combinaci\u00f3n aparatosa que funciona y mantiene entretenido al jugador entre unas 15 y 30 horas, dependiendo que tanto desee entregarse a la tarea. Odi\u00e9 los acertijos pero son necesarios para alargar este tipo de juegos y hacerle creer al jugador que no todo es empaparse con la sangre de tus enemigos.\n\nEl juego tiene una colecci\u00f3n muy respetable de artefactos que ayudar\u00e1n a Guerra a completar su misi\u00f3n. No s\u00f3lo est\u00e1 la variedad de armas, las cu\u00e1les son un deleite en su uso y su aprendizaje: un pu\u00f1o, una pistola, una hoz y una espada; pero tambi\u00e9n la variedad de objetos y de modos de juego, por ejemplo la m\u00e1scara de sombras, el arma de portal (s\u00ed, piensa en portales) y del caballo. Es muy satisfactorio recorrer los mapas o matar a un pu\u00f1ado de enemigos con las armas, as\u00ed como aprender el sistema de combos del juego (aunque tambi\u00e9n, seamos sinceros, no necesitas m\u00e1s de uno o dos combos). Aunque algunos de estos objetos, o ayudas, parecen solamente brillar para el \u00e1rea que fueron destinados y francamente, algunas veces recorrer todos los mapas, al momento de obtener algo nuevo, pod\u00eda convertirse en una rutina un poco tediosa. Darksiders se reserva varios objetos hasta muy pasada la historia y justo cuando crees que es una buena idea regresar para ver si puedes obtener algo nuevo, te dan algo m\u00e1s que contradice estas bonitas esperanzas o descubres un \u00e1rea nueva inalcanzable.\n\nLa historia se me hizo normalona, convencional. No hay personaje con el cual sentirse identificado, ni siquiera el personaje principal, pues todos parecen muy enojados, muy metidos en su papel, pues finalmente su origen, su naturaleza misma, ha excedido inevitablemente a la humanidad y eso parece quitarles emociones fiables, sinceras y todos parecen cartones o estereotipos. Sin embargo, las actuaciones de voz son imponentes y muy adecuadas (Mark Hamill, como siempre, engalanando con sus dotes una historia que podr\u00eda ser olvidable), y ello mismo, incluso, me hizo disfrutar la historia a pesar de insulsa y carente de giros interesantes.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos est\u00e1n muy bien pero los videos sufren en sistemas m\u00e1s actuales. Tuve problemas para ajusta el V-Sync. Hay que moverle un poco pero nada que Google y un par de reajustes en los drivers de video no resuelvan. Pero advertencia: a\u00fan as\u00ed, algunos videos saltaban o estaban desfasados.\n\nConvendr\u00eda comprar esta versi\u00f3n antes de Octubre o Noviembre 2016, porque est\u00e1n a punto de sacar una versi\u00f3n remasterizada del juego y puede que suban el valor.

And however, it stands out as one of the best of its genre.\nI played first when it came out, and my expectations were low, as I thought this was going to be a cheap God of War clone. It turned out I was wrong: combat was simple but satisfying, landscapes were imaginative and vibrant, and the story, while not deserving an Oscar, was mildly interesting. But what won me over was the puzzles. You see, this is in some way a Metroidvania: you can revisit previous locations with abilities you gain during your playthrough in order to get to new areas. The ways you get to use your new gear are sometimes not straightforward and there are more than a couple of clever puzzles in the game. Yes, many abilities we have seen in other games, like Portal, but when you copy things that work and are well implemented in the gameplay like this game does, then it's totally forgivable. Some people I know claim this is the best Zelda title ever, and I agree. Besides War, the main character is a total badass. \n\nWhen I revisited the game for my second playthrough a month or so ago, I tried to temper my expectations thinking 7 years have gone by and maybe it wasn\u00b4t going to hold up well. How wrong was I. Despite, the comparatively low polygon count of the models and backgrounds, the choice of colors and the exceptional design make them look great (this is the old tech vs art design debate), the combat without being as refined as DmC is responsive and satisfying, and puzzles and exploration are as good as ever. \n\nA sign of the quality of the game is that the company that bought the rights to the title is going to release  a 1080p/60fps version soon. Obviously if you have an average PC you should be able to play it at that resolution with no issues.\n\nDo yourself a favor and play this!", "timestamp_created": 1471979061, "timestamp_updated": 1471979061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25077465": {"recommendationid": "25077465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016004665", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1372, "last_played": 1471202816}, "language": "english", "review": "War...

It reminds me of the Soul Reaver series, which I also loved, but with a higher focus on combat rather than puzzles (although there are puzzles).\n\nThe game is kind of linear - the main path is, but you can explore around to get some benefits, and revisit old places with your new abilities to reach extra rewards (such as increasing your max health). You will unlock big new abilities and mechanics at specific points in the game, but many combat abilities and upgrades are bought using the game's currency (souls).\n\nThe combat is quite entertaining. You have (and unlock) many combat abilities and tools. Your main ways to avoid damage are blocking (which is more useful than it is in other games, though some big attacks are unblockable) and moving out of the way (usually using a dash). Your main weapon is a huge sword, but there's also two alternate weapons (one focused on a bigger are, and the other on stuns and sending people flying away), and they're all quite satisfying to use. These three weapons gain experience by using them to hit your enemies, and you can assign trinkets to them to add small bonuses. You get several ranged weapons, but they're not the main focus (they don't gain experience and you can't assign trinkets to them, but you can buy some upgrades for them). There's also other combat mechanics which you'll unlock, but I don't want to spoil them.\n\nThe story is quite good, and it doesn't end too abruptly, even if you do want to learn more about several things (though I haven't played the sequel yet). The story includes characters from several mythologies, but doesn't exactly follow any of them (many details are different from those mythologies), and other characters are new, creating the game's new mythological cosmology.\n\nThe graphics are relatively good, although the game's not that recent. The design of the characters and locations is excellent. The music's alright, but it's not particularly memorable. The voice acting is high quality.\n\nThe port is good, thought to unlock steam achievements, you should run the game after starting steam (you can restart steam before playing to be safe).

Esto resulta importante para los amantes del g\u00e9nero hack n slash, pues Darksiders no es un hack n slash puro sino un juego de aventuras en el que con dar mamporros a lo loco es suficiente para acabarse el juego. No hay exigencia t\u00e9cnica, aunque eso no es malo ya que el juego tiene personalidad propia y, de hecho, me recuerda a esas aventuras de acci\u00f3n de los tiempos de ps2.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente es dif\u00edcil de analizar a estas fechas y sospecho que en su d\u00eda no era puntero en este aspecto, aunque siempre ayudan las bondades del PC, como por ejemplo las altas resoluciones y el excelente rendimiento. Los dise\u00f1os de los personajes principales y los escenarios son realmente buenos. Obviamente, teniendo que dise\u00f1ar \u00e1ngeles, demonios y uno de los cuatro jinetes del apocalipsis, ten\u00edan un buen material con el que trabajar.\n\nDarksiders tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un buen apartado sonoro, con buenas composiciones musicales y adem\u00e1s con unas voces en espa\u00f1ol agradables de escuchar. Algunos personajes tienen voces m\u00e1s serias o dram\u00e1ticas mientras que otros cuentan con voces en un tono m\u00e1s acorde al de una pel\u00edcula de animaci\u00f3n. Algunos podr\u00edan preferir voces m\u00e1s serias para una aventura de este tipo, aunque no son las voces algo negativo en este juego.\n\nEl argumento es interesante y nos ayuda a estar interesados en todo momento. Siempre resulta atractiva la lucha entre el bien y el mal, pero si a eso le a\u00f1adimos a un jinete del apocalipsis en medio de todo el \u201cjaleo\u201d, pues hay trama para rato.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, s\u00f3lo queda hablar del aspecto donde m\u00e1s \u201cperos\u201d se encuentran en este juego: el control. Y aunque no es un obst\u00e1culo para acabar el juego, ya que Darksiders no es un juego dif\u00edcil, si se echa en falta un control m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo y preciso. Por poner algunos ejemplos, los botones de ataque y bloqueo se encuentran en el mismo lado, y se hace raro atacar y bloquear con la misma mano. Se usa el gatillo izquierdo para fijar enemigos pero para apuntar con el arma se usa R3. Hay que estar cambiando ciertos objetos desde el men\u00fa porque la cruceta solo da cuatro opciones. Esto se hubiese solucionado con la t\u00edpica \u201crueda\u201d de selecci\u00f3n que se despliega al pulsar un bot\u00f3n\u2026\n\nBueno, pues para terminar s\u00f3lo me queda decir que me ha encantado Darksiders y sin duda lo recomiendo, aunque como es un juego ya viejo es mejor conseguirlo en oferta. Veo una saga con potencial y creo que su segunda parte me va a parecer incluso mejor juego que el primero.", "timestamp_created": 1471173907, "timestamp_updated": 1471173947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24909028": {"recommendationid": "24909028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009582808", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1697830084}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my all time favorites.....10/10", "timestamp_created": 1471173300, "timestamp_updated": 1471173300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24906634": {"recommendationid": "24906634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044600561", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1347, "last_played": 1396347133}, "language": "english", "review": "Very underrated game.

While not on par with Bayonetta or the later DMC titles, it's still got enough to work with that it can be fun.\nOnce the game introduces you to the dungeons it becomes a lot more fun and interesting and the first two dungeons are great, rivalling some of Zelda's best with some good bosses to round off the experience. \nUnfortunately the game begins to fall flat at around the halfway point with the latter two dungeons being much less interesting and the bosses being a bit lame. There is no final dungeon and the final battle isn't very challenging or engaging at all. To top this off, there's a bit of padding before the final dungeon which is really just backtracking and busywork, not aided by the poor map system.\nThe story is there but it's not something I was really invested in. I don't really care much about the characters and there weren't any great moments.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is probably worth a play if you're into Zelda and want something that's similar but changes the formula up a bit.

As I said earlier though, this game is different enough from those two that it makes for a fairly unique game experience. Few action games have the kind of puzzles present in this game and almost no puzzle based games feature the combat that Darksiders has. \n\nEven though it's different in it's own way than God of War, if you have played GoW you'll feel right at home with the controls and the combat. You have your basic attacks, magic, and a huge number of combos to pull off. Countering enemies is always satisfying and gives you a huge advantage in that moment. Bosses are also great with each providing a slightly different mechanic to use to defeat them.\n\nOne area where I feel the game could improve is the ratio of combat to puzzles. There were some puzzle sections that seemed to go on just a hair too long as I was itching to kill more stuff. Combat is so fun that you end up missing it when doing the puzzle sections (which are adequate, but not quite up there with Zelda). This slightly breaks up the flow of the game and as I said earlier some puzzle stages definitely overstay their welcome. It doesn't help that the puzzles are usually somewhat mediocre (move x to y, push button, etc.). They aren't bad, but it's not like the combat which in itself is pretty exceptional.\n\nOn a visual level this is a relatively old game but it still looks pretty good thanks to Todd McFarlane's excellent character designs. Character design is great and you truly get the sense of being in a fantasy/post-apocalyptic setting. Some visual effects are absent as this game was made awhile ago and unfortunately cut scenes are not in 1080p.\n\nPuzzles and visuals aside this is one great game. It's fun and challenging without being frustrating and combat is a blast (when you're not solving puzzles). As far as achievements go there are a number of collectibles in the form of upgrades so they are worth collecting even if you need a guide. A forewarning about achievements in this game though: Some will NOT unlock when they should so keep your eye on the corner of your screen when you expect to get an achievement.

If you're not directly in a dungeon, you're\nfree to wander as you please from space to space.\n-Puzzles start off easy, and become interesting and challenging towards the end of the game.\n-Genuinly decent storyline. Not amazing, but interesting enough.\n-Great pacing. Just whenever the game begins to feel dull, a new mechanic is introduced, be it a grappling \nhook, explosives, riding on horseback, a new weapon, or so on. \n\nCons:\n-Supposedly has some issues running on some computers, not that I experienced them.\n-Lacks graphical settings other than V-Sync and Resolution.\n-Basically requires a controller to play. PC controls are blegh.\n-A few small bugs in places.\n\nOverall, I was pleasently surprised to find that Darksiders was an absolutely amazing game that I couldn't put down.\nIt played smoothly, it was fun, the pacing was great, and I loved every second of it.

I gotta admit - for a game six years old, I was pleasantly surprised!  I watched a trailer and purchased the game assuming that I was going to get a mindless hack and slash experience.  I DID get that experience - and got so much more.\n\nDarksiders is a great entertaining distraction with an interesting character and plot.  The game wonderfully integrates a great blend of genres - the hack and slash of Devil May Cry, the puzzles and exploration of Zelda, Progression of Metroidvania, and even some shooter elements.  As soon as I was tired of hacking things to bits in 50+ hit combos, I was rewarded with a couple hours of puzzle solving and dungeon exploration.  That back and forth continued throughout the game.\n\nThat said, the game is far from perfect.  The end game collect-a-thon grew very old very fast.  I can't help but think this was a dropped ball by Vigil Games narratively and gamplay-wise.  It felt as if they took the \"easy way out.\"  Go collect these four hearts...and then collect the seven pieces of the sword...and then go fight the boss, which requires you to fight the four mini bosses before hand.  Darksiders is set in a cosmic world with compelling ingredients - interesting characters, unique plot, and a blend of mechanics that somehow falls short in the end.\n\nI also went for 100% completion to get all the achievements, and the achievements were a drag to get.  I'm a completionist at heart and prefer gaming that way, but I felt like an idiot at the end killing spiders over and over again to farm money and experience for the sake of the achievement and not the sake of the game.

It doesn't really amaze me as a game in any way. The graphics are cartoonish and just about worthy of the Xbox 360 (not a compliment), the gameplay is formulaic and platformy reminiscent of a PlayStation 2 game (that's sort of a compliment) and the story-line and script is about as impressive as Michael Bay at his best (not really a compliment either), although having said that its \"twist\" ending keeps things at least a little fresh.\n\nDespite all this, to this day I find something in Darksiders simplicity that I like. Maybe it is simply the pleasure in experiencing the humble origins of its overly-ambitious sequel, perhaps it's the idiosyncratic lore-rich post-apocalyptic Earth, or maybe it's the storyline - the idea of ageless god-like creatures on a self-serving mission to resurrect the annihilated human race. \n\nThere is nothing new or groundbreaking about Darksiders, and although it was one of THQ's larger releases it is not at all a game that was made to be a money spinner I don't think. Somebody loved Darksiders, and in 2016 I still do. The level design is varied in a predictable sort of way (forest level, desert level, city level, scary level), the bosses which you hunt are quite interesting but again nothing new (giant spider, giant bat) and a lot of the game's completion relies on that obsession with collectables and point gathering that 2006-2010 games are so infamous for. \n\nThis game is totally charming.

What do I say about Darksiders.. Well, it is by no means a bad game. The gameplay and combat are clean; the puzzles are intriguing enough; the voice acting is fairly well done (especially work done by Mark Hamill); and most enemy designs are intuitive and fun to fight. Speaking of enemies, instant killing enemies is such a joy!\n \nHowever...\n\nDarksiders is woefully uninspired. There is absolutely NOTHING original about this game. Everything about the combat, the puzzles, the level/game design, the level up schematic, and even the way you ride your horse (which you won't do very often) is borrowed from other game designs. If you have every played God of War and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time you will quickly pick up on the tropes and cliches that this game uses. Also, the bosses are simple and gimmicky. Not to mention that the game is fairly easy, even on hard. Lastly, the lore is mildy interesting but the plot and story execution are weak and it just feels like set up for the sequel. \n\nFinal Word: \nDon't take my criticism as me not liking the game.

You play as War, one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, who has been stripped of his powers, and are tasked with regaining War's former glory and proving his innocence to an atrocity he's being accused of. And boy is that former power being regained at a brisk pace, piece by piece. There's a constant stream of small pieces of increased abilities. There's always some trinket, power up, a new weapon or stat increase just behind the corner. It's like following a trail of treasure crumbs back home. The frequent small rewards provide a hook that makes it more difficult to put the game down. Just one more treasure, I found myself muttering.\n\nThe game progresses steadily and without too much effort from the player. The main obstacle between War and the treasures are enemies vanquishable by combat. The fights have just enough difficulty to keep the player engaged and unable to watch Netflix from another screen, but without much risk of stifling advancement and the player getting stuck in one spot for too long. Combat could be a tad more difficult to encourage utilizing the whole set of tools available to the player. As it is all fights resemble each other a lot, and straightforward button smashing is a bit more effective than I would like. Light puzzles sprinkled between and around combat encounters follow a similar pattern, where they activate a couple brain cells but shouldn't leave most people stumped for very long.\n\nThe main path is linear and straightforward, but small secrets hidden in the nooks and crannies keep anyone inclined to do so exploring a good while longer than would be necessary to progress the main quest. Oftentimes a strange contraption is encountered - a sure sign you can't quite go somewhere yet, but are meant to come back after acquiring some ability later on in the game. This kind of backtracking is frequent, but mostly optional. Only in the end is it necessary to visit most already previously seen areas in the game, but this is a quick excursion that highlights just how much more powerful War is at that point than he was before.\n\nThere's not much new and fresh here, but the familiar ingredients form an entertaining enough package.
