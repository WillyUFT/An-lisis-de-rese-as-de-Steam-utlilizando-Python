The graphical style, some elements of gameplay, and a few enemies were heavily influenced by Castlevania: SOTN. The music for the first zone, as well as the ending, are pretty banger.  Run around and slap at things with your sword and use [strike]hearts[/strike] mana to throw axes, knives, etc. at foes.  Die a lot.  \n\nWith a variety of classes to choose from, you can pick what fits your playstyle (out of 3-6 choices, depending on your progress).  The barbarian queen/king is my favorite, with their huge HP pool and shout ability to blast away enemies and projectiles.  You can customize your loadout with equipment and runes, which theoretically you could swap in and out for different classes, but I find myself always using the same loadout for every class.  There is an Architect NPC, but frankly I found them useless.\n\nAround New Game +3, the game starts to fall apart because there is nothing to do with your gold.  This results in either a) collecting gold, only to give it to Charon  b) leaving tons of gold and diamonds on the floor all over the castle, which feels weird.  Thankfully, in the sequel they fixed this.\n\nOn subsequent runs, clearing the entire castle takes slightly over an hour if you survive it.  Originally I played this to New Game +23 where I would die in 1-3 hits, so farming stat ups became almost impossible.  However, since then they patched the game to make the stat up chests scale with NG+ (i.e. instead of a health max up always giving +5, now it gives +10, +15, .. +85, based on your NG+ count.  Starting with a fresh file recently, I'm back to the NG teens, and it seems impossible to die.  Probably the stat ups scaling is a bit too high.\n\nOne other gripe - one of the possibilities from stat up treasure chests is 'weight' increase.  This is useful early on for helping you equip better gear.  However, at some point you reach a cap where you could equip all the heaviest gear (if you even wanted to; I use some gear which is lighter for other stats I prefer).  Meaning, when you are going through the castle for essentially just farming stat ups and seeing how high NG+ you can go, you occasionally will get this weight option which is now useless.  It would have been nice, especially before they added stat scaling, if weight was removed from the drop pool once you reach a certain number (600 or so?).\n\nEnemies physically get larger as you upgrade your castle, until the point they are stupidly big in my opinion.  A few ranged enemies can easily make the screen a bullet hell.. I wish the projectiles were toned down a bit.\n\nIt may sound like I have many complaints, but I think the longer you play a game, the more the bad parts stand out.

There are no \"Oh, I see what I could have done differently there.\" moments, there are no \"Ah, I see how that killed me.\" moments, and there are no \"Ah, I feel stronger now\" moments. I'll cover each aspect and why I feel the way I do. I will also add the disclaimer that I'm generally not a fan of action platformers, but I did my best to separate that from this review.\n\n[h2]PROGRESSION[/h2]\nProgression is existent, and feels like what you'd see in a modern day mobile game. It, is, [b]SLOW[/b], as in having an amazing run will maybe get you 3 to 4 low cost upgrades, this is in a game where the base health and mana can be upgraded [b]75 TIMES!!!!!![/b] This results in upgrades feeling unimpactful and unsatisfying. The other forms of progression are sword and armor upgrades and sword and armor runes. Runes are limited to one per slot (5 in total), and armor is limited by your weight (another stat that you need to upgrade), both of which costs shocking amounts of gold and get more expensive as you by more. Nothing you will do within the progression system will make you feel stronger, it will just make you slightly less likely to die in the first three rooms... Speaking of which...\n\n[h2]THE ROOMS[/h2]\nRoom designs vary wildly, from actually quite good to absolute crap. Biggest problem many of these rooms face is that you have to blindly fall before you see where you can land (often surrounded by high damage spikes). There are rooms where there are spikes on the ceiling and you need to fit through a gap nearly the same size as you. And enemy layouts are often designed not to be challenging, but outright disrespectful to the player.\n\n[h2]THE ENEMIES[/h2]\nThe enemies are some of the most inconsistent, and poorly designed I've seen in a game. Firstly, all but a select few enemies have hurt boxes on their bodies, some of which make sense as that is their way of attacking, other such as armored guards or floating Wizards make no sense at all. Enemies hit like a British dad after their football team loses, and have inconsistent health. Usually there is a clear indicator of when an enemy gets stronger, such as an new area or stage, in this game their strength varies from room to room. Hitboxes feel inconsistent and attack patterns have all the consistency of the Washington Nationals (none to speak of).\n\n[h2]CONTROLS[/h2]\nShit. Absolute. Shit. Your character feels incredibly floaty, anything short of a short hop or full jump feels incredibly inconsistent, there is no \"coyote time\", which makes the game insanely hard to control. Attacking feels inconstant, dodging is incredibly hard,  for basic enemies and attacks because of the controls, and attacking feels weird because of how the character need to move a little before they turn around. Overall the game does NOT control well.\n\n[h2]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h2]\nThis game aged like fine milk, and I cannot, in 2023, recommend playing it. The difficulty does not come from a fair place, it comes from the combination of every bad design aspect in this game. I'm not a fan of Dark Souls, and I'm HORRIBLE at it, but I would still recommend it because its difficultly comes from a place where it can be conquered, This game's difficulty comes from a lack of respect for the player.", "timestamp_created": 1696097972, "timestamp_updated": 1696097972, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521040260791778564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147326232": {"recommendationid": "147326232", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994770206", "num_games_owned": 1821, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 2231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2231, "last_played": 1696043950}, "language": "english", "review": "I regret the time I put into this game.

The random attributes for progeny are a simple addition that doesn't really add anything. The difficulty stems from the clunky controls that make bullet hells and messy rooms with traps difficult to navigate. The hitboxes for attacks are broken (and this is not my own experience, this is a known problem in the game). The gameplay loop isn't enjoyable. Most deaths feel unfair and undeserved; rarely achieving any real progression you'd expect in a \"roguelite\" except in the few cases where you managed to get enough gold to increase your HP by a measly +10 points.\n\nI've read many reviews by now that share the same experience as me:\nStart a game, play for 3-4 hours die a lot of times, improve your character marginally and uninstall. Repeat a few times over the course of years.\n\nThe game simply isn't that good, or at least, the controls sure make it hard to enjoy. I don't believe it's fair to ask people to ignore glaring issues with the game just so they can maybe enjoy it for the last 3 hours of gameplay. The problems with the game are obvious once you look at the stats in HowLongToBeat. 11% of players start the game and never finish it. It takes a median 16.5 hours of dying over and over while improving your character marginally every few deaths to finish the game. Perhaps after many hours of practice you could master it, get used to the shitty controls and enjoy it; I'm simply not sticking around for that.\n\nI believe this game achieved the recognition it has because it firmly established the idea for a modern roguelite back in 2013; but, it's definitively a rather early, crude and primitive attempt at a 2D platforming roguelite.

actually recommend playing this game anymore, as the sequel - from what I've seen - fixes every issue I have with it.\n\nHowever, to ignore the (pardon the pun) legacy of this game would be dismissing the advances it made to the genre. It came out almost a decade ago, when the roguelite scene was still nascent; the original Isaac was only two years old, and Risk of Rain would release later that year. It was the first game to really nail a sense of proper progression; even runs that go poorly might be able to advance something in the metagame, and every step along the way was an actual improvement (contrasting, say, Isaac, where some runs would succeed only to unlock a bad item.)\n\nit made those strides with some hiccups, though.  The knowledge base for the game is relatively small, as all of your characters have the exact same melee attack and one of 11 spells, most of which are barely useful. There aren't many enemy varieties, with the only area having mostly unique ones being the Forest. The bosses are fairly typical 2D-platformer bullet hell, but unfortunately controls feel slippery and janky due to movement being purely digital. It takes some practice to dodge those patterns, and it never feels good.\n\nThe last achievement - one where you clear the entire game in under 15 deaths - also feels completely counter-intuitive to the game's design. You're supposed to die early on, not just because you lack knowledge but because the game scales harder than your characters do at the start. There's a reason why the speedruns rush Shinobi ASAP: it's the only class that can deal enough damage early game. I barely eked it out with 14 deaths, and most of those were Shinobi.\n\nTL;DR Was a good game in 2013, but play the sequel instead.", "timestamp_created": 1672899488, "timestamp_updated": 1672899488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612720668315887451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130141135": {"recommendationid": "130141135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110010375", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1687873653}, "language": "english", "review": "better than rogue legacy 2", "timestamp_created": 1672869659, "timestamp_updated": 1672869659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489270389080047607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130056225": {"recommendationid": "130056225", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962881039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6205, "last_played": 1672382748}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, but Rogue Legacy 2 is better", "timestamp_created": 1672779017, "timestamp_updated": 1672779017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129971395": {"recommendationid": "129971395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030989289", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1100, "last_played": 1673131404}, "language": "english", "review": "Good fun all around.

In a sense, it feels as if it is a very primeval, maybe even primordial attempt at doing a roguelike/roguelite - which is very nice, but also brings with it great deals of sorrow.\n\n Conceptually - very good! Actually, however, it is not, due to a number of reasons.\n\n Reason number one: CONTACT DAMAGE!\n\n Other issues with the gameplay. The Player gains access to a \u2018dash\u2019 move quite early on in the game. Unfortunately, this dash move does not provide the player with \u2018invincibility\u2019 frames, unlike the \u2018dodge roll\u2019 from Dark Souls (which came out in 2011 and is said to have influenced the developers of Rogue Legacy). One could argue that giving the dash invincibility frames would be very counterproductive, as it would trivialize the game\u2026\n\n But there\u2019s already a dash which gives the PC invincibility frames IN the game. Enter the \u2018shinobi\u2019, or rather the \u2018hokage\u2019 class, who comes with the special ability of having the highest strength in the game and doing massive damage with every hit, whilst also having the ability to dash\u2026 But with invincibility frames. It is literally the same as the dash the Player has on their disposal, but instead of going through (instead of movement) it features a \u2018blink\u2019. The PC is teleported to their destination, and thus can go through enemies.\n\n Does that make the \u2018hokage\u2019 the best class? Well, no, what makes them the best class would be their obscene strength stat. In fact, it is incredibly trivial. Sure, it might require 5 mana per cast, but that\u2019s such a tiny amount that it barely matters.\n\n THEN there\u2019s another problem. The consistency of the game keeps going to the toilet and flushing itself down the drain. Invincibility frames - we don\u2019t want those! Except when Zombies pop up from the ground and hit you and damage you while being impossible to damage, that\u2019s okay. The Zombies can have invincibility frames and they can hit you!\n\n The issues don\u2019t stop there, but I have the feeling that through the violent dismembering of the game that I am currently performing you, dear reader, can tell that there\u2019s something very intriguing about it. After all, I\u2019ve gone and gotten that in-depth on a game I\u2019m supposedly lampooning. That is something very intriguing, and it is bound to the supposed \u2018having no fun\u2019 period I mentioned earlier.\n\n All this game\u2019s problems pile on and combine into a beast of unmatched dimensions, a beast so foul and unpleasant that I don\u2019t want to deal with it. Sure, I did eventually deal with the \u2018uber\u2019 bosses, I did fight \u2018the brothers\u2019 in NG+2, but was it fun? No. Well, it was amusing, because these fights are almost completely disconnected from what the game actually is and present something totally outlandish.\n\n The boss-fights in this are good. The mini-boss fights - not so much, but the boss fights are decently good. They do require stupendous amounts of trial and error, which annoyed me, but they were well done.\n\n I\u2019ll stop here, though. I could have mentioned equipment, and how it\u2019s both super strange and wonky, as well as needlessly hard to come by, and how it\u2019s also stupendously useful, but I feel as though its issues come from the rest of the issues I\u2019ve outlined. I mentioned runes only in passing, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re barely interesting.\n\n Yes, you do get to have contact damage, but it sucks and doesn\u2019t fix the problem I spoke of. Yes, you do get extra gold, yes you do get healing and mana back, you get stuff, but nothing makes your shitty attacks better, so just eat it.\n\n I really like Rogue Legacy on a conceptual level. I want to like it on a practical level, too, but I don\u2019t. 2/3\n\nPresentation\n\n Cellar Door Games have done an impressively good job with making this game look the way that it does. It looks good. It looks as though it is its own thing. I\u2019ll easily recognize the silly sword of the PC, I\u2019ll know I\u2019m looking at Rogue Legacy if I see any screenshot from the game.\n\n The music is also kinda okay, even if I found it a bit\u2026 Lackluster, I suppose. Or maybe not my cup of tea.\n\n The way the tutorial is done is not bad at all, and it is presented in a manner that is relevant to the story, as well. In fact, the presentation of this game might be its strongest suit, which is most intriguing.\n\n That\u2019s owed up to the concept of quirks I mentioned earlier, in the Gameplay section. Each character the Player gets to play is very likely to have at least one quirk. These quirks can slightly alter gameplay, but what they mostly do, and what I like about them, is that they alter the way the game looks. One character might see everything in black and white, another might see things in sepia, one might be short-sighted, making everything beyond a certain radius blurry, whilst another might be far-sighted, making everything within a certain radius blurry.\n\n A character might have a condition where they curse and swear whenever they\u2019re hit, or a character might have glaucoma and have everything outside of a certain radius be darkened, nigh imperceptible. A character might have dementia and might see enemies that aren\u2019t actually there, who can\u2019t be hit nor can they hit the character.\n\n Those are stupendously interesting, and the most intriguing one of them would be \u2018the One\u2019, which turns everything into NEON! It\u2019s so neat\u2026\n\n But that isn\u2019t where it ends. This game is filled with references which I found quite endearing, quite pleasant. One would be that to \u2018The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\u2019, another would be to \u2018Naruto\u2019, a third would be to \u2018World Of Warcraft\u2019 (at least I think it was such).\n\n Admittedly I think I may have a weakness for pixel-art. Additionally, I might have a weakness for fantasy. Those, then, coupled, make for a very compelling, in my eyes, visual or even simply conceptual experience. I\u2019ve nothing to complain about in relation to the Presentation of the game. 3/3\n\nStory\n\n This is it. The weakest part of the game. It\u2019s weakest because it is made up of around 25 half pages worth of text. There is an interesting little twist at the end, but everything is so bare-bones that it barely matters.\n\n I liked the way the 25 half pages were written. I liked the way it presented the character writing them going through the motions they were going through. I liked the reasoning behind their actions, I liked the logic to it.\n\n Unfortunately, that\u2019s all there\u2019s to it. There was no interaction. When the Player recruits, say, the Enchantress, she presents a story detailing why it is that her current situation is as it is, she asks for the PC\u2019s help\u2026 And then that\u2019s that. Even if the Player brings her everything she has once lost, she does not say anything ever again, she does not react.\n\n Every single \u2018helpful\u2019 character is like that. They\u2019re all extremely limited and barely characters. The only exception might be Charon, who is so wreathed in mystery that there\u2019s barely any character to be had, but then the clown and the miserly elf are also as mysterious and unknown as Charon, yet they\u2019re far worse in the sense that the mystery does not make sense.\n\n In fact, very little in this game makes sense, story-wise. It isn\u2019t a game meant to be experienced for its story, and the story - the lore - is not even really meant to be considered. 1/3\n\nLegendary Point\n\n0/1\n\nConclusion\n6/10. It\u2019s a game that could be called slightly above average, but only slightly so. Tentative recommendation.\n\nRead the FULL review here: https://gemsimov.com/game-reviews/f/rogue-legacy---a-review", "timestamp_created": 1670161581, "timestamp_updated": 1670161581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503694593906402588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127653383": {"recommendationid": "127653383", "author": {"steamid": "76561199010696372", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1693563596}, "language": "english", "review": "burger\n", "timestamp_created": 1669842064, "timestamp_updated": 1669842064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495423883199691772", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127592674": {"recommendationid": "127592674", "author": {"steamid": "76561199102859881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1697499784}, "language": "english", "review": "Brutally difficult but I mean its also one of the best 2D roguelikes Ive ever played so I mean play at your own risk if you enjoy dying within the first 10 seconds for like the first hour you play", "timestamp_created": 1669760050, "timestamp_updated": 1669760050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127583414": {"recommendationid": "127583414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362747524", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1671781445}, "language": "english", "review": "assigned gay and bald at birth", "timestamp_created": 1669748759, "timestamp_updated": 1669748759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506285727024078369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127507723": {"recommendationid": "127507723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200161598", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 4661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4661, "last_played": 1598654800}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendadisimo cambiar el pool de nombres que tocan en los personajes y poner el nombre de amigos y conocidos\nFuera de esto muy divertido!!", "timestamp_created": 1669707444, "timestamp_updated": 1669707444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127499808": {"recommendationid": "127499808", "author": {"steamid": "76561199061381792", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3644, "last_played": 1660273057}, "language": "english", "review": "A 2d platforming rogue like with upgrades in between runs and increased difficulty along with those progressions.

On one hand I enjoy the art style quite a bit, the controls are responsive enough, and you unlock a double jump early in the game. I like that the castle layout is different every time, kind of, it's good and bad. It's good because you'll be playing the first part of the castle over and over and over again to level up, but the bad thing is because it's always changing I don't feel like I'm getting better or progressing at all. And the pace of progression is what leads me to not be able to recommend this game. You see, I'm a complete masochist so even though I hate tedious grinding to level up I still do it for some sick self loathing reason but I know the vast majority of gamers wouldn't enjoy it. Then how do I explain the \"very positive\" status of this title? Well, that's because I whole heartedly suck at video games. I don't play games to beat them, I play games to enjoy the new experience, to discover and uncover, then eventually I hit the limit of my abilities and say \"okay funs over time to buy a new game\", so I'm not going to sit here and say \"this game is too hard\" because the majority of people who play it don't feel that way so obviously it's me who finds it too hard, not everyone. The one thing that I have a hard time accepting is that people aren't turned off by how slowly you level up in this game. I've leveled up my magic/health, I've upgraded several character types, I've purchased all the armor and equipped a bunch of runes and after all that I don't feel like my character is any stronger than I was in the very beginning. A lot of that has to do with the fact that you can never play as the same character twice in a row so I can't get used to any abilities or traits, that's something I would rather not deal with but whatever, it's part of the game and there's no getting aroudn it.\n\nTL:DR version: I bought this title while it was on sale, a very generous discount, and that's what I suggest you do as well if you're interested in checking this game out, otherwise I personally would not buy it or recommend buying it at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1669386077, "timestamp_updated": 1669564072, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490638524293899536", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126655706": {"recommendationid": "126655706", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086789712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1791, "last_played": 1681432571}, "language": "spanish", "review": "aa\n", "timestamp_created": 1669310793, "timestamp_updated": 1669310793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126626494": {"recommendationid": "126626494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052621661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1560, "last_played": 1670119452}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun", "timestamp_created": 1669302675, "timestamp_updated": 1669302675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126531722": {"recommendationid": "126531722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072678707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1685078599}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun but it did go on sale 3 days after I bought it. >:(", "timestamp_created": 1669266397, "timestamp_updated": 1669266397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126523135": {"recommendationid": "126523135", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975931787", "num_games_owned": 3284, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1588129310}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game with a simple premise but an addicting gameplay loop.", "timestamp_created": 1669262403, "timestamp_updated": 1669262403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126249140": {"recommendationid": "126249140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263383752", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1561550666}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game to kill time with and lots to discover", "timestamp_created": 1669193718, "timestamp_updated": 1669193718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126101996": {"recommendationid": "126101996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098603581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1376, "last_played": 1672352952}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this freaking game, it's super cute and funny without trying too hard to be.

I understand that this is a roguelite, and that the whole point is a difficult game that you conquer and feel proud of, but while other roguelite's like Dead Cells and Isaac are hard, with dedication it's easy to improve at the game. Rogue Legacy, however is super hard to improve at. I can play 10 rounds in a row without doing any better than I did last time.

Eso es cosa mia.\n\nLa exploracion es fundamental lo cual me gusta mucho, nunca dejo una zona inexplorada, de echo te obliga a explorar el mapa para encontrarte con barriles o mezas, sillas, jarrones para que los rompas y te den oro, es increible que por esa peque\u00f1a probabilidad te des a la obligacion de romper cada una de las cosas que te encuentres en el mapa simplemente por el echo de que te pueda dar mas oro.

A good half of my playtime was just gold-grinding on Spelunker with Gold+ gear, only to find gold gain is practically doubled on NG+, so more wasted effort. Any sort of indications of either 20hrs sooner would've saved me some grief, and no, I don't find needing to look up walkthroughs to have success in a game, a redeeming feature.\n\nNG+2 is also notably harder and more random than even the vanilla game, since every enemy is not only upgraded to their strongest 'Elite' form, but also have compounded damage, health, and most importantly, speed, so anything that charges at you from offscreen, particularly projectiles, are now 3x more annoying. Could I start over from scratch for an 'easier' time, erasing 30 hours of essentially just grinding? Sure. But why? Not only why from a reasonable standpoint, but why from a development standpoint was this basically forced, unbeknownst, on players looking to 100%?\n\nI get that looking back things could've been improved here, and WERE improved in RL2, enough for me to sink dozens of hours into getting everything there. In the meantime though, that does nothing for this game, and the only true advocates for Rogue Legacy 1 I can see are those blinded by nostalgia for it.\n\nAs a product of its era, maybe it was good.

It offers snappy action and clean, responsive controls. It offers numerous progression paths that each provide different degrees of customization, from upgrading gear slots, to unlocking additional runes, to increasing base stats, to adding classes to the pool of possible options each time a new character is rolled. All of this is very good (in my opinion).\n\nI have a neutral stance toward the heir \"trait\" system, wherein each time a character dies, a new heir is chosen who comes with a number of characteristics or traits that can have anywhere from extremely benign or irrelevant impacts to being completely game redefining. While some of the effects could be classified as \"cute,\" having the entire map turned upside down for one run always ends up feeling obnoxious to me. Sometimes, a given attempt arbitrarily becomes a challenge run because you didn't have a better choice of next heir. \n\nConceptually, I'm neutral toward the entire notion, but I do have a negative reaction to how defining some of the characteristics can be, like having a massively bigger or smaller hitbox on your character. The game doesn't take itself seriously, and this mechanic (like many other things in the title) borders on the ridiculous, and yet the game is hardly a pushover. Indeed, it will most likely take a normal player a great many attempts to build up the gold and resources to conquer the dungeon, as the game is very deliberately set up to allow the accumulation of power over time (that's one of the selling points, after all). There's a tonal dissonance there, and I experience that with the game's wildly fluctuating difficulty where you have relatively little control over who your next character will be and what advantages or disadvantages they'll bring. That could be seen as its own little minigame (how far can I get each time using the random nonsense the game threw at me), but I'd rather challenge myself when I want to challenge myself, and improve at the classes and abilities I like when I want to. The randomness here doesn't feel like it adds a lot, and instead just leaves me liking the good aspects of the game less.\n\nSo if I don't like the core gimmick, why did I spend all this time playing it?\n\nRogue Legacy is still fun. It's just not as fun as it could be. It works against itself and has tonal dissonance between mechanics and presentation (this is obviously purely to taste; one could say the same of Cuphead but I have zero complaints about Cuphead).

The game looks a lot smoother, and plays a bit differently, as well as having unique images for skills. The game let's you level up stats, skills, and unlock new classes; which are represented as an ever growing castle of your making. The branching stats, skills, and classes a branching tree of new experiences, however they are bogged down by an increasing tax and loss of income due to the antagonist Charon: An NPC who canonically owns the Castle of which you invade. The Castle is procedurally generated, so each run is different, which they make canon in the games lore, not just weird nonsense. The game has a few big gimmicks one of which is giving \"disabilities\" to each of your children, and of a choice of 3[spoiler]-6[/spoiler] kids to avenge/succeed your previous character. You are unable to level up your character during a run, nor can you utilize any of the equipment, money, or skills (runes). With the most radical approach to disabilities, with all changing aspects of your gameplay, but none debilitating enough to ruin a run. The second big gimmick is the movement system with [spoiler] dashes, air dashes, air jumps, and flight[/spoiler] to move around. The  third being the  ability to [spoiler] lock the dungeon [/spoiler] so that you may access the exact same seed from the previous run.\n\n[h1] Difficulty and Unfairness [/h1]\n\nThis game has a tendency to not be as difficult as it is  just unfair. Prior to this game I played Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and 100% it. That game is very difficult, but it isn't unfair, you are not ever just missing something that won't let you complete a challenge. Only that each unlock, or new thing, gives you a new way of completing the challenges. However, Rogue Legacy would be like if you had to die a couple times to unlock the Parry mechanic. Much of the movement system is not available at the start of the game, thus the first run usually ends up being short, because you can't dodge or do the necessary skills to survive or move or deal proper damage. The game becomes a grind you can't keep up with until you die. It's why this game is called a Roguevania, it's also rougelite. These unlocks are permanent. The worst atrocity I think comes down to the Roguelite aspects. The [spoiler] Remix fights are amazing where you're given a pre-built set to fight advanced monsters, and that is a great. However, [/spoiler] fact that most of the game becomes trivial at a certain level up state, is upsetting. Also the fact that a run is additionally based a lot on luck. I'm not lucky, it took 4 -5 runs to get a [spoiler] FUCKING VAMPIRE RUNE [/spoiler] So that I could survive in a prolonged period of time. Now that's not to say I didn't have fun, I  have a lot of poggers clips from how difficult this bullet hell (YES ITS ALSO A BULLET HELL) can be. I just can't recommend the game at all. The music may be great, but its grating how often you hear the same thing over and over and over and over. Additionally, the most egregious part in my opinion, is the fact that the different classes, don't have a lot to differentiate. All use the same sword, same attack, and the only difference is your stats, and special ability which doesn't make a whole lot of difference, you end up having to invest each type of ability to help you with the randomized selection of characters.\n\n[h1] Spoiler most of this Section [/h1]\n\nRogue Legacy is a game about Johnhannes a knight on a journey to save the King he is loyal too, whom is also his father, from an alleged assassination attempt. Johnhannes learns of the location of the Fountain of Youth from Q, located within the castle of the demon Charon, totally not a trap. Johnhannes, thinking the castle is going to be simple accepts Charons challenge, to turn over all of his income like that of an multi-level marketing scheme, and pass on the money he makes to his kids passing on the burden of the ROGUE LEGACY (THEY LITERALLY USE THAT LINE IN THAT WAY TO EXPLAIN HOW YOU\"RE JUST AS BAD AS YOUR ANCESTORS) to the next character. Upon completing the challenge Johnhannes realizes that Q is [strike] Ron Watkins [/strike] the King, your father, having faked his injuries and becoming an immortal who will never release the throne, the perfect dictator. So Johnhannes does the only sensible thing, AND GANKS A FUCKING DICTATOR. The game proceeds with Charon, fulfilling his own entertainment by passing on the gold, skills, diary and found equipment to Johnhannes' descendants, whom are told by Charon: to entertain himself, knowing fully well that the Q thing was started and continued for evil purposes. Like a certain former President. Many heroes having fallen for the same lies: Ponce De Leon, Alex the IV, Al-Khidr, and Herodotus brought to the fountain enticed by Charon, and losing their faith to a monarchy in order to gain true freedom. Then you have to play as  a fucking Narc and eventually kill Johnhannes to avenge a King you never heard or met, who betrayed an entire country, and was killed by the only person who had a conscious: an antifa, true communist comrades, ganking dictators. \n\n[h1]TL;DR [/h1]\n\nThe company knows of this games limitations and has spent time to improve on the lackings of this game in the sequel. The music is nice but hearing the same few songs OVER AND OVER AND OVER, starts to grate on the nerves. A game with all of its core mechanics locked behind a luck based rougelite system, makes for an infuriating amount of resets for the harder achievements.

Most rogue like games you play the bosses become pretty manageable once you learn the pattern.  Not here.  At least not for someone of my reflexes and ability.  \n\nAnother minor issue is that massive RNG swings of castle design and room layout.  Rooms range from 1 to 10 difficulty in the very first zone.  Games have smoothed out the RNG experience in years since for sure and that's been for the better.  \n\nStill with all the complaints and nitpicks above I want to say this is still an addictive game play loop and process.

roguelike.\n\nWhile This game isn't terrible, I'd give it maybe 6/10, it isn't what I hoped it would be. The gameplay felt clunky to me, the grinding felt REALLY bad, and some of the time you lose because you don't get a good class. At least in my experience.\n\nThe humor isn't good, and while the game was difficult, instead of getting better, you can just grind out money. I also felt it was a weird decision to make it so you can only beat each boss EXACTLY once. If you beat a boss on a run, it stays dead until you beat the final boss. Hardly something I'd expect to see from a roguelike. And when you beat the final boss, you get forced into newgame+ which swaps all the early game enemies with late game ones and gives them boosted stats. I gave up due to not wanting to grind and having already beaten it once.\n\nIt is kinda hard to explain why this game left a bad taste in my mouth. I think part of the problem was that magic felt not only weak but hard to play around, and most of the time the random magic your character gets is the only one you will get. Top that off with every class playing the same way more or less, all of them get a sword and the only thing different is the stat spread, which you can offset through grinding anyway.

At some point I found out that it just easier to run past the enemies, go to deep and end open chests with 300+ gold in them. Like the forest, deep end and such. No reason to fight. Just run past enemies, open chests and avoid rooms with lots of enemies. Then when all is done, just smack you head on the spikes and proceed to upgrade yourself towards the mage.\n\nAlso there's no other MELEE weapons beside the bulky sword. Only different equipment is the magic ones which consume mana like drunk guy in a bar. You get one pint of mana while your guy would hypothetically need mana worth of 5 or 8 pints.

BUT, there is one giant hang up that earned a thumbs down, I'll get to it after the good stuff.\n\nArt is great, controls are buttery smooth, progression is fantastic.  The mechanic of dyeing and coming back as one of your heirs is great.  Classes feel very unique and the things they bring with their kit feels empowering and useful. The challenge rooms and ways to beat them feel awesome.  I personally love this game up down left and right.  15/10, badass seal of approval.  However, critically, 3/10.\n\nYou will have so much fun, invest 30+ hours in this game.  Be excited to get that next stat upgrade, beat the enemies in that next room and collect the gold.  You will feel on top of the world.  Then, to unlock the last super fun amazing class, you have to fight Neo Khidr.  Nothing that you have done will matter up to this point.  You will die...over...and over...and over...and over.  You will stop having fun, you will start questioning the developers decisions.  They give you a set character with set stats, abilities, and spells...they are all hot garbage for the challenge ahead.  The game goes from a fun action platformer to a bullet hell game that has bullets with hit-boxes the size of Texas, a very, VERY limited ability to avoid them, a mediocre means of damage output.  You will die, not because of a lack of skill, but because the game will throw an unwinnable wall of bullets at you.  You will get so close to winning many times, only to die to something you have little to no control over.  You will start to think that you maybe aren't as good at the game as you think, but then you will start to memorize all of the enemies attack patterns...and realize that even after you reach god tier reaction speed, and ability...you will die yet again to an unwinnable situation.\n\nWhen I finally beat the boss, it felt hollow.  I didn't win from skill.  After literally 300+ attempts, I won, because the game threw nothing but giant windows of open space at me...and it felt like that was the only way that I could have ever realistically beat the boss.  Don't buy this game, don't even play it for free as a gift from a friend, it will make you feel so great, only to sour it all when you get to this ONE boss, the other challenges bosses are reasonably hard, but not this one.  It is a gate to completing the game and obtaining the best class...you won't feel like it was worth it in the end.  I play, Dark Souls 1-3, Bloodborne, and other super hard games, handy capping myself to make things harder than they need to be and I excel at them.  This game though, I can confidently say, is just bullshit.  Fun fact, the devs put a donation box outside the boss room so you can pay gold to make the boss even harder...harder...yeah.  I really hope the devs read this and take it to heart as they make the second game, which I have already purchased and intend to play because I'm a psychopath whole likes to torture himself, but for the sake of the health of you game guys...put a little more effort in you challenge bosses.  If your next game is even half as good as this game, then you will get a 8/10, and still have a badass seal of approval.  But if there is another boss fight that is just as bull-crap as Neo Khidr, then your game is going to get another thumbs-down from me, and another warning to not buy or play the game.", "timestamp_created": 1640497009, "timestamp_updated": 1640497009, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495041817426681519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106406502": {"recommendationid": "106406502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082598970", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1686877724}, "language": "english", "review": "eugenics but the opposite", "timestamp_created": 1640328072, "timestamp_updated": 1640328072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567409098148345947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106323157": {"recommendationid": "106323157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059847874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2377, "last_played": 1640223807}, "language": "english", "review": "real good at making the pain easy to ignore\n", "timestamp_created": 1640221019, "timestamp_updated": 1640221019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106092229": {"recommendationid": "106092229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043017144", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 856, "last_played": 1639903862}, "language": "english", "review": "This game combines some of the most frustrating game mechanics of platformer games.\n\n1) Do you hate when the enemy can pass through walls?

There's no downside to killing of your character, which is thankful, but the question must be asked that if I'm just going to skip this character with terrible traits, why am I being given those traits at all.\nIt's a good idea and a fresh take on the rougelike genre, but it falls short somewhat.", "timestamp_created": 1637558448, "timestamp_updated": 1637558468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488156557083129883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103030828": {"recommendationid": "103030828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198442011079", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 652, "last_played": 1676132834}, "language": "english", "review": "yes\n", "timestamp_created": 1637308774, "timestamp_updated": 1637308774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103028625": {"recommendationid": "103028625", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999437970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 5507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5507, "last_played": 1635778964}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun indie platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1637304369, "timestamp_updated": 1637304369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103027230": {"recommendationid": "103027230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049692343", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 1384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1374, "last_played": 1690859124}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a single rogue, but a lot of legacies", "timestamp_created": 1637301275, "timestamp_updated": 1637301275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102903974": {"recommendationid": "102903974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198926480760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2987, "last_played": 1651679188}, "language": "english", "review": "gud game but i am bad lol", "timestamp_created": 1637100479, "timestamp_updated": 1637100479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102796588": {"recommendationid": "102796588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970122023", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1437, "last_played": 1645995592}, "language": "spanish", "review": "me encanta punto final", "timestamp_created": 1636928305, "timestamp_updated": 1636928305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102718455": {"recommendationid": "102718455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986829725", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1674423766}, "language": "english", "review": "Just the most dogshit controls.

In games as far back as the NES, you\u2019d run out of lives and have to start the whole thing over, as devs back then had no idea that arcade strategies didn\u2019t translate well to home consoles. Nowadays dying isn\u2019t quite so harsh, but you\u2019d lose progress regardless, doubly so if you hadn\u2019t saved in a while.\n\nIn Rogue Legacy, however, dying is GOOD!\u2026I guess. Probably depends on how strong your sense of pride is. Regardless, when the health bar drops to zero, the game is NOT over. Rather, the game continues as you pick a new toon and, with the funds you collected prior, improve your stats and powers. Sounds pretty awesome, right?\n\nWell\u2026it actually is! It\u2019s not a pleasure cruise, as a good deal of randomness is involved, and the difficulty ramps up fairly quickly as you advance, but in my opinion, it\u2019s a clever sort of endurance test: fight until you die, spend your winnings on upgrades, then roll up your sleeves and die, die again. I\u2019ll tell you right off the bat that anyone who doesn\u2019t like the idea of dying constantly will likely not enjoy it, whereas those who love the idea of adapting to constantly shifting gameplay will definitely feel at home here.\n\nSo let\u2019s start with the story. The game actually begins with a sort of prologue-esque level where you control a knight in a tutorial level, where said knight completes his mission by succeeding the king in a manner not unlike how Arthas succeeded his father in Warcraft 3. After that, you time skip for about, um, er\u2026*checks notes* Ok, so time skips are never detailed, so you become Sir Lee, the first of many, many heirs who will go through the castle, slaughtering foes, grabbing coins, obtaining an occasional power-up, and even playing a carnival game or two(no, that\u2019s not a joke), all while wondering how this castle sits atop what appears to be an outpost of hell and isn\u2019t being overrun by demons. Oh, right, the story\u2026well, there\u2019s a few journal entries about some jerkwad hoping to gain a bunch of power(likely the guy you played as in the tutorial), and that\u2019s basically it. That\u2019s right-you\u2019re going after four evil masters of great and terrible power, killing them all to open the big door at the front of the castle, and ultimately going after the BBEG because\u2026hey, it\u2019s a game, it\u2019s what you do! Yeah, not much of a narrative incentive to get through the game, though to be fair, I have yet to see any rogue-like have a story that goes above and beyond \u201cyou\u2019re the hero, now go kill stuff\u201d routine.\n\nThankfully, the gameplay makes up for it a good deal. In fact, this was the first real roguelike I ever played, and I got a great first impression. The idea of starting off, using your own skills to see how far you can get before you hit the inevitable wall, then taking what you earned, beefing yourself up, and seeing how much farther you get is a cool way of shoving aside the idea that dying is always bad, boo hoo(it can still be frustrating if it happens too frequently). Better yet, this isn\u2019t one of those games where you\u2019re just handed stuff to get you way farther just because you bit it. This game is very challenging, especially when you go into the biomes past the castle, and plenty of skill is demanded. That\u2019s not to say the challenge is indomitable; the strong variety of enemies give you plenty to watch out for, but they have fairly recognizable patterns that are easy to recognize, if not avoid 100% of the time.\n\nOf course, a roguelike can\u2019t just have every run be the exact same(unless you found a playstyle that can destroy the game *rolls eyes*), so every time you fall off the ramparts, you\u2019re given a random selection of three heirs; each with a different class that gives differing amounts of health and mana(and in one case, the value of gold you find), a different magic power or two, and even a special ability if you upgrade the class via upgrades. Now as awesome as this is, each class does have the exact same rudimentary playstyle barring alterations(you hit stuff with a sword, basically), so aside from powers and traits, each class is basically the same, which feels a bit jarring if you\u2019ve played other medieval fantasy stuff(BWAH? The mage wears PLATE MAIL?!).\n\nSince I mentioned it, each class also has various traits, all of which can impact the game in some way, be they beneficial, detrimental, or just there for the lolz. These traits can definitely shake things up, and as such, require a bit of adapting, though they can provide some fun little misadventures(i.e. heirs with dwarfism can fit in tiny passages).\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the acquisition of equipment and runes; basically weapons, armor, and trinkets that can provide various upgrades and give you a useful edge in certain scenarios. Of course, the game doesn\u2019t want you getting too powerful, so there are limits as to what you can have, although said limits can get boosted in the upgrades section, so there you go.\n\nI suppose the one downside to the game is the fact that it\u2019s essentially RNG: The Game. I get that RNG is the point, as rearranging the castle, giving you different heirs, and outfitting them with ever changing traits and such, but let\u2019s face it: sooner or later there will be one of THOSE runs where, even with all the progress they\u2019ve made, players will eventually run into a situation where they get hit by some bad moments, whether they have classes that aren\u2019t as good as the others(if you don\u2019t care about crit rates, DON\u2019T choose the assassin), have only negative traits to choose from(or at least no positive ones), or worst of all, go through a castle, run into a chance to open a fairy chest(primary rune source), all of which require some trial, and yet your character is completely unable to do them(i.e. they may require dwarfism or an invincibility power). This isn\u2019t game breaking in the least, but it can definitely get annoying at times, especially if there\u2019s that one rune you really want. There is an npc at the camp that can lock down a castle layout in exchange for a share of the profits you find, but even that doesn\u2019t eliminate all the RNG. In the end, while I do find adaptability a fun challenge, the fact that you have little control over what you adapt to can sour things, especially knowing that you have to explore a good chunk of the area ALL OVER AGAIN if you don\u2019t want to give money to the castle lockdown service, especially if you\u2019re ready to hunt a boss.\n\nGraphics and sound wise, I was rather hooked by the more bit-style appearance and occasional chiptune bits mixed into the nice and varied music tracks that accompany your adventure. As someone who grew up with the NES and such, I enjoyed the auditory and visual nostalgia that the game provided. It stands out without being overly distracting, and I liked it.\n\nSo if you\u2019re one of those players who hates getting nothing out of dying, or bashing your head against a game repeatedly, definitely give this game a run. It may be a bit dated, what with a sequel in early access, but the overall fair challenge, the class and trait combinations, occasionally powerful or hilarious, and the look and feel of it all make the game something you may come back to again and again, which is good, especially if you want to win.

Its a really basic game and a relatively basic roguelike. But it has 2 big things that it did that other roguelikes did not. \n\nFirst of all is its trait system, every death gives you a completely new character with new weird quirks both positive and negative, its a fun novelty and at the time it was really cool. The problem is eventually this becomes frustrating and annoying, some traits are so bad you would rather reset a run instead of playing with it.\n\nThe second of its twists is the main hub. You build up a massive castle that provides you many benefits, that way even if you die many many many times you can still slowly build up your characters and get stronger. For the time this was kind of revolutionary, most roguelikes seem to have something like this nowadays but at the time it was all about starting from a really basic starting point and just rolling with it. Rogue Legacy in that regard was one of the first popular roguelikes to really implement this mechanic in the way we see it today.\n\nNow this on paper sounds great, the problem is the game is balanced around the main hub mechanic, this means that it can take a LOT of grinding before you are strong enough to move onto the next part of the game. It becomes very quickly very repetitive to just grind for money, die, buy some new power up and keep going. The dungeon you go through is also surprisingly consistent, even if its all randomized there are a set number of rooms that usually will appear. Enemies are the same for each area and the boss is the same for each area. As a result you get a roguelike that feels less random and a lot more basic.\n\nThis makes it one of the simplest mechanical roguelikes out there, it can be a lot of fun but it usually burns itself out quite quickly over time. The early parts of it are very exciting and fun, but the more you play the more you feel like you are just replaying the same like 20 minutes over and over again. For the price you are still getting a great experience.

The progression system keeps you wanting to play more and unlock new things and get more gold. While the set back of death does suck, you will find yourself becoming better at the game as you go along. Noticing enemy movement and attack patters, becoming more accustomed to the game's movement style, figuring out what class is the most fun/best fits your playstyle and more.\nThe different diseases and disorders that your children can have when you pick them also help keep the game fresh and can make for some interesting runs. A child having dwarfism may seem like a bad thing at the beginning because of the shortened range that their sword swings have, but you may find it better than being normal sized because it's harder for you to get hit and you can go through tight passages for example. Some negatives about the game through are how somethings like how the down attack can feel like it doesn't go out when it should sometimes, the fact you can only beat a boss one time and you can't fight it again until you beat the game, some of the castle upgrades to affect your character feel like they're too expensive or there's too many upgrades to a node, and other things. \nEven considering these things, I would still give this game an 8/10.

What I'd expect from a Roguelike is maybe you gain some permanent upgrades but ultimately most of your boosts and abilities are only available for your current run. In this game, half of your goal is to collect coins so you can purchase permanent upgrades for your future runs. As you buy these upgrades, they get more expensive as expected. What's not expected is that purchasing upgrades for one thing will increase the price of everything else available, which just increases the grind.\n\nThe gameplay is simple which would have been fine without the extra hours of grind due to how the upgrade system works. There's only like 15 enemy types that you'll encounter who'll get stronger and gain new abilities in harder areas.

Sending countless generations of your family to their likely deaths is pretty grim, but it's never painted as a dark affair. I mean, you do have the long, long lineage screen you can look at, but there's no bloodshed (other than what the eyeball monsters shoot at you) and death is a pretty clean affair--everything but your character fades to black, your character clutches their chest, drops their sword, and keels over. Their ghost rises out of their body and turns into a portrait. Womp womp. The game isn't exactly silly (all the time, anyway) too, so that really does soften the blow of how dark the goings-on really could be. \n\nEach class does play differently from the next. Almost all of them have a STR penalty, but they're boosted in some other way. You won't completely change how you play from one class to the next since most of them will need to hit things with their swords, but the mage types will get better use out of spells and be able to use them more often, for example. It's a little like Broforce in that you need to adapt to what you're given when your previous guy dies, though you have a choice instead of having a new hero being picked at random. \n\nThough leveling is different than most RPGs, you still can feel that you get stronger with more upgrades. Enemies that gave you trouble earlier become effortless targets later on, and they're still worth fighting for their gold! It's too bad you can't re-fight old bosses without a New Game Plus loop. It'd be really cool to see how badly you struggled against Khidr at the start and how different it is with your level of power at the end. \n\n[h1]What I Didn't Like[/h1]\nThe layers of RNG with respect to gear and runes. I mentioned it earlier, but what if you wanted to mimic my strategy with the final boss? \"Get a Grace Rune.\" So you'd have to go find a Fairy Chest (I didn't take a Miner, so it's a crapshoot where they are), then complete the challenge ('No Jumping'? Guess I'm coming back with a Dragon), and then it might not be the right rune at all (Not another Siphon!). And [i]then[/i] it might be for the 'wrong' slot (I can take Grace, or I can double jump...hmm...). I can tolerate then having to buy the rune to use it given how everything else is money-driven, but even if you are diligent with scouring the castle, you still might not end up with something useful. \n\nSpeaking of RNG, you can always be dealt a pretty bad selection of heirs. That's just how the game goes, I know. There's an upgrade to reroll your selections once, but you lose the last 'hand' you're dealt, so there's no guarantee your new hand will be better. If you really like a certain class playstyle, you won't always be able to play it. \n\nHmm, third thing... I guess I'll say that the final boss gave me a pretty sizable amount of trouble to the point where I got discouraged to keep playing. I saw a lot of grinding in my future to get more upgrades that would ultimately not be enough, so back to the gold mines. I, uh, actually looked up if Grace Runes worked on bosses, so that definitely gave me the help I needed. The fourth boss was a wall for a while too, but I'll again admit that I'm not very good at this game. And that someone finished with zero damage taken at all. \n\n[h1]Verdict - 4/5[/h1]\nIt's pretty good. I couldn't stomach playing it for very long, maybe two or three runs at a time, but I think not having anything else lined up to act as a chaser didn't help me. And I hit a serious low point right before the end that had me ready to give this game a three. If you like the idea of metaprogression as opposed to a traditional roguelike starting you back at zero with nothing you did the last game having an impact on the next, then this platformer might be interesting. \n\nAnd honestly, I played the demo and preordered this game so long ago. It, uh, just took me a long time to get back to it. I may not have enjoyed it nearly as much as the initial interest and hype would've led me to think I would, but I don't regret picking this one up at all.

It\u2019s technically snappy, and if you move around in a blank space, it feels like your character\u2019s movement and control shouldn\u2019t be an issue...until you get into the castle and have to deal with enemies and the level layouts.\n\nThe size of the character in conjunction with the movement and control just never felt right. It\u2019s weird that I wanted some more weight to the movement or a little more looseness, because it just felt too stiff and awkward for what I had to deal with.\n\nI don\u2019t think this ruins the game. Or even makes it a bad game, I\u2019m sure it gets easier as you go on.\n\nBut the feel of the character movement and control moment to moment...just feels a little bit off. It doesn\u2019t help thay the dash direction is dependent on both side buttons rather than one and where you\u2019re pointing.\n\nThe character also feels rather floaty.\n\nAs a consequence, I\u2019m not sure how much I personally want to continue. I\u2019ll recommend it, as it seems to have a sizable depth. But just keep in mind the character control.", "timestamp_created": 1621122018, "timestamp_updated": 1621122018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92066981": {"recommendationid": "92066981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025959438", "num_games_owned": 2430, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 2817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2817, "last_played": 1562004983}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best roguevania on the market.\nInsanely fun, very hard, but very satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1621118169, "timestamp_updated": 1621118169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92000680": {"recommendationid": "92000680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003174259", "num_games_owned": 1704, "num_reviews": 315, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1385606227}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] One of the First Roguelikes [/h1]\n\n[b] What I Liked [/b]\n\nRoguelike gameplay, one of the first ever!\n\n[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]\n\nI was super bad at it as I didn't get the point of the game.\n\n[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]\n\nI was bad at it, because I didn't get I was supposed to die.

But ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and another life for the castle, and another, and another...\n\nEach time I learned a little more about how to deal with enemies:\n[list]\n[*]Spinning Picture Frame? Hit it twice before it gets a chance to spin away.\n[*]Flaming Skull? Attack, dash opposite and attack again.\n[*]Flame projectile mage? Find a ledge to stand under, and wait for him to exhaust his attack.\n[*]Ice mage? Wait for him to cast his icicle spell, then jump-attack him twice\n[/list]\nComing back to rooms that previously gave you a lot of trouble, and kicking their butts is the core gameplay loop, and is by far the most fulfilling part of the game. More on this later.\n\n[h1]The -like in Roguelike[/h1]\n\nWhen you die, you carry on your castle-raiding legacy by selecting one of three heirs. Each heir has a \u201cclass\u201d and \u201ctraits\u201d.\n\nClasses massively affect how a run is played. Barbarians are tanky, Knaves are glass cannons. Mages can cast extra spells. You only get to choose from 3 heirs when you die, so you can\u2019t always pick the class you want. I like this mechanic, since it forces you to experiment. Lichking became one of my favorite classes to clear the castle with because of his huge crowstorm spell. Spellblade became one of my favorite classes to fight bosses with, because of his reliable range.\n\nAlso consider Traits when picking an heir. You can have dwarves, giants, skinnies, fatties. There are other traits too, like ADHD which gives 30% extra movement speed. Also neutral traits that have novelty the first few times you see them. It\u2019s fun to see an heir with Coprolalia swear every time they get hit, or have jumbled letters due to dyslexia.\n\nMy biggest criticism of the game are negative traits, because they get in the way of having fun. Getting Dextrocardia, which switches your HP and Mana pools is not fun; I have yet to encounter a time when it doesn\u2019t just remove possible heirs. Vertigo is something that I picked once or twice, but quickly realized it\u2019s just a speedrun to the next generation. Nearsightedness and farsightedness don\u2019t affect gameplay; they\u2019re just annoying.\n\nYou can also upgrade your family castle in between lives, which gives your heirs abilities and stat bonuses. A \u201cproblem\u201d is that the \u201cgood\u201d upgrades to get aren\u2019t the \u201cfun\u201d ones. Increasing your attack damage, or later your crit chance/damage is outright better than everything else, and most equipment upgrades similarly just boost stats. That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t advantages to this design though. There was not that much difference between my first character, Sir Lee in 730 AD, and my last character Leona VIII in 13,122 AD, and in theory I could\u2019ve beaten the game with Sir Lee, in fact, several people have!\n\n[h1]Lose is Improve[/h1]\n\nThe best part of Rogue Legacy though, is that it\u2019s fun and fulfilling to improve at the game. When I entered a new region of the castle, I died. a lot. But with each death I slowly learned enemy attack patterns. Eventually, I was able to reliably fully clear the first section, Castle Hamson, and was ready to take on Khidr, the first boss of the game. I don\u2019t know how many lives Khidr took, but in terms of time the first boss in the game took me over an hour, with each life lasting 2-3 minutes.\n\nMoving on to the Forest, then the Maya then the Darkness and the final boss repeating the same steps, I ended up at Leona VIII in 13,122 AD,  516 generations removed from Sir Lee! But this was just the first step.\n\nEnter New Game+ Every enemy that I just fought in the regular castle? Now they have enhanced abilities. Remember the Ice Wizard who would shoot in 8 directions? Now it\u2019s 16! Enter New Game++ enemies that previously shot in 8 directions now shoot a torrent icicles at you, larger and more numerous than before! Despite the task of killing 4 bosses and the final boss being unchanged from the regular game, it still took 200 and 100 lives respectively to beat NG+(+).\n\nThen there are the Neo-Bosses, which are enhanced versions of the regular bosses. I think around a third of my hours on the game alone were from learning the attack patterns and repeatedly dying to Neo-Khidr, Alexander IV, Ponce de Freon, Astrodotus and Brohannes, but it\u2019s all worth it, since it\u2019s training for the final challenge of the game.\n\nEven though Neo-Bosses are really hard, they aren't the greatest challenge, Thanatophobia (beat the game in 15 or fewer lives) is. The catch? You do it in the standard game, not NG+. This is where all the practice and dying came in handy, because going back to 8 directions instead of a torrent is trivial by comparison. It still took me a few tries, but with all the practice my final Thanatophobia run took just 7 lives, way down from my original 516.\n\nBecoming an unstoppable, highly stated character is not what makes Rogue Legacy fun, but rather mastering the game, and Rogue Legacy gives all the tools and challenges to master the game.\n\nI recommend Rogue Legacy to all those looking for a challenge and give it my Bad !@# seal of approval!\n\nP.S:\nMusic: Average\nTheme: Charming\nGraphics: Sharp and Clear", "timestamp_created": 1620546417, "timestamp_updated": 1620546417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625726163387298584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91657075": {"recommendationid": "91657075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076471524", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 8674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 743, "playtime_at_review": 4717, "last_played": 1700665017}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game, simple controls, decent boss fights, and hard achievments, a good roguelike that is worth its money.", "timestamp_created": 1620492919, "timestamp_updated": 1620492919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91578675": {"recommendationid": "91578675", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993130229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1620227733}, "language": "english", "review": "Frequently humorous.

You die a lot, you upgrade a bit, but upgrades become exponentially more expensive.  Fast.  It's not like Diablo or Fate, where you can re-enter a higher (deeper) level of the dungeon.  \n\nRogue Legacy is a game for twitch-game fanatics who see constant death and failure to advance as features.

And the extra runes you can get are nice but they are small little bonus, they dont affect your damage, health, or anything like that. There's small permanent passive upgrades to your mana, health, damage, magic damage or armor that you get in some chests or after defeating bosses but those are VERY small upgrades.

Rogue Legacy is neat. Its upgrade system revolves around getting upgrades between runs, which makes it so you don't have to deal with a slow early game before grabbing items. Unfortunately, this also means there isn't a ton of variety in the gameplay department. Combine this with the fact that the gameplay just feels janky as all hell, makes this a not great game to play. As interesting as this game is, and as much fun as I had playing it on other platforms, coming back and replaying it recently is making me oh so aware of this game's faults.

I own it on the Switch and had to get it for the PC when I had the chance. So, despite putting 50 hours or so into the Switch version, I was happy to start from scratch and go again. And this is after I'd already played it for 40 hours or so on yet ANOTHER computer years ago when it came out. And despite having to start over again so many times, it's still just as fun as it ever was.\n\nHaving really bad ADHD to where I can barely focus on a game for more than a few minutes at times, even if I enjoy it, or I'm unable to read anything more than a paragraph or two, the amount of time I've been able to put into this game and still keep coming back speaks volumes for how addictive it is.\n\nI will say though, it does get a little repetitive after a few runs. But after a short break, I'm always able to come back and enjoy it every time. And there's so much more end game content added onto it. It really makes it worth playing.\n\nI've never actually played much past the first run on account of having to restart so many times. But from what I've read, there's a pretty good amount of end game content. Plus with all the mods out there, especially the one it comes with on Steam, it seems like there's a lot more content to keep you occupied once you've beaten this game completely.\n\nThere also seems to be a lot of content for people who are up for a big challenge.

And having multiple classes of heroes also adds to the variety), that getting stronger is rewarding, that there is enough reason to do it over and over again, that one run can be really short so it can be a game you play for about 10 minutes to just relax.. that you don't need to look things up online just to be able to play (though I did have to look up what the assistance does). There is just enough story to count as a story, but that's not why I play this game at all.\nA friend of mine got bored with this, so I guess it depends how much variety you expect from each run. But for a person that dislikes doing the same level over and over, this game was perfect for that. I wouldn't recommend it to people who dislike permadeath, but for me, I liked that each run felt fresh.

The 'heirs' also have good variety. From long range spell casters, to tanky barbarians. You have options outside of what you're \"born\" with as well, from the gear you can buy and equip, to runes you activate and bring with you on a session. The level design is great as the randomly generated placement of rooms always feels fresh and new, changing how you approach things in a fun way. RL2 is in Early Access and if you like what you see there, and in the screens and videos here, I doubt you would be disappointed. The achievements all feel very reachable but unique and difficult in their own right, so if that's your thing they give an added depth.

The combat ends up being a lot of enemies whose attacks are near impossible to dodge (not to mention one boss whose attacks come from off-screen). A lot of roguelikes create progression by making the game very hard and letting the player naturally get better. In Rogue Legacy, you get better by buying upgrades to your character which isn't bad in and of itself but I think it masks the fact that there is no real possibility to get better by becoming more skilful. Enemies become easier because you can tank them, not because you're better at the game.\n\nAnd (2), the roguelike elements are really surface level. The different classes are very similar and for a lot of them the only perceivable differences aren't in gameplay but just the size of health bars. The other changing element of the game, the legacy, isn't any better. So few of the conditions actually change gameplay. A surprising amount are purely visual changes and a lot of those that aren't don't feel very different (less knockback etc). There are very few that change the way that any character might play. And just to nitpick, I know some of the medical conditions aren't defined correctly.\n\nIn short, there are far far better games if you want to play a side-scrolling platformer or a roguelike.", "timestamp_created": 1614541625, "timestamp_updated": 1621303823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87627071": {"recommendationid": "87627071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277551435", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 213, "playtime_forever": 1354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1354, "last_played": 1614539775}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Vicio puro.\nPROS: - Jugabilidad divertida y variada.\n           - Muchas armas y magias.\n           - El factor suerte hace que cada partida sea diferente.\n           - Extremadamente rejugable.\nCONTRAS: - Desbloquear todo implica muchas horas y mucha suerte.", "timestamp_created": 1614539977, "timestamp_updated": 1614539977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87591666": {"recommendationid": "87591666", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978926591", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1337, "last_played": 1450803581}, "language": "english", "review": "I felt like someone took Ghosts 'n Goblins and added rogue like elements to it.

It also made me fall in love with the genre, due to it being such an addictive and exhilarating experience. It was the first time I experience the thrill of having a new, unique run, with special traits and different level compositions.\n\nIt was great. I replayed it a couple years ago, and it still is great. Sure, it doesn't have the same depth of newer roguelites/likes, like Dead Cells or Enter the Gungeon, but it still is an amazing experience in 2020.\n\nLet's talk about what the game:\n\nLet's start with the [b]sound[/b]:\nthe SFX is great. There's an oomph feeling when you hit enemies, when they hit you, when the spikes hurt you, or when you jump. They're great because there's not a single sound out of place. Everything fits, everything is the way you would've imagined it before you listened the sound.\nThe music is one of the best things in the game. It's beautifully composed, and it makes so much sense when you play it; depending on your location, a different soundtrack will play, and they fit the theme so well. In the dungeons, you'll hear a metallic, slavery, deep music that immerses you in place.\n\nFollowing up, [b]graphics[/b]:\nThey're not incredible in the sense that you'll be amazed by them, but that's not the point of them. The artistic direction revolves around a feeling. A mixture of retro and modern, with semi-pixelated visual effects, but still of high quality. A direction with a lot of personality. So good and so cute. Though it might not be everyone's cup of tea.\nThe visual effects follow that design and fit everything, there's nothing out of place.\n\nNext, [b]story[/b]:\nNothing really remarkable, it's interesting, funny, and a bit, if not a lot, dark. It's a great addition to the game, and it makes you want to dig in the lore when you find journals with piece of lore.\n\nThe most important, and last feature, the [b]gameplay[/b]:\nThis is the meat of the game. The most enjoyable and thrilling part. It isn't of gigantic depth, full of combos, and abilities. There are a few abilities, basically no combos, and there's not a lot of depth in it, but it doesn't matter. There's a learning curve, and once you master it, something beautiful happens. You need reflexes. You need to perceive and understand your surroundings, learn to read the enemies, and counter their abilities. It's so much fun.\n\nThere's one main feature, a feature that is the heart of Rogue Legacy: The heirs. Everytime you die, a new heir will take your place. You'll be able to pick between a few of them, each of them with their own traits, which aren't always good. Normally, these traits are genetical, which means, your heir might suffer from gigantism, flatulence, color blindness, and so on. Some of these traits will adjust better to your style, while others will help you get lore, complete puzzles, or obtain chests. Some others are just useless, and fun, but hey, they add to the game.\n\nTalking about when you die: you also have the possibility to spend the coins earned in your run to upgrade your castle, which means upgrading your character, your chances, your possibilities, and your rewards in different ways. If you don't spend these coins, they'll be lost [b]forever[/b], which makes for an interesting element: the better you are at the game, the faster you will proceed. The worse you're at it, the slower. But that's not bad, that's good, because while a fast player might need fewer upgrades to reach the same point, the slower one will also have the chance to reach that place once he's better prepared and more experienced.\n\nBosses are hard, enemies can be hard, but there's not a lot of unfairness in the game.

At least I can write an angry review about it...\n\nThis is unmistakably the worst rogue-like I've ever played, not because it's \"too hard\" it's because it's barely finished. The controls are some of the worst I've ever \"endured\" from the platforming genre. Both you and the enemies feel slippery and stiff at the same time. You swerve through the air like a greased air hockey puck, you grind along the ground like a brick on sandpaper. And whoever decided the dash needed to be bound to both triggers, one for left and one for right, needs to be punched in the throat. Repeatedly. I usually diligently avoid edglord crap in my reviews, but seriously. Fist. Neck. Until you cry. And whoever thought up those bouncy platforms you need to activate with the down-slash which only works half-the time? Your Hell is wating, it is full of these things, and I can't wait to watch.\n\nBear in mind, I'm telling you the PRIMARY GAMEPLAY LOOP is trash. And I need to emphasize LOOP because my 99 minutes was 50 minutes going through the tedium of hitting start, rolling a character, skipping the store I can't afford, skipping the OTHER store I can't afford, and listening to the game literally laugh in my face as it takes away the meager 180 gold I got on the previous run. I got so bored with the five enemy types and the twenty practical jokes these @#$%s confused for gameplay, that the initial joy-- yes, [i]real joy[/i] --I got from its humorous quirks were completely and totally vaporized.\n\nThe design philosophy of Rogue Legacy can best be summed up with a single middle finger. It is the type of shovel-ware amateur garbage that has all the earmarks of zero-play-testing, where the developers were having all the fun because they had access to cheats. Absolutely nothing is polished: the movement is janky and frustrating; the randomized rooms are never at all balanced with enemy placement that's lazy instead of organic; and what it calls challenge is completely from the superior bullying position of the map designer instead of the player (spikes for days).\n\n$3 is nothing to me, but if I never get it, then these jokers owe me a hamburger.\nAnd for my irritation and suffering, a bottle of Talisker and a written apology. \u26dd", "timestamp_created": 1605386117, "timestamp_updated": 1605586961, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440906316041946411", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79253336": {"recommendationid": "79253336", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072617990", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1465209095}, "language": "english", "review": "hate controls\ngood roguelike", "timestamp_created": 1605363501, "timestamp_updated": 1605363501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79249354": {"recommendationid": "79249354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977603090", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1605531390}, "language": "english", "review": "yo dis is dope", "timestamp_created": 1605358114, "timestamp_updated": 1605358114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79228563": {"recommendationid": "79228563", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982855091", "num_games_owned": 668, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 7446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7446, "last_played": 1496974348}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended.

And it is definitely that but by introducing a story and the idea of heirs, the gameplay is allowed to blossom. After you have an unsuccessful run and your current character is killed, their heir takes up the mantle. You choose from one of three heirs, each with multiple possible combinations of standard classes and the more interesting \"traits\". Classes range from Paladin to Rogue to Mage to more powerful classes later on after upgrading. Traits are where, in my opinion, the game makes the way you play change drastically. For example, you may be a far-sighted dwarf. This means you have a blurred radius around your character who is also half the normal size. Being shorter makes it easier to dodge but your sword is shorter so to melee attack you need to get even closer to the enemy at further risk to your health bar. This is only one combination of the multitude possible. \n\nThe castle is procedurally generated each time so there's no memorization involved unless you choose to 'lock' down the castle, preventing it from changing at a cost of lower rewards.\nWithout spoiling too much of the game itself, there are multiple bosses in different regions you need to fight in order to progress and different loadouts suit different bosses so one character may be superbly equipped to deal with one but ill-equipped to deal with another. So don't worry if you can't beat all the bosses in one life as it carries over until you beat the final boss.\n\nIf you are looking for a postgame, there is a NG+ which scales up the monsters to higher levels to challenge you. There are also additional secret bosses who I won't talk about but they are optional and if you fail you don't die so retry as many times as you would like.\n\nOverall, the gameplay can get repetitive which is often a pitfull of roguelikes but it makes up for it with interesting mechanics, procedural generation and a phenomenal artstyle. Would wholly recommend to anyone who enjoys roguelikes or even skill based platforming fighting. \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1602978211, "timestamp_updated": 1602978211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77706222": {"recommendationid": "77706222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965717947", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2458, "last_played": 1602948305}, "language": "english", "review": "Bom jogo, vale pegar uma promo\u00e7\u00e3o nele. \nHist\u00f3ria praticamente inexistente e monstros repetitivos.\nContudo vale a gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1602945130, "timestamp_updated": 1602945130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77682072": {"recommendationid": "77682072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342551439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4518, "last_played": 1698881706}, "language": "spanish", "review": "tremendo regalenmen el roge2porfavor! <3", "timestamp_created": 1602905354, "timestamp_updated": 1602905354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77670283": {"recommendationid": "77670283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350540681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 728, "last_played": 1604079836}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty adictive Roguevania.

If I weren't playing this during lockdown, I would quit much earlier.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you earn gold which can be spent on upgrades for future members of your family... but any excess gold is immediately taken by the castle's gatekeeper, the Reaper. This is the most frustrating aspect of the game, as you end up only upgrading incrementally after you die. If you're unlucky, you'll die before you earn enough gold to purchase a single upgrade, making the entire run a complete waste of time. \n\nThis game can't be considered a proper Metroidvania, however. While gameplay hinges on exploration of its procedurally generated dungeon, you don't receive any unlocks that change how you explore the game in any meaningful way like a traditional Metroidvania. \n\nI do not recommend this game at its current price point of $15. If you are a rogue-like and platformer/metroidvania fan, it may be worth picking up in a bundle or when deeply discounted, but the grind will repel most players.\n\n[b]For more reviews like this one, follow the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38513044/]\u0ca0_\u0ca0 Reviews Curator page.[/url][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1602305015, "timestamp_updated": 1602305120, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77154953": {"recommendationid": "77154953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099413719", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5438, "last_played": 1602092272}, "language": "english", "review": "play this before the sequel!", "timestamp_created": 1602034803, "timestamp_updated": 1602034803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77065483": {"recommendationid": "77065483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135053560", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1925, "last_played": 1601882266}, "language": "english", "review": "really damn good. only rogue lite game i've ever finished fully.", "timestamp_created": 1601882310, "timestamp_updated": 1601882310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77029804": {"recommendationid": "77029804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099782283", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1847, "last_played": 1601295355}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Borb\u00f3n Simulator", "timestamp_created": 1601823689, "timestamp_updated": 1601823689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518072307109832764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77020216": {"recommendationid": "77020216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003695291", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 2026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2026, "last_played": 1566553425}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic rogue lite platforme.

It might seem basic but there is a small twist ending that I won't spoil. You start out by playing as a knight and go to a castle and explore it getting some loot and defeating enemies (after the tutorial ofc). When you die, you select one of your 3 children with all having different traits to continue your legacy. You always go back to the castle to discover more stuff, fight bosses, get more loot in order to get weapons, runes, and upgrade your castle. You can also find blueprints in order to unlock weapons. Now always going back might seem tedious but the castle keeps getting updated for a fresh experience. And the castle is not the only place to explore, there is also a forest at the right of the castle, towers above and a dungeon below. There are different enemies and bosses of said places as well.

Nos ponemos en la piel de un caballero que tiene que adentrarse en un castillo para averiguar qui\u00e9n ha asesinado al Rey. Empezamos pues a nivel 1, y cuando nuestro primer caballero muere, ser\u00e1 nuestro hijo o nuestra hija quienes tomen el testigo de esta cruzada.\n\nCabe destacar que los m\u00e1s importante es el farmeo: cuando un caballero muere, deja todo el oro que ha recogido a su familia, y este se utiliza para subir niveles mediante stats y crafteo: aumentar la vida, aumentar la magia, el cr\u00edtico, desbloquear nuevos tipos de caballeros, evolucionar clases, conseguir bonificaciones de oro, forjar espadas y armaduras o engarzar partes del equipo con runas m\u00e1gicas que nos permitir\u00e1n hacer uso de nuevas habilidades.\n\nRogue Legacy tiene cuatro niveles bien diferenciados: el Castillo, el Bosque, la Torre y la Mazmorra, y un total de cinco enfrentamientos contra jefes finales. Tambi\u00e9n existen innumerables secretos, zonas ocultas, etc.\n\nHe terminado la aventura principal en nueve horas, yendo a un ritmo pausado y farmeando cuando lo he necesitado. El jefe del Bosque me ha parecido el m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de todos y he finalizado el juego a nivel 108.

When I finally bought the game in 2015, I played on-and-off for about 20 hours or so and then gave up, having believed Khidr was something I'd need to grind for. When I came back last month, I went straight to Khidr and absolutely stomped the poor fool. And then I proceeded to stomp the Forest. The game lets you get away with grinding to a stupid level, and after 3 hours you'll have seen all of the procedurally generated rooms. \nThis was only compounded by the fact that this game has a total of 3 classes worth a damn: the Shinobi/Hokage, the Miner/Spelunker, and the Mage/Archmage. Close quarters combat is a sometimes-food. You'll have enough Mana and enough potions laying around to replenish your spam, which expedites this already relatively easy game, and the ability to choose between 2 sets of 3 spells where one is ridiculously good and the other sucks lobotomizes the game. I beat every boss by pulling out the spikes or the flamewheel as an Archmage.\nThe Spelunker is a weak class, but it sure doesn't need to stick around long. You can bum around the Castle and receive more than enough loot. I was never incentivized to push into the Maya or the otherwise more weighty regions because the opportunity for loot in them was too low just by design. Oh, but magic will save you if your sword damage is still lacking.\nThe Hokage is admittedly a class that you'll never use once you've upgraded your Mana enough, but it's yet another class to rush through the early game. I will also say that this class is infinitely superior to the Assassin, because crits should never be a core design concept.\nEvery other class is rendered worthless in comparison due to their lack of mobility or the amount of time it takes to whack at an enemy.\n\nI really love this game, and I still do, but it just didn't balance itself too well. It helped the genre a ton, and I can appreciate that, but the core gameplay loop gets boring after beating the way-too-easy final boss.

Their classes, spells, and birth traits are all random, and this opens so much replayability and playstyles for the game.\n\nThe other systems are somewhat a mixed bag.\n\nYou can unlock perks and items with gold, and find other permanent upgrades within the dungeon. Some players will love this and build their ideal character, but it also impacts the difficulty balance for the rest of the game. New enemies and bosses need much higher stats to stay competitive, and this turns them into damage sponges. No matter your skill there will be moments where you just need to grind for higher stats.\n\nThe dungeon is procedurally generated every time you do a run. It takes dozens of premade rooms and arranges them into unique layouts.\nI don't think this reaches its full potential for variety, especially when most rooms in new zones are just reskins of earlier rooms. However the generated dungeons do a great job of keeping you in the moment and finding your way, instead of just memorizing the layout.

I gave up on it for a long time, then tried revisiting it years later. Once I was able to last longer as a barbarian and struggle through finding some lucky chests at the boss doors a few times, and with luck from finding the Obdol item that lets you keep gold for two runs temporarily, I was able to buy income upgrades and the spelunker class, which greatly sped up the skill tree unlocks. From there, dumping all your points into health and a few weapon/vampirism/damage upgrades makes the game snowball out of control and you get to see the castle for what it really is.\n\nGenerally each \"wing\" is 24-26 rooms, and you're looking for chests or the boss rooms, since they always have a health drop and two chests even whether you've beaten the boss or not. Bosses are kind of fun, but just the largest versions of the slime, eye, skull and wisp enemies you'll find many of, and they are only repeatable on New Game+ runs. The final boss is pretty underwhelming and mostly a stat check. graphics and environments are okay with some charm, but there's many annoying room designs that punish you for not being a dwarf character, or having the correct spell to hit enemies behind walls or floors. There's many runes and blueprints to chase down but most of them are pretty boring and it only makes sense to use a few dedicated items to toughen yourself up.\n\nIt's sometimes satisfying to stumble into a room full of many mages or eyeballs and successfully bob and weave around all the projectiles and carefully clear the room out, but it takes a long time to get to the point where you can do any meaningful damage or survive many encounters, which is where the game's tuning falls very short. It's just too hard in the first 15 minutes, and way too easy once you've reached the tipping point, and a lot of the game ends up being very shallow, especially for built-up profiles.

But after a time (and finished the main story 2 times), I decided to buy (and finish the main story more 2 times) because the devs deserves my money. The game is simple but very satisfying, the controls are fluid and enjoyable, the upgrade system is good enough to keep you interested, and the new game + has more stuff to do. And not just that, but you can see the love from the devs: Some of the easter eggs are other games they have worked (including my favorite, Don't **** your Pants. This game is still in the Art Games session on Newgrounds).\nNow, for the gameplay: Nothing new here, but it's well done and satisfying enough (or I wouldn't have played all this time), and the traits system is a nice addition. And not just that, but now the game comes with its mod, Laments of Zor, which, btw, is a really nice and interesting addition to the game, and it renews the gameplay with balancing, new enemies, a balancing on the difficulty and the classes, and new special levels.\nOverall, I think the game worths its full price, and it's really nice. I'm now waiting anxiously for Rogue Legacy 2, and I believe it will be, at least, as good as this first one.

What was available to me around 5 hours into the game is the same as what was available after grinding another 20 hours and beating the game. Most of all, I wanted the ability to beat the final boss and replay through the first 4 bosses with all of my hard earned upgrades. Instead, your reward for beating the final boss is a new game + mode which just makes you feel weak and unaccomplished. The only way to progress in the new game + is to farm gold for raw damage and health upgrades, and you're robbed of the opportunity to feel powerful.

I got the obols for both Alexander IV and Astrodotus relatively quickly upon my third and fourth NG+ respectively as at this point i had fully completed the manor (except for that cheeky one at the top that i found later xD) and with high stats playing a paladin was shredding through without dying at all. The fight for Alex IV took me ages to complete, and Astro wasn't as hard but was quite fun. Then I hit an unlucky point, I could not for the life of me get another obol until I finally got Khidir's obol at NG+ 10. So NG+ 11 comes as I give the obol to Charon and get to Khidir beat it and get my first attempt at Neo Khidir. I fight for about 3 attempts and on my fourth my computer crashes. Ok strange but isn't uncommon as i've had this computer for a while and seems to be nearing it's lifespan. No matter I force shutdown my computer as it was black screen and turn my computer back on. Now here is where the thumbs down comes from, I open up the game and it goes \"game unexpectedly closed, fetching save\" or something like that shouldn't lose to much progress as I got Khider's obol the night before and had saved and quit my game to go to bed, at the very start of NG+ 11. WRONG! THE GAME PUT ME ALL THE WAY BACK AT NG+ 3! WAY BEFORE I EVEN GOT MY FIRST OBOL A FEW DAYS PRIOR. This has completely ruined my entire experience of the game and i can't even stomach going back to START ALL OVER AGAIN! This is the reason I must give a thumbs down for this review.

include more traits, like anxiety which would cause your screen to shake, a heartbeat sound or flash red when your health is low, (or all 3 at once, depending on how unlucky you are, anxiety is a b****) depression would increase MP usage or lower your attack stat when your HP is low, and one of my personal favorites, Alien Hand Syndrome, Don't know what Alien Hand Syndrome is? it's when your hand seems to have a mind of it's own, causing it to act independently, so basically it would switch the magic attack button with the regular attack button.", "timestamp_created": 1591853666,

It's just a basic action platformer, and a grindy one at that.\n\nThe reason this game isn't really a rogue-like/rogue-lite is because you can't find anything within a run to change things. There are no items you can pick up to change how you attack, passive items to give you stat buffs, etc\u2026 Your character at the start of the run will be exactly the same by the end of the run. The only thing that you can pick up is gold, and you can't even spend that gold within a run. You can only spend this gold once the run ends. Therefore, there's not much replayability as far as I am concerned.\n\nThat would be completely fine if the core gameplay was fun. Unfortunately, it's not THAT great. The characters you play as are very basic. They can attack, dash, do multiple jumps, magic attack, and a special ability. The magic attack is pretty much irrelevant because it costs mana and you can't regenerate mana unless you pick up MP potions, which drop very rarely. The special abilities are also almost all defensive abilities, so it's not like they're super fun to use. They also cost mana, so you're going to want to save them for bosses. So that leaves you with attacking, dashing, and jumping\u2026\u2026..That's really basic -_-. To be fair, developers can make playing as basic characters incredibly fun to play. I mean hell, it can be argued that player characters in Dark Souls and Hollow Knight are basic, and those are some of my favorite games.\n\nThis game certainly has the POTENTIAL to be as great as those games. The controls are very precise and combat is fast paced. If you make 1 mistake like attacking when you should've jumped, you're going to get hit. Fine-tuning a game to this degree isn't easy, and this forces every enemy to pose a decent challenge. In every room, you have to quickly take in your surroundings and figure out how best to deal with all the enemies while minimizing the damage you take. I mean sometimes you have to use tactics such as only approaching an enemy from below instead of directly from the left/right of them. This is all great.\n\nWhat's not so great, and what's limiting this game's potential, is the over-emphasis on offense. Basically, if it takes you more than 3 hits to kill an enemy, you're not going to progress. This is because, like I said, the game is fast-paced. If you take too long to kill 1 enemy, another enemy will start attacking you. The problem is that you can't just dodge every single attack. To be specific, you can dodge AN enemy, but you can't dodge MULTIPLE enemies. Eventually you'll get swarmed and get caught in undodgeable scenarios. It doesn't help that the game is pretty zoomed in and you don't get invincibility frames on your dash. So killing enemies quickly is an absolute must.\n\nThis is where the grindy part comes in. Like I said before, you can't find anything within a run to change things. You have to pick up gold and spend it once you die. So this game is really just a matter of grinding enough gold in order to beat it. I.e., once you've grinded enough gold to kill the enemies you want within 1 hit, you're probably going to beat that level. 2 bosses are a perfect example of this: Alexander and Herodotus. These bosses summon minions throughout the battle with no cap on the number of minions that can be summoned. If you can't kill these minions fast enough (i.e. in 1 hit), there's no way in hell you're going to beat the boss. So these bosses, and arguably all of the bosses, serve as effective walls for the grinding.\n\nUltimately, I don't see myself replaying this game. While I've beaten the game and unlocked new game plus, this game is not really a rogue-lite since I know beating new game plus is going to be about grinding enough levels to quickly kill enemies. That means I have to rate it based on the time I played, and that time wasn't all that fun because the game is fairly basic with the difficulty really only coming from the grinding. So yea, I wouldn't really recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1591475991, "timestamp_updated": 1591475991, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497910767793655396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70354561": {"recommendationid": "70354561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334954831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1591561516}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1591394055, "timestamp_updated": 1591394055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70255422": {"recommendationid": "70255422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016257185", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1188, "last_played": 1665070102}, "language": "english", "review": "Games i challenging but very fun.

The game has a fairly wide range of difficulty, starting out extremely hard and slowly becoming more manageable as you progress. This helps ensures the game never gets too easy and is always at least a moderate challenge. Repetitiveness is a bit of an issue, but it is a core element of the genre, so it doesn't stand out as much worse than something like Enter the Gungeon. Tough to play for extended periods of time, but is very easy to pick up and play. The game uses a few different mechanics to encourage you to make lots of small steps in progress rather than infrequent leaps. It helps to aid the feeling of your family tree getting stronger because of how minor a lot of the bonuses are. It can get fairly grindy later in the game, but it is still an enjoyable trip there.\n\n8/10\n[quote]\nVisit our [url=https://www.mmmreviews.com]website[/url] for more in-depth reviews and recommendations\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1590355467, "timestamp_updated": 1597410057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535745441913604736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69703608": {"recommendationid": "69703608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301132052", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 12017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11292, "last_played": 1695477550}, "language": "english", "review": "fum gaem\n", "timestamp_created": 1590292729, "timestamp_updated": 1590292729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69697724": {"recommendationid": "69697724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020841943", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1590279923}, "language": "english", "review": "It is supposed to be hard.

Me record\u00f3 a un Symphony of the Night de bajo presupuesto (no como algo negativo). Y hasta cierto punto me pareci\u00f3 muy interesante el que cada partida fuese diferente. Fue mi primer contacto con los \"rogue\", y en consecuencia se convirti\u00f3 en el rasero por el que los mido todos, para bien o para mal.\n\nVaya por delante, que no es un genero de juego que me entusiasme. Si, he probado algunos y me han gustado, pero en muchos casos, al saber que un juego que me llamaba la atenci\u00f3n era rogue-like, pensaba: \"oh... que lastima\". Pero si luego el juego es bueno... pues lo es, y punto.\n\nY este \"Rogue Legacy\" que nos ocupa es una maravilla. Tras verlo en casa de ese amigo, me lo pill\u00e9 en ps3 y le d\u00ed much\u00edsimo. Y ahora le he vuelto a dar m\u00e1s. Pero... de que va esto?\n\nPues somos un caballero que tiene que cumplir una misi\u00f3n en un castillo maldito. Casi con total seguridad moriremos, y cuando lo hagamos, uno de nuestros descendientes (a elegir entre 3) deber\u00e1 tomar el testigo y completar dicha misi\u00f3n.\n\nPero el castillo est\u00e1 maldito, y cada vez que uno de nuestros descendientes entra, es diferente. Existe un m\u00e9todo para \"bloquear\" el castillo y que sea igual que el anterior, pero al coste de un 40% del oro que encontremos.\n\nHablemos de los descendientes, que a fin de cuentas, s\u00f3n los que tendr\u00e1n que lidiar con el problema en cuesti\u00f3n. Todos nuestros descendientes tendr\u00e1n alg\u00fan atributo, que en algunos casos puede ser positivo, en otros negativo, y en otros irrelevante. \nAlgunos ejemplos de atributos positivos serian: No tienes pulso en los pies (no te afectan las trampas de pinchos), conduces la electricidad (las plataformas siempre est\u00e1n abiertas), trastornos compulsivos (obtienes pm's por romper objetos), etc.\nAlgunos ejemplos negativos serian: Dislexia (los textos salen desordenados), daltonismo (se ve todo en blanco y negro), miopia...\nAlgunos ejemplos irrelevantes serian: Calvicie, Gay, Exageraci\u00f3n... ninguno de estos tiene efecto alguno en el personaje, por eso digo que s\u00f3n irrelevantes. En el caso de la exageraci\u00f3n, simplemente cada golpe nos marcar\u00e1 un da\u00f1o de 2500 de da\u00f1o, pero la cifra real de da\u00f1o ser\u00e1 la normal (25, por ejemplo).\n\nCon cada heredero que juguemos, ir\u00e1 recogiendo oro que al morir, nos permitir\u00e1 comprar mejoras de vida, ataque, magia, cr\u00edtico, mejoras de clases, nuevas clases, y un largo etc. Cada vez que compremos una mejora, el coste de las dem\u00e1s se incrementar\u00e1 ligeramente.\n\nTambien encontraremos planos de armadura y runas, que podremos equipar antes de entrar al castillo (y comprarlas, claro).\n\nRespecto a lo dem\u00e1s... t\u00e9cnicamente m\u00e1s que correcto, la m\u00fasica est\u00e1 bien, y lo \u00fanico que me chirr\u00eda, es que en las retransmisiones, el juego da un baj\u00f3n de fps bien gordo. Desconozco el motivo. El control es muy bueno y la dificultad diria que alta/muy alta. Morireis much\u00edsimo (o yo lo hice al menos) y en consecuencia os picar\u00e9is un mont\u00f3n.\n\nPersonalmente, creo que la manera de integrar los elementos rogue es magistral. Que sea tu familia la que generaci\u00f3n tras generaci\u00f3n luche para quitar la maldici\u00f3n del castillo, tiene todo el sentido del mundo. De hecho, la excusa de los Belmont en Castlevania y el castillo de Dr\u00e1cula (que est\u00e1 maldito y tiene muchas formas), aqu\u00ed me da la impresi\u00f3n de estar much\u00edsimo mejor llevado a cabo e implementado.\n\nY no se me ocurre mucho m\u00e1s asi a bote pronto. Lo cierto es que es el mejor rogue (para mi), y si os gusta el g\u00e9nero me sorprenderia que no los hubieseis probado ya. De modo que le voy a cascar un 9 sin siquiera parpadear, y SI, recomendad\u00edsimo.\n\nY en el pr\u00f3ximo episodio de Manqueando... deberia decir \"Lords of the Fallen\", que es a lo que estoy jugando, pero ya le hice una \"cr\u00edtica\" que voy a tener que rehacer por completo. Y para no desmadejar el hilo, voy a esperar a ver que toco despues. De modo que... stay tuned for new updates!\n\nEdit: Una vez rehecha la \"rese\u00f1a\" de \"Lords of the fallen\", para el proximo Manqueando... \"Dead Cells\"", "timestamp_created": 1590255081, "timestamp_updated": 1590880950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872172832489014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69574807": {"recommendationid": "69574807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198892157804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1592277363}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy divertido", "timestamp_created": 1590109042, "timestamp_updated": 1590109042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69565407": {"recommendationid": "69565407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088843983", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1304, "last_played": 1590102485}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Rogue Legacy es un gran juego.\n\nHonestamente, no soy de jugar rogue-lites o rogue-likes, pero este siempre llam\u00f3 mi atenci\u00f3n.

At that point, you have to make a judgement call about whether that room is worth your time or not.\n\nThe upgrade tree provides a lot of options, and the vast majority of these are useful.  The game encourages you to even out your stats by making a particular stat cost more every time you upgrade it.  This means that you'll be able to swap between a mage and a knight quite easily, but you probably won't make a lot of meaningful long-term build choices.  Often I just found myself upgrading whatever was most relevant to the character I was using.  The biggest problem is that all of the stats cap eventually, which means that if you play NG+, you eventually won't have any use for your money whatsoever.  I think there should have been some use for your cash in NG+ that would never become obsolete.\n\nAnother issue is the way that runes were handled.  Because each set of runes is the same, you'll be acquiring duplicates of the same runes that you already have for probably half the game.  This means that the faerie chests aren't very exciting to open until you've collected all of the runes.\n\nBut beyond those issues, the core gameplay is solid, and I definitely recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1589836281, "timestamp_updated": 1589836281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69371873": {"recommendationid": "69371873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079888394", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 1256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1256, "last_played": 1507570905}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.\n\nProbably my first roguelite (or whatever this is called).

The game is a unique take on the rouge like/lite genre, I am not a massive fan of roguelites, and prefer rougelikes. I feel the constant powering up of oneself means you don't get the sense of overcoming a challenge. I enjoy the enemy design, however I wish they didn't constantly recycle the same exact design with different recolors. Furthermore, for a game that is meant to be somewhat difficult, the difficulty of the five titular bosses is quite disappointing. The only boss I found to be actually difficult was the slime like boss found in the final area of the game. One of my favorite parts of the game was how open it was, although there was a map that conveniently marks the difficulty for each area (more squares = higher level enemies), the game allows you to find the final area and get massacred.  This leaves the player with a feeling of fear with those areas, and makes every revisit feel scary and makes every step feel like a victory. I'm very pleased with the debuff system in the game, with (almost) every debuff having benefits. My favorite example was the ADHD debuff, speeding you up significantly, however, making you lose more control of your character. Small micro decisions like that before the game allows the player to feel smart even before entering the castle.

Since your money reset at the start of each run, you can't just farm early areas for money and actually have to do well in the run to come back with enough money for anything at all. I also really appreciate having an in-game story reason for the perma-death. I can certainly see some people preferring this to traditional rouge-like mechanic. However, I am not one of those people, despite acknowledging the accomplished what they set out to do well. This structure occasionally make it ambiguous if you got better through improved skills or grinding for the permanent upgrade. Rationally, I know it's both, but it still feels weird sometime.\n\n\nThe game play is pretty fun, you have multiple classes with different abilities, different equipments to choose from, both melee and magic attacks. The game is challenging for sure but it is fair. The controls were smooth and enemies and bosses all have attack patterns that you can learn.

Not to mention that those new enemies will take about a dozen hits to defeat each, giving them ample time to return fire...\n\nAlthough moving around isn't difficult, it's quite slow. Thankfully not as bad as Towerclimb, but slow enough that the first zone is going to get old fast.\n\nThe entire family tree gimmick. Most of the time, you'll have some inconvenient-but-ultimately-harmless things to deal with. Maybe you randomly fart, which creates a small visual effect and a noise. Maybe the screen has a old-timey black-and-white-like effect. Other times, your screen will be flipped both vertically and horizontally, you can't see your HUD, and your hitbox is about twice as large as normal. This is problematic, considering if you don't have a choice in the matter, your only option is to intentionally get yourself killed to reroll your awful run. Thus wasting multiple minutes.\n\nThe combat. You have precisely three attacks. A swing that covers your front, as well as behind you, a downward stab that will bounce you upward if it hits, and your magic attack (which has limited uses). 90% of the time, you'll only be using the first for combat, the second for puzzles, and the third for bosses. This is unaffected by anything else; your only melee options are swords, which are all palette-swaps with stat changes (not interesting stat changes, mind you; this one has 10% more damage. Ooh, fancy.). The class system is pretty much irrelevant; none of them give any meaningful bonuses, so you can just ignore them entirely without missing anything. You jump or walk toward enemy, press attack button once or twice (if you're in a level-appropriate area, otherwise you'll die before coming close to an enemy, or getting started on their massive healthbar), and move on. Your movement options are similarly diverse; you can walk, and you can jump. Sometimes there are platforms that you activate using the downward stab, which is exclusively used for this since it sucks in every other regard. Even Mario Bros had more options; you could both sprint AND crouch, in addition to walking and jumping.\n\nIt boils down to just mindlessly grinding until you outclass everything in stats, and it's not exactly a good example of that, either. Reactor Incremental, for example, on Kongregate, for free, lets you attempt to customize your reactor in order to produce as much power as possible. If you're looking to spend time and $15, this is the game for you. If you're looking to have fun, look somewhere else.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1580276518, "timestamp_updated": 1580276518, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480120033025741577", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62604947": {"recommendationid": "62604947", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977250280", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 315, "playtime_forever": 2445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2445, "last_played": 1580272574}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent rouge like adventure game with tight controls, fun levels and enemies and many many hours of gameplay.

I love a challenge; I have a blast playing the Dark Souls series (which honestly doesn't even feel hard to me), old-school RPGs, and Monster Hunter. I was also a big fan of \"Roguelites\", which followed the general formula of Roguelike games but also allowed for metaprogression; in particular, I was a fan of Azure Dreams, and sunk hundreds of hours into it. I grew up loving to find challenges and figure out how to overcome them using strategy and thinking out an approach.\n\nNow, let's talk about Rogue Legacy.\n\nRogue Legacy is an action platformer vaguely reminiscent of metroidvania games. You tackle the castle, you collect gold, you die, you spend the gold to upgrade your next character, rinse and repeat. You continue this cycle, while learning enemy patterns and acquiring treasures in the form of Runes and Equipment Blueprints. \n\nOn paper, it's a fine and excellent standard roguelike formula. In practice, however, it plays absolutely nothing like roguelikes/lites you may have experienced in the past.\n\nMost roguelikes/lites require you to plan out your approach, carefully considering your movements and taking calculated risks while using every possible item, spell, weapon, tactic, or advantage of literally any kind to survive. \n\nRogue Legacy is nothing like this. There are some areas where you need to think out your approach, but in general the most complex thinking comes in the form of \"Hmm, what do I need in order to acquire that Fairy Chest?\", and remembering to lock the castle with the Architect if you get what you need.\n\nThe other 95% of the game is twitch reflexes, praying to god that you don't get swarmed by enemies that can shoot through walls, trying desperately to avoid cheap contact damage, and just generally dealing with complete bullet hell situations minus the bullets and with extra doses of hell. While being deprived of anything resembling healing or mana restoration 99% of the time unless you specifically choose to play a class that gives you MP regeneration as a feature.\n\nIt technically follows the surface-level formula of a roguelike. \"Procedurally randomize everything, place the player against impossible odds, and make them want to tear their hair out in frustration.\" However, because it replaces the strategic thinking of most roguelikes with twitch reflexes and bullet hell dodging, it's just not the same experience.\n\nRogue Legacy is for players that enjoy extremely fast-paced, incredibly unforgiving and often downright unfair gameplay. No matter how many times you attempt to play, the game WILL figure out new ways to screw you over... or otherwise just subject you to the same screw-you's that worked before.\n\nGot a character with Gigantism? Prepare for spike-filled precision-platforming to take up every room. Pick a miner to try and get some gold? Every other room will have an enemy that's far above the level of what you should be fighting. Pick a combat-focused class? Enjoy being swarmed by projectiles and contact-damage-abusing enemies at every possible turn.\n\nI thought we moved past contact damage as a mechanic. You could call it a throwback to oldschool gaming. I call it cheap and lazy fake difficulty; the reason contact damage was normalized by early games is because in the early stages of gaming, it was much more difficult to program relatively intelligent AI to provide a challenge without the use of contact damage. Considering how much the gaming industry has developed, there is no longer any excuse to rely on contact damage combined with Depth Perplexion for 90% of the challenge in the game.\n\nI want to like Rogue Legacy, and I keep coming back to it thinking \"Maybe it's not as unfair as I remember\", only to quickly be reminded that, yes, it's incredibly brutal and unfair in just about every possible way except for the hitboxes themselves. There's \"Difficult\", and then there's \"Why would you throw your skull against this brick wall more than once or twice?\"\n\nFor those who want the bragging rights and have nothing better to do all day but repeatedly throw themselves at this hellishly, unfairly difficult game, I salute you and respect your decision. For those of us who are actually sane (or at least don't have godlike reflexes and inherent slow-motion perception of the world around us), pass this one up and play dark souls instead. It's still a challenging game, but at least it's actually fair and doesnt depend on cheap gotchas, contact damage, and ledge bats to kill you. (Well, aside from the capra demon.)\n\nOriginal review Posted January 19, 2020.\n\nI once again attempted to play this game on December 9, 2021 upon watching a Rogue Legacy 2 Let's Play video thinking maybe I could attempt to beat it to have it under my belt before eventually playing Rogue Legacy 2. Yeah no. It's just as ridiculously unfair and obnoxious in its many enemy-favoring and player-crippling mechanics as I remember.

It was painful and boring to 100% this game, even though I've spent much more time 100%ing other games.\n\nI think that the only fun part of this game after the initial high when I bought it was the Thanatophobia achievement since you can't just brute force your way through the game and have to actually do some roguish stuff to maximize your gold with every run so that you can beat the game in under 15 deaths. It adds a sense of thrill to the game, but you unfortunately need to beat the game once or twice to get the skills to do it.\n\nI wouldn't buy it even for a massive discount. It's the most generic roguelite around. Still, if you do buy it, don't try to 100% it: beat the game, ignore NG+, and then go for Thanatophobia. That's probably the most fun way to play it, I think.\n\nOn the contrary, Monolith and Spelunky are both far better roguelike games that are usually about the same price as Rogue Legacy. Monolith has super fun shooty bullet combat and fun boss battles, and Spelunky is just brutal cave exploring action.

Con un toque de rol debido a que, con el dinero que vas consiguiendo, vas mejorando a los personajes posteriores. Tu decides si mejorar el Damage, la defensa o subirle la vida o mana.\nLa m\u00fasica es adecuada. Nada que destacar.\nEl apartado visual me ha parecido agradable. Los escenarios, no son variados debido a que sucede todo en un castillo, pero logran darle ese toque cl\u00e1sico y retro. En mi opini\u00f3n acertado.\nLos enemigos que nos encontramos si que son variados, acumulandose en la pantalla y atacandonos sucesivamente.

At first you can only jump and use your sword, having a particularly satisfying bounce slash that only works if timed juuuuuust right.\n\nWhen beginning the tables are turned against you and it you really feel it. Death after death you will keep running into the castle, which is procedurally generated each run, meaning that each time you explore it, the layout will be different than before.\n\nAs the title of the game suggests you are in fact leaving a legacy, as each new life you start as a descendant of the character you\u2019ve previously played. With each new life you can choose one of three descendants to play as, each with varying size, class, personal trait, and magic ability. For example you can get a colorblind mage and while you can defeat enemies by casting fireballs that circle around you, it\u2019s pretty hard to navigate through the level safely. Some will have glaucoma, making the entire level blurry, others have Vertigo, forcing you to play through the level upside down with the UI mirrored. In the beginning these characters just feel like torture to play, but if you embrace the challenge it can be an intriguing test of your skills.\n\nSpeaking of torture, Rogue Legacy is HARD. Like an old school platformer, take a break and come back hard, especially in the beginning. \n\n\nThe way that you progress in Rogue Legacy is using the coins that you collect each round to purchase upgrades to your estate which raises things like your attack stats, health, unlocks new characters and much more. You can also spend that money to unlock weapons, armor, and runes if you have found their blueprint in the game.\n\nEven then Rogue Legacy will still give you a realty check if you aren\u2019t giving it your all, but after you get deep into your unlocks you\u2019ll be able to level the playing field a bit. For each piece of armor or weapon that you wield you can equip a rune. Runes can vary from giving you an extra jump, which can be stacked so that you can have a triple or quadruple jump, a dash ability or earning more coins throughout the level.\n\nOverall, the game runs great on the the Switch, except for one crazy glitch that occured when I was in a middle of a great run, which really sucked, but the glitch was fun to experiment with.\n\nRogue Legacy is an addictive rogue-light platformer with a rewarding progression system once you get into the meat of the video game. The quick runs lend it to a great portable experience that I can wholeheartedly recommend if you are a fan of difficult retro platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1571579196, "timestamp_updated": 1571579196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55642133": {"recommendationid": "55642133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168849492", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 1434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1423, "last_played": 1595520059}, "language": "spanish", "review": "worth", "timestamp_created": 1571323230, "timestamp_updated": 1595522019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55631920": {"recommendationid": "55631920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122074266", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1541, "last_played": 1571250933}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really fun game.

Complete grindfest as well, you get upgrades that make consecutive runs easier as you can increase max health/armor etc.  Another thing that pisses me off is the RNG, you have to select between a couple characters each time which have different stats and abilities.

It's too difficult, but for the wrong reasons. It's not just a matter of getting good, it's just plain bad game design.\n\nThis game is pretty much a \"metroidvania meets bullet hell\" rogue-like game, but at first you'd think it's just the metroidvania part. That's where things start getting wrong anyway, because the clunky controls make getting through the rooms without getting hit, either by running into enemies, projectiles or plain old spikes, a much more complicated feat that you'd like. Health and mana go down quickly and recovery is sparse (and percentage based, which hurts more than helps). Now, you'll likely still be able to manage through the the first area of the game and chance upon one of the other three, which is where the bullet hell parts come in. Every enemy you found gets on steroids and hits harder and much more often, making dodging nearly impossible, so you'll be dead pretty much as soon as you set foot on one of them.\n\nSo how do you prevent that? We're back to the metroidvania - time to level up. Which you do by accruing gold before you die and once you do spending it on upgrades to make your characters stronger. Only that upgrades don't really matter much without getting a lot of them, and they just happen to get costlier each time. So you're back to the castle and notice that you lose any money you didn't use and that you're hitting a wall because you need way more money than you can get before you're dead again. Now you're stuck, needing to try multiple times until you luck out, get enough money and thus a tiny bit stronger. Rinse and repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat. Repeat while enduring the small variety of palette swapped enemies and bosses.\n\nI could get into more detail as how the game ruins your experience, but that pretty much sums up the worst points: it's unfair, and it becomes a way too boring grindfest. And even what could have been great ideas, like the whole class system along the different traits your character can get, gets screwed by the fact that you don't get to choose them (each time you pick one of three pre-generated characters) nor you can use a particular character for long enough since you'll die sooner than later. And even so, they end up feeling really similar since most of your damage is the sword-swing that every character shares.\n\nFor me, this game could have been one of my favorites, but it ended up falling short of expectations.

[u] The Camera [/u]\n\nIt's zoomed in so far that I can't reliably drop through a platform without getting hit by an off-screen projectile. I know that zooming out would take away the challenge of one of the traits, but it would also take away a lot of frustration when getting hit by something off-screen.\n\n2. [u] The Boss AI. [/u]\n\nAll of them have some form of RNG that can make them more or less difficult depending on how lucky you get. Based on my experience, both the regular and remix fights of the second and final boss are too erratic for me to reliably kill.\n\nIn the case of the final boss, he jumps, dashes, and uses his various attacks wildly making it extremely hard to predict what he's doing, and with certain attacks being spammable, you can often find yourself at the receiving end of a barrage of axes.\n\nduring his final phase he has two attacks that he can spam. One summons swords from the ground to fly up into the player, and the other summons daggers from either the left or right side of the arena. Since he can spam them, many times you'll be left without an opening to dodge through the attacks.\n\nThe second boss is really what takes the cake though because he can spawn minions who're also RNG reliant. Since they can all spawn projectiles to hit you with, you'll need to kill them else they'll turn the fight into a bullet hell. If you enter this fight as anything other than a shinobi or lich king, prepare for a frustrating battle.\n\nWith his remix fight though, you're in a world of pain. He spawns even more minions, the arena is covered in spikes, and with the zoomed in camera, you'll often teleport into enemies that you couldn't see. This is easily the most frustrating and difficult boss of the entire game. You can make it easier by spending money to buff the specter you play as for the fight, but ultimately this is a battle of luck. Please reconsider beating this game 100%.\n\n3. [u] The Room Layouts. [/u]\n\nThe majority of them are really good actually, but a few can be packed to the brim with enemies. Overall it's not that bad. What is an issue though is walking into a room and immediately being hit by an enemy standing by the entrance because you couldn't react fast enough to not run into it. It happens rarely, but it happened enough to where I decided to put it here.\n\n4. [u] The Hitboxes. [/u]\n\nThere seems to be a theme where the sprites of enemies, characters, and projectiles are larger than their hitboxes. It feels really weird having a spiked ball clearly touch your forehead only for it to phase right through you because your hitbox is actually shorter than your character sprite. The same goes for landing on platforms although I think this one is more an issue in that half the width of the character sprite is in the sword. It makes me think that my feet are more towards the center than they actually are.\n\n5. [u] The Physics. [/u]\n\nThe most frustrating part of this game for me is how your character will go from no movement to full speed in a single frame. In a slower game like Castlevania this is perfectly fine, especially with how much of the screen you can see in that game, but in this game, coupled with the cameras zoom, the lack of any momentum makes everything feel so sudden. The same goes for enemies although since enemies take knockback it's generally not an issue.\n\nOverall great game, but be prepared for the jank.

If things are getting tough, you can spend the money you found to upgrade your own castle for your heirs to upgrade their global stats and grant them access to new shops, abilities, and classes.\n\nThat brings me to the characters themselves.
