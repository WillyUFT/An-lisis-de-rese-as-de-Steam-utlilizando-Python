This would be fine if there was any depth to the combat in terms of strategy...instead its all about weaknesses and status effects (if the enemy has no weakness). So to find a weakness (at least 30 hours into the game) you have to attack the enemy to see if its weak. There are many different attack types so experimenting will cost you turns if unlucky. But when the enemy hits you, its most of the times game over and back to the tile screen. Encounters are then trivialized once you see what types of dmg the enemy can do. I literally no brained a boss, because I had a persona negating all dmg from it...that's how trivial it can be and its disappointing. For a game that has sooooo much love put into it to fail so miserably at combat, which for me is a major part why I like turn base games, is beyond mind boggling. So many different mechanics, so much variety but when it comes all together its much much less than the sum of its parts.\n\nEverything else about this game is Amazing!

SPOILERS AHEAD[/h1]\n\nWow.\n\nNot even know where to start. And, again, be wary, [b]there are plot spoilers ahead![/b]\n\n\nThe end of the semester and the high school festival has been marked by the rise and fall of the Phantom Thieves by the public opinion. I think this portray very well our society, whose only objective seems to be the desire for great heroes to be praised and evil villains to squander expressly. Throwaway stories, superficial connections created in order to trample and stand out above others, and sacrifices of people in the name of progress.\n\nThe whole topic of public opinion, how we perceive others and how it influences us has been growing more and more as it reached the culmination of the main story, completely breaking the stigmas of Japanese society about corrupt politicians, the media being controlled by the government and manipulating public opinion (and I see this is as a world-wide issue).\n\nThis has resulted in the creation of a god of Control who had been with us longer than we thought, even kidnapping good old Igor and splitting Lavenza into Caroline and Justine just to keep the fa\u00e7ade of our Velvet Room. And the great revelation: Morgana was not only not human, but she was also a creation of Igor with the remnants of hope that there was on the part of humanity, in the purest Pandora's box style.\n\nThe final battle with Satanael behind us has been wonderful, at the top of the center of Tokyo and with Shinjuku invaded and fused with Mementos. Seeing how the God of Control became more dangerous, thus causing the \"awakening\" of the people, has been a very epic culmination of the main story.\n\nAkechi as a villain has been a slow-cooked delight, even having him as a temporary member of the Phantom Thieves. Also, this kid has had ALL the references. He has been a Light Yagami with Berserk-esque villain overtones by way of his second true personality. He has been a clear target for all anime fans serving up personality, charisma, and a tragic past typical of this type of character.\n\nI could say much more, but we DON'T STOP. Right after the end of the year, we started directly with the content of Royal.

Look I\u2019m fully aware that by buying every re-release of a game I\u2019m part of a problem in today\u2019s gaming industry. Gamers being squeezed for every last penny they\u2019ve got, more so with fans of a particular game or series. \u201cThey love it, so they\u2019ll buy it anyway\u201d. And Atlus certainly has proven itself to be part of that side of the gaming industry that wants their fans to pay the absolute maximum, because they know that we\u2019ll buy it anyway.\nIt's just that most of their games are some of the absolute best ever made, and Persona 5 Royal, for me, is probably on top of that list. It\u2019s everything I hoped a game would be as a kid and here\u2019s why.\n\n[h3]A childhood dream come true[/h3]\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to read tons of comics, hundreds of them a year. My parents bought me a little tape-player (yes, I\u2019m that old) and every last cent of my pocket money was spent on either comics, music, or audiobooks on tape. It was much cheaper than buying a CD and the selection they had on certain events was just insane. Laying in bed listening to every story over and over again, my eyes closed and imagining I was part of every journey. No matter if I was Tintin, Spiderman, Wolverine or Asterix, I loved every story and I\u2019ve been a part of many of them.\n\nI wasn\u2019t all too familiar with Atlus-games in 2016, but I saw a trailer for Persona 5 and immediately added it to my wishlist on the PS-store. The more I checked out some early-on impressions on YouTube and read about it, I became aware of the huge passion the fans of the series had. Apparently the Persona series (and ofcourse Megami Tensei as a whole) had quite the legacy, which only made me more excited to play the game. \n\nIn April 2017 I was sitting on my couch, watching the download of Persona 5 crawl along. I felt something that I felt when unwrapping a new comic or tape. A mix of anticipation, excitement and a hint of nervousness. It\u2019s done. The Atlus logo is displayed, the music starts, goosebumps. And suddenly I\u2019m not sitting on my couch anymore, I\u2019m part of the Persona universe, each morning I\u2019m waking up in an attic, I\u2019m Ren/Joker.\n\n[h3]Masterful storytelling[/h3]\n\nRen\u2019s a high school student accused of assault and therefore put on probation, his parents decide that he\u2019ll go to another school and stay with their family friend Sojiro Sakura. There he\u2019ll become part of a story where adults are taking advantage of their (social) positions, most of the time to the detriment of children/young adults. Ren/Joker gets to know these victims, befriends them and starts to form his own social circle in this new city. Adults who become so distorted by their own (wicked) desires form a so-called palace. A place where they are the rulers and anything what they want to be in real life becomes reality, influencing their behavior in the real world. Ren and his friends infiltrate these places (palaces) and try to take away the thing that feeds these adults to behave the way they do (a treasure). \n\nPersona 5 does an impeccable job sucking you in their world. The way the story unfolds is on a level I\u2019ve experienced maybe a handful of times in gaming. Yes, it\u2019s a slow burn the first couple of hours but with good reason. The game starts in the middle of the story and after you are introduced to the stories\u2019 setting you are thrown back to the beginning. So many questions arise: Why was I there, what was I doing in a casino of all places, who betrayed me? \n\nWhen you get to the free roam part of the game you\u2019re several hours in. It\u2019ll definitely be worth it, but if you\u2019re more into the \u2018dive straight into the action\u2019-type games, be aware of this. But I hope you can find the patience because otherwise you\u2019re missing out on one of the greatest stories ever told.\n\nPersona, for me, feels like I\u2019m reading a comic and all of a sudden I\u2019m part of the story and certain choices have an impact on MY friends, on MY town, on MY family. I don\u2019t want to disappoint any of them, which make some of the choices so hard and so genuine. Who to spent time with? Who to date? Who to deepen your bond with? To balance all these choices while also trying to improve your own (social and combat) skills feels just like real life. I don\u2019t want to say no to any of them, but I\u2019ve got to think of myself as well you know?  I am Ren/Joker, these choices are mine and I must deal with the consequences. \n\n[h3]Perfect gameplay[/h3]\n\nP5(R) stays true to the turn based genre and to earlier Persona and to most of the Megami Tensei games. If you\u2019re familiar with them than P5R brings very little new stuff to the table, but it\u2019s probably also the reason you\u2019ll love this one. The game is divided in 2 forms of gameplay. \n\nFirst the dungeon crawling, action focused gameplay takes place in palaces/Mementos. Here you\u2019ll face \u2018shadows\u2019, fight them, gain new (fighting) skill and collect new additions to your team. Second is social part of the game, here you can explore the city, train social/life skills and socialize with a wide variety of people struggling with society. These social connections are a large part of what makes P5R so great. Each of the social connections has their own backstory. Some struggle with past mistakes, some with financial issues, are being bullied or are even unaware of who they really are. With each step you get to know them more and just like a real friendship they try to help you along in life, just like you\u2018re helping them. \n\nThe balance between the 2 gameplay types is great. Whenever you reach the limitation of certain confidant/social storylines the main storyline advances. Giving you several hours of action-filled gameplay, which advances everyone\u2019s story and gives you a new purpose to focus on when the social aspect again becomes the main focus. This ebb and flow of different kinds of gameplay keeps you invested, interested and makes it hard to stop. There\u2019s always something new to see, learn and love just a couple of minutes away.\n\nIn the last 6 years I\u2019ve played P5 (including Royal) 7 times. Depending on the difficulty setting and your interest to explore every part of each confidant, it should take you anywhere from 70 to 120 hours to complete. New game plus lets you keep items and social skills from the previous playthrough, which gives you more time to deepen the relations with the people around you and encourages you to choose an increased difficulty.\n\n[h3]I\u2019m not crying..[/h3]\nThe amount of times I\u2019ve had goosebumps from profound emotional moments is insanely high. Moments where you can\u2019t help but yell at the screen be it from happiness, anger of sadness. And when the story reaches it\u2019s inevitable peak and conclusion it felt like I was saying goodbye to my own friends and family. You know that feeling when you\u2019re watching the last scene of \u2018Friends\u2019 (or another series that\u2019s close to your heart), \u2018Embryonic Journey\u2019 by Jefferson Airplane starts playing and you feel the tears welling up in your eyes. You\u2019re torn somewhere between a feeling of love, loss and happiness to have been part of something truly special.\n\nP5R does that to you. It makes you want to instantly play the game again but also to keep a distance for a while because it takes time to recover from something that you so deeply love but eventually has to end. \n", "timestamp_created": 1700650282, "timestamp_updated": 1700650282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651912868022918701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150945460": {"recommendationid": "150945460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198888050534", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 204, "playtime_at_review": 1066, "last_played": 1700648546}, "language": "english", "review": "Loki.

I was not the biggest fan of the soundtrack originally coming from persona 4 and persona 3 but honestly It really grew on me. All of the music is really well put together and sounds really great. The costumes are really fun to use and some even change the in game battle themes. This game is roughly around 115-120 hours long to get the true royal ending some will say longer but that is if you are going at a slower pace. This game technically is cannon though some of the elements of royal are not in the sequel persona 5 Strikers. If you are playing this game for the first time I 100% recommend looking up a guide for the true royal ending and screenshot it.  The reason to why i say so is because the game is like over 100 hours XD. One tip I have is to make lots of save files especialy around the end of the year like november and going forward.

Its also my first Persona game, so it also served as a great introduction to the series for me. I was first introduced to the series in 2020 by my friend who owned this game on his PS4, and recommended it to me knowing I'm a huge RPG fan. But I couldn't play it at that time because I never owned a console and only had a PC. That's why I was so happy when Atlus finally announced that the game would be ported to both PC and Xbox and I'm glad I bought it. \n\nThe story is one of the best aspects of the game, and kept me hooked from start to finish, with its amazing characters and world building. It is filled with both happy and sad moments alike, with a lot of twists and turns. The turn based combat is phenomenal and engaging, and the boss fights were really well done. All the extra content they added with Royal were amazing and [spoiler] the Third Semester and Maruki's fight  [/spoiler] were my favorites. All of the side activities, like the mini-games, confidants, were really well done.\n\nOverall, if you are a fan of turn based JRPGs and are looking for a mystery filled story with twists and turns and amazing characters and combat, definitely go for this game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1700136599, "timestamp_updated": 1700136599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0,

From Arsene Lupin to Captain Kidd. Using these to battle Shadows (the opposite of Personas in Jung psych), you along with a colorful cast of characters will take down oppressive adults and take their heart's treasure. Combat is a hyper accessible yet deep spin on traditional turn based combat known as the Press-Turn system. As a general hater of turn based combat, its fantastic in this game, mainly because menus have been done away with as best they can--each button on the controller/near the WASDs corresponds to a battle action, a single button will target the weakness of a known enemy, and damage is relatively high on both sides. By targeting an enemies weakness, you not only knock them down, you gain another turn during which you can finish off the opponent, target a different one, heal, or you can pass that turn down to a teammate who can then target a weakness and pass their free turn down to the next person, effectively giving you 8 turns in a fight before the enemy can react should the circumstances be ideal. weaknesses can also be \"created\" via technical attacks--shattering a frozen enemy, hitting a sleeping enemy, attacking the mind of a confuzed enemy, etc.\n\nOutside of typical combat, you will spend time answering questions in class, and with those companions in the real world, deepening your bonds with them either through a heartfelt conversation, or by playing pool/darts, cramming for exams together, fishing, or going to see a movie. If your character is more of a loner, they can also read lots of books, visit the batting cage, fish or play the aforementioned games by themselves, work a job or five, meditate at the temple or pray at the shrine. Almost everything will refine your character in some way, whether it be a social stat increase (knowledge, guts, charm, kindness, proficiency), a bond increase, or a new item, if not a combination of all three. You will have to properly manage time in increments to do what you want; a blind run is best done without thinking about maxing out every stat and confidant, and rather just focusing on what you think your character finds most important, as you simply cannot 100 percent the game on a first run.\n\nThe characters you meet are all good if not great. On the surface, they all slot neatly into archetypes so they never get confusing as they all have a unique personality. but as you dig into their lives you realize that all of them are dealing with realistic problems and will also grow over the course of your relationship. Each \"confidant\" is a satisfying substory to engage with narratively but also, each will give you keep combat abilities. those who don't directly assist you in combat but are still confidants will grant you powerful items to buy or deeper tactical knowledge. As you progress through the female confidants (yes, ANY of them, including the adults), you will eventually be able to start relationship with them, which can lead to some cute moments, some awkward moments, and if you date ALL of them, one really funny moment. Sadly no gay representation though. Comparing this cast to persona 4 is hard as this game generally goes for a much darker tone, so these characters are a lot more focused on their own serious questions about their lives, whereas 4 is much more \"scooby doo\" in it's approach.\n\nGraphically, P5R doesn't top any charts--it'll probably run flawlessly 4k 60 fps on any rig from the last 5 years, but _artistically_ this game is something else. This game does what Into the Spider-Verse did for animated movies for anime-inspired JRPGs. Very striking use of color and moving jagged edges for menu boxes along with powerful animations, popping particle/damage effects, and very simple transitions into 2D frames keep the screen alive with energy, even during the moments of calm dialogue, while also keeping every element, every piece of action entirely readable, which is an absolute feat.\n\nThe music is also fantastic. Shoji Meguro will hopefully soon be known as one gaming's greats alongside Koji Kondo, MIck Gordon, etc. The acid jazz blended with funk is lively when it wants to be, calm when it needs to be, but always iconic and highly memorable earworm tunes. Palaces all have multiple variations of the same melody to shake things up and the songs that play during emotional moments perfectly accentuate these moments. These are the kinda songs that actually might come into your head while living your life. The times when it diverges into orchestral rock feel appropriately dire yet epic. My one major complaint here is that the original intro song, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\" is much better then this one, but its still really good.\n\nIts funny to see how universal the love for this game is, but that cliched IGN saying \"theres a little something for everyone\" ALMOST applies perfectly to this game. You really have to give it about 6 hours before it \"turns you loose\" and really lets you start to do things on your own--its partially hand-holding, but its mostly just because there is a lot in this story to set up, and it really prefers to go slow with it. Once you get going, it should be easy to find something to really love about this game. The reason i come back it over and over is that it sucks you into its vibe so easily.

Con una narrativa cautivadora y una mec\u00e1nica de juego pulida, este t\u00edtulo se alza como una obra maestra que cautiva desde el primer momento.\n\nUno de los aspectos m\u00e1s destacables es su combate \u00e1gil y din\u00e1mico. La fluidez con la que los personajes ejecutan sus habilidades es asombrosa, brindando una experiencia muy entretenida.\n\nLos dise\u00f1os estilizados y vibrantes de los personajes y escenarios, combinados con una direcci\u00f3n art\u00edstica impecable, crean un mundo que parece saltar de las p\u00e1ginas de un manga. Cada rinc\u00f3n de Tokio y sus Palacios es una delicia visual que te sumerge en esta extraordinaria trama.\n\nLa historia es digna de un anime de renombre. Llena de personajes intrigantes y temas profundos, la trama teje una red emocional que te atrapa y no te suelta. A medida que te adentras en los secretos de los Palacios y desvelas los oscuros misterios que rodean a los antagonistas, te encuentras ansioso por descubrir qu\u00e9 suceder\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n.\n\nLos personajes principales son el alma de esta aventura. Cada uno de ellos es un individuo complejo con sus propias luchas, sue\u00f1os y arcos de desarrollo. A medida que pasas m\u00e1s tiempo con Joker, Ryuji, Ann y el resto del grupo, es inevitable no sentir un v\u00ednculo profundo con ellos. Esto tambi\u00e9n se aplica a los personajes secundarios, que est\u00e1n igualmente bien construidos y aportan capas adicionales a la trama.\n\nLas mec\u00e1nicas y minijuegos a\u00f1aden una capa adicional de profundidad y variedad al juego. Desde gestionar tu vida estudiantil hasta explorar los Mementos en busca de tesoros ocultos, cada actividad se siente significativa y enriquecedora. El abanico de opciones disponibles es impresionante, permiti\u00e9ndote personalizar tu experiencia de juego de innumerables maneras.\n\nAunque el extenso calendario y los Palacios prolongados pueden resultar un desaf\u00edo, tambi\u00e9n son testimonio de la riqueza y la inmersi\u00f3n que ofrece el juego. Cada d\u00eda cuenta, y cada Palacio es una prueba de habilidad y paciencia que te recompensa con una sensaci\u00f3n de logro palpable.\n\nEn resumen, Persona 5 Royal no solo redefine el g\u00e9nero RPG, sino que establece un est\u00e1ndar inigualable en la industria del videojuego. Con una historia cautivadora, personajes memorables y mec\u00e1nicas pulidas, es una experiencia que no debes perderte.

I have always struggled to connect with my son as he spends most of his free time playing games online or watching others play on YouTube.

It had been decades since I last played a video game, so I was quite rusty. But my son patiently taught me how to play and we started bonding over this game.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how much fun we had playing together. It was like we were solving a mystery together, laughing and having a great time. Playing video games with my son reminded me of the joy of being a kid and it helped me to connect with my son on a whole new level. We even started spending more time together outside of the game, going on walks and enjoying other activities.\n\nAs a single father, it can be difficult to find common ground with my son, but video games have given us a new way to bond and spend quality time together.

The visuals - beautiful! Striking! Delicious! The soundtrack is delightful and fun (if lacking in variety considering the game's scope)\n\nThe setting is pretty cool. It's a cute version of Tokyo, full of life and activity.\n\nWhat else is unique? Three things.\n\nFirst, the dungeons in this game take place inside villains' heads. You fight within their unconscious. A great idea! But most of the time this consists of fighting pumpkins and endless variations of sexy women with wings. The villains also each represent one of the seven deadly sins. As you can imagine, these different ideas - the unconscious, funny little odd creatures, and bad concepts from medieval Catholicism - don't match up.\n\nSecond, you play up against a turn limit. Each day is divided between day and evening and you can take one main action in each. This could mean that you are tasked with making deliberate choices about which skills and relationships to prioritise. I started playing like this. \n\nBut over time you realise that most of the time you do the activity with the person when they invite you, otherwise you do the skill that has a bonus right now. You can't push relationships forward much outside of this. There's not much to be gained from either optimisation (not needed) or specialisation (you can't. You're pretty much the same regardless of playthrough).\n\nThird, you fight with personas, which are a bit like Pokemon, and can merge them, sacrificing one in the process. The Persona menu is unwieldy, and collecting Personas doesn't work well, because you can only have a limited number at a time. And if you move too quickly through the menu then a character shouts at you, which got annoying.\n\nI got 30 hours in, up to the third dungeon (of 7 I believe) and I was tired of the core of the game. Everything else about it is *fine*. The characters are fine, the story is fine, the gameplay is fine, the dungeons are fine. But you can't spread mediocrity over tens of hours and create an engaging experience. The aesthetics can only take it so far.\n\nThere are clearly lots of people for whom \"RPG of average quality story & gameplay with brilliant presentation spread over 100+ hours\" is appealing. There is a lot of game for your money. If that's your cup of tea you will like this! I feel like if I were younger,  had less alternative choice, and hadn't read the equivalent of generic YA stuff many times this could appeal.

Royal i've finished twice, now.\n\nIt's decent. Far from the best in the franchise and the main game is way too easy. My most recent playthrough only used Arsene, upgrading that with skill cards and strengthening it, but even that wasn't really enough to make it challenging.\n\nThe final fight of royal is especially dissapointing. it's one pretty mediocre fight followed by a cutscene fight that's underwhelming. I recall one shotting the second phase with Lucifer on my first run. I think Baton Pass really ruins the difficulty of the combat in this game, and am not the biggest fan of how buffed it got in Royal. Somehow the Okumura boss remains the most challenging in the main story, because it recognised how to challenge the overpowered Baton Pass system.\n\nEveryone also praises this game for having good dungeons but I'd honestly prefer strange journey warp puzzles to some of the pretty dull shit that this game makes you do. They're passable dungeons for the most part, and incredibly hand-holding in places. They're fine, just not really that interesting.\n\nThe story is alright, but it drags a lot in places. Peaks and valleys, starting off strong and dipping back and forth over and over. Half of the palaces in the game suck narratively, and most of the antagonists are pretty uninteresting. Kamoshida, Futaba, and the third semester are the highlights arcs of the game, whilst everything else is pretty middling to me.\n\nGood game.

Hurts especially when he does get some VA but it is never used that much.\n\n- Story often feels insultingly lacking in subtlety, either spells out twists to the player too easily and/or makes them so obvious the characters look stupid\n\n- Morgana is presented as an annoying, self-important moron throughout the story and when the story ends he is still an annoying, self-important moron. The game expects you to care about this.\n\n- The dubbing feels kind of middling in places (but still good overall). Many of the lines feel way too overacted (especially Ryuji and Ann) to the point where it can be difficult to follow the story seriously.\n\n- Many of the humor comes off as very out of touch and painfully bad, most notably the many involving sexualizing minors. The game seems to expect you to laugh at people lusting for underage girls/boys in several occasions and it comes off as extremely creepy on the writers' part and not funny at all. Aside from that there are of course many nonsexual jokes that don't land such as Morgana makes Ryuji mad for the 900 billionth time (because it was so funny the first time thank you Atlus).\n\n- While a few unique mechanics spice up the battles a fair bit, the game still requires and is cheesable through level grinding which make these moments of engagement rare. Boss fights also largely negate elemental weaknesses and status effects for balance which cut out a fair bit of depth and make them more about being bullet sponges and stockpiling items\n\n- The game wastes a lot of time going through menus and doesn't feel all that streamlined for the amount of repetition it expects out of you\n\n- Items can feel like a chore to sort through, especially when labels are not informative or information on what an item does is completely absent aside from its name (skill cards).\n\n- Elemental weaknesses being trial and error can be helped through some confidants which is okay I guess, although I'm not a fan of weaknesses being forgot after a failed battle against an enemy and coming back to them especially with the sheer amount of different enemies and elemental types.\n\n- Needing to constantly check weaknesses on opponents if you can't keep track gets annoying with Makoto repeating her voice lines over and over again.\n\nGood game tho do play", "timestamp_created": 1698216059, "timestamp_updated": 1698386630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487596601247787476", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148828158": {"recommendationid": "148828158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834506692", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "playtime_at_review": 10808, "last_played": 1700042440}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game i played so far", "timestamp_created": 1698204819, "timestamp_updated": 1698204819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148821741": {"recommendationid": "148821741", "author": {"steamid": "76561199048979654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 435, "playtime_at_review": 7588, "last_played": 1700526282}, "language": "english", "review": "Goro Akechi means everything to me.", "timestamp_created": 1698194726, "timestamp_updated": 1698194726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148819259": {"recommendationid": "148819259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198688795", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 3278, "last_played": 1700177138}, "language": "english", "review": "i think if atlus made a goro akechi dating sim they would make a lot of money", "timestamp_created": 1698190847, "timestamp_updated": 1698190847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148800239": {"recommendationid": "148800239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190800089", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 3512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1699213361}, "language": "english", "review": "The best Persona game.

has it's own theme song and style.\n\nFantastic music, every single piece is catchy.\n\nAnd on top of that - the best turn based combat system I have ever seen in my life.\nCombat is fast, incredibly satisfying to pull off combos, and they actually use the camera!\nThere's almost never more than 5 enemies in any fight, so you never have the fallout 2 issue of waiting for a rat 100 yards away to take it's turn.\n\nThe only possible downside is the story can get convoluted at times, and cycling through 100 items to see if any of them cure the 1 specific ailment you need is kind of bad.\n\nBut still, as someone who grew up on town-down CRPGs (Icewind dale, neverwinter nights, etc), where dialogue just has a portrait of a guy looking at you from 5 feet away, having characters move their face when talking and having different sprites for happy / angry expressions is already more than I've seen anywhere else.\n\nOn top of that - around 150 hours of STORY. There's (Almost) no grinding, just straight up an interesting story and so much of it.\nThis is what I always wished RPGs were like. I just never knew this game existed before.\n\nSo much of this game had me yelling 'why isn't every game doing this?' .\n", "timestamp_created": 1697796379, "timestamp_updated": 1697796379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148528809": {"recommendationid": "148528809", "author": {"steamid": "76561199010436542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10055, "last_played": 1696812037}, "language": "english", "review": "ryuji best girl", "timestamp_created": 1697790241, "timestamp_updated": 1697790241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148527553": {"recommendationid": "148527553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198439166099", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 32927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32927, "last_played": 1686391684}, "language": "english", "review": "Gud", "timestamp_created": 1697787467, "timestamp_updated": 1697787467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148526823": {"recommendationid": "148526823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312874239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1196, "last_played": 1697863430}, "language": "english", "review": "Good\n", "timestamp_created": 1697785935, "timestamp_updated": 1697785935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148523542": {"recommendationid": "148523542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055092733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 4754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4754, "last_played": 1697769987}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just 200k+ words of a Japanese virgin high-schooler's dreamscape harem fanfic narrative but you have to grind HOURS against randomized enemies (designed by horny rule34 artists) just to flip to the next page, which is just a recap of the last page with a few new words, oh and every \"chapter\" revolves around sexualizing or otherwise taking advantage of a minor", "timestamp_created": 1697778350, "timestamp_updated": 1697814717, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450254529714584351", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148520248": {"recommendationid": "148520248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149365502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_at_review": 11317, "last_played": 1700764070}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly one of the best games you'll ever play.

problems and insecurities they feel real and relatable (anime tropes aside)\n\nThe Good\n\nThe gameplay for a turnbased JRPG is probably one of the best I have played it has many different mechanics imbued into the traditional turn based combat, you keep learning new mechanics througout the game until the end be it via main quest progression or confident progression by befriending them and doing stuff togheter. \n\nThe Social sim part of the game is also pretty good although it's not exactly the focus of the game you can take part of many activities during your day be it along or with confidants. \n\nThe Bad\n\nWell I don't think the game has any glaring issue, the only thing I did not like was the AA the game has, no matter what you do you get visible jaggies and shimmering on

average the story is, how cringeworthy most of the main characters are, how forgettable and generic the villains are (except for Kamoshida and [spoiler]Maruki[/spoiler]), and most importantly just how boring at times the dungeon crawling can be due to how extremely easy the game is even on the highest difficulty.\n\nYet despite its flaws, Persona 5 Royal is still one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. While the Phantom Thieves could have been written much better, this game has some of the most interesting side characters in the franchise imo. Characters like Iwai, Sojiro, Kawakami, and Maruki honestly carry the game. The soundtrack slaps, the UI and art style is beautiful, voice acting is perfect, and the gameplay is objectively the best in the franchise. Palaces are a massive improvement over P4 dungeons, and there are way more side activities you can do than in any other Persona game. \n\nNot only is this my favourite Persona game, it is my favourite game of all time. Even though it's flawed, I'm sure you'll still have a very good time with it on your first playthrough. If you would want to replay it numerous times, I recommend you do so with mods, at least the ones that completely rework the difficulty. Either way, if you're at least a tiny bit interested in P5R, then go for it and buy the game now. I 100% recommend it and honestly, most of the problems this game has are only really noticeable if you are mentally deranged just like me and put over 1K hours into this damn singleplayer game

"review": "Fool Labellin drifts through sensuous alleyways in search of his pen. The detached fugitive simply wishes to partake in the local merriment, indulging in bathhouse steam and medicinal stupor. And yet, few temporal seams are unimpeded by babble and burden. Behind his faint muttering and blank peering is a masked rage. The prattling of Mango, Ramen Sadsack, Itchy Ozone, Hamhair Okra, Yucky Mushroom, Chihuahua Muff, and Yugyug - most dreadfully Yugyug - corrode his sanity.\n\nTwin rapscallions berate him as he absorbs remnants of executed obscenities. A tyrant in a pink thong hurtles spheres at him. Denizens morph into machines in a mendacious fantasy. Zealots attempt to transform existence via a network of violence, tunneling terror under the metropolis. There are two of him, and perhaps the other is more laudable. The ink as he writes this bleeds slightly with each stroke. But the lecher hides him, the recluse inspires, the gecko arms, the conjurer doses, and the schism seduces.\n\nWhere have they been? He's been searching all along, lacing the moonlight without any glue. The real question is where has he been? He's a shoeshiner, at the last parade, binding both space and time. What else should he be? In moments of aplomb, there's nothing left to be found. Except next to a mirror, he finds an empty glass, reflecting a sad truth - he's just a cage of bones. Don't celebrate the demise.\n\nHowever, there is escape in a cozy attic. In bed, his head rests upon his hands as he's stargazing at the blemishes of the wooden rafters and plastered ceiling.

There is so much content for me to cover, and I don\u2019t think this review will do this game justice on how much there is available.\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]A fantastic story that will teach you the meaning of freedom\n[*]Great characters that have impressive development and personality\n[*]Fun turn-based combat with many unique abilities\n[*]Lots of stuff to do in the overworld\n[*]Awesome soundtrack that is just nice to listen to\n[*]Beautiful graphics and unique style to the visuals\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The dialog is a bit weird during the cutscenes\n[*]Getting the best ending in the game is a bit cumbersome\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story starts out with [b]Ren Amamiya[/b] (you can change his name) who was falsely accused of assault one night when trying to defend a woman. He is then labeled a criminal and is now on probation as well as sent to [b]Sujin Academy[/b] where he will continue his second year of High School. He moves into the attic at [b]Cafe Leblanc[/b] thanks to the help of [b]Sojiro Sakura[/b] who is taking care of him for his probation period. He also gets his first new friend at his new high school who goes by the name of [b]Ryuji Sakamoto[/b].\n\nThat is all I will go into for the story of P5R, there is a lot for me to talk about and it would take at least half of this review to even talk about the beginning portion of the game. The story is just outright fantastic, and the characters shined greatly. They made the story just outright fun, with my three favorites being Ryuji Sakamoto, Yusuke Kitagawa, and Goro Akechi. I liked their personalities and how they all go along. There are other characters I liked as well but those three shined to me the most. I could make an entire review on the characters alone for the game, as there is just so much to talk about with them and the story.\n\nThe only issue I had with the story is how some of the dialog is presented in the game. This mainly stems from the English dub. There are times when characters will say \"this means in English\" while speaking English; I know they are in Japan but it just sounds awkward. I don\u2019t mind if the dialog is changed in English dubs a tad bit and this is coming from someone who does prefer their subs over dubs. I was just too used to playing the Persona games in English when I started with P4G. This is, of course, my opinion only and you can play the game in whatever language you prefer.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay for [b]P5R[/b] is probably one of the hardest things for me to explain in this review as there is so much to talk about. However, I will go over combat first as that is the main gameplay feature of the game. In combat, you and your party members will have a certain [b]Persona[/b] with their own abilities, as well as a weakness to another ability. This also applies to the enemies that you will encounter as well. If you, a party member, enemy, or boss exploit a weakness, they will get an extra turn to do whatever they want. \n\nHowever, new to [b]P5[/b] (as this feature was in the original version) is the [b]Baton Pass[/b] feature, which allows a party member who exploited a weakness to allow a different party member to attack. This can be useful in some battles if different enemies have different weaknesses, so if one enemy is weak to ice and the other to wind and you have two party members or if [b]Joker[/b] (who is [b]Ren Amamiya[/b]} has a [b]Persona[/b] who can cover those weaknesses and already had his turn. The [b]Baton Pass[/b] mechanic is a handy feature that I recommend you take advantage of. You can also get some extra benefits from [b]Baton Passing[/b] as well, like restoring some HP, SP, and doing extra damage. However, you do need to hang out with your party members to get these benefits.\n\nDuring combat, [b]Joker\u2019s Personas[/b] will stop learning moves, what you can do then is go to Igor, who will then fuse your unwanted [b]Personas[/b] into new and more powerful ones. You can get new [b]Personas[/b] after battle but the method of getting them is different. [b]Shuffle Time[/b] has been removed and now you need to try and talk your way to understand the enemy and if both of your responses go along with what the enemy is feeling, you get a new [b]Persona[/b].\n\nIf you knock all the enemies down in combat, then you can do these [b]All-Out Attacks[/b]. These attacks will damage all enemies while doing physical damage, this will bypass physical immunity or resistance if the enemy has it. \n\nHowever, there is lots of stuff for you to do outside of combat, you can spend time together with your party members or other friends. This will increase your [b]social links[/b], which can be used for helping give the [b]Personas[/b] you fuse extra levels and experience, which will make them stronger than usual and they may learn a few extra useful moves as well. Your party members will also learn new abilities in combat that will help you out in certain situations, so I highly recommend you go out and hang out with everyone as much as you can.\n\nYou will also get requests to help other people out in [b]Mementos[/b], this is another area of the game that you can use to farm your [b]Personas[/b] and party members. I also recommend doing these as you can get some nice rewards when exploring the place which can be very useful in combat. Your party members will also have some conversations sometimes with each other that add to their character altogether.\n\nAlthough, I do have one issue with the game and that is the method of getting the true ending of the game, which is entirely unique to [b]P5R[/b]. To get this ending, you need to max out three social links in the game and to add to this [b]Goro Akechi\u2019s[/b] social does not progress in the story like in the original [b]P5[/b], you must hang out with him. All of these have a time limit, but the game gives you more than enough time to get all three of them maxed out, so there is that. It\u2019s still cumbersome to do though, as you can\u2019t really miss a day to hang out with at least two of them. One of the [b]social links[/b] you can max out with no issue as it\u2019s small and that character is also unique to [b]P5R[/b] but the other two you must hang out with when they call you. This is not a big issue but something that still annoyed me, nonetheless.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe soundtrack for [b]P5R[/b] is honestly one of the best things of the game, every song I listened to was just fantastic and I loved them all. My favorites have to be [b]Life Will Change, Rivers In The Desert, Take Over, Last Surprise[/b], and [b]Ark[/b]. As you can tell, that is a long list of my favorite songs in the game, they are all honesty great.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]\n[b]P5R[/b] is a beautiful game both in its 2D and 3D art style, I loved looking at all of the games areas it has to offer. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50 and 16 GB of RAM. I experienced no issues while playing which ran at a smooth 60 FPS.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3051310040\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nIf you are looking for a great turn-based [b]JRPG[/b] with a lot of depth and obvious care from the developer, then I highly recommend [b]P5R[/b]. There is a lot to do in the title and this review does not do the game justice, at best, I have only talked about at least 10% of the game itself and it\u2019s only because I can only fit so much into a review without risk of spoiling the story. If you want to uncover what this game has to offer, the only thing I recommend is to play the game yourself.\n\n[quote]Unexpected situations are necessary at

Though I also feel as if the localisers did their usual butchery (Futaba saying \"KEK!\" and various slang put here and there that just does not match the tone or vibes, IE the Phantom Website comments that sound like something a CEO would say while drunkenly mimicking what \"A little zoomer\" would say on the 'net).\n\u2014 Goro.\n\u2014 Morgana.\n\u2014Okumura's Palace is still a slog to play, and, impressively enough, Fatlus made the boss fight substantially worse than in Vanilla (playtesters too expensive, small family company, plz understand; oh, and buy the $200 Persona 3: Reloaded Special Edition plz :)).\n\u2014 Denuovo.\n\u2014 Can't fast-forward through All-out Attack animations because lol (you're going to be seeing the animation probably a thousand times by the end of the game, as it's a long, long game with quite a bit of padding).\n\u2014 Kasumi, the new character added in Royal, is literally just a poochie. When she's not on screen, and before she has a scene, the characters talk about \"Woah, did you hear about that athletic honor student? She's so cute, think I have a shot with her?\" and \"She's so great!\" When she does interact with your character, she's always kissing up to you for literally no reason (she's a very popular student, so shouldn't she be less willing to just be BEST FRIENDS with someone she just met? Much less one with the MC's current reputation upon meeting?).\n\u2014 Morgana.\n\nLike, if this is your first JRPG ever, or if you don't play games besides the top 10 on Twitch, then it's pretty great. But if you've played other SMT games, read VNs or novels with proper characterization, or just even browsed Pixiv for pics of cute girls, then there really isn't much here beyond the surface-level flash and style that this game offers, which, admittedly, it does have in spades. Wish I could be more positive about this, as it HAS potential, and it leaves me hungry for a more finished product, but playtesting and hiring a professional storyboard team is too expensive for poor old Fatlus (this game is seven years old and still being sold at full price).", "timestamp_created": 1697350055, "timestamp_updated": 1697350055, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.411254584789276123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148256409": {"recommendationid": "148256409", "author": {"steamid": "76561199187928294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 939, "playtime_at_review": 819, "last_played": 1700785894}, "language": "english", "review": "a very good jrpg\n", "timestamp_created": 1697348423, "timestamp_updated": 1697348423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148255648": {"recommendationid": "148255648", "author": {"steamid": "76561199291681162", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 15086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15086, "last_played": 1697130372}, "language": "english", "review": "P5 Royal has best overall gameplay and mechanic in all Persona games.

Planning out my schedule weeks in advanced was not something I expected to enjoy so much. Also, I loved the hang out scenes, getting to know more about the other characters was great, plus without them I wouldn't get to see my favorites at all, Oda and Yoshida. I also love Sojiro and Kawakami. Honestly, all my favorite characters aren't part of the Phantom Thieves, although I do love Joker.

Known to be arguably one of the greatest RPGs of all time, and that isn't exaggerated at all. My first playthrough, on Merciless difficulty (Highest of the 5 options) took 120 hours, and that alone makes a 60$ game worth the price. The best part is, in those 120 hours there is constant content and pretty much nothing repetitive. There is, in fact, so much to do that I found myself struggling to decide on what I would spend my days doing, and even with all those options, I later found out I had missed a TON of stuff, and I there were some confidants (people you can befriend, essentially) I never even talked to! I DEFINITELY recommend this game, it's visually amazing, the soundtrack is perfect, the gameplay is superb, the story is awesome, and the characters tie it all together in one excellent game. Get this game. Now. Stop reading my review and just play it.\n\n---{ Graphics }---\nWhile everything is a bit outdated and everything is sorta low poly/low res, something about the game is just beautiful. Maybe it's the retro-ish feel to it, maybe it's the talented people creating it, maybe it's that one Persona. Yeah, you know the one I'm talking about. No matter what it is, despite the PS3 graphics, it still looks amazing and definitely blows pretty much any other anime style game out of the water.\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\nThe first thing that had me hooked when I started playing, aside from the opening scene of Joker in the Casino, and the scene where Kasumi is doing that weird dance fight thing, and... okay, maybe not the first thing, but ONE of the first things that had me hooked was when I was able to use guns. When I found out I could just shoot the crap out of anything with the push of a button, I just instantly got this rush of dopamine. It's just little things like that that make this game a joy to play. Yes, it is turn based, but something about the way that they do it makes it surprisingly immersive and fun. The soundtrack and sound design definitely help too. I normally get a bit bored in most turn based RPGs, just because of how boring most of them are. But this game definitely did it right. Outside of fighting, the system of just living your life is amazing. There is so much to do, and I know for a fact, despite me 130+ hour playtime, I've missed a ton of stuff. \n\nThe best thing I can say to sell you on the gameplay is that within an hour of me finishing my first playthrough I started another so I could find some of the stuff I missed in my first time.\n\n---{ Audio }---\nPerfect. Best soundtrack ever. Need I say more? I guess so. The music is amazing, I don't think there is a single song I don't like on it (Though the one for the widely agreed upon worst Palace, which I won't name for spoilers, brings back bad memories, iykyk). I've tried both English and Japanese VOs and both are great. The only problem with the English version is their weird pronounciations of Japanese words. I heard that this was because of the voice director for the English version, which is definitely believable, the cast is filled with great talent and I know that they could've done it right. And I don't mean they pronounce it weird like saying words with an American accent (Like leaving the stressed R sound in, rather than the more subtle, almost silent version used in Japanese), I mean that they just plain pronounce words wrong. It's hard to describe in text form, and you probably wouldn't notice it if you didn't know much about Japanese, but it's just a bit odd at times.\n\n---{ Can you run it? }---\nThe game does require surprisingly powerful hardware, despite it's age. I originally played on a much worse laptop which I used for gaming that had VERY outdated hardware (It had an i7-6600u for it's CPU and an R7 360 GPU, alongside a mechanical hard drive and only 8gbs of RAM). I could run it, but it struggled to hold 30 FPS on bare minimum graphics, 50% resolution scale, and playing on 720p. Now that I have a PC that actually works, I can run 4k resolution and max graphics with a solid 60 FPS.\n\n\n(My Specs: \nGPU: Quadro RTX 4000\nCPU: I7-9750H\nRAM: 64GBs)\n\n---{ Will I rage quit? }---\nI played on the hardest difficulty and it was never too difficult. Sometimes I would need to plan a fight out a bit more than usual, but it's nothing a little brain power couldn't handle.\n\n---{ Must I grind? }---\nA little bit. There is a grind to pretty much everything, but they disguise the grind with fun gameplay and all sorts of things to keep you entertained. In my opinion, it's a grind, but it's a really fun one.\n\n---{ Will the story replace my life? }---\nYes. I won't say more on account of spoilers, but yes. Yes it will.\n\n---{ Is it worth the price? }---\nAbsolutely. You are getting hundreds of hours of content for only 60$, I've definitely spent more on stupider things. I used to play Fortnite after all.\n\n---{ How buggy is it?}---\nI have literally never seen a bug.\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10\n\u2611 11\n", "timestamp_created": 1696891668, "timestamp_updated": 1697069740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147946845": {"recommendationid": "147946845", "author": {"steamid": "76561199470796757", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6935, "last_played": 1697741539}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the most beautiful, wonderful and amazing game that exists. \nIt got me emotional to end this.\nIt's a masterpiece.

It also helps a great deal that ATLUS went all out on this and packed every nook and cranny of this game with amazing content. The dungeons are brilliant, the monster-collecting makes other monster tamer games blush with envy and the base mechanics of P5 are brilliant and assure that fights are quick and snappy. Couple this with a killer soundtrack, a stunning visual direction and (thankfully) every DLC they ever released in form of outfits/personas and what you get here is easily worth way more than the initial asking price.\n\nOnly downside: You need A LOT of free time to even attempt this game.\nI'm also glad to report that the game runs smooth as butter on PC (which is sadly not the norm anymore).\n\n10/10 - a really rare gem of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1696772905, "timestamp_updated": 1697304250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147864615": {"recommendationid": "147864615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293301538", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 7292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7292, "last_played": 1696769606}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es como tener amigos pero no existen, muy guapo muchas gracias", "timestamp_created": 1696769640, "timestamp_updated": 1696769640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147862531": {"recommendationid": "147862531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363592890", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4767, "last_played": 1696727025}, "language": "english", "review": "I LIKE IT", "timestamp_created": 1696767097, "timestamp_updated": 1696767097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147860005": {"recommendationid": "147860005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386863071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 844, "last_played": 1697713569}, "language": "english", "review": "can't stop playing after 1 hours in", "timestamp_created": 1696763855, "timestamp_updated": 1696763855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147858548": {"recommendationid": "147858548", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026060592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 431, "playtime_at_review": 932, "last_played": 1700652745}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good", "timestamp_created": 1696761940, "timestamp_updated": 1696761940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147850014": {"recommendationid": "147850014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087950263", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6366, "last_played": 1696742945}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the top 10 games ive ever played.

[b]Yes,[/b] especially if you find it on sale during a Sega or Atlus promotion. It's well worth the time investment if you're a fan of SMT games or turn-based RPGs. That being said... Do I think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread? Absolutely not. It's good, but caught on it's own leash. There will be spoilers, but they'll be marked.\n\n[h2]The Good Bits[/h2]\n\nThe game starts off at a pretty high note all things considered. It's a LOT faster to get into the gameplay than Persona 4 did, thank goodness. There's a number of improvements to the core gameplay that helps bridge elements from across the series together. I absolutely LOVE that the classic SMT demons are the Shadows now, just like they used to be back in Persona 1/2 and SMT if. It helps significantly to aid in memory and recognition rather than just color-swapped masked blobs and objects from 3/4, which I thought was a pretty significant downside to those games. The fact that you actually have to negotiate with the Shadows to recruit them like they are really demons, plus the commentary by them in battle, and the fact that they are no longer purely random in said negotiations are huge benefits to help bridge the gap between series. The Baton Pass mechanic further incentivizes identifying weaknesses by offering additional moves and decisions. Do you pass the baton to someone else, or double-dip for setup? The UI presentation is also very much improved upon and gives the game a unique style. A number of smaller quality-of-life improvements such as being able to save the game nearly anywhere in the real world and plenty of Safe Rooms helps you be able to pick up and play if you only want to burn a little bit of time for preparations, and is far better than having to go chase a bloody blue butterfly every day. The palaces offer actual constructed dungeons in a Persona game again rather than simply procedural-generated grids in voids, but Mementos does carry that side... \n\n[h2]The Bad Bits[/h2]\n\nPersona 5 Royal seems to hate the idea of letting the player off the leash entirely. Significant chunks of the game will basically have you railroaded by plot devices or a certain unlikable cat and deny you the opportunity to pursue Social Links or dungeon exploration. The Battle UI actually doesn't go far enough with showing who goes next unless you press on the D-Pad, and we're still in that weird Persona slant where buffs and debuffs are three-turn and single-target only unless you got 'Ma' versions. There's two new elements in Nuke and Psychic, but in practice, there's nothing interesting with them beyond just needing a unique element to tie to party members. This wouldn't bother me except that they already split Light and Dark into both offense/instakill at the same time so Nuke/Psychic just feel like pure filler as a result. In terms of balance, the game likes to 'try' to be difficult (especially if you play on Hard, did two playthroughs on Normal/Hard to compare) but also keeps fudging it's rolls for the player. Showtime moves, your Support interjecting, multiple fully-automatic Social Links and the Royal content all seem to act more like a helicopter parent yanking you away from scraping your knee up and learning your lesson through a bit of trial and error. It doesn't help that while you can ignore the Showtime button, a bunch of other things are basically automatically triggered without your inputs. Oh, and speaking of the Royal content....\n\n[h2]The Royal Mess[/h2]\n\nThis is where we get kind of finnicky, and this entire section is probably going to be marked with spoilers to the point of impersonating some top-secret documents through this stint.\n\n[spoiler]I really do not like the Royal content additions much at all. Let's start with the super intrusive type, and that's literally how intrusive and off-fitting the Royal additions feel. The characters of Royal, along with their scenarios, certainly feel very 'Atlus expansion re-release' in execution. What do I mean by that? I mean having the new stuff jutting out or shoved in haphazardly with lots of neon arrow signs pointing at them. Kasumi in particular gets it BAD with how she's not only shoved into the the intro scenario for little reason or impact but the game pretends it's a big moment, but also the character in general. Way too peppy and cheery, only to have that script flipped only in the tail end, but with no hints of that darker depths at all. I mean, come on, she got a bloody magical girl transformation. The Final Palace actually does have my interest as one of my favorites due to the unique puzzles, such as having to do a personality quiz from the mentality of your adversary rather than yourself. But at the same time, it feels wonky, especially in balance. Hell, ask anyone who completed the game and they'd probably tell you the finale was more cutscene than boss. There's also some seriously overtuned Personas introduced (why you can get them for free in the Compendium?) and all of the bonus costumes are also tied to a huge item bundle that screws up the start of the game. 100k yen plus like 20 Homunculus? And on that subject of costumes, while it is nice that you can dress up in the style of your favorite Persona/SMT games for the most part with different BGMs from said games... You cannot play said battle BGMs unless you are wearing that specific outfit on your protagonist. Really? There couldn't be an option to shuffle or set them independently?[/spoiler]\n\nIn conclusion, it's well worth it if you find this game on sale, and perhaps even at full price if you're a real sucker for RPGs or the Atlus brand. But just be aware that this game is not the pure and perfect game that people often rave it is. It's got some problems that set me off in particular, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.", "timestamp_created": 1696739336, "timestamp_updated": 1696739336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147840411": {"recommendationid": "147840411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138452592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4942, "last_played": 1698118657}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite game during the pandemic on PlayStation and still a great game.

A playable anime. A benchmark for JRPGs and turn-based games. A 100+ hours journey into changing the hearts of the wicked and yourselves. \n\nTakes place over a bit more than a full school year, and lets you mostly decide what you do with your free time. Will you bond with a certain character, work a part-time job, fulfill people's requests, improve your social stats... It may seem repetitive at first and I can say that it is after a long time playing, but the game makes sure to relieve you of it with story beats and events. It also lets you move forward quite fast if you so desire. I fancy that the game lets you choose and asks you to put time into planning what you want to do, who you want to focus on... This is the best school-anime out there. \n\nThe story and the characters are one in the same, and the central pillar of the game. The characters are all so charismatic and unique. You grow very attached to them over such a long exposure time. The game has such fantastic vibes to it. The UI and its transitions are splendid (it's cool to navigate the menus and the in-game UI is amazing too), the game is full of colour and personality. This eccentric personality is present in everything you see and do, from the story to the characters to the gameplay to the UI to the music... \n\nSpecial mention to the music too, deserves an award. Jazz-voiced tracks make the game feel so much better and are truly key in creating unforgettable moments. I can't stop listening to the OST. It's unreal how good the music and SFX are.  \n\nGameplay-wise, I love the staging. 4 characters with their personas, with proper animations, camera angles and voiceover to accompany their actions. Hell, just hearing Ryuji shout \"PERSONAAAAA\" during one of the main boss fights with amazing background music is already a treat to my senses. The weakness, technical, ailments and stats system is broad but simple to understand. I love the inclusion of many support skills and specially the baton pass, it's such a great mechanic and hypes you up. The showtimes are such a nice treat too, I loved Ann/Morgana, Ryuji/Yusuke and Joker/Akechi showtimes. There are also a bunch of chance-based events that help break monotony. \n\nThe idea of Joker having multiple personas and being able to fuse them to obtain more powerful ones with shared abilities is super cool. I really enjoyed gathering personas to see what I could obtain. Having multiple personas allows you to plan your deck and make sure you have abilities for all situations. Feels like Pokemon in that regard.\n\nThe story is super interesting and mysterious. The moment of truth is so good it reminds me of Detective Conan's \"The Clash of Red and Black\" arc. It was most likely the best and most intricate arc in the whole series. The sheer amount of details was mind-blowing, and the same can be said for this game.   From that point forward, it is a non-stop rollercoaster. Full of memorable moments and charged with emotions.\n\nIt was sad to let go and say goodbye to the characters. The game is super long (100 hours) and this is both a liability and a strength. It amplifies emotions and exposure which helps bonding with the world/story/characters but at the same time it took me a month to play. Could it be trimmed somehow? Would it lose part of its charm?

(OJO estoy hablando de la red dentro del juego que te permite unas ayudas en lo que vas jugando, no hablo de mi red wifi)\n\nOtra cosa que no me gusto es el doblaje espa\u00f1ol espa\u00f1a, si bien el doblaje de espa\u00f1a no es ningun problema en otros juegos pues este si me molestaba a veces ya que aveces en una conversacion todas las lineas de dialogos eran como: Joder tio que flipada chaval que os den por ostias madre mia que vosotros os calleis. Y asi osea no esta mal pero minimo traten de neutralizar el idioma espa\u00f1ol para todos y no solo que lo hable un espa\u00f1ol, yo creo que ni en espa\u00f1a no hablan tanto asi como lo hablan aca, He jugado DEMASIADOS juegos en espa\u00f1ol espa\u00f1a pero en este si exageraron un monton. Si no entiendes muy bien las jergas espa\u00f1olas te recomiendo mejor jugarlo en ingles.\n\nTambien algo que me molestaba un buen y me hacia reiniciar el juego y aveces perder el progreso esque en la tiendas de armas nose porque pero al modificar una arma aveces ojo digo aveces porque no siempre pasaba pero casi si, el juego se congelaba NO digo que se crashee si no que el juego sigue ejecutandose y moviendose pero no podia hacer ninguna interaccion mas que ver como el juego seguia corriendo, Creo que esto tiene que ver con el modo a pantalla completa pero deberian arreglarlo.\n\nPuntos positivos:\n\nUna historia unica que a pesar de unos juegos rpgs aca todo es totalmente impredencible de lo que vaya a ocurrir en la historia.\n\nMe encanto los personajes de esta entrega al igual que el persona 4 y este en mi opinion tienen a los mejores personajes de la saga persona.\n\nLa guarida de los ladrones me parece una excelente forma de pasar el tiempo en ella si en algun momento te aburres (aunque no creo que alguien se llegue a aburrir con este juego)\n\nMEJORARON EL SISTEMA DE DUNGEONS, si bien en entregas posteriores eran pasillos totalmente iguales y solo avanzar, aca mementos y los palacios son de lo mejor para explorar contando con cada nivel de mazmorra unico y diferente y no tener que repetir lo mismo una y otra vez por el resto del juego, en verdad se le agradece esto. En persona 3 y 4 me daba mucha pajar entrar a los calabozos sabiendo que voy a repetir lo mismo una y otra vez, aqui es totalmtente contrario\n\nLA MUSICA OH POR DIOS, Muchos conocen a este juego por su excelente musica y no lo puedo negar que soundtracks tan hermosos, para cada momento este juego te brinda una cancion unica y muy buena, tiene la cancion perfecta para cada momento, recomiendo mucho buscar una playlist completa en alguna plataforma de musica para apreciarla.\n\nHay mucho mas puntos positivos para este juegazo pero seria un sin fin de palabras.\n\n\nEn verdad recomiendo este juego para los expertos en este tipo de juegos y los que no saben de este genero.\nEsta opinion la digo de la forma mas neutral y con cero fanatismo.\n\nPor ultimo solo digo que makoto besto waifu.", "timestamp_created": 1696633175, "timestamp_updated": 1696633175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147765259": {"recommendationid": "147765259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282912962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8742, "last_played": 1697221819}, "language": "english", "review": "Persona 5 does NOT cure autism.", "timestamp_created": 1696629006, "timestamp_updated": 1696649945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147762814": {"recommendationid": "147762814", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976488644", "num_games_owned": 489, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 17546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 297, "playtime_at_review": 14525, "last_played": 1699657395}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El Mejor J-RPG hasta la fecha objetivamente.

That being said the story isn't the greatest and is kinda bear bones in depth of characters if you don't do the optional character confidants. The confidants though in my opinion are some of the worst parts of the game, first off one of them is genuinely atrocious while some are bland or just too far into the story to actually get the character fleshed out. Second off they take up so much of your play time if you try to do them all it genuinely feels like a hassle or an inconvenience if their reward isn't good enough; not to mention some of them are just weird. Those are some of my only complaints for the game, the art style is extremely pleasing to the eyes and I could stare at it for hours. The gameplay is so good it's almost worth waiting so many hours at a time to play the game again. That is my biggest complaint for the game is that in-between actually rpg gameplay P5 likes to take it's sweet fucking time. I have probably spent up to 10 or more hours not actually playing the rpg part of the rpg that i spent $60 for, if that sounds that something that you wouldn't like in a game then you should not get this game, if you don't think you would mind it then go ahead and buy it. I genuinely believe if you can get through those slogs then you could find an amazing rpg that will hopefully go into one of your favorites. I don't really feel like mentioning the music, some of the tracks are not good at all but most of are absolute jams that I would listen to any day of the week, even if you don't think you'd like the game just listen to the soundtrack, you won' be disappointed.

The Music and Art-Style are super unique and are the reason it stands out in a sea of generic JRPG\u00b4s.

It has not disappoint. The story is rich, and the characters are well written. The banter between the characters, and the interactions you have with them are top notch imo. I would recommend this game to RPG fans, or even anyone who is interested in getting into Persona series the first time.\n\nUpdate 1: I've finally finished the True Ending. SPOILER BELOW, don't read if you don't want to spoil yourself. \n\n[spoiler] Man it was a ride, fighting Maruki was tough (at least for me), but it was satisfying. The message that our team carried and conveyed, especially to Maruki, moved me a lot. Maruki definitely had good intentions, or rather misguided(?) intentions on wanting to remove pain from everyone so that everyone becomes happy. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Ultimately, this only still hides from the problem and avoids reality all together. The message that our crew conveyed when fighting Maruki was the one that really resonated  \n with me the most; out of all the boss fights. All the previous boss fights were, in some manner ,fighting against the injustice that adults that committed. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] But Maruki instead wants to alter reality to remove pain, which definitely is different from all other villains that we've faced before him. His intentions are good, but the methods are dubious at best, convoluted at worst. Our protagonists reject the reality that Maruki wants to impose on everyone, and ultimately, we overcame him in the end. The message that was conveyed in throughout the True Ending portion, was, TLDR: In the face of hardship, you still move forward. You don't shy away from the pain, you face it. Of course, you don't have to do this alone, there are others who will help and overcome it together with you.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, an excellent game.

los conocieses realmente, muy carism\u00e1ticos todos con sus puntos buenos, son gente normal, ni h\u00e9roes, ni elegidos, que han obtenido una facultad, la cual, han aprovechado para evolucionar y superar sus problemas.\n\nLa animaci\u00f3n de MAPPA cuando toca es brutal, como siempre no defrauda.\n\nPor \u00faltimo decir que el sistema de Personas es el mejor juego de pok\u00e9mon que existe, que Akechi es un personaje brutal y que el final es perfecto, Maruki es otro personaje incre\u00edble y alrededor de todo el juego tratan temas muy adultos, complejos y reflexivos, todo lleno de

choosing a main for smash bros. An edgy guy with a cat and spirit demon seemed like the obvious choice, but to really get to know the character i deiced to get the games. I started on p5 vanilla and loved it. The characters and dynamic of the whole thing were so brilliantly layed out that when they announced strikers i couldn't wait to get it on my ps4. it was free too :) Anyway, a few years later i got back into persona do to my friend making jokes about how he likes sae. I replayed vanilla and strikers and once again loved them both. The second runs of these were even better then the first in my opinion. Getting to know the characters again and and exploring new ones was fantastic. Plus. i cut down on my times quite a bit. I then got p5 royal when i got my ps5 and somehow, i don't know how, atlus continues to blow me away with these games. I completed it and here i am now, crying at the credits of a video game. I've got strikers installing as i speak so i cant wait to play that on pc too. Thank you atlus for creating these games. The have changed me so much as a person. They truly have stole my heart.

However, after revisiting the series with Persona 5 Strikers in 2021 and this year with Persona 5 Royal... I cannot say how much a anime-style JRPG has changed my life. Sounds stupid, but this very series of games made me hold on to my real life friends even more. I couldn't wait to play this game, especially because I was busy with final exams when it released. But now I coudl play it freely.\n\nGame-wise, I loved every single second of it. Even though it's the third time I did the story (P5 normal playthrough and NG+, alongside this one), I am not bored. Insane. The story is truly immersive, long, perfectly-paced and just overall a treat. The characters just seem so real to me, it truly felt I made some amazing friends, which made our departure in the end the more painful, but you know, don't be sad because it ended, be happy because it happened. P5R adds some spice to the bosses and combat, disabling the Reaper Flu Season glitch from the original, adding Jose in the Mementos for more rewarding grinding and also the third semester, the last chance to finish up some remaining confidants, as it's customary for remastered versions of Persona games.\n\nI adore this game.\nOh and also Futaba Sakura is THE best girl, she's literally me.", "timestamp_created": 1695670897, "timestamp_updated": 1695670897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147019665": {"recommendationid": "147019665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319868265", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4647, "last_played": 1698520006}, "language": "english", "review": "VERYYY VERYYYYYYYYY RECOMMENDED EVEN IF NEED TO NEW GAME+", "timestamp_created": 1695669753, "timestamp_updated": 1695669753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147016475": {"recommendationid": "147016475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055984851", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5352, "last_played": 1695949136}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing game!

Like the majority of other Persona games, Persona 5 Royal is an insanely great game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I cannot say much due to it being a story based game, so I'll just get right to the ratings:\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10 - The gameplay feels very engaging and fun, especially when you start learning some fun combos, and figure out the best ways to get yourself \"1 more\" over and over. The combat is fun, and the non-combat systems are also pretty nice.\nStory: 9.5/10 - I am not saying anything aside from that I absolutely love this story.\nVisuals: 9.5/10 - The visual style of Persona 5 Royal is amazing, style oozes from every corner, whether that be in the animations, the text boxes, or even just the current date, it has a very fluid style that is extremely pleasant to look at.\nMusic/Sound: 9.5/10 - Again, another aspect Persona 5 Royal nails, the music is amazing as usual for this franchise, very energetic and fun soundtrack mixed with more somber tracks when needed. The sound design is also really good as well, everything is clear, and everything just works! Both the English and Japanese voices also are pretty nice, the Japanese voices are more consistent in being very good quality, but I have a soft spot for the English voices, which are still pretty good.\nReplayability: 6/10 - Now this is potentially Persona 5 Royal's big issue, and is an issue with Persona in general which can't really be avoided, it's a story focused game that doesn't end up offering the kind of big changes you would find in different routes in games that are more VN focused. You can have fun replaying the game, due to the existence of New Game Plus, as well as being able to set yourself challenges, you can focus on building the best team possible, all that sorta stuff, however, this game is really damn long, replaying it is likely not something a decent amount of players would want to do, but that's completely fine when you consider that replayability is not the point.\nOverall: 9.5/10 - I still believe Persona 5 Royal is one of the best games to be released in general, and is definently my favourite game of all time as of writing, it executes everything it's aiming for really well, and is a blast to play.", "timestamp_created": 1695650188, "timestamp_updated": 1695650188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

I've played a good handful of jrpgs: Earthbound, Xenoblade Chronicles, Pokemon (if you can count that), Dragon Quest, and this game stomps them all. It's a JRPG for people who are averse to JRPGs. It's got an amazing setting that isn't just \"generic fantasy rpg\", it's got lovable characters, an amazing story, and the battle system isn't boring or makes you wanna rip your hair out. This game has taken over my life and changed me for the better. \n\nIt's not a perfect game by any means. There's some yikesy moments, especially when it comes to sexualizing the cast of minors and being able to date adults as a minor, the story takes a few dips sometimes, and the protagonist is the generic perfect badass male hero that gets all the ladies. But I still don't think that it detracts from the overall experience. It's an amazing game, and when it's at it's peak, and Life Will Change starts playing, no game has yet to top that feeling for me. Just pure HYPE!\n\nI love this game to death. It is a masterpiece, and I will recommend this game forever. I would recommend getting the True ending as it adds another story arc to the game and, in my opinion, is the only valid ending for this game. What they added in Royal truly elevates P5 as like a 7.5/10 to a 9.5/10 for me.\n\nOh, and this isn't Pokemon, use buff and debuff moves.

Even just the vanilla P5 is one of the greatest RPGs of all time, with a cast of lovable characters, incredible visual style and soundtrack, and hours upon hours of content, not to mention the most fun the Persona gameplay has ever been. \n\nOne could think it would be boring to replay the same game with just some changes again. Well, thankfully, Royal manages to make it work. Even the content from the vanilla game is enhanced, between the re-done Akechi confidant, and adding Maruki and Yoshizawa into the original game's events, not to mention adding follow-up conversations to all original confidants. On top of that, hunting for Will Seeds in the Palaces, Jose's stamps in Mementos, and the dart minigame add a lot on the gameplay front, and make it fun even if you've played the original.\n\nThen, there is the third semester. I think it's an amazing addition to the story, showing a situation the Phantom Thieves have not faced before - trying to change the heart of an adult who doesn't have evil intentions. I can't say he doesn't have selfish intentions, because it does feel like creating a new, pain-free reality is some way to feed his savior complex... but the last palace's ruler does not wish to exploit people, only to help them, even if it's in a way not everyone would agree with, that takes away their agency. I think it's really interesting to actually have the Phantom Thieves question their morality, doubt if they're doing the right thing. Is freedom worth more than happiness? Aren't the struggles we overcome a part of what defines us? It adds on to the already brilliant story of P5 in a very satisfying and constructive way, making Royal, at least imo, the definitive P5 experience.\n\nP5R is, without a doubt, one of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing, and I'm planning at some point to go back and do NG+, just to try and complete everything there is to do in this masterpiece of an RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1695040949, "timestamp_updated": 1695040949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146527611": {"recommendationid": "146527611", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229724898", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11498, "last_played": 1697200566}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my few 10/10 games, It's literally a long journey that i don't regret to experience.

That music makes the game, because if the music was switched out for some heavy metal or pop punk, the game just wouldn't work at all\n\nI don't know what to call the music of this game. Is it jazz? is it funk? Is some of it rock? definitely, but there's one overlaying theme. It all fits, seamlessly\n\nI've not finished the game, but it's already one of my favorite games of all time.

Great story with an incredibly strong cast of characters. The English voice overs are really well done, some of the best I\u2019ve seen from a JRPG. It left me wishing more scenes were fully voiced.\n\nThe game is quite long but never really feels like it\u2019s too bloated like some more modern long games, however there were times near the end of the game I was ready for it to finish as some arcs aren\u2019t as strong as others and drag on.\n\nThe post game Royal content/third semester is great fun though, it has a great start that draws you in right away and features the best antagonist of the entire game. It\u2019s well worth getting to, and even though I was ready for the game to end just before the third semester started, when it kicked in any burnout I had from the long game was gone. I was ready for more thanks to the excellent third semester start serving as almost a palette cleanser.\n\nThe PC port is good with no major issues or frame drops. Pretty solid all the way through. Although, P5 is a game originally designed for the PS3 so it would be shocking if it came to PC in 2022 with issues. However, it does have a minor problem, the shadows reset to medium after every loading screen/transition, which means they will reset after minutes. Even though the settings menu continues showing it\u2019s set to High, it won\u2019t be. Luckily there\u2019s a mod on gamebanana that fixes this issue, but it does mean having to install and launch the game through a mod launcher. Disappointing that the port got patches but this issue was never addressed. \n\nEven if you aren\u2019t into JRPGs, or VNs, this game is an absolute must play. One of those games where once the credits roll you are left a little in awe.", "timestamp_created": 1694859414, "timestamp_updated": 1694859414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

You are 96% likely to love it's story, music, characters, and combat just as much as everyone else in the world.\nI, on the other hand, have a disorganized list of problems with this game that I hope can maybe fix future installments or warn particularly apprehensive buyers. I'll start with things I do like though, just to delay the notion that I hate-played this game just so I could hate it with more authority.\n[b]The Good:[/b] \n- Most of the female characters are excellently designed and given engaging friendship/romance dialogue\n- Takemi\n- Futaba\n- The stylized menus are cool\n- The non-vocal BGM is mostly great, and the vocalist is also decent in some songs\n- I appreciate that they cared enough to make an actual mini-game for the baseball and darts activities.\n- I can't recall any performance issues I ran into\n- It was easy for me to setup and use a controller. \nI thought I'd have more to talk about here. It really was the characters that got me this far. \n\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n- Morgana is a garbage character. I know everyone loves these mascots, but on top of being ugly as fuck in costume, it's also annoying as fuck and thankfully our own private Navi to narrate our life. I don't know it's secret and honestly don't care. \n- You cannot save whenever, so there are certain stretches of days that you just have to get through until you can actually save the game again. I'm not trying to save scum dialogue or something, I just wanna quit sometimes right when the game decides it's gonna be on autopilot for 3-4 days.\n- Minor thing, but why are there only like 20 save slots? I ran out towards the end, so I now have to overwrite more saves. I initially split off to have checkpoints to go back to if something went south or I missed an achievement or something, but now I'm having to go back up the list and it's awkward.  \n- The male characters were kind of annoying, except the doctor, Sojiro, and Akechi. Ryuji was just stupid, and it was annoying when that had consequences. Yusuke just never had any appeal to me, and his ignorance was not as amusing to me as it is to other people. Why did both of these fucks come to my house but never any uninvited girls? Fuck your \"people watching\" Yusuke\n- On the topic of Morgana, they use this little shit to convey all these random restrictions on certain nights that make absolutely no sense. You just finished a palace or left mementos, you're too tired to go outside(I know there's a workaround later, but why should we even need it?). Some random story thing is happening tomorrow, let's go to sleep early. Sometimes they don't even let you do activities in your room, even though they gave you control of the character. I'm so glad it's MY decision to go immediately to bed because Morgana pulls some shit out of his ass when I try to interact with anything. Just make the day pass, like fucking seriously. \n- The main story has incredibly shitty writing. It feels like a sitcom, the way drama starts or conflict is created to push things along. Every new adversary has to manufacture some ticking clock that won't stop until like a day before it's over, even if you resolve the problem immediately. If you rush it, like it seems you canonically should, you just wait 20 days of group texts afterwards about how everyone hopes it works out. Glad I felt compelled to resolve a problem for a character I care about, only to have them wait out the timer to be saved anyways. Like, just let it end early and give me free time in the middle? Why is that so hard? I'm not going to complain about not having a time-bomb in the top right corner that I've already defused.\n- This is apparently just a personal thing, but I really hate the vocal version of the song that plays every night. Like, especially the part where they say \"I'm a shapeshifter\". I know this is too much to ask, but I'd love to be able to disable certain songs or toggle what I would want to play instead. But you just get to change music volume, so I played a bit on mute to keep my brains off the wall a bit longer. \nKinda same thing with the casino music vocals, but less exposure = less vitriol \n- Why didn't they make a pool/billiards mini-game. I feel so detached when I have no input/agency and just watch. \n- There were a lot of dialogue options that I didn't get any hearts for, despite it seeming like I was just being playful or making a joke. I hate feeling like I need to choose a different option than what I wanna say because I don't want to have to waste an evening later with a non-relationship enhancing encounter. Joker just has to be stereo-typically supportive all the time. \n- A lot of the Mementos quests are really unclear. How am I supposed to guess I need to work at the flower shop twice to get info or figure out that gamer one. \n- I initially expected getting a job to be more committal\n- As much as I praised some of the relationships earlier, it sucks that they seem stuck to a formula of \"introduce character that has conflict around rank 5 or 6 (maybe earlier) and then you have to go to mementos to fix them at rank 8 or 9. Like, maybe someone's problems in life aren't solved by factory resetting one or more demons in their life.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n[b]Combat:[/b] Thought this deserved it's own section. I've not played other persona games, so this is not rated against them.  \n- There is very little to go off of when trying to guess something weakness. There seems to be something about flying things being weak to guns/lightning/ice, but beyond that, I was mostly just trying everything until it worked. This wasn't satisfying at all, and just artificially extended combat encounters. \n- Stunned things do not lose their turn. This became particularly annoying during a certain palace boss, but it's really unsatisfying to be unable to stun everything in the first turn, so you just have to watch them all wake up and attack you one after the other. It feels like they should lose a turn recovering, and I would not mind if that was mirrored on the player. \n- Fusing is super unsatisfying. There's a chance that you can fuse your 2 level 50 personas and make like a level 5 fairy. I know it's not random, but why is that a thing? You can also fuse two things and the level is like 90, so you're like, cool, guess I'll just buy them back later. Why not balance this a bit more so things always/only get a bit stronger, proportional to the avg level of the two or something. Like your two level 50s combine to make 55 or 60, so you are likely to be able to make things you can actually make use of? There's barely a point for personas to even level up when they jumps are just better from fusing if you can get the right personas to fuse. \n- Bosses are just not fun. Most of them are just about surviving or stat checking you, which is not really strategic. \n- I'm gonna put this in combat, but why does walking around in palaces feel like a PS2 game? The platforming is so restrained and exploration is locked behind what glows. See a window that seems relevant? Wait till the story lets you go there because it's not important yet. Wanna jump down somewhere so you don't have to walk all the way around to the stairs and sneak past a bunch of enemy spam you don't wanna deal with? Too bad, you're a cripple when the wall isn't shiny. It just feels clunky to do anything. \n- I think the default difficulty should give a lot more damage for weakness hits and the finisher when everyone is stunned. This is mostly fine for groups, but it feels terrible against single target bosses/mini-bosses\n- There should be something that tells you if a persona/boss is immune to a status. There doesn't seem to be any indicator or intuition for what will completely ignore everything, but I guess just don't bother trying to sleep bosses. \n_______________\nI ran out of characters.", "timestamp_created": 1694211130, "timestamp_updated": 1694211130, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478253155946731567", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145934318": {"recommendationid": "145934318", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161932661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 5656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1700736872}, "language": "english", "review": "nose man gives me personality disorder \n\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1694203435, "timestamp_updated": 1694203435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145928378": {"recommendationid": "145928378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079864005", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9619, "last_played": 1694668626}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 an amazing story based game, very thoughtful story and well fleshed out narrative that has a nice mix between a lot of dialogue and some good story based gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1694196618, "timestamp_updated": 1694196618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145925254": {"recommendationid": "145925254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068568554", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 7154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7154, "last_played": 1694192953}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1694193107, "timestamp_updated": 1695594466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145921238": {"recommendationid": "145921238", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013816367", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 12307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12307, "last_played": 1693264740}, "language": "spanish", "review": "JUEGAZO CON TODAS LAS LETRAS!!!!!!!!!!

It not only pays homage to its predecessors but also excels in enhancing key elements. The game introduces depth to battles, leveling, and bonuses, offering a more immersive gameplay experience. The inclusion of personas from previous games adds a nostalgic touch. Moreover, the abundance of ways to acquire items and the distinct playstyles of companions further enrich the game's appeal.\n\nOne of the game's standout features is its player experience. Building social links with characters feels seamless and rewarding, often granting new abilities and unlocking fresh perspectives on gameplay. This fosters a sense of progression and encourages players to explore these connections, which are backed by well-crafted character development.\n\nThe game's narrative is a strong point, with a captivating beginning that sustains interest throughout. The thoughtfully designed characters become individuals you genuinely care about, evolving into familiar faces over the course of the adventure. The storytelling is peppered with surprising twists and turns, including the additional DLC content, which introduces compelling new characters.\n\nThe soundtrack is a mesmerizing auditory masterpiece, with each track contributing to the game's atmosphere seamlessly. Even the DLC-specific music, while distinct, serves a meaningful role within the storyline.\n\nHowever, some aspects could be improved. The ending, while arguably designed to lead into future titles, feels somewhat abrupt. The decision to truncate the ending seems like an attempt to mitigate player frustration, although it may not have been necessary. Moreover, the \"True Good Ending\" lacks the depth and emotional resonance of its predecessor, with the game seemingly rushing to its conclusion. The missed opportunity for more meaningful character interactions in the closing moments is a letdown.\n\nWhile avoiding spoilers, it's worth noting that there are some inconsistencies within the game's universe.\n\nIn conclusion, Persona 5 Royal deserves a solid 9/10 rating. It offers an exceptional gaming experience despite its flaws.

All 53 Achievements, 100% Persona Compendium, Errybody at Lv99, All Bonds maxed, All Stamps collected, erry place unlocked, erry movie watched, erry vidya game played, erry book read, Secret Mementos Boss defeated, etc\n\nComing from Persona 4 Golden, the game was pretty much better in almost erry possible way. From the prominent things such as the art/visual upgrade and the significantly better dungeon exploration and combatUI/animations, to minor things like animated sprites during cutscenes, and countless other QoL improvements. Errything in P4G was carried over to P5R and improved on\n\nThe controls were awful. The Deadzones were massive. The camera stick had almost no diagonal input. It was very frustrating to use the camera. For the first 9 hours, I couldn't even walk at full speed when I used diagonal stick input. Even effected my Keyboard. Holding W + A/D just instantly starting walking at slowest pace. I had to hold 1 of the 4 directions to move at full speed, until I unlocked Sprint ability. It sucked\n\nThe achievements were nearly a complete waste of time. The accomplishments I listed in the first paragraph don't have their own achievements, like they did in P4G. Rather, the achievements are almost entirely automatically unlocked. Doing trivial things such as \"completing a palace\", \"going to a specific place\", \"performing a certain action\", etc. There was nothing achieving in it other than defeating the Reaper.

And omg, you cannot even skip the credits, I was on subway and almost failed to make a save due to those unskippable 10 minutes credits - luckily my deck survived at 3%... The devs definetely do not respect your time... Probably the most evil devs (or moe likely studio execs) I've ever supported with my coin, totally not gonna buy any more atlas games, unless someone finally steals their heart - go phantoms, I believe you can do it xD\n\nMy opinion - it's a flawed masterpiece... or maybe bloated masterpiece would be more accurate?\n\nI started the game already having some niche expectations that didn't influence my evaluation:\n- the game is over 100h long;\n- the game is half jrpg and half Japanese school simulator;\n- the game is not fully voiced and thus the characters will be making silly noises almost constantly;\n- the game is completely linear, and your choices doesn't matter;\n- time is the most important currency in the game.\nI was aware that not everyone like such staff, and went i the game anyway, since it is something I'm Ok with. I also need to disclose that I'm suffering from perfectionism, but I believe that even if you skip the majority of the content(unlike me) you will still get annoyed by all the bloatware. Although, if you take long pauses and finish other games while playing the game, you might not mind it.\n\nOverall the story is 8/10. sometimes it gets boring, but most of the time it plays just like the silly anime you expect it to be.\n\nThe character roaster is 6/10. Some of the main and side characters are completely boring, and their story better be integrated into other characters.\n\nthe side stories are 6/10. some of them are really interesting, maybe 9/10 or even 10/10, but majority of them are just bloated fillers. If I were the editor, I would've cut 30% of the party members and 30% of non battle confidants. But they probably just HAD to include more, since it is good for marketing...\nOh, yeah. even the good ones are bloated since writers had to make each confidant to have 10 events, it would've been nice if they cut it to 3-5. But hey, target audience like the game to have more hours, even if t makes the game bloated AF..\n\noh, yeah. the constant use of word pooped is def 0/10. it took me forever to realize they mean fucked. Worst low effort censorship ever...\n\nthe minigames are 5/10. there's way too many of them and they have too many levels/subgames. too many books/dvd/games as well...\n\nOverall, If they cut 30% of the lazy bloated content from daily life, it would've made that part of the game perfect.\n\njrpg side is pretty good. 7/10. once again, I would've cut 30% of the map size and 30% of the puzzles to make it perfect. But as is it's pretty good.\n\ncombat is also alright, but gets easy as you learn the mechanics and progress in story. by mid game i've already switched to merciless difficulty but the battles were still very easy. luckily Riuji + hunting the reaper a few times allows you to RUN into enemies for insta-kills allowing you to skip most battles xD\n\nOverall the game is good, but doesn't value your time. Cutting out the bloated parts of the daily life and half of the palaces would make the story more concise and the combat challenging till the end. but I guess 50h game is harder to sell to the target audience, that would much prefer bloated 150h game...\n\nP.S the game runs fine on steam deck, but anti-aliasing suffers greatly, probably the didn't have 720p screens in mind when testing it or the engine just couldn't handle it and they decided to ignore it :( looks gorgeous at 1080p, though...", "timestamp_created": 1693519936, "timestamp_updated": 1693591990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5,

On Hard difficulty, this game's turn-based combat is exactly what I wanted. Boss battles are hard enough to force you to strategise, find the boss' weaknesses, and make use of your party's full moveset.\nOf course, you can't mention \"Persona 5\" and \"difficult boss\" in the same sentence without mentioning \n[spoiler] Okumura [/spoiler] . This boss was brutal and often considered to be the hardest boss in the game by far. And this may be a hot take, but I LOVED it. I was stuck on this boss for an entire week and I even made an Excel spreadsheet to track my strategy. But if that's not your style, you can always lower the difficulty.\n\nThe other half of the game is the life-sim aspects. The Yakuza franchise has spoiled me for life-sim/side content, so this game doesn't quite hold the torch to it but it comes close. Persona 5's confidant system really expands on the main and side-characters and does wonders for worldbuilding. \nThe calendar system is a unique and interesting mechanic, the likes of which is rarely seen in gaming. Because time passes only as a result of you doing activities (main or side content), the game simultaneously incentivizes you to engage in side content, yet restricts the amount of side content you can do. I never felt the dilemma of \"Am I missing out on side content by rushing the story?\" or vice versa, that I often feel with other games. Every day has a purpose, and unless there's a scheduled story event, it's up to you to decide what that purpose is.\n\nAll of this ties in beautifully with the story, which is not just about some high-schoolers with special powers, but about how those powers affect society as a whole. The game has excellent storytelling with plenty of mysteries that unfold throughout the game. The game focuses on several main villains whose motives aren't that far off from real life corrupt people in power. The game's palaces both literally and [i] literally [/i] give you a deep look into their minds and how they think.\n\nThis game really exceeded my expectations and I will be playing more SMT/Persona games in the future.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1693439886, "timestamp_updated": 1693439886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145348796": {"recommendationid": "145348796", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233460315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1272, "last_played": 1693888723}, "language": "english", "review": "Persona 5 is a great game, and Persona 5 Royal is the best version of that game.

Without going into specifics that's all I can say on that front, but to be sure the story is not perfect because of this, as well as just some lame narrative choices here and there that I think come from an unwillingness to change the persona formula.\nAll of that said, I loved playing this game, which is most of what mattered. I just beat the game for the first time having never seen any of the content added on with royal, and while I think it is a welcome addition, it feels kinda tacked on and less fleshed out then the rest of the game as a whole (Still no spoilers). I still really enjoyed the bits tacked on in this re release and am glad to be able to play it on a pc. \nThe gameplay and overall presentation of this game are phenomenal, very few gripes there, I think the DLC personas you can get are kiiiiiiinda baby mode since you can just grab them literally whenever, but earning them through fusion felt really good especially at the end of the game. \nI played the game on hard, and got my ass kicked which was pretty cool minus one fight (I'd guess most people know which one I'm talking about) that was just poorly designed imo but everything else felt tough but fair. I would reccomend this game to most everyone as the conversations and world feel alive, the gameplay is super engaging, the music and visual presentation draw you in constantly, and it's just fun!\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1693433857, "timestamp_updated": 1693433857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145346742": {"recommendationid": "145346742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309230293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2374, "last_played": 1697406863}, "language": "english", "review": "theyre all so silly tbh :3", "timestamp_created": 1693433327, "timestamp_updated": 1693433327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145345310": {"recommendationid": "145345310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083957025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5280, "last_played": 1696815701}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super easy to get into and has a great story arch that seems to keep on going.

Allow me to elucidate why this is the case.\n\nI harbor a genuine affection for this game. It demanded 133 hours of my time to navigate its intricacies, and every moment was a delight. If I were to pinpoint a standout attribute, it would be the meticulous attention lavished upon even the minutest elements. The game's ability to sustain engagement throughout its considerable length is astonishing; monotony is conspicuously absent. Every facet serves a distinct purpose, ripe for utilization. Even a choice postponed by 40 hours could prove valuable at any given moment. On occasion, certain characters undertook actions that I had unlocked some time ago, prompting a surge of gratitude for the timely unfolding of events.\n\nFurthermore, the overarching stylistic coherence merits praise. The game exudes a unique aesthetic across menus, the metaverse, and reality itself, thus amplifying the immersive quality of the experience. Notable examples include Jose's menu design, alongside the visually captivating menus of Iwai and Takemi.\n\nThe music is simply exceptional, leaving me in awe of the ingenious process behind crafting such an outstanding soundtrack. Each time I listen, a wave of shivers engulfs me, evoking the sensation of stealthily infiltrating various palaces while embodying the essence of a true Phantom Thief. Even during challenging battles, the soundtrack doesn't falter, delivering resounding masterpieces that are destined to etch themselves into my memory indefinitely. Without a doubt, this ranks among the most remarkable soundtracks in the realm of video games that I've ever had the privilege to experience.\n\nThe combat adheres to classic JRPG mechanics, offering an engaging and enjoyable experience. Admittedly, certain Personas possess overwhelming power, and particular boss encounters left me disenchanted due to a rather one-dimensional approach of endurance and methodical, gradual depletion of their health. These battles lacked the strategic depth present in encounters earlier in the game.\n\nReturning to my initial point, I contend that Persona 5 Royal might stand as my sole foray into the Persona universe. In terms of style, narrative, and gameplay, no other installment appears to compare. This game seems to encapsulate the essence of the Persona formula flawlessly. While I acknowledge that others might hold differing viewpoints, I maintain that this sentiment reflects my personal assessment.\n\nOne more thing though Fuck You Okumura and your dogshit fight :)", "timestamp_created": 1693416851, "timestamp_updated": 1693439578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549918174743652344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145330569": {"recommendationid": "145330569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198993089267", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10439, "last_played": 1693413396}, "language": "english", "review": "let me romance sae you cowards", "timestamp_created": 1693413476, "timestamp_updated": 1693413476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145321298": {"recommendationid": "145321298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820081334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2886, "last_played": 1694647926}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.

Some Dutch (Larian) and Polish (CD Projekt), even UBISOFT (!?!?!?) arent as consumer hating. Remember that current-day Rockstar even supported story progression from previous to current-gen!\n\nOtherwise: it's an incredible game. The performance is really good even though it is a PS3 game. Runs absolutely great on Steam Deck on 1080p with 75% resolution scaling and SMAA with pretty consisten 60 FPS. On GTX 1080 it runs 4K @60 absolutely perfectly.\n\nIf it weren't for Atlus' atrocious customer relation, I would have zero issues. But their history in low-effort remasters (SMT3) and churning out this game thrice is just mad. Other devs grandfather you in or allow you to buy some form of season pass to get from P5 PS4->P5R PS4, which they of course didn't. P5R PS4 free next-gen patch or at least some form of upgrade path?

When I first played Persona 5 I was dealing with some heavy emotional trauma in my life, and going through the hardest times I could image. The idea of awakening to your inner self and finding justice in a world without it was a beautiful idea to me, I loved it. Now, years later when P5R hit steam, I was a few years into healing from the bad things I was going through when I originally played. The game hit different this time. The extra \"Royal\" content hits different than I knew it would have when I first played. The Persona games can bring light and joy into a dark existence. I have no doubt that this game has helped many people get through hard times as it has me. I am so excited that Persona hit the new audience on steam, and I'm so excited for the remasters, and P6 in the future. This is the best persona game yet, and I'm so glad its on PC (and steam deck!!) Do yourself a favor and enjoy this masterpiece. The art, story, music, and gameplay are stellar. I'm not really into anime, or japanese culture much, but this game transcends those things and is something great all its own. -PR0XIDIAN", "timestamp_created": 1693187078, "timestamp_updated": 1693187078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145166852": {"recommendationid": "145166852", "author": {"steamid": "76561199465305241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 510, "playtime_at_review": 6705, "last_played": 1699829044}, "language": "english", "review": "Akechi slid into my DMs 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1693179906, "timestamp_updated": 1693179906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145163578": {"recommendationid": "145163578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198964065378", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 4578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4557, "last_played": 1693412961}, "language": "english", "review": "so this is what post-persona depression feels like", "timestamp_created": 1693175310, "timestamp_updated": 1693175310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532330214977264404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145163392": {"recommendationid": "145163392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981425561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3340, "last_played": 1693180554}, "language": "english", "review": "slay game", "timestamp_created": 1693175079, "timestamp_updated": 1693175079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145162910": {"recommendationid": "145162910", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036539202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 7185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6367, "last_played": 1697646270}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute must play. obsessed, and even after finishing it, i want to play again, which is exactly what im going to do", "timestamp_created": 1693174439, "timestamp_updated": 1693174439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145157841": {"recommendationid": "145157841", "author": {"steamid": "76561199351461791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "playtime_at_review": 8033, "last_played": 1700397489}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing.

Atlus has weaved an intricate tapestry of psychology, supernatural powers, and social simulation, resulting in a title that defies classification and stands as a pinnacle of interactive storytelling.\n\nVisuals:\nThe visual design of Persona 5 is a living work of art that thrusts players into a vibrant and stylized Tokyo. From the strikingly animated menus to the meticulously crafted environments, every frame pulsates with a sense of purpose and style. The use of bold colors, intricate patterns, and unique character designs contributes to a world that feels both surreal and familiar, drawing players into its embrace.\n\nGameplay:\nPersona 5's fusion of turn-based combat, social simulation, and dungeon exploration is a symphony of gameplay mechanics that harmonize effortlessly. The innovative \"Confidant\" system deepens character relationships and grants tangible benefits in battle, while the Persona negotiation and fusion mechanics add layers of strategy and customization. The time-management aspect of juggling school life and the supernatural imbues the experience with a sense of urgency and immersion.\n\nStory and Characters:\nPersona 5's narrative is a labyrinthine tapestry of psychological exploration, societal critique, and personal growth. The story tackles themes of rebellion, justice, and the masks people wear in an oppressive world. The main characters are multi-dimensional and endearing, each harboring secrets that gradually unfold through heart-wrenching confessions. The synergy between the narrative and character development creates an emotional resonance that is rare in gaming.\n\nSoundtrack:\nShoji Meguro's soundtrack is an auditory masterpiece that enhances every facet of Persona 5. The eclectic mix of jazz, rock, and electronic genres captures the game's urban atmosphere and emotional depth. Memorable tracks like \"Life Will Change\" and \"Rivers in the Desert\" punctuate key moments with an energy that stays with players long after they've put down the controller.\n\nAesthetics and Themes:\nPersona 5's aesthetic choices transcend the visual and auditory realms, seeping into its thematic core. The motif of masks, rebellion, and the \"Metaverse\" resonates on both a narrative and symbolic level, mirroring the personas people adopt to navigate their lives. This introspective exploration of identity adds layers of depth, inviting players to reflect on their own masks and motivations.\n\nLongevity:\nWith a sprawling main storyline, hidden secrets, and multiple endings, Persona 5's longevity is practically boundless. The New Game+ feature encourages subsequent playthroughs, allowing players to carry over progress and unlock new interactions. The desire to uncover all confidant stories, fuse every Persona, and uncover the mysteries of the Metaverse ensures that the allure of Persona 5 never fades.\n\nConclusion:\nPersona 5 stands as a magnum opus that marries its distinctive aesthetics, compelling characters, and layered gameplay into a transcendent experience. Atlus has achieved a feat of storytelling that transcends the medium, creating a masterpiece that lingers in the minds and hearts of players. With its evocative visuals, rich gameplay, and profound narrative, Persona 5 secures its place among the most treasured works of interactive artistry.\n\n-from chatgpt ign style", "timestamp_created":

[/i]\n\nPersona 5 Royal es el tercer juego de la saga Persona que me paso, segundo si solo contamos los juegos de la l\u00ednea principal. Tengo sentimientos encontrados con este juego, siempre me dec\u00edan que era una obra maestra y que era superior al 4. No, no lo es. Claro, solo la segunda afirmaci\u00f3n porque es un JUEGAZO en toda la regla. Tal vez peca un poco en la historia y en los personajes, pero nada fuera de lo normal. En lo que s\u00ed estoy de acuerdo que le da una barrida al 4 es en el gameplay, aunque es l\u00f3gico, ya que es un juego 8 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s (WTF Atlus, ya va a pasar 8 a\u00f1os desde que sacaste el 5, por favor ya saca el 6)\n\nDejando a un lado las comparativas y enfoc\u00e1ndonos en otro punto. Persona 5 tiene los despertares m\u00e1s \u00e9picos que he visto hasta el momento, no los mejores, porque esos son los del 4 (otra comparativa, debi\u00f3 ser una sorpresa) me gusta mucho el tema de la rebeld\u00eda hacia la sociedad o los prejuicios, simplemente Atlus supo hacer bien este apartado, adem\u00e1s de que cuentan con tremendo OST que con eso llegamos a otro punto.\n\nSer\u00e9 sincero, me siguen gustando m\u00e1s el ost de Persona 3 y Persona 4, pero tampoco es para rebajar a los temones de este juego (con decir que siempre los escucho al momento de jugar otro juego o al estudiar ya es mucho) \n\nEn cuestiones de trama, pues, es lo que esperar\u00edas como m\u00ednimo de un jrpg. Est\u00e1 bien, pero no es la venida de Jesucristo. El cast principal es otro punto a medias, me gustan algunos m\u00e1s que otros, pero en general no tanto. No percibo esa amistad \"verdadera\" o \"fluida\" que dej\u00f3 el elenco de Persona 4. A\u00fan as\u00ed, est\u00e1n bastante bien, ya que para ser los t\u00edpicos estereotipes de personajes anime, estos si presentan un desarrollo con el paso del tiempo (y c\u00f3mo no, el juego dura como 100 horas)\n\nPor \u00faltimo me enfocar\u00e9 en el tema de el contenido extra de ROYAL. Hice dos runs como de costumbre, una solo con el contenido vanilla y el \u00faltimo con los nuevos agregados. Debo decir que estuvo exquisito. Me gust\u00f3 infinitamente m\u00e1s que el arco final del juego vanilla. Sumire es un gran personaje y una buena waifu y ni hablar del Doctor Maruki (mi padre). Adachi me gust\u00f3 como antagonista por ser un loco desquiciado, pero es que Maruki es otro nivel. Son de esos antagonistas que te hacen simpatizar con sus acciones e ideales, se podr\u00eda decir que son mas anti h\u00e9roes, pero ese t\u00edtulo le queda mejor al edgy de Akechi, que por cierto, tambi\u00e9n se luci\u00f3 y redimi\u00f3 en este \u00faltimo arco. Vean la escena post cr\u00e9ditos, por favor.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n. Persona 5 Royal es un juego que [b] DEBES [/b] de jugar si te gusta la saga o los jrpg en general. Ya que no presenta continuidad con los juegos anteriores, salvo cameos o menciones de personajes.\nPersona 5 Royal es un juego con alma y con una identidad diferente a los dem\u00e1s, incluso podr\u00eda recomend\u00e1rselo a aquellos que no les gusta los JRPGs ni los combates por turnos, ya que el juego est\u00e1 tan bien hecho que no te vas a perder as\u00ed seas un manco.\n\nEso es todo sobre mi opini\u00f3n, me encant\u00f3 estas 160 horas de juego. Dejarlo al 100% este tipo de juegos que te encantan con todo el ser, se siente verdaderamente magn\u00edfico. Solo toca esperar al Persona 3 Reload que tiene una pintaza y le tengo unas ganas, que se viene a casa d\u00eda uno. \n\nPD: Castren a Morgana\nPD 2: Futaba es la best waifu", "timestamp_created": 1692559255, "timestamp_updated": 1692559255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501742184162139893", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144663663": {"recommendationid": "144663663", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026549614", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7708, "last_played": 1694083027}, "language": "english", "review": "-1/10, could not romance Ryuji", "timestamp_created": 1692557680, "timestamp_updated": 1692557680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144658472": {"recommendationid": "144658472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316761079", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 228, "playtime_at_review": 6615, "last_played": 1700431094}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great story <3", "timestamp_created": 1692552799, "timestamp_updated": 1692552799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144655098": {"recommendationid": "144655098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998171400", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4420, "last_played": 1692628008}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I feel like I need more\"\nMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1692549747, "timestamp_updated": 1692549747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144644987": {"recommendationid": "144644987", "author": {"steamid": "76561199248993950", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 40716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36637, "last_played": 1693486872}, "language": "english", "review": "Persona !

The style, and flair of the game is remarkable, the visuals are the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed and have inspired me to pursue art more. The soundtrack if what I imagine a backing track to my real life would be, and the other songs in it show off the stylish and groovy jazz/rock(?) themed the game provides. If you want to get the most out of P5R do not play with the DLC Personas not until at least NG+, the break this game so much lmao. I genuinely believe this to be the most influential thing in my life. This game changed my outlook on life as a whole and it is a statement that everyone who has ever shown any interest in this game should play it till the end, anyone who\u2019s experienced a JRPG should play it to the end, anyone who knows of Joker\u2019s existence should play it to the end.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how Persona 5 Royal, took my heart. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1692355434,

pol\u00edtica, abuso de las empresas grandes, un mundo falso de felicidad, etc. \nLos personajes no se quedan atr\u00e1s aun que parezcan estereotipos sacado de los animes son personajes

Para empezar tienes el estado social, el estado social consiste de Inteligencia, Coraje, Amabilidad, Destreza y Belleza. consiste en mejorar eso estados para poder hacer cosas en la vida o seguir la trama de los personaje que mencione lo anteriormente y como se mejora el estado haciendo cosas ejemplo: si quieres mejorar amabilidad trabaja en tiendas con clientes amables. si quieres mejorar coraje ve pel\u00edculas de terror o anda al gimnasio asi con los dem\u00e1s estados sociales. tambi\u00e9n tiene el sistema de calendario es lo mas simple del mundo el sistema consiste en hacer cosas en dia para pasar el siguiente dia y ya pero por que es importante que en el juego te lo explica de mejor manera.\nEl apartado visual y sonoro es de lo mas rico del juego la m\u00fasica es lo mejor del mundo y el apartado visual es lo mejor con detalles tanto de la m\u00fasica y del arte que tiene har\u00e1 feliz a cualquiera que le gusta en ambos mundos de la m\u00fasica de visual.\nMi opini\u00f3n: Es un juego que me marco es uno de los mejores que e jugando en todo los juegos que tuve en la vida lo recomiendo a todos ya sea que no te guste o no dale una oportunidad no te vas a arrepentir gracias por leer por esta rese\u00f1a uy nos vemos en otro juego", "timestamp_created": 1692306278, "timestamp_updated": 1692306278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144437012": {"recommendationid": "144437012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285264770", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6228, "last_played": 1692249095}, "language": "english", "review": "game is good", "timestamp_created": 1692303399, "timestamp_updated": 1692303399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144434732": {"recommendationid": "144434732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073939607", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 16490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16490, "last_played": 1678853552}, "language": "english", "review": "Style might not be everything, but here it's overwhelming.\n\nPlaying Persona 5 lets you enjoy a beautiful illusion of leading a crew of rebellious teenagers in the alienating yet comfortable suburbs of Tokyo.

The balance of being a model high school student pushing through exams, being called upon randomly in class while dozing off, or getting chalk thrown at you by a psycho teacher, by day and a \"save-the-world vigilante\" by night, is truly such an immersive and enjoyable experience. \n\nThe story told is always interesting. Getting to learn about your friends and enemies is a really rewarding and exciting part of the game. So much so that I found myself upset that I wouldn't be able to hang out with this friend or that friend because a story beat is coming the next day. \n\nThe life-sim aspect of Persona 5 Royal was the highlight of the game for me. Having to decide who or what to spend my time with each day was extremely engaging. Should I study? Hang out with a friend? Go see a movie at a theater to make myself more charming? Try and eat a giant burger to be more gutsy? Try and seduce my doctor? Or fight a bunch of monsters and/or do the big story content? This was easily the most fun part of the game for me and what kept me playing.  \n\nI have never been a huge fan of turn based combat but I did have a lot of fun with various aspects of Persona 5's combat system. Most of the boss fights were also very intriguing with the combat and the story leading up to them through the palaces that you fight through to get to the final boss. These palaces always felt fresh and were a genuine blast to go through each and every time. \n\nMy biggest gripe with Persona 5 Royal is just the sheer amount of dialogue shoved at you over and over again. I do not know just how many times my protagonist had a conversation with someone or a group of people just to get a text or phone call basically having that entire conversation all over again. This happened constantly sometimes the same conversation is repeated multiple times over the course of a couple weeks. While the characters are extremely interesting and the dialogue is fun and engaging it does get quite annoying to have the same thing repeated to you over and over and over again. \n\nThere were also some extremely long stretches of cutscenes that had me pause and take a little break before wanting to pick up the controller to hold for another 30 minutes before I could have control of my character again. This is not necessarily a bad thing. But I thought it was worth mentioning. \n\nAll in all Persona 5 Royal was an all around great experience. A fantastic lineup of characters to get to know and grow bonds with and a thoroughly enjoyable story jam-packed into an 100+ long game but those 100 hours will still leave you wanting to spend more time with its characters and its world once it is over,\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1692213596, "timestamp_updated": 1692213596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144356119": {"recommendationid": "144356119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140777044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 13521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 214, "playtime_at_review": 12798, "last_played": 1700341993}, "language": "english", "review": "What a game!

The game does its best to make it feel like everything Joker does can help improve himself; both as a Phantom Thief and as a person. Confidants are even more incentivized than previous game's social links, because they help you in mementos and palaces. The Jazz club and Penguin Sniper help improve your party members. Jobs can lead to new connections (though really, we do them once or twice for the requests). Technicals have also been improved from the vanilla version, making them feel worthwhile to use.\n\nThere are lower points in the game. Some of the story beats towards the middle can feel weaker, though the bombastic starts and ends do make up for it. With some of the mementos perks, it can be very easy to overlevel, making an occasionally difficult game easy. That is not even mentioning a certain DLC persona that trivializes the game.

My set up has:\n-GPU: Nvidia GTX 1660 ti\n-CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600\n-RAM: DDR4 32gb (16 and 16)\n-Motherboard: Rog Strix X470-F Gaming\n\n\n                                                                                        Final Score\n\nOverall from 1 to 10 I would say 9/10 is a very good score and I highly recommend it...\nI wanted to give it a 10/10 but every game must have room for development. So I hope Persona 6 would be even better than the previous ones...\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1692108494, "timestamp_updated": 1692108494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

I know it doesn't need another review, at this point, but I want to anyway. Before that, let's take a step back, to when I first met this saga, at the hands of Persona 4, a game that to this day remains one of my favorites and I don't think it will ever be dethroned.\n\nPersona 4 completely captivated me, and turned me into an Atlus fan (although I had played Devil Survivor and SMT: Strange Journey before, they hadn't captured me as much as this one), so I waited anxiously for Persona 5 to finally come to PC. I dodged heavy spoilers for years, looked the other way when the anime came out, and even when it showed up in stores, already within my reach, I had to keep waiting until I could buy it... and damn, it was worth it, very worth it.\n\nPersona 5 is a JRPG that has captured the hearts of many gamers (pun intended), and offers not only a story full of touching and exciting moments, but also a gameplay that, while maintaining the soul of its predecessors, adds modernizing changes and very cool mechanics, as well as improving on what was already there.\n\nThis time, the [b]story[/b] puts us in the role of a guy who was a victim of society's corruption, framed for an assault he did not commit, and being forced to change schools while carrying the label of criminal. But this event will lead him to meet some mysterious jailers from an alternate world, who\u2019ll help him in his journey and with his \"rehabilitation\", which will be explained to us gradually.\n\nLittle by little, the plot will be revealed to us, and we\u2019ll awaken our powers (I'll get to that later) as we become familiar with the city and its inhabitants. Throughout our adventure, we\u2019ll recruit companions who share the will of rebellion; and with them, we\u2019ll form the band of thieves of hearts; that is, pretty much, the central theme of the game, and I thought it was phenomenal! It's a story with several clich\u00e9s, but overflowing with genius and a setting that I simply loved, and it must be said that it's carried on the shoulders of endearing characters that I won't soon forget. \n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] is similar to the previous game, but with several entertaining improvements. Something that returns practically immaculate is having a certain amount of time in the day (usually afternoon and evening) to perform our activities; this is why we must choose carefully what to do each day, because once we decide, time will pass and there will be no turning back. There are many things to do and unlock, so planning our decisions a little is not so bad either.\n\nIn our free time, either after school or on free days, we can explore the city and visit different places and stores, do some activity that increases our parameters, or simply hang out with our companions to strengthen our bonds. Bonds, or social links, are very important in this saga, and represent the \"level\" of friendship we have with certain individuals. \n\nEach bond will have its different benefits depending on the level, and the goal is to raise them to the maximum to get the most out of them. For example, raising the \"death\" bond, with the local doctor, gives us a repertoire of medicines that expands as we help her with her work and get to know her better. In the case of the companions that we can bring in the group, they usually get skills more focused on combat.\n\nTouching on the subject of combat, it is the classic turn-based group combat, where we can go with up to four characters at the same time and battle against the \"shadows\" that reside in an alternate world, called the \"metaverse\" (no, not Facebook\u2019s). In this place we'll find what the game presents as \"palaces\", where powerful shadows that are the manifestation of the most twisted desires of certain individuals reign; and our job as thieves of hearts, is to trace a route within these palaces, reach the treasure, and steal it, so that these people have a \"change of heart\". We also need to sell a calling card before the heist, in all-good phantom thieves fashion!\n\nWithin the combat we'll have Personas, powerful creatures that represent our will, our other self, and so on. While our companions have their own Persona, the protagonist is able to invite the shadows of the metaverse to join him, in order to get their cooperation and special abilities; this is what makes him stand out, since he is like a wildcard, versatile and can adapt to any situation (especially because each Persona also has its own attributes, such as weakness/strength to fire, lightning, etc.).\n\nOutside of combat, the exploration of the palaces is made interesting thanks to some creative mechanics, such as being able to hide in the shadows and behind obstacles to set up ambushes (and thus start the fight with an advantage), or dodge enemies to proceed without fighting. We'll also have thief tools, such as lock picks to open chests, or a zipline gun to hook ourselves around and look very cool flying through the air, as well as to reach high places, I guess. All in all, this section is one of the most entertaining, and I feel that they improved quite a bit the combat and exploration compared to the previous installment; I must say that there's still a lot I haven't mentioned, but I'll put a stop here.\n\nThe game's [b]art[/b] section is just great, from the title screen to the character designs; there's no other game that made me think \"how cool are these menus\" over and over, really. The 3D models looked great to me, especially after coming from playing SMT 3: Nocturne, as I was able to have a pretty clear comparison, and I was delighted. If I had to decide on one word to sum it all up, it would be style. Bosses are badass, Personas are so cool looking, it\u2019s just all great.\n\nThe [b]soundtrack[/b] is no slouch either, giving off a majestic vibe in all of the game's tunes. I especially loved the tracks in Mementos, one of the game's mazes, and the weapon store; they're great. It's worth noting that one of the main songs is the one heard in the background in countless YouTube videos, to give an example of how good this is. In short, an immaculate audiovisual section, and I expected nothing less!\n\nIn [b]conclusion[/b], Persona 5 Royal takes the essentials of the franchise and elevates it to its maximum splendor, adding novelties and with a super entertaining story, which does not neglect a cast of characters that I became attached to as if they were my own friends. It is a detailed, stylized and charismatic game, and I hated to see how it slowly reached the end, because I really didn't want to let go (although, truth be told, I spent the final stretch grinning from ear to ear, very moved). But, same as in 4, that's the idea, not to hold on to the past and move forward, face reality; or at least that's how I came to interpret it.

Every time a new Persona is on the horizon I always see some muppets say they want the series to drop the calendar and/or social sim mechanics and go back to P1/P2 style, which would be dumb as hell.\n\nI played the game in Japanese, so I can't comment on the localization, but I CAN say that Sumire is way hotter with her hair down.", "timestamp_created": 1691910209, "timestamp_updated": 1697326048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51754385232925415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144065598": {"recommendationid": "144065598", "author": {"steamid": "76561199028056775", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 8697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8583, "last_played": 1698662302}, "language": "english", "review": "Zest fest overload", "timestamp_created": 1691908988, "timestamp_updated": 1691908988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144064873": {"recommendationid": "144064873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134385328", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8131, "last_played": 1692243838}, "language": "english", "review": "Makoto best girl.", "timestamp_created": 1691908264, "timestamp_updated": 1691908264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144063794": {"recommendationid": "144063794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122788314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5095, "last_played": 1686464614}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is GOOD!", "timestamp_created": 1691907059, "timestamp_updated": 1691907059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144062927": {"recommendationid": "144062927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199154831424", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 10232, "last_played": 1700745637}, "language": "english", "review": "KAWAKAMI", "timestamp_created": 1691906173, "timestamp_updated": 1691906173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144058743": {"recommendationid": "144058743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868946587", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2346, "last_played": 1699206223}, "language": "english", "review": "clearly I don't have enough hours on here to have completed it, 39 hours and not even on second palace yet!

I was instantly captivated, the music, the fun persona system, almost like im catching pokemon or something, it was just amazing fun with a great story.

A long game.  Took me a bit to get into it myself, but my playthrough of the PC version is the second, first of Royal version.  If you're here wondering if you should play this before strikers?  yes.  Yes Yes yes.  Strikers is fine, but totally different combat.  This game can get a bit....  campy.  A bit \"rotten adults\" and \"Rah rah save the world,\" and I find myself cringing from that, but even still I enjoy following the story, even on my second run (a rarity for me) and enjoy the characters.  Definitely make your first play through blind.  You'll miss a lot of confidants and helpful skills, but playing it \"as you would\" making decisions as you'd make them, rather than to maximize your abilities, makes the life sim end of it more enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1691341784, "timestamp_updated": 1691341784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538461565971374512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143532993": {"recommendationid": "143532993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313916524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 5558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5558, "last_played": 1691339648}, "language": "english", "review": "JUST AMAZING", "timestamp_created": 1691339656, "timestamp_updated": 1691339656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143510972": {"recommendationid": "143510972", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988453220", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 14605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14568, "last_played": 1691379832}, "language": "english", "review": "best game i've maybe ever played", "timestamp_created": 1691315353, "timestamp_updated": 1691315353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143507413": {"recommendationid": "143507413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046272286", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4219, "last_played": 1691272149}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Prove your existence to society.
