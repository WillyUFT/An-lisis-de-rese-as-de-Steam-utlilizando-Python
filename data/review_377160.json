de juego se ve empa\u00f1ada por un crafting que para mi es abusivo con un modo de construcci\u00f3n que tienes que \"moddear\" o \"glitchear\" para hacer las cosas medio bien, el desarrollo de juego no es para nada tan fluido como el del Fallout 3, juego que para m\u00ed es mucho mejor que este Fallout 4, por mucho que digan y quien diga lo contrario es porque no tuvo el placer de jugar al Fallout 3 en su momento, adem\u00e1s la gesti\u00f3n y los ataques constantes a tus asentamientos, te cortan el rollo, cuando estas en medio de una misi\u00f3n principal,  te sientes obligado a hacer un \"Fast Travel\" a tu asentamiento para defenderlo dejando la misi\u00f3n a medias, cort\u00e1ndote el rollo y casi hasta perdi\u00e9ndo la noci\u00f3n de lo que estabas haciendo o ibas a hacer, cosa que me da much\u00edsima rabia en los juegos con historias intensas como \u00e9ste.\n\nEn definitiva el juego es muy bueno, mucho mejor gestionado y dise\u00f1ado que el actual Starfield, con muchos menos bugs e infinitamente mejor caracterizado y aunque mi review viene con 8 a\u00f1os de retraso desde que salio el juego, le doy mi pulgar hacia arriba, juegos as\u00ed aunque no sean perfectos hay que defenderlos como el que defiende sus juegos favoritos porque le gustan o como el que defiende su casa en una guerra, m\u00e1s vale tarde que nunca como dicen en mi pueblo, Fallout 4 es un mundo abierto disfrutable, entretenido, apasionante, con un punto negro que son los asentamientos que te obligan a estar constantemente encima de ellos cort\u00e1ndote constantemente el rollo como he dicho, pero con una optimizaci\u00f3n soberbia desde el principio a final del juego, t\u00e9cnicamente atrasado pero buen\u00edsimo en todos los aspectos. Tengo que decir que aunque no esta al nivel del Fallout 3 y anda varios pasos por detr\u00e1s de \u00e9ste recomiendo encarecidamente Fallout 4.\n\nMe gustaria destacar las labores de programaci\u00f3n que, aunque a d\u00eda de hoy, 8 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s y aunque el juego ya est\u00e9 algo pasadito, a\u00fan conserva algunos bugs, y reafirma la teor\u00eda de que Bethesda nunca termina de pulir sus juegos en este aspecto. Y me gustaria reiterar que la herramienta de construcci\u00f3n que te brinda el juego, como he dicho, es una pifia por lo que a mi respecta es muy mejorable, adaptada a las omnipresentes consolas que me tienen cansad\u00edsimo, adem\u00e1s de que como he dicho arriba, en ocasiones, tienes que \"glitchearla\" para poder construir bien tus asentamientos y hacer coincidir las piezas, labor la cual te lleva demasiado tiempo y se hace muy tediosa y pesada, a veces te hace pensar que estas en un \"city builder\" antes que en una aventura de acci\u00f3n-rol, pero que por \"h\" o por \"z\" no llega a exprimir al m\u00e1ximo ninguno de los dos g\u00e9neros por culpa de una microgesti\u00f3n excesiva de asentamientos que en un juego como este deber\u00eda haber sido m\u00e1s liviana, pasas m\u00e1s tiempo construyendo que siguiendo las tramas del juego, al final te  rompe el rollo y obstruye constantemente la experiencia de juego, dicho sea de paso es mi opini\u00f3n y como cada cual tiene la suya, que cada uno opine lo que quiera, buenos d\u00edas.", "timestamp_created": 1700731310, "timestamp_updated": 1700733219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151274128": {"recommendationid": "151274128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293506079", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 8697, "last_played": 1700730250}, "language": "english", "review": "never gets boring", "timestamp_created": 1700730372, "timestamp_updated": 1700730372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151274000": {"recommendationid": "151274000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865240239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 4458, "last_played": 1700729374}, "language": "english", "review": "Fallout 4 excels in story, gameplay, and character creation.

I often see people say that it's \"a good game, but not a good Fallout game\", and I am inclined to agree with this. \n\nDespite its flaws, I find it to be a really enjoyable shooter with a nice overall aesthetic and good soundtrack. The shooting mechanics themselves are far and away better than previous entries in the series, and there is an absolute ton of quest content to get through. The companions are likeable, and as always, it is a very moddable game. It also made the brave choice of including a DLC where 90% of the content is only playable if you become a raider. \n\nIf you want a vanilla-like experience with enhancements akin to FNV's Viva New Vegas, I would recommend The Midnight Ride (https://themidnightride.moddinglinked.com/), and you can add Sim Settlements 2 to this if you're interested in that part of the game too.",

I love repairing and building back sanctuary hills, especially after I realized how to set up electricity in the houses. I wish that objects interaction would be less clunky in building mode, but otherwise it feels relaxing to come back to the game and spend a couple of hours in this weird world, listening to old music and finding new fun stories to discover. \nI really love the mini-stories in the side-quests. Even reading stories in terminals feel interesting, even though I usually skip reading things in games. But somehow those stories unwrap from the end to the beginning, end figuring out what happen in this office or in an old vault leads to interesting conclusions and feels rewarding. \nI also love the moments, when you don't expect game to react to some minor decisions, and suddenly finding consequecnes of your decision.

Our operating characters have complete, multi-path upgrades. We can choose the direction of evolution that suits us.

We can build various facilities in the communities we control to develop local residents.\n\nSpeaking of shortcomings, the relatively rough graphics and UI must be mentioned.

I'm no lore guy, but the way the difficulty work is just: The higher the difficulty, enemy do more damage and becomes tankier. So what happens in high difficulty is that it's just resource dump, not the good kind because the shooting feels a bit off (better than fallout 3 and NV though).\n\nSo to alleviate this, I kinda cheated by installing a mod that enables the random critical hit back from the old game. So I got the new critical hit system from fallout 4 which was a guaranteed hit after a few hits in VATS and the random critical hit. This makes the game better, but for a multi million game designer to not realize this sounds like incompetency. That and also the AI and the way combat can be trivialized by huffing on stimpaks. Fallout 3 and NV is like this but not to a worse amount, especially now that enemy scales with level, the enemies are going to get tankier.\n\nContent wise I think the game is just too big with no so memorable stuff. I remember the fallout NV plant vault to this very day and how dangerous it was to venture there. I remember the fallout 3 combat system and how busted Luck was. Here, I just remember Cait, which was a companion on the game that I kinda like because how sarcastic she was. The main story just felt off by the end and I think the final nail in the coffin that made me give a negative review is that the ending was bugged.\n\nYes, a multi million dollar company couldn't figure out that a main quest for their game had a consistent bug preventing you from progressing.

Fallout 3 would come out the next year, sure, but the world was blessed with that year\u2019s entry in the famed Tony Hawk series: Tony Hawk\u2019s Proving Ground\u2026 and the vastly, vastly superior Skate from Electronic Arts. It\u2019s hard to state what it was like, after playing nearly [i]every[/i] Tony Hawk game, how EA\u2019s skate felt, especially since Tony Hawk was seemingly in the trough of its relevancy (and little did we know how much further it could fall.) Some of those later Hawk games are classics (Underground 1) or, at least, pretty good (UG2, maybe American Wasteland?) but it was clear the idea well was nearly empty, with you spending what felt like more and more mission time [i]not[/i] skateboarding. And, yet, I still played Proving Ground for dozens of hours. Why? Because it was still Tony Hawk. No matter how much nonsense they tried to bolt on the mechanics, they still worked. It wasn\u2019t until the entire engine went through the woodchipper after Neversoft was relieved of command did I sign off entirely.\n\nSo let\u2019s now turn to Fallout. This was another game series I played extensively. When Fallout 4 was released, I was not very happy and passed it by. I wasn\u2019t interested in the setting of Massachusetts. I wasn\u2019t interested in exploring the Institute. I almost always skip The Replicated Man quest in Fallout 3. I just didn't care.\n\nSo I decided to finally pull the trigger and purchase 4. Oh boy. The opening salvo was nearly a quitting moment in itself. Old world! Nuclear war! Go to the vault! Shady Vault-Tec experiment! Plot starts!! Radroaches! Funny robot! Bloatflies! The dog! Molerats! Raiders! Good guys! Power armor! DEATHCLAW!\n\nThis is a  theme park ride of the Fallout Experience, not an action RPG with a 40+ hour main campaign. It signaled to me that something was amiss. In a bubble, there\u2019s plenty of things going okay here. The plot has urgency and momentum, even if the direness of 4 is more amplified than, say, finding your perfectly capable adult father in DC (I was waiting for that achievement you get in The Forest \u2013 \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be finding your son?\u201d.) The combat is very good. The landscape is pleasantly despairing, full of abject failure and misery and contrast between how different groups of humans adapt to awful circumstances. Almost every location is a story within itself and exploring with no expectation of a reward, outside of just attempting to figure out what on Earth happened, is a joy. Companions are, by and large, fun and compelling and complex. And the overall political landscape \u2013 three good guy factions with their own impulses (civilian resistance, military strength, subversion) aimed against a larger bad guy faction \u2013 is simple and done fairly well. The radio is absolutely incredible and might be the best part of the game: the songs they picked out or are original recordings are dissonant in the best way, underscoring that you are a lost weirdo without a home in a land that is actively hostile to you. \n\nOutside of the bubble, I can\u2019t help but feel disappointed. The approach to combat, to me, favors run-and-gun way heavier, deemphasizing VATS and thus one of the last mechanical ties to the original Fallout games. Enemies get spongy damn near immediately, evoking to me the worst part of having Broken Steel installed for 3. Structurally, the Commonwealth is more than a little bit like the Capital Wasteland \u2013 the open hills as your \u201cstarter area\u201d with realms of difficulty demarcated by a urban environment. Like Fallout 3, you\u2019re often in the ghoul/raider/Super Mutant/mercenary combat matrix with such alarming frequency you wonder how anyone managed to settle here at all. You\u2019ll often find yourself besieged and assaulted vertically. There\u2019s so, so many fire escapes and roofs and it is logical but it doesn\u2019t make it any less annoying. There are way, way, way too many mini-nukes and Fat Man\u2019s lying around to make sense at all. You\u2019ll probably encounter a raider with a Fat Man 30 minutes into your playthrough, in one of the most logical thoroughfares for what to do after the introduction, and it will [i]piss you off [/i]. The dungeon-like nature of notable locations reveal themselves almost immediately, having you ask why so many raiders are just holed up somewhere in outer Boston. Vault-Tec apparently abandoned all pretense of being inscrutable-but-unscrupulous and is now just plain evil. A warhead created what feels like miles of irradiated wasteland here, despite the White House being *directely hit* by a nuke in Fallout 3 and DC is still, like, there.\n\nBut that\u2019s the old stuff. What about the new stuff? The settlement system is an interesting thought but demands mods to be passably engaging. Without, it feels like Fallout\u2019s worst tendencies regarding its world repackaged as gameplay feature. You don't encounter communities that that have been affected by a setback but could otherwise grow and thrive (or at least leave), but groups of pathetic, dirty, sick wastrels that are waiting around to be killed horribly without your help. It\u2019s also great to know that nobody in the 250-something years of the Fallout timeline ever learned basic carpentry and that you are no exception. Gun and armor improvements are similarly fascinating, but the negative of them comes from removing the lion\u2019s share of unique, named weapons and armor from the game world in place of \u201clegendaries\u201d with random effects. And while you can kind of make your own Terrible Shotgun, it\u2019s not as fun, to me, as finding it in the landscape. In the hands of a slaver merchant. Who you will kill, of course.\n\nThe story is\u2026 whatever. I wonder if they simply were thinking \u201clet\u2019s approach the father/son dynamic of Fallout 3 from the inverse angle?\u201d. It does what it should most of the time, but Fallout has always been mostly black-and-white. The most thought-out bad guy faction was the Legion, in terms of policies that people that aren\u2019t stupid and/or sociopaths would actually believe, but even going for them was radically dumb in terms of what it does to step-by-step gameplay. The second twist in Fallout 4 may give you that momentary pause that other \u201cevil offers\u201d, like President Eden\u2019s wish for you to poison the entire coast\u2019s water supply, do not, but the Institute is still hilariously backwards and bumbling outside of making fake people. So, it\u2019s kind of funny. It\u2019s like if you found James in DC and he\u2019s trying to domesticate Yao Guais.\n\nYou\u2019ll probably invest in the Game of the Year edition. And you\u2019ll be hit with a bunch of questions in the gamut of DLC about the expanded Fallout universe that might be fascinating for a minute or for a mod. Hey, buster! Did you ever want to build your own Vault? (No, not really.) Don\u2019t you want to build some of those RobCo robots? (I guess, maybe..) Don\u2019t you want to face off again with the Mechanist?! (Huh??) Do you want to create a bunch of Minecraft-esque contraptions that still pull from the same extremely limited resource pool, requiring multiple travels to merchants to buy shipments of materials? (No.) Do you want to lead a raider gang in what feels like the first draft of the Pitt DLC? (Absolutely not.) Don\u2019t you want to explore a gorgeous landscape, a great story, whole new enemies, and one of those fantastic integrations of mechanics and setting like the best ideas from Point Lookout and Dead Money? (Why wasn\u2019t this just the game??)\n\n\nUltimately, describing my experience with Fallout 4 would be like describing a visit to Disney World. The experiences are diverse and entralling. But, in the moment-to-moment? Well, when in Disney, you probably spend, like, 80% of your time bored, frustrated, or waiting in line. But, overall, did you have fun? Probably. That's why I have as many hours as I do in Fallout 4. Like how Tony Hawk's Proving Ground was still Tony Hawk, it's still Fallout. So, yeah, I recommend it.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he started to help me. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Yes, even those directions (and no, don't tell me about it).\n\nIt's also got settlement building, which I find extremely fun and nearly impossible to do in Skyrim.\n\nThere are arguments that Fallout 4 is more a First-Person Shooter (FPS) with Role-Playing Game (RPG) elements; and there's plenty of criticism for Bethesda's story-writing and plotting - and it's Bethesda, which means bugs-a-plenty - but I found it engaging for hundreds of hours.  \n\nIf you can get the GOTY version on sale, do so.

civilians defend themselves or join the bad guys. Fallout 4? No! You can't kill Preston. \nIn this game every character assumes you are a good person. Even when you join the institute. The faction that everyone is scared sh*tless of. I realized this when I read the paper piper types up about you at the end of the game. \n\n\"But perhaps the most compelling reason not to give up hope just yet is the fact that, if my sources are correct - and I know they are - the Institute is now under direct influence of someone many of us have already met - the Vault Dweller. That lonely figure who came into our settlement searching for a missing child, and clearly found something else entirely. And maybe, just maybe, the Institute is all the better for it.\" - Piper\n\nAnother issue I have with the story is the fact that In Fallout 3 you could find your father WITHOUT anyones help. In fallout 4 you cannot find Kellog or your baby until you find Nick the detective. Nick and Piper are way more forced onto you in the game and deserves some of the hate that Preston gets. At least you can do a complete playthrough without interacting with him. \n\nGameplay\n\n-Best in the 3d series. Fallout3/NV had so much janky movement it always felt like your characters was sliding across the map. \n\nVisuals\n\nThe lighting isn't as good as Skyrim. \nHorrible floating textures and precombines. The trash that is on the ground is 2D and glued to the floor. This is infuriating if you want to make a new clean looking settlement. If you try to use mod to remove trash there would be hole in the world......\n\nPerformance-\n\nEXTREMELY bad. I can run Red Dead Redemption 2 Ultra settings averaging 100fps @ 4k on my 3080/ti . Although I do get 144fps it can dip all the way down to 50fps in some areas. With maxed out settings. \nI have about 1000s hours in this game because Survival no death runs WAS extremely fun. It's trying to figure out what's gonna kill you and how to prevent it. \n\nP.S. You can't! This isn't Tamriel. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699649795, "timestamp_updated": 1699649795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149888178": {"recommendationid": "149888178", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998182222", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5201, "last_played": 1502925049}, "language": "english", "review": "About 12 hours of my playtime were from falling asleep with my PC on.

Sure, the dialogue isn't as rich as New Vegas's dialogue and the choices you make in F4 seem to have less of an impact than they did in FNV but the aforementioned elements aren't \"bad\" so to speak, they're just not as good as New Vegas's. So, if you've never played New Vegas before playing F4, you won't really feel like the story's really weak or lacking, nor is the dialogue. The factions are good, they each have their own unique ideologies and selling points in order to draw you in and, in my opinion, they're similar to New Vegas's factions in their uniqueness.\n\nAs for the gunplay and mechanics, they're the best in the Fallout franchise, obviously since F4 was released in 2015. So you won't be needing any hitmarker mods or recoil mods, the guns are visually well designed and their feedback and impact are on par with any other FPS released in 2015.\n\nAnd if you found Fallout 3's world to be too desolate or FNV's world too sparse (even though it's set in a desert), then you'll find Fallout 4's world and environment to be a quaint blend between feeling post-apocalyptic enough but not [i]too[/i] desolate and dead: you can always hear gunfights erupting in the distance, or a super mutant blowing himself up with a mini nuke at some Brotherhood of Steel squad with a supporting Vertibird hovering over the battlefield. Diamond City feels very comfy given how such a large number of people are making do in a baseball stadium, it's a nice concept. The world feels alive and you'll never know what you may run into after rounding a corner in the streets of downtown Boston.\n\nOverall, it's a great game and I would suggest you give it a try.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699559653, "timestamp_updated": 1699559653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149829060": {"recommendationid": "149829060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164577432", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1699338749}, "language": "english", "review": "Great if you like shooting stuff, bad if you like roleplaying and making choices.

[/h1]\n[h2] Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (5/5) [/h2]\n\n\n\nFallout 4 on Steam has been one of the most immersive and captivating gaming experiences I've had in recent years. From the moment I stepped out into the wasteland, it was clear that Bethesda had put an incredible amount of detail and effort into crafting this post-apocalyptic world.\n\nThe graphics are stunning, showcasing beautiful landscapes and highly-detailed environments. Exploring the vast open-world of the Commonwealth was a joy, with each location feeling unique and full of secrets waiting to be discovered. The attention to detail in every nook and cranny really adds to the sense of immersion and makes every moment feel like an adventure.\n\nThe game's story is equally engaging, with a compelling main questline that kept me hooked for hours on end. The character development system is well-designed, allowing me to customize my character and playstyle to suit my own preferences. The choices I made throughout the game had real consequences, further enhancing the depth and replayability of the narrative.\n\nCombat in Fallout 4 is incredibly satisfying. The gunplay feels tight and responsive, and the use of VATS (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) adds a strategic element to every encounter. The variety of weapons and modifications available allows for a diverse and personalized playstyle.\n\nOne of the standout features of Fallout 4 is the settlement-building system. Being able to construct and customize my own settlements, complete with farms, defenses, and even attracting new settlers, added a whole new layer of gameplay. It was incredibly satisfying to see my settlements thrive and evolve as I invested time and resources into developing them.\n\nOverall, Fallout 4 is a must-play for any fan of open-world RPGs or the Fallout series. It offers a vast, immersive world, a gripping story, satisfying combat, and countless hours of gameplay. \n\n\n\n[b] -To the world that was. Mankind shall never see its like again.

There are super mutants, ghouls, and these nasty Raiders who just wanna kill you, which sucks big time.\n\nBut it's not all bad \u2013 you get this cool Pip-Boy thing on your wrist, which is like a fancy wrist computer, and it helps you keep track of stuff and manage your gear. Plus, you can make friends with some cool companions, like Dogmeat, the loyal pup, or Nick Valentine, a synth detective who's pretty awesome.\n\nAnd the story, oh man, it's like a rollercoaster. You gotta choose sides and make some tough decisions, like, should you help the Brotherhood of Steel, or maybe side with the Railroad or the Institute? It's like being stuck between a Rockzilla and a hard place.\n\nSo, you fight, you explore, and you do a ton of stuff, all while trying to solve the mystery of where the heck your kid went.

Having poured over 500 hours into Fallout: New Vegas beforehand, there were many infuriating regressions and dumbed-down RPG mechanics. The main story of the Sole Survivor attempting to find their son in the ruins of the Commonwealth is sub-par, very few of your choices actually matter and the main gameplay additions feel incredibly superficial, adding nothing to the role-playing elements. If you're a Fallout purist,, you'll turn your nose up at so many elements; the depth, lore and strong writing of the older entries have all been thoroughly neutered.\n\nHowever, on a second run with mods installed and playing the game on its own terms, I found an addicting looter-shooter with plenty to like. If you don't rush through the main story and go through the regular cycle of exploring new areas, killing enemies and grabbing all the loot you can find, Fallout 4 does succeed. The gunplay has been tuned up considerably, the amount of customisation for your equipment (including the updated power armoured suits) is excellent and some companions do offer up a likeable personality (a rare thing for a Bethesda game). Despite the skills system being absorbed by the perk chart, there is still some room for differing play-styles as well; all of it takes place in a varied and interesting environment that ditches the flat terrain of the Capital Wasteland for more verticality.\n\nIn short, you shouldn't go into Fallout 4 demanding a serious RPG with tons of depth and complexity. Treat it like a toy sandbox you can play around in without worrying about consequences or deeper meaning and put it down when you're finished. The series may have gone downhill in recent years with 76 but this entry will still tide you over for a while.

They do not care about there games, they do not care about their customers they care about their money and nothing else and no tactic is too disgusting to protect those numbers. They've even broken laws in their marketing schemes in multiple cases with fallout 76 marketing alone. After all why would they bother making a new game worth playing when they could sell skyrim for the 50th time. After all 'It just works\". The fans care more about their games then the devs do it is a consistent pattern that fans are better at making patches for the games then Bethesda are themselves. This happened with skyrim, fallout 3, new Vegas, 4 and now starfeild. You will have to spend a week modding your game before you have an experience worth playing like I have and even then it will be buggy and glitch and freeze up. Even if you play without mods this is a problem because it's crappy code. Do yourself a favor and stop buying their games you're only hurting yourself even the game play in these games is unbalanced and completely broken beyond functionality with Bethesda never learning in spite of game after game is that meat tanks are not difficulty modifiers thy're just a pain in the butt. If all of this still has not convinced you to put away your wallet look up side by side comparisons of the graphics of skyrim special edition, fallout and even cyberpunk 2077 and all of them have better graphics than star field.

The stuff after the \"end of the game\" is still fun but feels like a grind at times. Pardon me for typing this in but the game somewhat feels like \"The Sims: Fallout edition\" after getting most of the story done. Even though i don't actually play Sims games and the settlement building for me is a nice extra, like a game within a game.\n\nI played this game when it came out and was very excited to play. I even changed the date and time or used Virtual Private Network on my computer, In order for me to play Fallout 4 as early as possible. \n\nMy first play-through was siding with the Institute because of family matters obviously in terms of the main character. Teleportation was neat but it didn't really do much but provide a cool effect when fast-traveling (I didn't notice if game time passes the same rate or not with or without teleportation). \n\nI didn't actually play much after numerous DLCs came out for Fallout 4. I played for a little while with a fresh new game, sometimes with modifications or no mods. Sometimes I would notice the new content but i was often unable to distinguish the DLC with non-DLC content which is a good thing. \n\nThis game sometimes makes you think of possible creative branches for your character's narrative or possible story outcomes for other characters. When it gets \"quite\" or there's a moment in your game-play where there's nothing much to do but to try and improve your gear, That's when (In my personal experience) it hits me or I think of 'Maybe if i did [x], then [y] would [z]. I would've had option [A] instead of [B]'.\n\nBecause of the paragraph above (Referring to the multiple possibilities and outcomes of player choices). Having multiple instances of play-through is definitely a must if you're into role-playing games. If you choose the alternative of which is playing for the story content , Then i suggest you save your game progress at moments where player choices are required.\n\nFortifying settlements is enjoyable, especially with DLC content. Each DLC is unique and each takes half or less time as the main story.", "timestamp_created": 1699343293, "timestamp_updated": 1699669406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Not sure what happened as I invested more than 20 hours into it and I loved every minute of it. In any case, I'm glad I finally managed to complete it this year with over 130 hours spent with the base game and its story-oriented DLC, Far Harbor.\n\n[b]The story[/b]\n\nThe start of the game is just superb. This time we start in the \"present\" and witness the nuclear blast itself (from a safe distance, of course) then we end up in a vault which will be our safe haven for many years to come but not in a way you'd think as we are put into stasis. We witness not only the murder of our wife but the kidnapping of our son. The objective is clear as we set out into the Commonwealth after waking up: locating our only next of kin once and for all.\n\n[b]The graphics[/b]\n\nThis is a sequel released many years after its predecessor so, as one could expect, the graphics look much better. But where [i]Fallout 4[/i] really shines is the colour palette itself. For me number 3 looked way too simplistic or dull (if I may). Number 4 finally shows us how an post-apocalyptic world can look like. \n\n[b]V.A.T.S. and weapon customisation[/b]\n\nThe targeting system was already great back then so this is something one can only enjoy here when it comes to combat. As for weapons: there are TONS of objects (materials) we can find that we can use for weapon customisation at benches. Some make the damage done greater but in certain cases we can change how the gun itself operates. Do you prefer a rapid-firing laser weapon instead of shooting one destructive beam? Off you go then! It's also fun modifying the many melee weapons available.\n\n[b]Post-apocalyptic Sims[/b]\n\nAn interesting part of the game that was a bit of a hit-and-miss for me. Factions return and the first group you meet are the Minutemen. You also go back to the starting position (where you used to live pre-war) to build your own settlement. Most of the objects you find can be scrapped for materials and even unnecessary parts of buildings can be immediately scrapped on the spot. \n\nThen you start putting down structures (a radio beacon will be important to attract fellow survivors) and even pieces of furniture inside houses (or in the open). As the people arrive you can assign them to help defend your settlement or start working on the fields (yes, you can have your own crops). This is an exciting part of the game but it can quickly become tedious. I wish scrapped materials were universally available across the many benches but this is not the case. \n\nPreston (from Minutemen) will regularly tell you what new group of people require your assistance and by completing these quests we'll get access to new posts and, consequently, their benches. Then, from time to time, we have to defend these outposts (not that anything bad happens if we fail such a quest). These quests are mainly good for exploration purposes so I decided to focus on the story and move on instead.\n\n[b]Factions and companions[/b]\n\nOnce again we have the opportunity to join various factions. This affects the ending and we have several we can get. I liked how the story wasn't black and white. While the Brotherhood of Steel wanted to look good there were many aspects of their approach I didn't like. The game gives you the option to meet the Minutemen first that represent the - sort of - neutral option. Here's an important piece of information as it is not obvious: you CAN join multiple factions later; quests for the others will still be available. If you have reached the point-of-no-return the game will notify you anyway. Don't be hesitant when the option to join is offered.\n\nAs for companions? We have many who comment on the actions we do or the decisions we make during a dialogue. This affinity meter can increase to a point where romance options open up and we can receive a special perk from our companion when maxed out. I can't really comment any further as I preferred Dogmeat from start to finish - your character is actually considered travelling alone this way so additional perks are available making you stronger. It's a wasteland and it's the end of the world already: I need no human beings, just a trustworthy pet as my only loyal friend (whose animations are superb).\n\n[b]What else?[/b]\n\nThe game has tons of places to explore. You even find points of interest outside the boundaries of the map. Mutants, ghouls and deathclaws return and we now have a lot of androids (synths) as enemies. Animal parts can be cooked which is a must for additional effects and radiation elimination. There are many recipes not just for cooking but also for making our own chemicals.\n\nI loved this game. After a while I felt weaker but with additional perks (around level 25-30) you can become pretty strong so much so that almost nothing will pose a challenge. It should also be noted that there isn't really a cap level so feel free to pick any perk you like. \n\nFallout 4 is still a fresh experience for me. I loved the exploration part and I preferred ditching any companion for Dogmeat - it was just us out in the wasteland exploring long-hidden vaults and completing multiple missions for any allies we could get to know. I tried only a couple of radio stations to listen to and only for a short period of time - not even songs could save me from the preferred loneliness. Thus, I recommend you the same loneliness in the wasteland of Commonwealth.", "timestamp_created": 1699307810, "timestamp_updated": 1699307828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852552413940429688", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149671620": {"recommendationid": "149671620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111908956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3040, "last_played": 1597263226}, "language": "english", "review": "Mods!", "timestamp_created": 1699304967, "timestamp_updated": 1699304967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149670751": {"recommendationid": "149670751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083227612", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 226, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1700633014}, "language": "english", "review": "the action rpg of all time", "timestamp_created": 1699303899, "timestamp_updated": 1699303899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149670238": {"recommendationid": "149670238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059338581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 5009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5009, "last_played": 1699302924}, "language": "english", "review": "Massively regret waiting so long to play it.

The story is forgettable at best, the side quests are honestly better, and I personally have fun establishing the minutemen and a whole network of settlements. I'd love to see future Fallout games mix New Vegas and 4 together, and although 4 is one of the more divisive games in the franchise, I think everyone should give this game a shot if they haven't already, and I'll be replaying this game until Fallout 5 (so 2077).", "timestamp_created": 1699243222, "timestamp_updated": 1699243222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149628051": {"recommendationid": "149628051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880290863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1554, "last_played": 1692573478}, "language": "english", "review": "i love sex mod", "timestamp_created": 1699239370, "timestamp_updated": 1699239370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149626735": {"recommendationid": "149626735", "author": {"steamid": "76561199194897020", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 228, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1699631311}, "language": "english", "review": "l", "timestamp_created": 1699237066, "timestamp_updated": 1699237066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149626430": {"recommendationid": "149626430", "author": {"steamid": "76561199481911830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1700439288}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1699236504, "timestamp_updated": 1699236504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149626287": {"recommendationid": "149626287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067280386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 13312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13312, "last_played": 1694728254}, "language": "english", "review": "I was PROFOUNDLY disappointed with this game when it first came out.

Or rather I used to love it in the past. That's why I wanted to replay it. \n\nI don't know what is up with this copy. I have to constantly shut it down because the game isn't responding. Sometimes there is a cut scene and afterwards my controls aren't responding. I started keeping the task manager open on a second monitor. And I recommend you do too until you are sure that your PC isn't affected. At one point I couldn't even open the manager. So this way I can at least prevent a hard shut down.\n\nI am sorry to post this. It is a great game and I love it. I don't even know how many hours I have been sinking in to this game in the past. \nIt is just not operational on my PC at the moment. I do have a Razor Huntsman TKL keyboard so nothing out of the usual for a gamer. So I wonder where the problem is. I might dial everything down as I am only sporting a 1660 Super out of protest for recent GPU pricing. But I am not sure it will help, I don't think it is the graphics but I keep wondering what else might cause the disturbance. Over all this PC is a lot stronger than the last one we had (except for the GPU but as said that's political). All the other games and applications are working fine. They did so for more then a year.

Though I have to admit the gameplay is still true to the original series just- I guess you could say underwhelming at best even with the newest engine used. You do have a vast world to explore on a certain degree but you know, your character level of course limits you but not that highly. There's old guns returning from Fallout 3 and New Vegas and some new. I mean it's Fallout, there's not much to say other than it being the same old fashioned example. However...\n\nThere's a lot to grasp where there's bugs and side hiccups on the table: the main course here is voice acting along with lots of selections. But be advised the choices in this game are way more narrowed and linear. It almost makes you dislike it with shame cause really they're not bad and not great either. You'd wish they sounded a bit more like pretty much any older entries of the games. Because A. choices sound too lifeless and make less impact how you progress and no matter how you act it's gonna sound same and B. with voice acting combined it sounds too robotic and soulless. Yes, I know there's lots of dialogue and recordings went into making these but my god does it hurt to know that some of it does no impact what-so-ever. And don't get me started on the biggest highlight of this game, the construction and sandbox mode.\nYou're very limited at start but once specific perks are obtained it's so plain easy to build whatever you want. It's basically your own Sim City example but feels way too boring and overused. Why overused, you may ask?\nIt's used in main story and DLC stories. It's enforced in which is the most disliked example to put it. I don't hate it but it's just so unnecessary thing to put into the game. It DOES give your settlers inside your area for interactions and all but I swear I get no satisfaction value from it. It's very optional for a gimmick both for free sandbox use and well annoying standards to force it in to the main story. Oh and highest difficulty is a bigger bullet sponge experience than in older games. Don't get me wrong, plot and story has its own uniqueness and I appreciate it. But it's way toned down and tries to copy out Fallout: New Vegas with the choice of 4 endings and siding with four factions. It's not bad for replayability value but like I said it feels undertone at best. Feels less rewarding for getting any ending than in older series.\n\nOh and DLCs, they're good. They have exotic looks, story, newer enemies and some guns to display. Although it's same deal to what I said above. At least some characters return from older games so that's a plus.\n\nIn all honesty Fallout 4 is not a bad bad entry for the series. It just could've become more if Todd Howard wasn't self obsessed with rushing things and lying but we all know how it goes. But really, take this game for a ride when it's on sale. If it suits you, it suits you if not then don't bother.

The Dlcs where a very mixed bag of \u2018Alright\u2019 to \u2018Why you do this?\u2019\nFallout New Vegas, not flawless but pretty damn good and kept more towards the originals than 3 did with a more complex story and better built area. Dlcs were also pretty good.\nFallout 4 has some good points but overall is just an entry better off skipped with a brief summary than actually played vanilla. \nWhile it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve played the story and haven\u2019t touched most of the dlcs yet there are reasons for it. Short handed reasons: They ruined the designs of guns by making them left-handed and having a modification mechanic that shouldn\u2019t exist as it is, would\u2019ve taken different types of each ammo instead of needing to put a stock on a rifle. The plot was way too shallow and uninteresting with its factions and characters, also suffered from the \u201cOverpowered MC issue\u201d that wasn\u2019t handled well. Building mechanic, the way it was added just played into the \u201cOverpowered MC issue\u201d and helped ruin the game. And overall, the experience was far more draining than previous and future entries. (Yes, fallout 76 was more bearable to play since there were friends to play with; doesn\u2019t mean 76 was or is good, it very much isn\u2019t, but that should give a pretty good idea of what it was like playing this game.)\nWill mention that I don\u2019t believe that the ability to mod a game makes it suddenly a good game, I believe games should be played vanilla for their first playthrough and judged on that. Mods can make any game good, but it cant fix the foundation of a game being bad, thus the bad review. \nWill I be going back to the game to finish the dlcs? Probably, just to get them done. Going back to replay the story? It took me numerous days, 6+ hours alone as of the day I\u2019m writing this to boot the game back up to see if my save file was still there\u2026 so very unlikely.\n\nWays they could\u2019ve fixed the issues in my opinion:\nStory: While it\u2019s just the reverse plot of Fallout 3 taking place in that one area mentioned from that one side quest in Rivet City. It could\u2019ve been much better if they had made it more mysterious, hinting at the existence of the \u2018main bad guy\u2019 instead of bluntly throwing them at the player. Also, could\u2019ve made the reason behind what they were doing more morally complex (been a while so don\u2019t fully remember but it was just meh from what my memory tells me). Example of how the devs could\u2019ve hinted at their existence: have people in the player\u2019s settlement slowly be replaced over the course of the beginning search and have the player\u2019s settlers mention how some people seem different so it forces the player to keep an eye on them, leading to ways to further the overall plot. Plenty of other plot points that would need fixing and plenty of characters that could\u2019ve been way more interesting. (Quick rant about characters, why they gotta treat Arthur Maxson like a personal OC that\u2019s way too overpowered for his own good)\nPower Armor: Fallout 3 don\u2019t get training till the end of the game or by doing a dlc. Fallout NV, work for power armor either through the BoS or the Enclave with interesting side quest that aren\u2019t required for the main story (Kinda on the BoS one). Fallout 4 took the idea of powerful military grade armor and defenestrated it and just gave it to the player in the opening act and made it a constant for the entire game\u2026 Personally, just wish they didn\u2019t touch power armor and had it as a reward for a hidden/difficult side quest like breaking into a military base, but cant use it until trained by someone you have to find. Or could\u2019ve just have it so the player character was a mechanic for Power Armor suits but wasn\u2019t trained to use one, so they find them throughout the waste and collect parts to build their own and hunt down an old army buddy to learn how to use it, maybe one of the factions would have a dude to train them.\nWeapons: modification mechanic sacrificed weapon design and \u201crealistic\u201d functionality for something that didn\u2019t need to be complex at all. A lot of the weapon designs are disappointing (Looking at you Assault rifle, tube having waste of space), and for some reason all of them are meant for left-handed shooters. They really could\u2019ve just kept the ammo complexity from Fallout NV and added some modifications like silencers, different mag types, etc. without making all the weapons look beyond stupid by taking off components.  (Fun fact rant about 76 that I believe is also in 4, the Light machine gun requires both a stock and a certain part around the front of the barrel to function\u2026 and they decided to make that locked behind modifications; so basically, they made the gun completely useless in its default form.)\nSettlements: As it was implemented, just ruined fallout 4 for me. It plays into the \u201cOverpowered MC issue\u201d by making them a master builder while also being a master in just about everything else. It would\u2019ve been so much better leaving that mechanic to a settler, let the player create a blueprint somewhere and provide materials to said NPC settler and have them build it over the course of in game days (More NPCs the faster it goes). The settlers feel completely useless and such a system would\u2019ve fixed it, giving them different jobs to manage and build the settlements would make the \u201crestoration of the wasteland\u201d feel more whole, instead of one person doing all the work for the Commonwealth.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698987076, "timestamp_updated": 1698987076, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

of painful accuracy like STALKER.\n\u2022 A dedication to patch the game when it released in rough shape.\n\u2022 Fun gameplay mechanics and a sense of actually rebuilding the world, thanks to

Each feels separate from the gameplay and Far Harbor is often skipped because of that.\n\u2022 Creation Club never released as a Season or Collected Bundle.

The story is deeply engaging, adding even more depth to the Fallout universe.\n\nWhat truly sets Fallout 4 apart from its predecessors is the innovative building system, introducing a whole new dimension to the game. Now, you can create and customize your own headquarters, giving you even more control over your experience. It's incredibly fun to watch your headquarters evolve.\n\nFallout 4 is not only a must-have for any fan of the series, but it will also appeal to RPG and open-world enthusiasts in general.

For starters some of the pipe weapons don't have functional designs, the assault rifle should be classified as a light machine gun due to its size, for some reason all the guns are meant for left handed people despite the player character being right handed, Diamond City is far too underpopulated to be called a city (my average unmodded settlements could house roughly the same number of people and in \"better\" conditions too) nevermind that realistically the stands and underneath the stands should have been where much of the proper \"city\" was built while the field should have been solely farm/park space, few buildings would have been left standing after 210 years, and the story itself is rather mediocre (also why can't I change the policies of the Institute despite becoming the director?). Gameplay itself is quite fun and I am one of the few people apparently who likes the whole settlement building part (what's not to love about being a benevolent dictator?), however it can get even better through the usage of mods. Now this game has a very large mod compatibility as thousands of them can be found with over 43,000 alone being on Nexus with over 1.3 billion downloads worldwide. Of course me personally the several mods that I have are for the most part lore friendly since I obviously want to still be playing a Fallout game but with various features to enhance certain things where I find lackluster vanilla wise or perhaps as an extra fun addition, though there are tons of non lore friendly mods out there if that is more or less your thing.

The voiced protagonist basically takes away the general role playing feeling Bethesda was known for. You're playing the character with a missing kid and dead spouse and because of the set up, you never really feel like you're playing your own character. The companions are finally compelling, but they're also tied so hard into the story line that you can't really do anything meaningful with them that strays too far outside of the story path. The world is better, but they do such weird things with the sense of scale that it's never convincing in the way it could or should be. The story is yet another in a long line of poorly written stories that sadly Bethesda has become known for. The BOS ending basically is just a rip off and remix of Fallout 3, the Railroad are comically bad and never really give much of a reason for their pro-synth stance other than it just being there, the Minutemen don't even really have much of their own story beyond having to rebuild because they were such failures the first time, and the Institute is so poorly written that nothing they do makes any sense compared to what they say, or their stated \"goals\" which also contradict their actions. I have a character that runs the Institute and I still really have no clue what they're trying to do or why they go about what they say they want to do the way that they do it. So what's good about this game? The settlement system is a great concept, but poorly executed, and the combat isn't bad anymore. It's not good, but it isn't as awful as it was in Fallout 3. Overall, a poor experience with obvious cut content around every corner, a nonsensical story, graphics that always put Bethesda games in a AA category despite them making AAA money, and a main character that's about as interesting as a glass of ice water. Not worth it for more than a few dollars.

Yet, one can't help but be drawn into its post-apocalyptic world, where choices are rarely clear-cut, and humour often shines through the gloom.\n\nThe game's RPG elements may not be as deep as some franchise fans hoped, and the decent story doesn't match up to the quality seen in earlier Fallout titles. But for all its flaws, Fallout 4 has one undeniable virtue\u2014fun. The shooter mechanics are solid, the open world is expansive, and the atmosphere is quintessentially Fallout. Even without VATS, the game manages to deliver satisfying gunplay and exploration.\n\nIt's also a game where you can't escape the lure of modding. With a vibrant modding community constantly churning out new content, Fallout 4 can be transformed into a more rewarding experience, rectifying many of its issues and opening up endless possibilities.\n\nThe graphics may need to be top-tier by today's standards, and the occasional bug is par for the course with a Bethesda title. But these minor inconveniences fade when you immerse yourself in a vast wasteland with countless stories to discover.\n\nThe verdict? Fallout 4 is a game that isn't without its flaws, but it's a game that, much like the post-apocalyptic survivors it portrays, keeps on going. The colourful world, diverse companions, and the lure of mods make it a game worth revisiting, especially if you're a fan of the Fallout universe.", "timestamp_created": 1698745171, "timestamp_updated": 1698745171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149238945": {"recommendationid": "149238945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343083354", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1471, "playtime_at_review": 16178, "last_played": 1700721998}, "language": "english", "review": "is a bethesda game", "timestamp_created": 1698739628, "timestamp_updated": 1698739628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149238007": {"recommendationid": "149238007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198950865086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1698752206}, "language": "english", "review": "Loot and Shoot Fallout <3", "timestamp_created": 1698737556, "timestamp_updated": 1698737556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149237696": {"recommendationid": "149237696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057795149", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 46919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 507, "playtime_at_review": 46065, "last_played": 1699942906}, "language": "english", "review": "Without Mods:\n\nFallout 1 & 2: Best writing, dated environments, extremely quirky gameplay.\nFallout 3 & NV: Good writing and environments, slightly clunky gameplay.\nFallout 4: Just right.\nStarfield: Horrendously bad writing and copy/paste environments, modern gameplay.\nElder Scrolls 6: After FO76 and Starfield, it looks like Bethesda will do to ES what Disney did to SW.\n\nWith Mods:\n\nFallout 3&NV: There are finished DLC sized overhaul mods.\nFallout 4:  There exist WIP DLC sized mods and numerous regular mods.\nStarfield:  Good mods take time, and right now modders are handicapped by upcoming patches, a lack of a creation kit, and the usual bugginess.

It's not horrible, but when you can't really build your own story around it, that's going to be more apparent.\n-New SPECIAL system replacing skills with Perk levels removes another layer of character stat customization\n-DON'T GIVE US A FULL SUIT OF POWER ARMOR THAT EARLY INTO THE GAME, BETHESDA\n-It can be hard to find a good difficulty level: Lower difficulties can result in you chewing thru enemies, higher levels can turn them into sponges, and Survival places extra limitations that some players won't enjoy\n\nThe Posititives:\n-Sarcastic Dialogue options are Spider-Man worthy banter\n-Weapon and Armor modifications give you a lot of freedom.\n-Genuinely funny sidequests all throughout the Commonwealth\n-Settlement Building can be genuinely fun\n-Gunplay, while still not realistic, feels quite good overall, and is generally a major upgrade from 3 and New Vegas\n-Dogmeat is the goodest of boys. The other companions are fun, too, I guess, but Dogmeat tho\n-Survival Difficulty, while brutal, does a good job of making the Commonwealth feel like a genuinely dangerous place\n-You now have a reason to hoard all of that junk you find\n\n\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a WRPG like the older Fallouts, you won't find as much of that here, but you will STILL find a fun game. Play it as more of an action-adventure game with RPG and crafting elements blended in.\n\nNote: If you intend to use Mods on this game, make sure to follow a guide like \"The Midnight Ride\" so you don't create glitchy results. My personal no 1 recommendation would be a mod to make DogMeat not count to the companion limit, which was the original plan during development", "timestamp_created": 1698675122, "timestamp_updated":

Vanilla Fallout 4 is average at best, well then you get to nuka world... oh my... Bad, so bad.\n\nI love the fallout IP, the setting, visual theme, vault boy/imagery.  So yeah i dig the 1960s atomic age punk whatever. The map itself has some great little spots, It still captured some of that Bethesda magic in simple wandering/exploration/Discovery. The world building was pretty good, some assets were pretty good, almost nice and it was an OK shooter looter.... but thats about it.. \n\nThe story ahhh... well lets just say unless your heavily invested in the backstory/narrative slapping you in the face you end up playing as the worlds worst husband/father. The writing/voice acting was quite bad in almost all instances, those companions oof...\n\nThe game is a technical shit show, visually and with its mechanics, consistency in its systems is almost non existent, like nobody knows what resolute means... Example of lazy/unfinished design, the armor layering. There are countless outfits in the game and a small hand full has the ability to have armor layed over top. You can wear that dirty as long-johns under your armor but not that spiffy suit, are you mad sir? Its not the bulk of said outfit or anything logical for the most part, they just stopped adding attach points (Bone Data) to clothing at an arbitrary point.\n\nI literally used the XEdit tool (Mad Props to the xedit team) to copy Bone Data from other similar outfits onto the ones missing it, and its perfectly functional, imagine having access to there tools in development and just not bothering. This type of thing persists through every facet of this game and every other, like boy they really struggle with how much things weigh.... basic stuff, baby town frollicks.\n\nThere is no apparent focus, or i can only imagine they must split up individually, all work on a different segment of a system and or mechanic in complete isolation from one another, then probably at the half way point they just take what they each have and kinda cobble it together...\n\nThe technology *cough*, Inner workings, game systems and mechanics ARE NOT!! always just inherently enjoyable by themselves...or half done, smashed together...yesh. They are generally there to support, like ya know, important stuff... things like World building, Story/Narrative, Meaning and connection, Interaction, Emotion, Purpose...  Its like they are Poppy from Mythic Quest (minus her genius and charm)  in the scene where she realises she \"doesn't see it\" \"Im a glorified mechanic\" she says. She doesn't even see fun like a normal person, she builds systems but has no insight on how to pull them together in coherently enjoyable ways - Someone at the top has some bad un-diagnosed ADHD, no like seriously, in a not funny, its destructive and disruptive to my life kind of way.\n\nSo why the insane hours you say? Its obvious, Mods. The sheer talent in the modding community boggles my mind, they take something so half baked and janky and just pull it together. It great once you can get things  to work, consistently and fix glaring oversights and visual laziness.  So thank you Beth for the \"framework\" and some decent assets, but please kindly fuck off and get on you knees and thank the modding community for allowing you to exist this long. Oh and MS should give the IP back to Obsidian.\n\nWith this, then Fallout 76 and now Starfield/Starfail/Nahfield you pick, I think its honestly time for the modders to move on, stop dragging this ragged sad company any further. They dont deserve your talent or your time. Connect with each other, pool your resources and talent and just make your own games, let Bethesda die in all there pants crapping glory because Bethesda.......

If you're a console player looking to buy this on a PC it is worth it. Fallout 4 on PC has better modding capabilities, better graphics, and more freedom. Most mods are created on PC and ported to console which causes bugs and glitches, on PC most of the mods aren't ported so they run better or aren't glitchy. PCs are usually more powerful than consoles so the graphics and frame rate end up improving drastically.

It's like a mix of Mad Max and The Sims, with a dash of radiation poisoning to keep things interesting.\n\nNow, the story kicks off with the typical \"Hey, I'm just an ordinary suburbanite\" scenario, but within minutes, you find yourself frozen in cryostasis, your spouse murdered, and your baby kidnapped. And just when you think life couldn't get any worse, the world ends in nuclear fire. It's the kind of day that makes Monday mornings feel like a spa day.\n\nBut then, you wake up in the ruins of Boston, and it's your job to make the Commonwealth great again, one mutated creature and rusty tin can at a time. And what's the best way to do that? Well, by hoarding every piece of junk you find, of course!\n\nFallout 4's crafting system is like a post-apocalyptic Pinterest board. You'll collect everything from coffee cups to toy cars, break them down into raw materials, and use them to build settlements that look like they were designed by a deranged interior decorator. If you're not sure what I mean, try building a house with an exploding car chandelier and a toilet that's mysteriously placed on the ceiling. It's a work of art, really.\n\nBut it's not all about home improvement. You've got a whole wasteland to explore, filled with ghouls, super mutants, and an endless supply of raiders who clearly didn't pay attention in shooting school. Oh, and don't forget the Deathclaws \u2013 they're like T-Rexes on steroids, and running into one is basically a game of \"Can I outrun this before I become lunch?\"\n\nThen there's the iconic Power Armor, which is like having your very own mini-mech suit. You'll feel like Iron Man, but with a bit more rust and a lot less charm. And nothing says \"I'm here to kick butt and scavenge junk\" like stomping around in one of these bad boys.\n\nOf course, let's not forget the companions \u2013 each with their own quirks and baggage. They're like a post-apocalyptic therapy group that follows you around. Piper, the sassy reporter, loves to uncover the truth, while Nick Valentine, the synth detective, has a heart of gold (or at least circuits of gold). And then there's Dogmeat, your loyal canine companion who can carry an entire arsenal in his invisible backpack. Who's a good boy? Dogmeat, that's who!\n\nIn a nutshell, Fallout 4 is the kind of game that makes you feel like a true survivor, a junk-collecting, mutant-fighting, settlement-building legend. It's a world where you'll encounter bizarre characters, make morally ambiguous choices, and laugh in the face of radioactive danger. So, grab your Pip-Boy, load up your Laser Musket, and get ready for a post-apocalyptic adventure that's as entertaining as it is irradiated. Welcome to the Commonwealth, Vault Dweller.

I just met him and the whole intro segment was slow and tedious,) all characters can use all weapons and armor, VATS is still OP unless your agility is really low, and power armor getting handed to you for free at the beginning just feels like Bethesda wanted a \"WOW\" factor and couldn't think of anything better.\n\nI mean, Bethesda and other mod-heavy games get a big free pass for being moddable, which really isn't something that a dev should get away with.

My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor.

It was a ton of fun to play, and I was so excited when I was finally able to get a hold of FO4 (Now with voice acting!). So yeah, I had semi high hopes that I would enjoy this just like the others...except I didn't. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it had some amazing moments! I loved the level design especially. I'm not sure of the proper word, but the vertical level design (how enemies could shoot at you from on top of buildings, bridges, etc.) was really cool and made things feel more action packed. I was loved the graphics. Although the game is almost 10 years old, it still looks amazing. I really like how much variety there is in character creation, since you can add burns, scars, freckles, wrinkles, anything. I changed my hair/scars throughout the story to reflect how the commonwealth is effecting my character. The companions are great as well, with most being romancable. \n\nThe part that really made this otherwise great game bland was the lack of RPG elements. Sometimes what you say doesn't matter. The best example of this was when I told someone that I did not want to do their quest, yet it was added to my quest log anyway. What I love about RPGs is that I feel like I have an impact on the world around me and with FO4 I just didn't. Some of the quests were interesting (my fave involved a ship, a mother deathclaw, and a comic book character) but a ton can be summarized with go to this area, clear out the mirelurks/ghouls/supermutants/raiders,etc. than come back. Which is fine but it would have been nice if they spiced it up a little more. \n\nBut worse of all, was the ending. It seems no matter what you do, you get a generic slideshow about how the commonwealth has changed you. I have over 300 hours in this game (including DLCs) so I didn't expect for them to mention everything I did but at least say something.

It's like enjoying a McDonalds burger, you know its poor quality, poorly made, you know its not actually a great burger (or a great RPG in this case), its a cheap facsimile of what a burger is, designed for mass appeal and to generate money, yet my brain still likes one from time to time anyway.  I enjoyed my first playthrough of this game (heavily modded) in 2015-2016 too.\n\nNow trying to replay Fallout 4 for the first time in about 6 years, the game is just a buggy PoS. The game's performance on a 3080 TI, Ryzen 7, 32gb ram is sub-40 fps at only 1440p. God rays settings in the launcher don't save, so I have to open 2 ini files to just make those options work, because this is too complex a concept for Bethesda Game Studios and their over 2 decades of PC port experience. (I hear god rays crash RTX users, so I have to brute force them off that way. They also used to tank the framerate when they actually functioned before by like 20 to 40 fps). \n\nIntroducing just 6 or so mods just makes the game crash for no reason even though they all worked before for a several minutes, then after reseting the game and altering nothing, the game crashes once the game world is loaded and is unplayble. (after my 17 years of modding TES4&5, and Fallout 3&NV and not struggling with those at all.) The StartingConsoleCommand's break once you use F4SE, the feature just stops working and you need F4SE for mods. The anti-aliasing looks like vasiline is smeared on the monitor, real humans from BGS added it in and thought it looked just great.\n\nFallout: New Vegas makes this game look like a 6 year old's first grade art project. Play FO:NV instead, BGS cannot write good lore, make satisfying RPG mechanics like unique skill checks, or write good dialogue or characters. Seriously gotta stop supporting BGS, they're shockingly incompetent at PC ports, as well as core RPG game design too. They make shallow and technically broken garbage, just aiming for mass appeal and mass profits, while not knowing anything about how to make a good RPG.

Bethesda is a terrible, greedy company. The game also has minimal replayability since you're forced to be this mother (or father) looking for their kidnapped son. There's minimal roleplaying options because the game forces you to be this character. In Skyrim, you were the dragonborn, but you could have been a thief, a wizard, or anything else you can imagine. In Fallout NV, you were the courier, but you could have chosen to be good or bad, or ignore your quest completely. In this game, you have no choice but to roleplay as a parent, and half of the dialogue options force you into being a \"good\" person. The dialogue system itself is terrible, since you have only four options to choose from and you need to guess what your character will actually say, since the dialogue prompt is incredibly short and sometimes the options are as simple as \"yes\", \"no\", \"more information\", and \"sarcastic\". Without mods, this game is fun maybe one time. If it weren't for the modding community I would have never touched it again.

DLCs are mediocre apart from Far Harbor.\n\nRecommend buying during a sale & if there is nothing better to play.\n\n[h1]FULL REVIEW[/h1]\nA quick note about me and this review - I enjoy fully completing games and all of its achievements. After experiencing everything the developers have released for the consumer, I only then write my opinion about the game.\n\n[h1]STORY:[/h1]\nThe start of the game creates the right atmosphere through the events that happen, and after an hour or so, the story becomes quite shallow. Only at the end does it pick up and depending on your choices, ends abruptly.\n\nIn most dialogue encounters, you, the player, have four dialogue options to choose from that create the illusion that you're in control of the final outcome, while in reality, although it does have an effect, the final destination is linear. I understand this saves a lot of development time, but I do wish you were punished more for making wrong, different, or stupid decisions. \n\nThere are a lot of side quests in this game that have their own little stories that are completely detached from the main story and some that are connected in non-influential ways.\n\nDuring my playtime, I ran into a good few quests, including main story ones, that I couldn't progress without using console commands to fix them.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\nA lot of content that also feels... useless.\n\nCombat is a double-edged sword - there is a lot to it, but it is also simply there to waste your time. Enemies are bullet sponges depending on your difficulty, tons of different guns & attachments that are not really worth picking up, and legendaries are bonkers OP, making other equipment worthless.\n\nV.A.T.S. seemed like an unnecessary addition to the game, but this might just be me, and a good half of the unlockable perks were either very weak or straight-up useless.\n\nThe world is vast and full of loot, so exploration can be fun for the first ten or twenty hours, afterward becoming quite dull. In some cases, loot distribution made no sense (i.e. caps can be found in locations that haven't been accessed post-war).\n\nQuests are repetitive fetch quests for the most part, and with the core game being quite big, they are everywhere. Even those that are different in idea still share the similar process of going somewhere, killing enemies, scouting, and locating objective tasks.\n\nMods (like with any Bethesda game) fix many issues and create a better overall experience, so here's a short list of mods I wouldn't even bother playing the game without:\n\n[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9424]Place Everywhere[/url] \nAllows you to build settlements without ridiculous restrictions, turning this aspect of the game from being frustrating and uninteresting to one of the better parts of the game.\n\n[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44798]High FPS Physics Fix[/url]\nDoes a lot of things, but primarily removes the FPS cap of 60, making the game run at an enjoyable framerate.\n\n[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12465]Achievements[/url]\nRe-enables Steam achievements if you decide to use any mods.\n\n[h1]ADDITIONAL CONTENT:[/h1]\nMost of the DLCs added additional stuff to build, craft, or play with, but in terms of the interesting storytelling, quests, and atmosphere, Far Harbor was the only DLC worth playing.\n\nNuka World was the least enjoyable one for me, as it felt to me like the most developer-to-player detached content. Forced to play evil path if you want to see the quests and other content, while also creating achievements that make me believe the developers don't play their own game and just put random requirement numbers in.\n\n[h1]ACHIEVEMENTS:[/h1]\nQuite a big portion of the achievements will be unlocked by simply playing through the game and completing quests. There are, however, a few that will require you to either start a new playthrough or load a quite early save. \n\nLike many other games, there are some achievements that are very specific in requirements but are not difficult to achieve.", "timestamp_created": 1697820127, "timestamp_updated": 1697885685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148546262": {"recommendationid": "148546262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127227034", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 34636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34401, "last_played": 1699204239}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games ever made, there are a few bugs here and there that spoil things a bit but it's tolerable, the other thing that could have been done was to make the dlc more related to the main story, but it's not a big problem, but overall it's 9/10 for me :)", "timestamp_created": 1697815309, "timestamp_updated": 1697815993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148544296": {"recommendationid": "148544296", "author": {"steamid": "76561199387464380", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4981, "last_played": 1699142821}, "language": "english", "review": "a post", "timestamp_created": 1697813192, "timestamp_updated": 1697813192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148537239": {"recommendationid": "148537239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120982243", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15754, "last_played": 1698415134}, "language": "english", "review": "Had a fantastic time with literally everything except the main plot. 10/10 would make endless settlements and avoid all radiant or main plot quests like the plague again.", "timestamp_created": 1697805000, "timestamp_updated": 1697805000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148537193": {"recommendationid": "148537193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130964189", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 26825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25113, "last_played": 1698339034}, "language": "english", "review": "Peace is never an option", "timestamp_created": 1697804913, "timestamp_updated": 1697804913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148536384": {"recommendationid": "148536384", "author": {"steamid": "76561199096523960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2271, "last_played": 1689108236}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh, Fallout 4! Where do I even begin? It's like a post-apocalyptic wonderland that's as charming as a two-headed radstag. The vanilla game itself is a masterpiece, a veritable buffet of irradiated delights. You've got everything from super mutants to deathclaws, and let's not forget the ever-lovable Preston Garvey with his endless supply of settlements that need your help. \n\nThe main storyline? Oh, it's a rollercoaster of emotions. One minute you're a happy suburban parent, the next you're frozen in time, only to wake up in a world that's been nuked back to the Stone Age. And let's not forget about the Institute. Ah, the Institute, my home sweet home. Some people might call them the bad guys, but hey, who wouldn't want to live in a clean, high-tech utopia away from all the dirt and radiation?\n\nBut where Fallout 4 really shines is its modding community. These folks are like the magical elves of the gaming world. They take an already amazing game and turn it into something extraordinary. Want to turn your power armor into Iron Man's suit? There's a mod for that. Want to replace all deathclaws with Thomas the Tank Engine? There's a mod for that too. The possibilities are endless!\n\nAnd let me tell you, choosing the Institute was the best decision I ever made. Sure, they might be a little morally ambiguous, but who cares when you've got teleportation and synths? Plus, their cafeteria has the best Blamco Mac & Cheese in the Commonwealth.\n\nIn conclusion, Fallout 4 is like a radroach-infested diamond in the rough. It's beautiful, it's terrifying, and it's utterly addictive. And if you'll excuse me, I need to go now. My ever-growing R&D department needs funding and apparently saving the Commonwealth doesn't pay well.

I was skeptical of Fallout 3, but it turned out to be pretty fun.  I was perhaps even more skeptical of Fallout 4.  A relative gifted it to me when they found out that I hadn't played it yet.  It's been almost a decade since then, and I've dropped a lot of playtime in it.\n\nGiven the number of hours I've put into Fallout 4, I'd probably have to put it somewhere in my top 10.  It's odd, though, because Fallout 4 comes up short in a lot of places.  The role-playing is not very deep, too many of the quests are a bit simplistic and have only one solution, and the dialogue trees have been simplified to the point where you're mostly just saying \"yes\" or \"no\".  The world can be surprisingly responsive to your choices, but, especially in the main quest, you're railroaded through a quest without many options.  Despite these problems, it's is just so much fun to play that I often don't care.\n\nPart of it is the open world exploration.  No matter how much they might stumble in other areas, Bethesda is quite good at this.  Part of it is the combat.  Whether you go in guns blazing, sneak in and line up your shots with a scope, or go tactical with VATS, it's fun.  Part of it is the endless crafting and customization, which extend to almost everything in the game.  The game is also quite funny.  Even as I sometimes cursed the limited dialogue options, I often enjoyed the black humor and amusing things my character said.\n\nDo you like loot?  Fallout 4 has mountains of loot.  Hauling all that stuff back to a settlement you established and outfitting your settlers in godlike gear is great fun.  Finally, you have something to do with all your spare loot.  Yeah, the whole \"defend your settlement from raiders\" mechanic can get tedious when it interrupts your gameplay, but there are few things more awesome than seeing your settlers blow away mutated monsters with a minigun.\n\nThe game is often a bit on the easy side, but the highest difficulty turns the game into a fun survival-like experience where you have to find food, water, and shelter.  This introduces new gameplay elements and keeps things fresh.  It's a bit scary at first to play a Bethesda game with quick saves disabled, but Fallout 4 is pretty stable.\n\nFallout 4 is a great choice if you're looking for something a bit casual and streamlined that still has recognizable role-playing elements.  Fallout 4 is a different experience than the isometric Fallout games, which can be frustrating at times, but if you get over that, it's quite enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1697747506, "timestamp_updated": 1697747506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148506467": {"recommendationid": "148506467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198431990258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8044, "last_played": 1697747170}, "language": "english", "review": "Cito like game.", "timestamp_created": 1697747292, "timestamp_updated": 1697747292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148504016": {"recommendationid": "148504016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283006088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 12603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12365, "last_played": 1699159209}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've played.

This exploration will delve into the numerous shortcomings of the base game while highlighting the incredible transformation it undergoes when paired with mods. Fallout 4, despite its issues, has been revived and rejuvenated by a passionate modding community that has turned this flawed gem into a shining masterpiece.\n\nBefore we delve into the incredible world of mods that have revitalized Fallout 4, it's important to discuss the significant flaws that plagued the vanilla game upon release. These flaws encompass various aspects, from graphics and performance to storytelling and role-playing elements.\n\nOne of the most glaring issues in Fallout 4 was its outdated graphics engine. Despite the game's release in 2015, it was running on the Creation Engine, a modified version of the engine used for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This choice resulted in graphics that felt dated, with texture quality, character models, and facial animations falling behind contemporary standards.\n\nFurthermore, Fallout 4 suffered from performance problems on both consoles and PC. Frame rate drops, stuttering, and game crashes were not uncommon, especially in areas with more complex geometry or crowded with NPCs. These performance issues hindered the immersion and overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe dialogue system in Fallout 4 also received heavy criticism. Unlike its predecessors, which offered nuanced and morally complex dialogue choices, Fallout 4 introduced a simplified system with four response options, often boiling down to \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"Sarcastic,\" or \"Tell me more.\" This stripped-down approach eliminated much of the role-playing depth and left players feeling like they had less control over their character's personality and choices.\n\nFallout 4's role-playing elements were notably shallow compared to previous titles in the series. The skill and attribute system was replaced with a simplified perk system, and the removal of the Karma system meant that player choices had fewer far-reaching consequences. The lack of a true karma system and a scarcity of significant moral choices left many players feeling that their decisions had less impact on the game world.\n\nWhile the main quest of Fallout 4 had its moments, many players found the story less engaging and thought-provoking compared to the intricate narratives of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The lack of branching story paths and the linear structure of the main questline further diminished the game's replayability.\n\nDespite its flaws, Fallout 4 became a prime example of the power of the modding community in rejuvenating a game. Modders from around the world took it upon themselves to address many of the game's shortcomings and enhance its overall experience. Let's explore some of the ways in which mods have transformed Fallout 4.\n\nOne of the first areas modders targeted was graphics. Several mod projects, such as \"Fallout 4 HD Reworked Project,\" \"NAC X,\" and \"Vivid Fallout,\" have drastically improved the game's visuals. These mods enhance texture quality, lighting, and weather effects, bringing the Commonwealth wasteland to life with a level of detail and immersion that the base game could not achieve.\n\nModders have also focused on character models and animations, creating mods like \"LooksMenu\" and \"Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer\" to overhaul character creation and customization. With these mods, players can create more detailed and realistic characters, adding depth to their role-playing experience.\n\nTo address the game's performance issues, modders developed several stability and optimization mods. These mods help alleviate frame rate drops and reduce stuttering, providing a smoother gaming experience. By addressing memory and resource management, modders have significantly improved Fallout 4's overall performance.\n\nFor those disappointed by the simplified dialogue system, mods such as \"Full Dialogue Interface\" reintroduce a more traditional dialogue wheel, providing players with a clearer understanding of their character's responses. Additionally, mods like \"Start Me Up - Alternate Start and Dialogue Overhaul\" enable a more diverse role-playing experience by allowing players to choose alternative origins and narratives, breaking free from the pre-established backstory of the Sole Survivor.\n\nWhile Fallout 4's main story may have left some players wanting more, modders have stepped in to fill the void with high-quality quest mods. Projects like \"Frost,\" \"Tales from the Commonwealth,\" and \"Project Valkyrie\" offer new storylines, unique characters, and intricate questlines that rival the quality of official Bethesda content. These mods expand the world of Fallout 4, introducing fresh adventures and exploration opportunities.\n\nMods have also made significant improvements to gameplay and mechanics. \"Sim Settlements\" revolutionizes settlement building by allowing settlers to construct their own homes and structures, bringing more life to the Commonwealth. Additionally, \"Arbitration\" and \"War of the Commonwealth\" ramp up the difficulty and intensity of combat, making the wasteland a more dangerous and thrilling place.\n\nThe modding community for Fallout 4 is remarkably active and collaborative, with modders often working together to create comprehensive experiences. Modding platforms like Nexus Mods provide a central hub for modders to share their creations and receive feedback. This sense of community support has enabled modders to push the boundaries of what Fallout 4 can offer.\n\nIn conclusion, Fallout 4, while a deeply flawed game upon release, has experienced a renaissance thanks to the dedication of the modding community. The tireless work of modders has transformed the game from a dated and frustrating experience into a dynamic, immersive, and highly replayable masterpiece. The power of Fallout 4's modding community serves as a testament to the resilience of the gaming community and the transformative potential of mods in modern gaming. The flaws of Fallout 4 became opportunities for passionate modders to reinvigorate a game that, in many ways, surpasses its predecessors. With the help of mods, Fallout 4 stands as a shining example of how player-driven creativity and dedication can turn a flawed gem into a masterpiece that continues to capture the imaginations of players worldwide.", "timestamp_created": 1697707913, "timestamp_updated": 1697707913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148472944": {"recommendationid": "148472944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805228722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 5887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5887, "last_played": 1691406206}, "language": "english", "review": "Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5)\n\nFallout 4, the latest installment in Bethesda's beloved post-apocalyptic RPG series, has kept me immersed in its wasteland for a substantial 98 hours. My journey in the Commonwealth, with and without mods, has been a mix of captivating storytelling, exploration, and modifiable gameplay, but not without its quirks.\n\nOne of the standout features of Fallout 4 is its compelling and emotionally charged narrative. As the Sole Survivor searching for your lost son in the aftermath of a nuclear apocalypse, the game is filled with emotional weight. Your journey through the wasteland, interacting with various factions and colorful characters, makes for an engaging storytelling experience.\n\nThe Commonwealth, Fallout 4's rendition of post-apocalyptic Massachusetts, offers a grim and atmospheric open world. Ruined cityscapes, irradiated swamps, and underground hideouts create a setting rich in detail and history. The addition of dynamic weather and a day-night cycle adds to the immersion.\n\nThe crafting and settlement-building system is a substantial addition, allowing players to modify and build structures, weapons, and armor. This feature can be immensely satisfying, as you tailor your surroundings and gear to your playstyle, and it significantly extends gameplay hours. However, it can be a bit daunting for those looking for a more straightforward experience.\n\nCombat in Fallout 4 has improved over its predecessors. The V.A.T.S. system, which lets you target specific body parts and slow down time during combat, is engaging and strategic. Gunplay feels more polished, and the addition of melee combat options provides variety. However, combat can sometimes be hampered by the game's occasionally glitchy mechanics, especially with mods.\n\nI've played Fallout 4 both with and without mods, and the modding community for the game is extensive. Mods can enhance graphics, introduce new quests, and alter gameplay mechanics, offering a high level of customization. The modding community's dedication to the game is commendable, as it keeps the experience fresh and adds replay value.\n\nOn the downside, Fallout 4 has its share of technical hiccups. Bugs and performance issues, especially when heavily modded, can occasionally hinder the experience. While Bethesda has made efforts to address some of these issues with patches, they can still be frustrating.\n\nIn conclusion, Fallout 4 is a solid entry in the Fallout series, offering a rich narrative, an expansive open world, and extensive modding potential. Playing for 98 hours, I've appreciated the game's storytelling and crafting systems, though the technical issues and occasionally unpolished mechanics do detract from the overall experience. Whether you're a seasoned wasteland survivor or a newcomer to the series, Fallout 4 offers a compelling post-apocalyptic adventure with the added bonus of endless modding possibilities.", "timestamp_created": 1697695413, "timestamp_updated": 1697695413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148471587": {"recommendationid": "148471587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322266519", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5239, "last_played": 1698462767}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Pues muchos dicen q ya no parece fallout pero es disfrutable pero si no tiene una extensa opciones de dialogo y eso pero para mi es pues aceptable el juego y me gusta", "timestamp_created": 1697692157, "timestamp_updated": 1697692157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148470732": {"recommendationid": "148470732", "author": {"steamid": "76561199562595220", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 868, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1700764494}, "language": "english", "review": "this is my fVORTIE", "timestamp_created": 1697690248, "timestamp_updated": 1697690248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148468100": {"recommendationid": "148468100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198980960037", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7322, "last_played": 1697693395}, "language": "spanish", "review": "piola mala historia, peor q el new vegas parejo con el 3", "timestamp_created": 1697684750, "timestamp_updated": 1697684750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148466907": {"recommendationid": "148466907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799761341", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 45208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1045, "playtime_at_review": 44163, "last_played": 1700460037}, "language": "english", "review": "mid", "timestamp_created": 1697682335, "timestamp_updated": 1697682335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148462192": {"recommendationid": "148462192", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973280461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 23014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23014, "last_played": 1646438932}, "language": "english", "review": "War.
